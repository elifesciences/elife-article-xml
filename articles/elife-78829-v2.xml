and the smooth chorion (SC) which surrounds more than 70% of the developing fetus but whose cellular composition and function is poorly understood. Here, we use single cell RNA-sequencing to compare the cell types and molecular programs between these two regions in the second trimester human placenta. Each region consists of progenitor cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) and extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) with similar gene expression programs. While CTBs in the villous chorion differentiate into syncytiotrophoblasts, they take an alternative trajectory in the SC producing a previously unknown CTB population which we term SC-specific CTBs (SC-CTBs). Marked by expression of region-specific cytokeratins, the SC-CTBs form a stratified epithelium above a basal layer of progenitor CTBs. They express epidermal and metabolic transcriptional programs consistent with a primary role in defense against physical stress and pathogens. Additionally, we show that SC-CTBs closely associate with EVTs and secrete factors that inhibit the migration of the EVTs. This restriction of EVT migration is in striking contrast to the villous region where EVTs migrate away from the chorion and invade deeply into the decidua. Together, these findings greatly expand our understanding of CTB differentiation in these distinct regions of the human placenta. This knowledge has broad implications for studies of the development, functions, and diseases of the human placenta.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>placenta</kwd><kwd>human development</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 HD055764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marsh</surname><given-names>Bryan</given-names></name><name><surname>Blelloch</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 HD076253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name><name><surname>Kapidzic</surname><given-names>Mirhan</given-names></name><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single cell RNA-sequencing of distinct regions of the human placenta identifies a smooth chorion-specific cytotrophoblast population responsible for unique functions of the smooth chorion, including acting as a barrier and restricting invasion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human placenta is the first organ to develop and forms the essential bridge between maternal and fetal tissues beginning at implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knöfler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Turco et al., 2018</xref>). The placenta must begin development rapidly upon conception in order to perform the roles of future organ systems that have not yet developed and matured in the fetus, including nutrient and oxygen transport and protection from mechanical and pathogenic insults. The placenta also performs unique functions such as modulation of maternal tolerance and hormone production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maltepe and Fisher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knöfler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Turco et al., 2018</xref>). Placental development begins with the generation of stem villi surrounding the entire embryo and then proceeds asymmetrically to produce two distinct regions. At the human implantation site, the embryonic pole, the villi grow and branch to give rise to the region essential for the exchange of gases and nutrients, the chorion frondosum (also known as the chorionic villi or the villous chorion [VC]). This region includes the placental villi and the invasive EVTs. The villi located on the opposite side, the abembryonic pole, degenerate resulting in a smooth surface lacking villi termed the chorion leave (also known as the smooth chorion [SC]). The SC fuses with the amnion forming the chorioamniotic membranes (also known as the fetal membranes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamilton and Boyd, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyd and Hamilton, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benirschke et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Both the VC and SC are comprised of fetal derived cytotrophoblasts (CTBs), with CTBs in the VC differentiating to either multinucleate syncytiotrophoblast (STB) or to invasive extravillous trophoblast (EVT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knöfler et al., 2019</xref>). Compared to the VC, little effort has been made to analyze types and functions of the CTBs that comprise the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benirschke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garrido-Gomez et al., 2017</xref>). The CTBs of the SC exist in an epithelial-like structure and lack STBs and proximity to the fetal vasculature, and thus cannot function in a manner comparable to villi in VC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benirschke et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast to the VC where EVTs invade and remodel the maternal arteries, the cells of the SC do not invade the adjacent decidua and the maternal blood vessels it contains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Genbačev et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the function of these SC CTBs remains unclear.</p><p>Several pieces of evidence suggest that the SC is not simply a vestigial structure. First, the intact CTB layer contains proliferating cells and is maintained until term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yeh et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benirschke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garrido-Gomez et al., 2017</xref>). Second, the histological heterogeneity among SC CTBs suggests functional distinctions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yeh et al., 1989</xref>, characterize two distinct populations of vacuolated and eosinophilic CTBs. Vacuolated CTBs were positive for placental lactogen and placental alkaline phosphatase, while the eosinophilic subpopulations was not. Both populations were rich in keratin and neither had the known characteristics of villous CTBs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bou-Resli et al., 1981</xref> also note high levels of variation among CTBs in the SC and the existence of a vacuolated population. A more molecular characterization was carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garrido-Gomez et al., 2017</xref>, which demonstrated heterogeneity of ITGA4 and HLA-G expression, markers previously associated with stemness and invasion, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genbacev et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McMaster et al., 1995</xref>). This study also uncovered an expansion of the SC in cases of severe pre-eclampsia, along with a disease-specific gene expression pattern. In sum, these results suggest that the SC CTBs are a heterogeneous and dynamic collection of cells with important functions in development and disease.</p><p>Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as the standard for transcriptional characterization of complex organs. This methodology was previously applied to the placenta, but with a focus on the maternal-fetal interface, specifically the chorionic villi and basal plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suryawanshi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vento-Tormo et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, scRNA-seq was used to profile the smooch chorion at term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pique-Regi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pique-Regi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia-Flores et al., 2022</xref>). However, in Pique-Regi et al., 2019, only 132 CTBs were identified in the SC out of 29,921 cells (0.44%) collected from this region. A comparable number of CTBs in the SC were recovered in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia-Flores et al., 2022</xref>, potentially reflecting a difficulty in capturing these cells at term. To better understand the differences in the cell types and functions of the two sides of the developing placenta, we applied scRNA-seq to matching samples of cells isolated from the VC and SC regions of human samples from mid to late in the second trimester. We used scRNA-seq to compare the composition and developmental trajectories of CTBs in the VC and SC. The data were validated and extended with functional studies to gain initial insights into the basis of differential migration of trophoblasts in each region. These results identified a novel SC-specific CTB population important for establishment of a protective barrier and the suppression of trophoblast invasion. In addition, these data represent a resource of CTB types, proportions, and gene expression at mid-gestation against which age-related and pathogenic alterations can be measured.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The transcriptional landscape of the VC and SC at mid-gestation</title><p>To understand the cellular composition of the SC, we isolated and profiled cells from both the VC and the SC regions of four second trimester human placentas spanning gestational weeks 18–24 (GW18–24) using scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We chose to analyze second trimester samples because the maturation of the SC is complete but the inflammation and apoptosis associated with membrane rupture and parturition is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benirschke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yuan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yuan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). SC and VC cells were isolated from each human placental sample allowing within and across patient comparisons. VC samples included cells isolated from floating and anchoring villi and areas surrounding the cell column, while most of the decidua (including spiral arteries) were dissected away. SC samples included the chorion and underlying stroma (mesenchymal and endothelial cells), but not the amnion and little of the neighboring decidua, which were also removed during dissection. CTBs were further enriched over stromal and immune cells during cell preparation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garrido-Gomez et al., 2017</xref> and in Materials and methods). The transcriptomes of the resulting cells were captured using the 10× Genomics scRNA-seq platform.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The transcriptional landscape of the villous (VC) and smooth chorion (SC) at mid-gestation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Left: Schematic of the placenta at mid-gestation, highlighting the regions sampled, together with the methods used for cell isolation and characterization.

Overall, CTB 2–4 were more transcriptionally similar to each other than to CTB 1, indicating a transcriptional program that was distinct from canonical villous CTBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref> and c). CTB 2–4 existed along a gradient of gene expression changes suggestive of various stages of a common differentiation pathway. However, each population expressed distinct transcripts corresponding to important proposed functions of the SC. CTB 2 cells highly expressed <italic>CLU</italic>, <italic>CFD</italic>, and <italic>IFIT3</italic>, suggesting roles in responding to bacterial or viral infection through the innate arm of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thurman and Holers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2011</xref>).

Finally, CTB 4 specifically expressed several cytokeratins — <italic>KRT6A</italic>, <italic>KRT17</italic>, and <italic>KRT14</italic>, found in many epithelial barrier tissues and important for maintenance of integrity in response to mechanical stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karantza, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Previous analysis of the SC region at term using scRNA-seq identified fewer than 0.5% of trophoblasts as being CTB and did not identify a separate KRT6 expressing CTB population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pique-Regi et al., 2019</xref>). Computational integration of the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pique-Regi et al., 2019</xref>, with the trophoblast subset confirmed CTB 3 and CTB 4 to be unique to this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f and g</xref> ). These results establish a previously underappreciated transcriptional diversity of CTB subpopulations.</p><p>Quantification of cells showed a strong regional bias in the number and proportion contributing to each CTB cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). In the VC samples, 53.8% of CTBs clustered in CTB 1 compared to 11.1% in the SC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In contrast, the SC had a much larger proportion of the CTB 2–4 clusters. In this region, 71.3% of CTBs were nearly equally distributed among CTB 2 (25.6%), CTB 3 (24.9%), and CTB 4 (20.8%). In the VC, only 24.1% of CTBs were found in the same clusters, with the majority in CTB 2 (16.1%). The contribution to cycling clusters was consistent across regions: 22.1% and 17.5% of CTBs in the VC and SC, respectively. The relative proportions of CTB 1–4 in the VC and SC were consistent across individual samples indicating that this difference was not driven by sample variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b-c</xref>). Furthermore, independent clustering analysis of VC and SC cells identified the same populations as the integrated trophoblast subset. Importantly, independent clustering of each region did not identify CTB 4 in the VC or STB in the SC, suggesting CTB 4 and STB to be specific to the SC and VC, respectively. The small number of cells in the integrated dataset identified as VC CTB 4 (173 cells) or SC STB (14 cells) may be in part an artifact of computational integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a-f</xref>).</p><p>Next, we immunolocalized the protein products of genes that distinguished the subpopulations. At the mRNA level, <italic>PAGE4</italic> expression was highest in CTB 1 and decreased across CTB 2–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and e</xref>). In the VC, the CTB monolayer between the fetal stromal villous core and the overlying STB layer showed strong PAGE4 immunoreactivity, which diminished upon differentiation to EVT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> - left). PAGE4 mRNA and protein expression matched that of known villous CTB marker CDH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Genbacev et al., 1997</xref>). In the SC, the PAGE4 signal was strong in the epithelial layer directly adjacent to the fetal stroma and then decreased in cells distant from the basal layer, again matching CDH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> – right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4b</xref> – right). Both RNA expression and protein localization were consistent with CTB 1 cells existing in both chorionic regions and occupying a similar niche.</p><p>Staining for KRT6, a marker highly enriched in CTB 4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>) showed a strikingly different result. Cells occupying the upper layers of SC epithelium showed a strong KRT6 signal, a pattern opposite to CDH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h and i</xref> – right). KRT6 was absent from either the floating or anchoring villi of the VC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h and i</xref> – left), although rare decidual resident KRT6 positive cells were identified in the VC region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> – top).

In accordance with previous results, RNA velocity projections identified CTB 1 as the root for three differentiation trajectories: self-renewal, differentiation to STBs, and differentiation to EVTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

However, CTB 1 cells showed strong directionality and magnitude toward CTB 2–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). All cells in CTB 1–4 clusters displayed uniform directionality indicating a robust differentiation trajectory ending at CTB 4. High levels of transcriptional similarity between CTB 2 and 4 compared to CTB 1 suggested CTB 2 and CTB 3 are intermediate states between CTB 1 and CTB 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Mitotic KRT6+ cells were identified, and while the interaction between the cell cycle and differentiation of SC-CTBs remains unclear, these data show that differentiation to SC-CTB does not require cell cycle exit, unlike STBs and EVTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In contrast to the VC, we observed no velocity vectors with directionality toward the STB lineage from the CTB clusters in the SC samples. Further, the smaller number of STB precursors (460 cells) and STBs (14 cells) exhibited reduced expression of STB canonical markers such as ERVFRD-1 and GCM1, and notably, a near absence of ERVW-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). These cells may be associated with ghost villi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benirschke et al., 2006</xref>). In sum, these data show differential developmental trajectories for the CTB 1 cells in the SC and VC, with the former largely giving rise to SC-CTBs and the latter to STBs.</p><p>To identify the genes that were correlated with progression from CTB 1–4 in the SC, we used the velocity vector predictions to construct a pseudotemporal model of differentiation. All the cells in these clusters were plotted in one dimension from the least to the most differentiated according the pseudotime model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Genes that were highly expressed at the start of the pseudotemporal differentiation included pan-trophoblast factors such as <italic>EGFR</italic>, which was expressed throughout all four CTB populations in both the VC and SC. Progression along the pseudotime trajectory identified regulators of cell fate and function, including the transcription factor <italic>KLF4</italic> and extracellular matrix (ECM) components <italic>COL5A1</italic> and <italic>LAMA3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–d</xref>); all demonstrated SC-specific expression. Elevated expression of ECM transcripts (<italic>COL4A2</italic>, <italic>FN1</italic>) and transcription factors responsive to cell contact and mechanical stress (<italic>HES1</italic>, <italic>YAP1</italic>) were coordinately upregulated, potentially highlighting the effects of the extracellular environment on fate specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). To identify differential signaling events that might regulate alternative paths of differentiation in the VC and SC, we used CellPhoneDB to predict receptor-ligand interactions between CTB clusters within each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a-b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Efremova et al., 2020</xref>).

Together, these data demonstrated that SC-CTBs originate from CTB 1 progenitors common to both the VC and SC. In the SC, instead of upregulating syncytialization factors such as <italic>GCM1</italic> and <italic>ERVFRD-1</italic>, CTB 1 progenitors upregulate transcription factors such as <italic>KLF4</italic>, <italic>YAP1</italic>, and <italic>HES1</italic>, which drive an epithelial cell fate in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Segre et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rock et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SC-CTBs express a distinct epidermal transcriptional program</title><p>Next, we sought a better understanding of the physiological functions of the SC trophoblast clusters. We performed gene ontology analysis as a summary of functional processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). We focused on the progenitor CTB 1 and terminally differentiated SC-CTBs as they showed enrichment for strikingly different functional categories. In CTB 1, we identified enrichment for WNT signaling, epithelial morphogenesis, and membrane transport, categories commonly associated with progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We validated the activity of WNT signaling and the location of these cells by immunolocalization of non-phosphorylated CTNNB1 (np-CTNNB1). Staining was localized to the most basal epithelial layer nearest to the stroma in both the VC and SC regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), matching expression of the CTB 1 marker CDH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>). WNT signaling has an important role in the maintenance of villous CTBs in vivo and in the derivation and culture of self-renewing human trophoblast stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knöfler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haider et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okae et al., 2018</xref>). We investigated proliferation of np-CTNNB1 expressing cells in both regions using KI67 as a mitotic marker. This revealed a similar percentage of KI67+ CTB 1 cells, suggesting similar proliferative capacity across regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>). We next analyzed regional differences within CTB 1. Gene ontology identified an enrichment for oxidative phosphorylation and epithelial signaling cues in VC CTB 1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>). This is in direct contrast to SC CTB 1 cells that displayed elevated levels of hypoxia response genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b-c</xref>). KLF4 was identified in the RNA velocity analysis as gaining expression from CTB 1–4, but also showed greater expression in CTB 1 in the SC compared to the VC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). In accordance with the mRNA expression data, KLF4 protein often co-localized to CTB 1 in the SC, but was only observed in rare cells in the VC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). These data further support a similar location and function for CTB 1 in the SC and VC, with transcriptional and metabolic differences that presage distinct developmental trajectories.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Smooth chorion-specific cytotrophoblasts (SC-CTBs) express a distinct epidermal transcriptional program.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Heatmap of gene ontology analysis adjusted p-values.

The greatest enrichment was for cell junction and cell substrate adhesion genes that included numerous integrin and laminin subunits as well as junctional proteins <italic>PATJ</italic>, <italic>DSP</italic>, and <italic>JUP</italic>. An enrichment for both skin and epidermal development correlated with upregulation of the ECM and junctional transcripts. These categories included many cytokeratins (<italic>KRT6A, 7, 8, 14, 17, 18,</italic> and <italic>19</italic>) and transcription factors (<italic>KLF4</italic>, <italic>YAP1</italic>) required for epidermal identity and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Segre et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schlegelmilch et al., 2011</xref>). The organization of the SC is reminiscent of stratified epidermal cells of the skin, with progenitors adherent to the basal lamina and more differentiated cells progeny forming the upper layers. In many tissues, the specific domains of cytokeratin expression correspond to stratified cell layers with different functions. We asked if this was also the case in the SC epithelium. Cytokeratins 7, 8, and 18 were expressed in all trophoblast regardless of region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3a</xref>), but cytokeratin 6A, 14, and 17 displayed SC-specific expression that increased with differentiation toward CTB 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3b</xref>). Immunofluorescence localization confirmed expression of KRT14 as specific to the CTBs in the SC and inclusive of all KRT6 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). These data support a model of accumulated cytokeratin expression that begins with CTB 1 (<italic>KRT7, KRT8, KRT18</italic>), increases in CTB 2–3 (<italic>KRT14, KRT17</italic>), and culminates in CTB 4 (<italic>KRT6A</italic>). Together these data are consistent with a central role for the CTBs of the SC in establishing a protective epithelial barrier for the rapidly growing fetus.</p><p>Beyond forming a physical barrier, important chorionic functions include protection from bacterial and viral infections. We identified an enrichment for genes involved in antiviral response in SC-CTBs, and in SC cells more broadly. For example, IFITM3, a restriction factor preventing entry of viruses into cells, is highly expressed in CTBs from the SC compared to the VC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spence et al., 2019</xref>). IFITM proteins have also been reported to inhibit syncytialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buchrieser et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting IFITM3 may also function to block differentiation of CTBs into STBs in the SC. Taken together, these data establish SC-CTBs as the building blocks and critical regulators of the SC barrier, responsible for both protection against physical forces and pathogen infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>EVTs of the VC and SC regions display distinct invasive activity but are transcriptionally similar</title><p>EVTs are the invasive trophoblasts of the placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knöfler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Turco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Red-Horse et al., 2004</xref>).

The columnar subpopulation is believed to represent newly differentiated EVTs, which lie at the base of the columns that connect the anchoring villi to the uterine wall. Interstitial EVTs migrate through the decidua homing to maternal arteries, which they invade. The relationship between this subpopulation and endovascular EVTs that replace the maternal arterial endothelium is unclear, with evidence supporting endovascular EVTs arising either from interstitial EVTs and/or an independent origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Red-Horse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pijnenborg et al., 2011</xref>).

In contrast, EVT 2–4 showed enrichment for extracellular structure and matrix organization, glycosylation, and peptidase activity. EVT clusters 3–4 specifically showed increased expression for transcripts of proteases such as <italic>HTRA1</italic>, <italic>MMP2</italic>, and <italic>MMP11</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Based on the GO and specific gene enrichments, EVT 1 appeared most similar to columnar EVTs, while EVT 2–4 were consistent with interstitial EVTs that gain invasive capacity. The relative enrichment for EVT 1 in the SC (VC – 10.57% of EVT; SC – 25.05% of EVT) suggested an expansion in columnar-like EVTs at the expense of interstitial EVT. Conversely, the relative enrichment for EVT 2–4 in the VC region suggested an expansion of the invasive subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).</p><p>As almost 75% of EVTs from the SC region were in EVT clusters 2–4, we next asked if there were differences in gene expression between interstitial EVTs isolated from each region. This analysis identified relatively few differentially expressed genes, with the vast majority identified having a log fold change less than 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1 fig5sdata2 fig5sdata3 fig5sdata4">Figure 5—source data 1–4</xref>). The small number of differentially expressed genes with a fold change greater than 1 was typically identified across multiple EVT clusters, suggesting an overriding transcriptional program that might supersede subcluster designations. To identify genes associated with this program, we combined all EVT subclusters into one cluster for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Differential expression analysis revealed the hormone CSH1 and several proteases including HTRA1, HTRA4, and PAPPA to be expressed at significantly higher levels in the more invasive VC EVTs. However, of the most differentially expressed transcripts, only CSH1, ITM2C, and DNASE1L3 were exclusive to the VC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Immunolocalization of CSH1 confirmed this result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). CSH1, also known as human prolactin, is a secreted hormone that signals through the receptor PRLR found on maternal cells. As such, the primary effect of CSH1 is likely non-cell autonomous, raising the possibility that the largest differences in EVTs between regions may not be in inherent invasive capacity, but rather their ability to communicate with the neighboring cells. Therefore, we asked whether differential EVT-stroma signaling interactions exist between the VC and the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Efremova et al., 2020</xref>). While this analysis underrepresents the contribution of the stroma due to its depletion by the trophoblast enrichment protocol, we identified enrichment for collagen-integrin interactions between EVT and stromal cells in the VC, which were not present in the SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3a</xref>). In contrast, SC-specific EVT-stromal interactions included PDGFA and FN1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3b</xref>). As we see few transcriptional changes in EVTs between regions, our data support a model by which differential signaling may create a stromal environment more amenable to EVT invasion.</p><p>We next asked whether the gene expression differences between the VC and SC were smaller for EVT clusters than for all other trophoblast clusters. Calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient across each cluster, EVT 3, EVT 4, and CTB 1 (which we have established as common to both regions) were most similar and the only clusters with a coefficient greater than 0.75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Since this analysis does not account for cluster heterogeneity or size, we quantified the number of differentially expressed genes between 100 randomly selected cells from each region within each cluster. Across 100 permutations, the number of differentially expressed genes between regions was the lowest for all four EVT clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Together, these results showed that the EVTs of the VC and SC are surprisingly similar even though they have distinct levels of invasion in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>CTBs of the SC inhibit EVT invasion</title><p>Given the transcriptional similarity between EVT clusters originating from the VC and SC, we wondered if a non-cell autonomous program could explain their distinct migratory properties.

Contacts between CTB 1 and EVTs in the SC were not observed and the VC contain only rare and irregular KRT6+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Briefly, these cells were enriched using the same protocol as described for the scRNA-seq experiments. The cells were plated on Matrigel-coated transwell filters and cultured for 39 hr. Trophoblast projections that reached the underside of the filter, a proxy for invasion, were visualized by immunostaining with a pan-cytokeratin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with the differences observed in vivo, there was greater invasion of VC as compared to SC trophoblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Next, we asked whether CTBs from the SC region secreted soluble factors that inhibited invasion. The invasion assays were repeated with VC cells cultured with conditioned medium from SC cells and vice versa. While VC conditioned medium had no impact on either VC or SC cells, SC conditioned medium significantly reduced invasion of VC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Neither conditioned medium impacted the density of VC or SC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, a secreted factor from SC cells inhibited the invasion of VC EVTs. Given that SC-CTBs were the only cell type unique to the SC side, it is highly likely that they produced the secreted factors that inhibit the invasion of EVTs to which they are juxtaposed. To identify which factors might be responsible for the repression of cellular invasion, we subset the predicted signaling interactions between CTB-EVT isolated from the SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). We then subset this analysis for only those containing secreted factors, which identified numerous interactions between CTB 4 and EVTs including both canonical cell signaling pathways (TNFa, PGF, TGFB1, FGF1, and PDGFB) and modifiers of the ECM (FN1 and THBS1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). These data support a paracrine signaling mechanism by which CTB 4 cells restrict EVT invasion in the SC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study profiled the developing second trimester placenta, providing a high-resolution molecular description of the trophoblast in the SC and placing them in context of the trophoblast from the VC of the same placenta. In doing so, we addressed long-standing observations concerning apparent similarities and differences between VC and SC trophoblast, deconstruct the trophoblast populations in the SC, and ascribe functions to the cells of this understudied region. Our study characterized a novel trophoblast population distinct from both extant CTB in the VC and from EVT found in either region. These trophoblasts reside only in stratified epithelium of the SC, express a specific cytokeratin (KRT6), and comprise at least 25% of all trophoblast in the region. Lineage reconstruction by RNA velocity suggested that the progenitors for these SC-specific CTBs are a resident proliferative progenitor trophoblast with a transcriptional profile that matches villous CTB. We identified several potential regulators of the transition from a common villous CTB-like cell to SC-CTB, including epidermal transcription factors such as KLF4 and YAP1. These molecules along with region-specific signaling events drive an epidermal transcriptional program creating the building blocks for a barrier against both physical and pathogen stressors. Finally, we identified CTB-EVT interactions occurring only in the SC and provide evidence that paracrine signaling between these populations restricts trophoblast invasion.</p><p>Since the SC is created by a degenerative process, consensus has been that these cells are remnants of this process, making the SC a vestigial structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benirschke et al., 2006</xref>). However, several previous observations suggested this might be an oversimplification. First, these cells were noted to be proliferative, suggesting either cellular expansion or turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benirschke et al., 2006</xref>). We confirmed the presence of proliferative trophoblasts in the SC. Each cycling CTB cluster expressed markers of CTB 1–4 in both regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>) and both CTB 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–c</xref>) and SC-CTBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>) also expressed KI67 protein. Proliferation of both the progenitor and differentiated cells suggested a need for expansion coordinated with the growth of the developing fetus. Second, the importance of the SC was suggested by the noted heterogeneity of the trophoblasts within this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yeh et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bou-Resli et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garrido-Gomez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benirschke et al., 2006</xref>). In agreement, our scRNA-seq results showed the SC to be a complex tissue with several trophoblast types. We identified, by differential transcription and function, at least two distinct CTB cell types, columnar and interstitial EVT, and a small number of STB Precursors. As discussed, all CTB and EVT populations either matched those found in the VC or had new region-specific functions. The only evidence of degeneration was the STB Precursor population within the SC, which lacked expression of both <italic>ERVW-1</italic> and <italic>ERVFRD-1</italic>, the fusogens necessary to form STB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blaise et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). In sum, these studies suggested that the SC is a complex and functional tissue, not simply the remnant of villous degeneration.</p><p>We focused on CTB 4, a novel population found exclusively in the SC, in the context of the unique functions of this region. CTB 4 were enriched for epidermal, skin development, and antiviral gene categories suggesting concerted roles in the creation of a barrier against external forces and pathogens. Previous studies have noted that CTBs residing in the SC have high levels of keratin expression and are associated with extensive ECM deposits rich in laminin, collagen, and fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yeh et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bou-Resli et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benirschke et al., 2006</xref>). Among all SC CTB populations, but most notably in CTB 4, we identified the upregulation of ECM components, including <italic>LAMA3</italic>, <italic>COL5A1,</italic> and <italic>FN1</italic>. Expression of ECM molecules in the SC is essential to protect against premature rupture of the fetal membranes, but its deposition has previously been ascribed to the stromal cells of the chorion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parry and Strauss, 1998</xref>). Our results suggest that the trophoblasts of the SC create a specific ECM environment distinct from that of the VC. This altered composition likely has wide-ranging effects on trophoblast fate, gene expression, and activity. It will be interesting to explore the impact of advancing gestational age on the SC epithelium, especially with respect to the ECM. Presumably, cellular and structural changes precede the normal process of membrane rupture prior to delivery at term. Whether premature rupture of the membranes phenocopies these events or is a unique process is an important open question.</p><p>Pathogen defense is another important function of the placenta. Infections of the chorion and amnion (chorioamnionitis) often result in adverse outcomes for mother and fetus, primarily preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romero et al., 2014</xref>). We identified specific expression of the antiviral gene IFITM3 in CTB 4. IFITM3 expression is particularly interesting due to the recent finding that it blocks STB fusion mediated by the endogenous retroviral elements, ERVW-1 and ERVFRD-1. Therefore, IFITM3 expression in SC-CTBs may have a dual role – restricting viral entry into the cell and blocking the formation of STBs in the SC. Its expression also provides a mechanism by which the lack of STBs in the SC is maintained after degradation of the villi is complete.</p><p>A distinct feature of the CTBs of the SC was remodeling of the cytokeratin network coordinated with differentiation from CTB 1 to SC-CTBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3b</xref>). The progressive expression of KRT14, KRT17, and KRT6A is reminiscent of the cytokeratin code found in the epithelial cell layers of many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karantza, 2011</xref>). KRT14 is recognized as a marker of all stratified epithelium including subsets of basal progenitor and stem cells in several tissues, usually alongside KRT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moll et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nelson and Sun, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rock et al., 2009</xref>). While we did not identify expression of KRT5 in any trophoblast, the KRT14 expressing proliferative cells of the SC fit the profile of stratified epithelia in other locations. The roles of KRT17 and KRT6 are less clear. Most knowledge about the function of these molecules comes from the epidermis in the context of injury and disease. KRT6 and KRT17 are upregulated rapidly upon epidermal injury and are expressed through the repair phase, each contributing specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takahashi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGowan and Coulombe, 1998</xref>). KRT17 promotes proliferation and increases in cell size through Akt/mTOR and STAT3, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). KRT6 is a negative regulator of cell migration through the inhibition of Src kinase and associations with myosin IIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wong and Coulombe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rotty and Coulombe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, this molecule promotes expression of Desmoplakin and the maintenance of desmosomes, the latter, a long-established feature of SC trophoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bou-Resli et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartels and Wang, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benirschke et al., 2006</xref>). Taken together, these observations are consistent with data on SC-CTBs. We found no evidence of their invasion, but did identify frequent interactions with the ECM, CTBs, and EVTs. The coordinated expression of these cytokeratins and the transcriptional profile writ large suggested that the SC has the properties of a highly specialized epidermis with a robust proliferative capacity and strong cohesive properties, but lacking migratory or invasive behavior.</p><p>As previous work has demonstrated or assumed, the majority of trophoblast identified are represented in both the VC and SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benirschke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garrido-Gomez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pique-Regi et al., 2019</xref>). We identified two cell types with striking transcriptional similarity between regions, CTB 1 and EVT. CTB 1 cells in the VC matched canonical villous CTB in transcriptional profile, activity, and niche. We identified a similar population in the SC. They are localized to an epithelial sheet juxtaposed to the fetal stroma, separated by a thin basal lamina. These cells are supported by similar signaling pathways in both regions, including HGF and WNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7g</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dokras et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okae et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2002</xref>). The similarities in location and growth factor requirements demonstrate that a niche similar to the villous trophoblast membrane exists in the SC. Additionally, we identified CTB 1 as the progenitor population for SC-CTB, and possibly for EVT in the SC. Thus, CTB 1 in both regions functions as multipotent progenitors. Despite the many similarities, the developmental trajectories emerging from CTB 1 differ in a region-specific manner. At present, it is unclear whether CTB 1 cells in both regions originally have the same potential or if fate restriction occurs as the fetal membranes form. Future experiments will need to functionally address whether CTB 1 from the VC can be coerced to generate SC-CTBs and if CTB 1 from the SC can efficiently generate STBs and invasive EVTs. Multipotent trophoblasts have been generated from first trimester SC cells, however, these cells have a distinct transcriptional profile from the second trimester cells we characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genbacev et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Similarities between the EVT of each region, as defined by contact with the decidua, has been documented in observational, molecular, and most recently, transcriptomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benirschke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pique-Regi et al., 2019</xref>). Our data confirmed a strong correlation between gene expression for all EVT populations, regardless of regional identity. Based on previously established EVT subtypes, we identified a reduction in the proportion of interstitial EVTs and a concomitant increase in columnar-like EVTs of the SC. However, we did not find evidence of specific EVT subpopulations or intrinsic gene expression programs that would explain the differences in the depth of invasion of EVT in each region. However, we did uncover CTB-EVT interactions specific to the SC epithelium. Rather than physically separating as they do in the VC, CTBs and EVTs co-occupy the stratified epithelium of the SC, providing a contained environment for paracrine signaling, cell contact-mediated signaling, and cell-ECM interactions that may impact trophoblast invasion. In this study we show that soluble signaling factors from SC cells restrict the invasion of their counterparts from the VC. We can speculate on potential candidates that may function across multiple biological systems to restrict invasion. CTB 4 cells express high levels of TIMP1, TIMP3, and SERPINE1 (PAI-1), which inhibit the function and/or activation of MMPs necessary for trophoblast invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fisher et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). Addition of recombinant TIMPs or a function blocking antibody against plasminogen (whose processing is inhibited by SERPINE1) reduced trophoblast invasion in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lala and Graham, 1990</xref>). While these molecules are expressed by decidual cells, we identified their expression within the SC epithelium directly adjacent to EVTs. Another candidate regulator of invasion expressed by CTB 4 is TNFα. Treatment of trophoblasts with TNFα increases EVT apoptosis, decreases protease expression, increases SERPINE1 expression, and decreases invasion in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). These data suggest that SC-CTBs secrete multiple molecules that could decrease the survival and invasion of EVTs in the SC. In this study we explored the role of secreted factors, but SC-CTBs may also influence EVTs through cell contact-mediated signaling and the deposition of an ECM distinct from the basal plate. Future experiments will be necessary to explore the contributions of these distinct signaling pathways and matrices.</p><p>In summary, this study provides a high-resolution molecular accounting of the trophoblast that occupy SC. By comparison with trophoblasts isolated from the VC of the same placentas, we identified key similarities and differences to better understand the molecular determinants of trophoblast function and activity in the SC. We characterized a novel CTB population, marked by KRT6A expression, that is central to three key functions of the SC: formation of an epidermal-like barrier, blockage of aberrant STB differentiation, and restriction of EVT invasion. These data provide a better understanding of molecular and cellular pathways that control human placental development and against which disease-related changes can be identified and therapeutic targets discovered.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Institutional Review Board approved this study (11-05530). All donors gave informed consent. All samples are from elective terminations between gestational age of 17 weeks and 6 days and 24 weeks and 0 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cellular isolation of VC trophoblast</title><p>Trophoblast were isolated from both floating and anchoring villi dissected from second trimester human placentas. Trophoblast were isolated according to previously published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fisher et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kliman and Feinberg, 1990</xref>). Briefly, cuts were made at the base of each cotyledon near the chorionic plate and the entire villous tree up to and including the basal plate was taken for study. The decidua was removed from the basal plate side and the remaining villous tree was dissected and dissociated. The resulting floating and anchoring chorionic villi were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> free), dissected into 2–4 mm pieces, and filtered through a 1 mm mesh strainer to remove small pieces of tissue. CTBs were isolated from the tissue pieces by first removing the outer STB layer by collagenase digestion (Sigma-Aldrich; C-2674). Next, CTBs were dissociated by sequential enzymatic digestion (trypsin [Sigma-Aldrich; T8003; twice] and collagenase). Finally, CTBs were purified by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Single cells were visually inspected for quality, counted using a hemacytometer, and immediately collected for scRNA-seq or for culture experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cellular isolation of SC trophoblast</title><p>Trophoblast were isolated according to previously published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garrido-Gomez et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, the fetal membranes were washed with PBS (Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> free) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (10,000 units/ml penicillin; 10,000 μg/ml streptomycin), 0.003% fungizone (stock solution of 250 mg/ml), and 1% gentamicin. Next, the amnion and SC were manually separated and the amnion discarded. Next, the decidua parietalis was removed and discarded. The SC CTB layer was then minced into small pieces (2–4 mm) and dissociated by sequential enzymatic digestion. First, the tissue pieces were incubated in PBS (10 ml/g of tissue) containing 3.5 mg collagenase, 1.2 mg DNase, 6.9 mg hyaluronidase, and 10 mg bovine serum albumin for 15–30 min. The supernatant was then discarded. Next, the tissue was incubated for 20–40 min in PBS containing trypsin (6.9 mg trypsin, 20 mg EDTA, 12 mg DNase per 100 ml; tissue weight: dissociation buffer volume = 1:8). The enzyme activity was quenched by adding an equal volume of media containing 10% FBS. The cell suspension was filtered through a 70 μm sterile strainer and centrifuged at 1200 <italic>g</italic> for 7 min. A second collagenase digestion was performed by adding a 7× volume of the collagenase digestion buffer (see above), calculated on the basis of the weight of the cell pellet, followed by another incubation for 15–30 min. The cell suspension was then collected again by centrifugation. The cell pellets from the trypsin and second collagenase digestions were combined and purified over a Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Single cells were visually inspected for quality, counted using a hemacytometer, and immediately collected for scRNA-seq or for culture experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>scRNA-seq and analysis</title><p>To capture the transcriptome of individual cells, we used the Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent V3 Kit from 10× Genomics. For all samples 17,500 cells were loaded into one well of a Chip B kit for GEM generation. Library preparation including reverse transcription, barcoding, cDNA amplification, and purification was performed according to Chromium 10× V3 protocols. Each sample was sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 to a depth of approximately 20,000–30,000 reads per cell. The gene expression matrices for each dataset was generated using the CellRanger software (v3.0.2–10× Genomics). All reads were aligned to GRCh38 using STAR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/references">https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/references</ext-link>). The counts matrix was thresholded and analyzed in the package Seurat (v3.1.3). Cells with fewer than 500 or greater than 6000 unique genes, as well as all cells with greater than 15% mitochondrial counts, were excluded from all subsequent analyses. Doublet detection was performed for each sample using DoubletFinder and all doublets were excluded from analysis. For each sample, counts were scaled and normalized using ScaleData and NormalizeData, respectively, with default settings FindVariableFeatures used to identify the 2000 most variable genes as input for all future analyses. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using RunPCA and significant principal components (PCs) assessed using ElbowPlot and DimHeatmap. Dimensionality reduction and visualization using UMAP was performed by RunUMAP.</p><p>Integration of each timepoint into one dataset was performed using FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData, both using 20 dimensions (after filtering each dataset for number of genes, mitochondrial counts, and normalizing as described above). Data scaling, PCA, selection of PCs, clustering and visualization proceeded as described above using 30 PCs and a resolution of 0.6.</p><p>To generate the trophoblast, stroma, and immune cell subsets, the respective clusters were subset from the integrated dataset using the function SubsetData based upon annotations from marker genes identified by FindAllMarkers. After subsetting, counts were scaled and normalized using ScaleData and NormalizeData, respectively, with default settings FindVariableFeatures used to identify the 2000 most variable genes. Differentially expressed genes for each integrated dataset were identified using FindAllMarkers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>scVelo</title><p>RNA velocity analysis was applied to the entire conglomerate dataset using Velocyto to generate spliced and unspliced reads for all cells.

The scVelo dynamical model was run with default settings and subset by each timepoint.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Differential expression between regions</title><p>The number of trophoblast cells in each cluster were downsampled to 100 cells from each region of origin and performed differential expression using FindMarkers function and repeated this for 100 permutations. The number of genes found to be significantly differentially expressed (adj. p-value &lt; 0.05) from each permutation are plotted. Clusters having less that 100 cells from each region were excluded from this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Gene ontology analysis</title><p>Gene ontology analysis was performed with ClusterProfiler enrichGO function. The simplify function within this package was used to consolidate hierarchically related terms using a cutoff of 0.5.

Placental tissue in OCT was sectioned at 5 μm for all conditions. In brief, slides were washed in 1× PBST (1× PBS, 0.05% Tween-20), blocked for 1 hr (1× PBS +5% donkey or goat serum + 0.3% Triton-X), incubated in primary antibody diluted for 3 hr at room temperature (or overnight at 4°C), washed in 1× PBST, incubated in secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 or 594) for 1 hr at room temperature, incubated in DAPI for 10 min at room temperature, washed in 1× PBST, and mounted and sealed for imaging. Any antigen retrieval was performed prior to the blocking step by heating the slides in a 1× citrate buffer with 0.05% Tween-20 at 95°C for 30 min. All antibodies and the dilutions are listed in the Key resources table. All immunofluorescence staining was performed in n=3 biological replicates (3 distinct placentas) and representative image is shown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Transwell invasion assay</title><p>Twenty-four-well plate transwell inserts with an 8 μM polycarbonate membrane (Corning Costar 3422) were coated with 10 μl of Matrigel (growth factor-containing, Corning Corp, Corning, NY) diluted 1:1 in Serum Free Media (95% DME H-21+ Glutamine, 2% Nutridoma (mostly β-D xylopyranose), 1% Pen Strep, 1% HEPES, 0.1% Gentamycin). Cells from each region of the placenta were isolated as described above and then plated in the upper well of the transwell insert at a density of 250,000 cells in 250 μl of Serum Free Media, with 1 ml of Serum Free Media (or conditioned media) in the well below the insert. The cells were then cultured for 39 hr. The cells in the transwell were then fixed in 3% PFA for 10 min at 4°C, permeabilized in ice-cold methanol for 10 min at 4°C, then washed in 1× PBS, incubated in Pan-CK primary antibody for 3 hr at 37°C, washed in 1× PBS, incubated with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 594) and DAPI for 1 hr at 37°C, washed in 1× PBS, then mounted and sealed for imaging. All experiments were performed in n=3 biological replicates (3 distinct placentas). For conditioned media experiments n=3 biological replicates were analyzed (cells and conditioned medium derived from 3 distinct placentas).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Transwell invasion assay quantification</title><p>Transwell membranes mounted on slides were imaged at 40× magnification and the number of Pan-CK-positive projections through the membrane counted. Normalization for changes in cell density across fields of view and culture conditions was performed by quantifying the DAPI-positive area of each image and the number of projections normalized to the median across comparisons. Between 7 and 10 fields of view were quantified for each transwell membrane. p-Values were determined by t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Culture of placental cells and generation of conditioned media</title><p>Each well of a 24-well plate was coated with 20 μl of Matrigel undiluted (growth factor-containing, Corning Corp, Corning, NY) prior to cell seeding.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, this study is novel and addresses an important and uninvestigated question utilizing scRNA-seq and elegant computational approaches. The reviewers consider that the field will benefit from the publication of this research. Yet, there are caveats that the authors need to address before publication.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>(1) A point raised by both Reviewers #1 and #3 is about sample collection. We suggest the authors explain in detail in the method sections how the cellular isolations of VC and SC trophoblasts were performed and not just cite other papers. In addition, it would be good to know how the samples were obtained. Were they normal and voluntarily terminated? Reviewer #3 mentions that only very rarely do pregnancies fail in the second trimester which is a safe period for the mother and baby, so what is the reason for their delivery? If they were voluntary terminations of pregnancy they will have been exposed to mifepristone/misoprostol that will affect gene expression. Whichever way they were obtained they are not normal. Were the samples of the SC taken from close to the disc or near the cervix?</p><p>(2) Reviewers #1 and #2 raised a similar suggestion. The authors mention that there are differences in the EVTs isolated from the placental villi and those obtained from the chorioamniotic membranes. Other studies from the first and third trimesters have documented the presence of EVTs using scRNA-seq. I think that the study would benefit from comparing the authors' data (second trimester) with these publically available datasets. I think the authors could provide a unique roadmap of EVT transcriptomic activity throughout gestation.</p><p>(3) The findings on SC-CTB-secreted factors inhibiting EVT invasion are very intriguing. Could the authors analyze the conditioned media (via mass spec or ELISA) from SC and VC to try to identify potential candidates (e.g. SERPINE1 as mentioned in the discussion)?</p><p>(4) A major concern raised by Reviewer #2 is about the nomenclature used in the paper: villous chorion and smooth chorion. According to the schematic representation shown in Figure 1A, the authors sample the placental villous attached to the basal plate. Is this correct? It would have been more appropriate to sample the placental villous neighboring the chorionic plate or that from the inner placental mass, which is not associated with the basal or chorionic plate. In addition, the names utilized to define these placental compartments are unconventional. The readers would benefit from the authors utilizing conventional nomenclatures such as placental villi or chorioamniotic membranes. Last, the trophoblast in the chorioamniotic membranes is termed chorion laeve. The authors should consider using such terms throughout the manuscript and figures.</p><p>(5) Recent studies have suggested that stromal cells from the membranes participate in the host response against viral infection (COVID-19). Did the authors analyze the different types of stromal cell types between the placental villi and the membranes, and whether these display shared or unique functionality? Please discuss.</p><p>(6) Overall, the study would benefit from incorporating publically available data into the manuscript to strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>(7) Differences between CTBs and EVTs can also rely on cell-cell communications. Therefore, the authors are encouraged to perform Cell-Cell Chat analysis using their data.</p><p>(8) The manuscript is clearly presented and well written with a comprehensive reference to primary papers. However, many cited references are not included in the list including Maltepe 2015; Boll-Resli 1981; Pique-Regi 2020; Schlegelmilch 2011; Turco 2018; Kim 2006; Garcia-Flores et al. 2022.</p><p>(9) Reviewer #3 mentioned that identification of phenotypic markers specific to the smooth chorion is of interest and explains how this layer mediates important barrier functions for the fetus. An interesting finding is the specific expression of KRT6A in the smooth chorion. What is not clear from the report is how this layer is generated from the villi that originally surround the conceptus, which then regress probably due to the high oxygen concentrations at the periphery (Burton). This process is defective when the trophoblast transformation of vessels is abnormal in conditions, such as pre-eclampsia and preterm labour. The findings would be considerably more interesting if they could access samples earlier in pregnancy as the underlying pathogenesis of preterm labour is still unclear.</p><p>Thus, the important unanswered question is: what in these two microenvironments is driving the differential trajectory of CTB 1 towards villous SCT or to smooth KRT6A+ cells in the smooth chorion? Some TFs are different but what causes their upregulation in SC and this needs addressing? Are there any cells with the SC transcriptome in the new models of human TSC (Okae 2018; Turco 2018; Haider 2018)? These provide an in vitro model to generate SC and would considerably strengthen the paper.</p><p>(10) The methods of cell isolation rely on referring back to a previous publication and need expanding. &quot;CTBs were enriched over stromal and immune cells – line 126&quot; needs explanation as this will be a potential source of bias in the results. It appears that samples of the maternal side of the main villous placenta have been obtained – is this correct? Was decidua deliberately included? For the smooth chorion was the whole chorion – amnion, stroma, trophoblast and decidua included? These details are important as selecting specific areas and removing others will obviously alter the comparisons made.</p><p>(11) There are 6 macrophage populations – where are they located and which one is fetal Hofbauer cells? The relative paucity of NK cells and abundance of macrophages suggest that these are not from decidua. But why are there so few blood/decidual T cells? The best way to resolve these issues is to sequence maternal blood (and cord blood if obtainable) at the same time and remove these from the analyses.</p><p>To resolve these issues, the authors should compare their immune and fibroblast datasets in S2-S3 with previous single-cell data from the first trimester (Suryawanshi et al. 2018, Vento-Tormo et al. 2018). The correspondence between the decidual macrophages described in this manuscript is unclear compared with the ones from previous studies. Surprisingly, the 3 dNK cells previously identified are not found in this new dataset.</p><p>(12) The authors integrate the data from the villous chorion and smooth chorion computationally (eg Figure 1b). However, they should demonstrate that the integration pipeline is working correctly by defining the same cell states identified in the joint manifold when analysing the data separately. The same applies to all the analyses when specific cell subsets are zoomed in. For example, Figure 2c.</p><p>In addition, for each of the UMAPs defined in the manuscript, it is important to colour them by individual to confirm the integration.</p><p>(13) The EVT populations described are problematic and the logic of this section is hard to follow. Most trophoblast cells in the SC express the definitive EVT marker, HLA-G (Hutter 1996). So how do these EVT subsets relate to CTR2-4 and to published datasets? It is also surprising that the same EVT populations are defined in the analysis of villous and smooth chorion. An artifact due to the computational algorithm could be forcing the integration and it needs to be shown that this is not the case. This is common, as, by default, the method will assume equivalent populations in both datasets. One way to do so may be by using alternative methods for data integration (e.g., harmony, scVI), or by analysing datasets independently and comparing them afterwards (e.g. correlation analysis, machine-learning tools). It is also not made clear that the interstitial trophoblast deep in the decidua have not been sampled and only those EVT in the cell columns.</p><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>(1) Line 368 &quot;within the arterial wall, this population (interstitial EVT) further differentiates to endovascular EVTs and replaces the maternal arterial endothelium (Harris 2009, Red-Horse 2004)&quot;. This is controversial with the majority view instead being that interstitial trophoblast mediates medial destruction and then there is the replacement of the endothelium by endovascular trophoblast moving down from the shell (Pijnenborg; Bulmer).</p><p>(2) Introduction: The second paragraph of the introduction could be rewritten and/or incorporated into the third paragraph. In its present form, it reads like a textbook. In addition, the introduction is somewhat too long and would benefit from some trimming.</p><p>(3) Introduction: The last paragraph of the introduction should be revised. The authors mention that previous studies using scRNA-seq were performed in the fetal membranes from term pregnancies (Page 3, Lines 104-105). Yet, no references were provided. In the following sentence (Page 3, Lines 105-106), the authors mention &quot;in this study, CTBs were not identified in the smooth chorion…&quot; and the authors cite four papers. Which of these papers are the authors referring to? In the 2019 study that is cited, the authors reported the presence of CTBs and EVTs in the fetal membranes. In addition, new studies have also reported the presence of CTBs and EVTs in the fetal membranes (PMIDs: 32662421, 35042863). The authors may consider including this information.</p><p>(4) Results, Page 3, Lines 122-124: The authors mention that they chose to analyze second-trimester samples to avoid inflammation and apoptosis associated with parturition. Couldn't the authors include samples from women who delivered at term without labor?</p><p>(5) Page 8, Lines 265-266: What is the evidence to suggest that the differentiation of SC-CTB does not require a cell cycle?</p><p>(6) Results, Page 5, Lines 157-159: The authors suggest the involvement of maternal immune cells in VC and SC; yet, these results are expected since both the placental villous and the chorioamniotic membranes (which were sampled in this study) represent the maternal-fetal interface: intervillous space and decidua parietalis, respectively.</p><p>(7) Results: The authors are congratulated for validating the mRNA results with protein expression. Specifically referring to Figure 2. The authors are also congratulated for testing functional differences between the EVTs from the placental villi and those from the membranes. I think that this is a very useful piece of information, and the functionality of the different subsets of EVTs requires further investigation.</p><p>(8) Results, Page 8, Line 245: The authors claim that the CTBs from the membranes and those from the placental villi share a common progenitor by performing an elegant RNA velocity analysis. Yet, wouldn't it be expected that all trophoblasts share a progenitor?</p><p>(9) Figure 5: What is the evidence that EVTs from the two different compartments are behaviorally distinct? In other words, what do the authors mean by &quot;behavioral&quot;?</p><p>(10) Immune cells Figure 1S2</p><p>How were the 4 different immune cell populations – maternal blood/decidual and fetal blood/placental cells distinguished? Both stromal and immune cells from both individuals will be present in these isolates. It is said by XIST that most of the immune cells are maternal – are they from blood or decidua? Were the fetuses all male? It would be better to look at the transcriptomes and deconvolute the genotype data by SNPs to confirm.</p><p>(11) Figure 1S3</p><p>The presence of lymphatics in decidua is disputed (Volchek 2010) and Hofbauer cells express LYVE1 (Bockle 2008) so how certain is the presence of lymphatics.</p><p>(12) In Figure 2 the authors introduce a CTB cycling population. Is this population corresponding to CTB-1 only? Or, is it a mix of CTB-1-4? If the latter, defining independent clusters by, for example, removing cell cycling genes from the highly variable genes considered to define the clusters should be performed.</p><p>(13) Line 417. The &quot;suggesting a cell non-autonomous, rather than cell-autonomous, regulation of invasion&quot; is speculation that should be included in discussion rather than the results. How do the authors explain the fact that trophoblast organoids invade in the absence of decidua as in tubal or abdominal pregnancy? To increase the impact the proteomes of the two conditioned media from VC and SC should be studied to identify what is inhibiting invasion into decidua.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Line 368 &quot;within the arterial wall, this population (interstitial EVT) further differentiates to endovascular EVTs and replaces the maternal arterial endothelium (Harris 2009, Red-Horse 2004)&quot;. This is a controversial statement. Please review well the literature on this and include additional references.</p><p>– It would be very interesting to know if there are SC-CTB present in the new in vitro models (trophoblast stem cells from Okae et al. 2018 or in the placental organoids obtained as in Turco et al. 2018 and Haider et al. 2018).</p><p>– It may be important to report the sex of the fetuses, especially in the sequencing data repository.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

Both stromal and immune cells from both individuals will be present in these isolates. It is said by XIST that most of the immune cells are maternal – are they from blood or decidua?

The correspondence between the decidual macrophages described in this manuscript is unclear compared with the ones from previous studies. Surprisingly, the 3 dNK cells previously identified are not found in this new dataset.</p><p>Figure 1S3</p><p>The presence of lymphatics in decidua is disputed (Volchek 2010) and Hofbauer cells express LYVE1 (Bockle 2008) so how certain is the presence of lymphatics.</p><p>The authors integrate the data from the villous chorion and smooth chorion computationally (eg Figure 1b). However, they should demonstrate that the integration pipeline is working correctly by defining the same cell states identified in the joint manifold when analysing the data separately. The same applies to all the analyses when specific cell subsets are zoomed in. For example, Figure 2c.</p><p>In addition, for each of the UMAPs defined in the manuscript, it is important to colour them by individual to confirm the integration.</p><p>In Figure 2 the authors introduce a CTB cycling population. Is this population corresponding to CTB-1 only? Or, is it a mix of CTB-1-4? If the latter, defining independent clusters by, for example, removing cell cycling genes from the highly variable genes considered to define the clusters should be performed.</p><p>The EVT populations described are problematic and the logic of this section is hard to follow. Most trophoblast cells in the SC express the definitive EVT marker, HLA-G (Hutter 1996). So how do these EVT subsets relate to CTR2-4 and to published datasets? It is also surprising that the same EVT populations are defined in the analysis of villous and smooth chorion. An artifact due to the computational algorithm could be forcing the integration and it needs to be shown that this is not the case. This is common, as by default, the method will assume equivalent populations in both datasets. One way to do so may be by using alternative methods for data integration (e.g., harmony, scVI), or by analysing datasets independently and comparing them afterwards (e.g. correlation analysis, machine-learning tools). It is also not made clear that the interstitial trophoblast deep in the decidua have not been sampled and only those EVT in the cell columns.</p><p>Line 368 &quot;within the arterial wall, this population (interstitial EVT) further differentiates to endovascular EVTs and replaces the maternal arterial endothelium (Harris 2009, Red-Horse 2004)&quot;.

The &quot;suggesting a cell non-autonomous, rather than cell-autonomous, regulation of invasion&quot; is speculation that should be included in discussion rather than the results. How do the authors explain the fact that trophoblast organoids invade in the absence of decidua as in tubal or abdominal pregnancy? To increase the impact the proteomes of the two conditioned media from VC and SC should be studied to identify what is inhibiting invasion into decidua.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78829.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, this study is novel and addresses an important and uninvestigated question utilizing scRNA-seq and elegant computational approaches.

We suggest the authors explain in detail in the method sections how the cellular isolations of VC and SC trophoblasts were performed and not just cite other papers. In addition, it would be good to know how the samples were obtained. Were they normal and voluntarily terminated? Reviewer #3 mentions that only very rarely do pregnancies fail in the second trimester which is a safe period for the mother and baby, so what is the reason for their delivery? If they were voluntary terminations of pregnancy they will have been exposed to mifepristone/misoprostol that will affect gene expression. Whichever way they were obtained they are not normal. Were the samples of the SC taken from close to the disc or near the cervix?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have added more detailed protocols for dissection and cellular isolation from both the villous and smooth chorion to the methods section. All samples were healthy and voluntarily terminated in the second trimester between weeks 17 and 24. This information has been added to the methods section.</p><p>We also thank the reviewers for the consideration of the influence of the elective termination procedure on the cells we collected. Mifepristone and Misoprostol were not used in the termination of these pregnancies.</p><p>As to the location of the samples, the SC samples include cells isolated from varying distances from the disk and cervix. Briefly, the fetal membranes (often not fully intact) were washed and the amnion and decidual parietalis removed. The tissue was then minced into small pieces. These pieces contain tissue from many points along the SC. Therefore, the samples represent a sampling of cells from multiple locations in the SC, not biopsies of specific locations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Reviewers #1 and #2 raised a similar suggestion. The authors mention that there are differences in the EVTs isolated from the placental villi and those obtained from the chorioamniotic membranes. Other studies from the first and third trimesters have documented the presence of EVTs using scRNA-seq. I think that the study would benefit from comparing the authors' data (second trimester) with these publically available datasets. I think the authors could provide a unique roadmap of EVT transcriptomic activity throughout gestation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion of incorporating public data to strengthen our analysis of the trophoblast populations, including EVTs. We compared our trophoblast data to data from the VC of first trimester placentas from Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 and to data from the VC and SC of term placentas from Pique-Regi et al., 2019. First, we performed pairwise comparisons of the populations recovered in each of these studies, to identify which cell types were common among studies (Figure 2-S1d and f). This demonstrated the transcriptome of CTB 4 (and to a lesser extent CTB 3) not to be correlated with populations found in either Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 or Pique-Regi et al., 2019. Additionally, this analysis identified a strong correlation between the EVT populations identified in each dataset. EVT identified in Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 (first trimester) showed a stronger correlation with the less mature EVT populations in our dataset, while EVT identified in Pique-Regi et al., 2019 (term) demonstrated strong correlation with the most mature EVT clusters (2-4) in our data. To investigate this with higher resolution we integrated the data from each dataset with our own. Integration of the data from Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 show first trimester EVTs (including cells FAC sorted from HLA-G protein expression) align with our EVT 1 population. This suggests these first trimester EVTs resemble the least mature EVTs in our data and lack several features of invasive cells. Integration of the data from Pique-Regi et al., 2019 show strong similarity to those identified in our dataset. The cells isolated from the SC at term appear restricted to the less invasive EVT clusters in our dataset. Together these analyses suggest that EVTs in the SC may decrease an invasive transcriptional program between the second trimester and term. However, as there are notable differences in the populations recovered by Pique-Regi et al., 2019 and our study, including SC-CTBs (not found in Pique-Regi et al., 2019) and npi-CTBs (not found in our data), we cannot rule out that differences in EVT transcriptional signature may not be solely due to gestational age but due to differences in dissection and. Therefore, we are cautious about expanding claims about the relationship between EVTs and developmental time beyond these analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The findings on SC-CTB-secreted factors inhibiting EVT invasion are very intriguing. Could the authors analyze the conditioned media (via mass spec or ELISA) from SC and VC to try to identify potential candidates (e.g. SERPINE1 as mentioned in the discussion)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the potential for specific secreted factors from SCCTBs suppressing EVT migration is exciting and that their discovery would be exceptionally impactful. Indeed, Dr. Blelloch is currently preparing a grant proposing to seek and study such factors including by mass spec and ELISA panels. This grant proposal is a five-year plan and we feel beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) A major concern raised by Reviewer #2 is about the nomenclature used in the paper: villous chorion and smooth chorion. According to the schematic representation shown in Figure 1A, the authors sample the placental villous attached to the basal plate. Is this correct? It would have been more appropriate to sample the placental villous neighboring the chorionic plate or that from the inner placental mass, which is not associated with the basal or chorionic plate.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize to the reviews for the lack of clarity around the regions that were sampled in this study. We sampled cells from both floating villi and anchoring villi. We sampled these regions to ensure capture of CTBs, STBs, and EVTs. A schematic of the anchoring villi was provided because it depicts all of these cell types, whereas a schematic of the floating villi would not depict EVTs. We also deem it necessary to highlight the villous cell types including invasive EVTs in the VC to contrast with the SC trophoblast epithelium which lacks both villi and invasive EVTs. The text has been updated to specify that both floating and anchoring villi were collected.</p><p>We have included a more detailed explanation of the method of sampling. Cuts were made at the base of each cotyledon near the chorionic plate and the entire villous tree up to and including the basal plate was taken for study. The decidua was removed from the basal plate side and the remaining villous tree was dissected and dissociated. This retained cells in the basal plate (including cells moving through the villous cell column and beginning invasion into the decidua) and the floating villi near the chorionic plate and the inner placental mass.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the names utilized to define these placental compartments are unconventional. The readers would benefit from the authors utilizing conventional nomenclatures such as placental villi or chorioamniotic membranes. Last, the trophoblast in the chorioamniotic membranes is termed chorion laeve. The authors should consider using such terms throughout the manuscript and figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers concern over the nomenclature in the manuscript. The terms villous chorion and smooth chorion are accepted and widely used in publications (Benirschke et al., 2006; Genbacev et al., 2015; Genbacev et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2006; Yuan et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2009; King, 1981; Garrido-Gomez et al., 2017). While we appreciate that placental biologists and clinicians still use the traditional Latin names of chorionic villi and chorion laeve. Since we are submitting this study to <italic>eLife</italic> for a general audience we would like to maintain the use of common English terms for the clarity of the general readership. We have rewritten the introduction to clarify the nomenclature we use and put it in the context of the more specialized terms such as chorioamniotic membranes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Recent studies have suggested that stromal cells from the membranes participate in the host response against viral infection (COVID-19). Did the authors analyze the different types of stromal cell types between the placental villi and the membranes, and whether these display shared or unique functionality? Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We feel it would be off topic and inappropriate to comment on the application of these data to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic for multiple reasons. Primarily, the trophoblast enrichment protocol specifically selects against stromal cells. We recover fewer than 1000 cells from VC samples, including two samples with just 1 and 13 cells. This analysis is deeply underpowered to identify differentially expressed markers with specific functions in viral infection. Future cellular isolations which do not deplete stromal cells will be necessary to answer this question. Second, there are several datasets which have better representation of the stroma which would be better suited to answer this question (Pique-Regi et al., 2019; Pique-Regi et al., 2020; Garcia-Flores et al., 2022). Lastly, our study was designed to focus on trophoblast cell fate and function and a deviation to explore anti-viral properties of the stromal cells is beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Overall, the study would benefit from incorporating publically available data into the manuscript to strengthen the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these suggestions. We have incorporated two publicly available datasets, Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 (an atlas of first trimester villous chorion cells including emphasis on the stroma and immune populations) and the Pique-Regi et al., 2019 (a dataset that profiles both the villous and smooth chorions at term). First, we compared the cell types we identified in each of the trophoblast, stroma, and immune subsets to the cell types identified in Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 (Figure 1-S3a and c; Figure 2-S1d) and in Pique-Regi et al., 2019 (Figure 1-S4a and c; Figure 2-S1f). We found strong correlations in average expression between our cluster and those previously identified, which allowed for the validation of our cell type annotations. This comparison did not involve any computational integration and demonstrated the recovery of similar cell types in independent clustering analyses. Second, we computationally integrated our data with Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 (Figure 1-S3b and d; Figure 2 S1e) and Pique-Regi et al., 2019 (Figure 1-S4b and d; Figure 2-S1g), which demonstrated similarity between the cell types identified in each dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Differences between CTBs and EVTs can also rely on cell-cell communications. Therefore, the authors are encouraged to perform Cell-Cell Chat analysis using their data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to model receptor-ligand interactions between cell types in each region. We analyzed the predicted signaling interactions within cell population isolated from each region using CellPhoneDB and focused on three comparisons: CTB-CTB interactions (VC and SC), EVT-stromal interactions (VC and SC) and, CTB-EVT interactions (only in SC).</p><p>Since the four distinct CTB populations in the SC reside in close proximity to each other, we hypothesized that signaling between these populations may instruct the differentiation from CTB 1 to CTB 4 (SC-CTB). The number of predicted receptor-ligand interactions unique to the SC between CTB populations far outnumber those unique to the VC, which is largely composed of only CTB 1 cells. We plotted the predicted interactions unique to each region and the weight of the interactions estimated by mean expression of both receptor and ligand in the heatmaps in Figure 3-S2. Several pathways were unique to the SC including BMP and Notch signaling, as well as, several members of the EPH-EPHRIN family (Figure 3-S2b). These interactions may contribute to the function of the SC through influencing cell fate and/or cell sorting.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the predicted interactions between EVT and stromal cells within each region to identify differential signaling events that might contribute to reduced invasion in the SC. We plotted the predicted interactions unique to each region and the weight of the interactions estimated by mean expression of both receptor and ligand in the heatmaps in Figure 5-S3. We identified a greater number of interactions unique to the VC than the SC, and these interactions were enriched for Collagen-Integrin signaling from the EVTs to stromal cells (Figure 5-S3a). Interactions unique to EVT-stroma in the SC included PDGFA and FN1 secreted by EVTs to receptors various stromal cells</p><p>(Figure 5-S3b). Future work will test the functional consequences of these interactions.</p><p>Finally, since we observed frequent CTB-EVT interactions in the SC, we investigated signaling between these populations. We did not perform this analysis for the VC cells as these populations do not contact each other in the VC and any predicted interactions would be false-positives. We plotted the predicted interactions between CTBs and EVTs in the SC and the weight of the interactions estimated by mean expression of both receptor and ligand in the heatmap in Figure 6-S4. To attempt to identify secreted factors which might be responsible for the reduced invasion in VC cells upon treatment with SC conditioned media (Figure 6d), we analyzed the interactions between CTB 4 and EVTs which contained a secreted factor (Figure 6e). This analysis revealed numerous factors for future study, including FN1, TNFa, PGF, THBS1, TGFB1, FGF1, and PDGFB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The manuscript is clearly presented and well written with a comprehensive reference to primary papers. However, many cited references are not included in the list including Maltepe 2015; Boll-Resli 1981; Pique-Regi 2020; Schlegelmilch 2011; Turco 2018; Kim 2006; Garcia-Flores et al. 2022.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the oversight in not providing appropriate citations.

Like the identification of specific factors that explain the suppression of EVT migration on SC side would be very exciting, so would be the uncovering of the basis of differential trajectories for CTB1 differentiation on the two sides. As suggested here, it very well may be differential oxygen tension, but there are countless other possibilities. It may even be an underlying cell autonomous factor such as epigenetic differences that we cannot see at the RNA level. Looking earlier, i.e. the first trimester, might be one way to get at this question, although prior to clear morphological differences of the two sides, it will be difficult to know what will become future villous vs. smooth chorion from the sort of surgical specimens we receive from the clinic. In all, these are exciting, but complex questions with likely complex underlying mechanisms. We certainly plan to pursue these questions, but again feel it is beyond the scope of the paper. We believe the discovery of the different trajectories and of a previously undescribed CTB population on the SC side is already an important advance in the field. We hope the reviewers agree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there any cells with the SC transcriptome in the new models of human TSC (Okae 2018; Turco 2018; Haider 2018)? These provide an in vitro model to generate SC and would considerably strengthen the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to analyze data from existing culture systems to identify if SC-CTBs are present. The three resources for placental organoid culture (Okae 2018; Turco 2018; Haider 2018) do not perform scRNA-seq which is a limitation for detecting rare subpopulations of cells. These studies performed bulk RNA analyses and we investigated whether KRT6A transcript was expressed in any of these datasets.</p><p>Okae et al., 2018, performed bullk RNA-seq to compare the transcriptional profiles of cells isolated from chorionic villi, human trophoblast stem cells, and differentiated cells from human trophoblast stem cells. They identified very low average KRT6A transcript in cells isolated from tissue [CTB = 0.018, EVT = 0.194, STB = 0.016 log2(FPKM+1)], in accordance with the low level of expression in the VC in our study. In most cultured cells KRT6A transcript was not detected. A very low level of expression was detected in TS cell derived from blastocysts [0.016 log2(FPKM+1)] and in the 3D differentiation of STB from blastocysts [0.106 log2(FPKM+1)]. Therefore, we believe that SC-CTB are not generated by these culture methods or if they are, it must be in very small numbers.</p><p>Turco et al., 2018 performed RNA microarray comparing GW6-GW12 chorionic villi samples to cultured placental organoids. Average normalized expression of KRT6A does not change between tissue samples (2.16) and organoid samples (2.41). As we have established that KRT6A expressing cells are not found in the villous chorion, no increase in expression in organoids suggested SC-CTB were not present.</p><p>Haider et al., 2018 performed RNA-seq on CTB-organoids and compared transcriptional profiles to isolated CTB, STB, and fibroblasts. The average expression of KRT6A across all samples as calculated by DESeq2 baseMean was 69.7 compared to highly expressed CTB marker genes like KRT7 (4406) and PAGE4 (14392), ranking KRT6A expression 9740th out of 17008 transcripts identified. Additionally, KRT6A was not found to be differentially expressed in any comparison across conditions. Therefore, we concluded that SC-CTB are not generated in this organoid culture system.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the ability to derive SC-CTB in culture would greatly enhance our ability to study these cells. However, it seems these cells are not currently generated in either directed differentiation or heterogenous organoid culture models. We do hope in the future to be able to identify in vitro differentiation conditions that do produce SC-CTBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) The methods of cell isolation rely on referring back to a previous publication and need expanding. &quot;CTBs were enriched over stromal and immune cells – line 126&quot; needs explanation as this will be a potential source of bias in the results. It appears that samples of the maternal side of the main villous placenta have been obtained – is this correct? Was decidua deliberately included? For the smooth chorion was the whole chorion – amnion, stroma, trophoblast and decidua included? These details are important as selecting specific areas and removing others will obviously alter the comparisons made.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to expand details on the methods of dissection and cellular isolation. Please also see the response to point 1, as this raises the same question. We have greatly expanded the methods section for dissection and isolation for both VC and SC samples.</p><p>The goal of this study was to focus on the trophoblast populations. In the VC samples, floating villi and anchoring villi were carefully dissected away from the decidua. These dissections, not surprisingly, do retain some decidual cells, presumably those most closely associated with the cell columns. The cell preparation further enriches for trophoblast cells over the stroma cells (both decidua and fetal derived) as well as immune cells. The result is that stromal cells are not even found in all VC samples and the total number of stromal cells is less than 1000. Immune cells are found in greater numbers, but also likely reduced. In SC, both the decidua and amnion were dissected away. The remaining cells were once again prepared to enrich for trophoblasts over stromal and immune cells. The purposeful depletion of stromal and immune cells is now explicitly stated in the text. We only briefly mention the stromal and immune cell types we recover and make limited claims concerning their functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) There are 6 macrophage populations – where are they located and which one is fetal Hofbauer cells? The relative paucity of NK cells and abundance of macrophages suggest that these are not from decidua. But why are there so few blood/decidual T cells?

The reviewer is correct that the best way to identify the maternal cells is to sequence maternal blood (as is performed in Vento-Tormo et al. 2018). However, we did not do this because we sought to minimize the contribution of stromal and immune cells and to focus on the trophoblast.</p><p>Previous publications, like Vento-Tormo et al. 2018, specifically enriched for immune cells by both collecting peripheral blood and decidual samples, then sorting for CD45+ cell by FACS and performing scRNA-seq. Additionally, characterization of the three dNK cells mentioned by the reviewer includes data from the Smart-Seq2 method of scRNAseq. Because this method captures full length RNA and sequences to a much greater depth, Smart-Seq2 is a much more sensitive assay than droplet based scRNA-seq methods like 10x genomics. For these reasons, we do not find it surprising that our droplet based scRNA-seq data isolated from samples by a method specifically designed to exclude the decidual regions does not recover these cell states with the same resolution.</p><p>By design our experiment targets trophoblast cells at the expense of immune cells and stromal cells. We understand and admit the strengths and caveats of this approach, namely that there are populations missing from the immune and stromal cells. We have added language to further emphasize these caveats and our logic in the text.</p><p>To better understand the immune populations in our dataset and to compare to existing cell type definitions we have compared the immune subsets from this study to published data in Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 and Pique-Regi et al., 2019. We did this both through correlation of expression between independently derived clusters and through the computation integration of these datasets. Our NK cells show strong correlation and integration with the three dNK subsets identified in Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 (Figure 1S5e and f).</p><p>Based on the comparison of our macrophage populations to those identified in Vento-</p><p>Tormo et al., 2018 we have amended the cluster annotations slightly. The new Macrophage 1 (M) cluster matches the dM1 cluster from Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 and contains the old Macrophage 1 (M), Macrophage 2.1 (M), Macrophage 2.2 (M) clusters. The new Macrophage 2 (M) cluster matches the dM2 cluster from Vento-Tormo et al.,</p><p>2018 and contains the old Macrophage 2.3 (M) and Macrophage 2.4 (M). Macrophage 3 (M) matches the dM3 cluster from Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 and remains unchanged.

However, they should demonstrate that the integration pipeline is working correctly by defining the same cell states identified in the joint manifold when analysing the data separately. The same applies to all the analyses when specific cell subsets are zoomed in. For example, Figure 2c.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point. To address this, we analyzed the cells from the VC and SC independently as suggested. Focusing on the trophoblast cells, clustering identified similar clusters as the integrated dataset. Independent analysis of the VC identified all clusters except for CTB 4 (the smooth chorion specific population), suggesting that the small number found in the integrated analysis were coerced by cellular integration. Analogously, independent analysis of the SC identified all clusters except for STB Precursor, STB, and EVT Precursor cells. These results are consistent the small number of STB (14 cells) and EVT precursor (8 cells) from the SC in the integrated dataset (Supplementary Table 1). We have included these analyses in an additional supplementary figure (Figure 2-S3a-f). We performed the same analyses for both the stroma and immune subsets and included these analyses in new supplementary figures (Figure 1-S6a-d and Figure 1-S8a-d).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, for each of the UMAPs defined in the manuscript, it is important to colour them by individual to confirm the integration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. The contributions of each individual to each UMAP colored by coarse cluster are provided in Figure 1-S1c and the contribution of each individual to the trophoblast subset colored by cluster annotation is shown in Figure 2-S1b. We have added the contribution of each individual to the immune and stroma subset UMAPs in Figure 1-S5c and Figure 1-S7c, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) The EVT populations described are problematic and the logic of this section is hard to follow. Most trophoblast cells in the SC express the definitive EVT marker, HLA-G (Hutter 1996).</p></disp-quote><p>We regret the confusion in this section. While we appreciate that prior work has suggested that most trophoblast cells in the smooth chorion express HLA-G (Hutter, 1996), we do not find this to be true. In our scRNA-seq data we identify that only 46.8% of trophoblasts in the VC and 32.1% of trophoblasts in the SC express HLA-G (Figure 5c). The mix of trophoblast population in SC was further supported by staining for HLAG protein in the SC (Figure 5b, Figure 6b, Figure 6-S1). Our findings are also supported in the literature by HLA-G staining (Garrido-Gomez et al., 2017).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that EVTs are marked by the definitive marker HLA-G. Expression of HLA-G transcript was used to define the EVT clusters we identified (Figure 2 and Figure 5) and protein expression of HLA-G is used to define EVT cell identity in all tissue sections (Figure 5 and Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>So how do these EVT subsets relate to CTR2-4 and to published datasets?</p></disp-quote><p>CTB 1-4 and CTB S-phase and CTB G2/M-phase cells do not express HLA-G transcript, as shown in Figure 5a and Figure 2-S2b. Additionally, we demonstrated that the CTB 1 marker np-CTNNB1 (Figure 6a and Figure 6-S1) and the CTB 4 marker KRT6A (Figure 6b and Figure 6-S1) have mutually exclusive domains of protein expression from EVT marker HLA-G. Therefore, our data support that EVT identified in either the VC or SC are distinct from all CTB populations (including all proliferating cells).</p><p>We compared the trophoblasts populations we identified to those published in VentoTormo et al., 2018. The EVT cells we identify bear strong resemblance to both computationally annotated EVT cells and FACS sorted HLA-G+ cells identified in VentoTormo et al., 2018 (Figure 2S<sup>-1</sup>d and e). In accordance with our data, all EVT and HLAG+ cells cluster separately from all CTB (including the smooth chorion specific CTB 4 cells) [Figure 2-S1e]. This provides evidence from an external dataset that the EVT we identify match previously published EVT and are distinct from all CTB isolated from either the VC or the SC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also surprising that the same EVT populations are defined in the analysis of villous and smooth chorion. An artifact due to the computational algorithm could be forcing the integration and it needs to be shown that this is not the case. This is common, as, by default, the method will assume equivalent populations in both datasets. One way to do so may be by using alternative methods for data integration (e.g., harmony, scVI), or by analysing datasets independently and comparing them afterwards (e.g. correlation analysis, machine-learning tools).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. To address the possibility that similarities between EVT population are an artifact of integration we performed independent analysis of the cells isolated from each region (see the response to point 12). We identify both strong correlations and overlapping computational integrations between independently identified EVT clusters in the VC and SC samples (Figure 2-S3a-f), between the EVT populations identified in this study with EVT identified by Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 (defined by both by transcript and HLA-G protein expression)[Figure 2-S1d and e], and between the EVT populations identified in this study with EVT identified by Pique-Regi et al., 2019 (Figure 2-S1f and g). Please see the response to point 2 above for more detail. Given the agreement in the findings of multiple orthogonal methods and multiple independent datasets, we do not believe the transcriptional similarity between EVT from the VC and SC is an artifact of computational integration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also not made clear that the interstitial trophoblast deep in the decidua have not been sampled and only those EVT in the cell columns.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity around this point.

The authors mention that previous studies using scRNA-seq were performed in the fetal membranes from term pregnancies (Page 3, Lines 104-105). Yet, no references were provided.

Which of these papers are the authors referring to? In the 2019 study that is cited, the authors reported the presence of CTBs and EVTs in the fetal membranes. In addition, new studies have also reported the presence of CTBs and EVTs in the fetal membranes (PMIDs: 32662421, 35042863). The authors may consider including this information.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize to the reviewers for lack of clarity in this section. Pique-Regi et al., 2019 was cited as a reference for the claim that CTBs were not identified in the smooth chorion. No claims were made about a lack of EVTs in either Pique-Regi et al., 2019 or in our manuscript. In Pique-Regi et al., 2019 the authors identify 132 CTBs (CTB and npi-CTB) out of 29,921 cells isolated from the chorioamniotic membranes, representing 0.44% of all cells recovered.

We do not claim (or have evidence) that the differentiation to CTB 4 does not require a cell cycle. We demonstrate KRT6+ CTB 4 cells express KI67, suggesting these cells have not exited the cell cycle. We cannot determine and do not comment on the intersection of cell cycle and differentiation beyond noting that CTB 4 cells can remain proliferative. Since both other differentiated cell types in the placenta (EVTs and STBs) exit the cell cycle in concert with differentiation (unlike CTB 4), we feel this is a distinction worth noting. We have updated the text to clarify this point.</p><p>Please see lines 268-270: “Mitotic KRT6+ cells were identified, and while the interaction between the cell cycle and differentiation of SC-CTBs remains unclear, these data show that differentiation to SC-CTB does not require cell cycle exit, unlike STBs and EVTs”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Results: The authors are congratulated for validating the mRNA results with protein expression.

The result we found surprising is that a common progenitor exists as late as GW23, this progenitor is transcriptionally similar to canonical Villous CTB (now demonstrated to exist in the SC), and that this progenitor appears fate restricted by its location.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Figure 5: What is the evidence that EVTs from the two different compartments are behaviorally distinct? In other words, what do the authors mean by &quot;behavioral&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the vagaries of this wording. We use the term behavioral to refer to the migratory/invasive actions of these cells in the tissue. In referencing distinct behavior, we refer to the documented differences in the depth of invasion/migration into maternal cells observed in the VC or the SC (Genbacev et al., 2015). To reduce confusion, we have changed “behavior” to “invasive activity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Immune cells Figure 1S2</p><p>How were the 4 different immune cell populations – maternal blood/decidual and fetal blood/placental cells distinguished? Both stromal and immune cells from both individuals will be present in these isolates. It is said by XIST that most of the immune cells are maternal – are they from blood or decidua? Were the fetuses all male? It would be better to look at the transcriptomes and deconvolute the genotype data by SNPs to confirm.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the need for better characterization of the origin of stromal and immune cells. We agree with the reviewers that the best method to assess the origin of these populations is to collect blood and decidua and deconvolute by SNPs. Deconvolution by SNP from transcripts using programs like freemuxlet work well for separating reads from two distinct (unrelated) individuals but fail in the case of parental relationships due to shared genomic material. As this study was focused entirely on the trophoblast populations (fetal only), we did not sequence and genotype maternal decidua, maternal blood, and fetal only cells to perform this analysis.</p><p>Instead, by assessing XIST expression in trophoblast cells from each sample (all of fetal origin), we assigned the sex of each sample to be GW17.6 = Male, GW18.2 = Male, GW23 = Female, and GW24 = Male (Figure 1-S2a). Therefore, in the stromal and immune populations cells of fetal origin would only express XIST in GW23 samples and no others. All immune populations, with the exception of Erythrocytes, express XIST in all samples (Figure 1-S2c). Stromal populations with XIST expression largely restricted to GW23 samples (Mesenchyme 1 (F), Mesenchyme 3 (F), and Mesenchyme 4 (F)), are annotated as fetal. All others show XIST expression across all samples and are thus annotated as maternal (Figure 1-S2b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Figure 1S3</p><p>The presence of lymphatics in decidua is disputed (Volchek 2010) and Hofbauer cells express LYVE1 (Bockle 2008) so how certain is the presence of lymphatics.</p></disp-quote><p>The lymphatic endothelium in the smooth chorion has been previously identified, validated, and localized in Pique-Regi et al., 2019.

While we did not perform any immunolocalization, Pique-Regi et al., 2019 did confirm the location of these cells in the SC using an antibody to LYVE1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) In Figure 2 the authors introduce a CTB cycling population. Is this population corresponding to CTB-1 only? Or, is it a mix of CTB-1-4? If the latter, defining independent clusters by, for example, removing cell cycling genes from the highly variable genes considered to define the clusters should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the lack of clarity around the identity of these populations. The S-phase and G2/M-phase CTB populations contain a mix of cells from CTB 1-4 (but not from STB, EVT, or either precursor populations). Although it can be beneficial to regress out cell cycle related genes to remove factors which obscure cell identity, we did not remove cell cycle genes from our analysis for two reasons. First, cell cycle is an important component of cell fate and identity. This is especially true in the placenta as both commitment to EVT and STB lineages is inextricably tied to cell fate (Lu et al., 2017; Genbacev et al., 1997). Therefore, we determined that excluding information relating to cell cycle state might decrease the ability to identify determinants of cell fate. The S-phase and G2/M-phase CTB containing cells expressing markers of CTB 1-4 clusters, motivated the analysis of proliferation by KI67 staining (Figure 4b and Figure 3-S1b) that demonstrates that CTB 4 cells remain proliferative. This sets this population apart from both EVT and STB. Second, the majority of CTB identified in our analysis do not contain markers of S or G2/M phase transcripts. Therefore, we are confident in the ability to define cell identity solely based on non-phasic transcripts in these 26,325 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Line 417. The &quot;suggesting a cell non-autonomous, rather than cell-autonomous, regulation of invasion&quot; is speculation that should be included in discussion rather than the results. How do the authors explain the fact that trophoblast organoids invade in the absence of decidua as in tubal or abdominal pregnancy?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the opportunity to clarify this point. We have removed this from the Results section. We believe our data suggest that the default action of EVT is to invade/migrate and the environment (SC-CTB and decidual cells) may function to restrict this invasion. If invasion is the default, EVTs will invade in the absence of SCCTB and decidual cells, matching what is observed in organoid models. Therefore, we believe our model is consistent with what is seen in in vitro models and tubal or abdominal pregnancies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To increase the impact the proteomes of the two conditioned media from VC and SC should be studied to identify what is inhibiting invasion into decidua.</p></disp-quote><p>See answer to question 3 in general comments.</p><p>References (not included in manuscript)</p><p>King, B.
