While paresis, a weakness of voluntary movements driven by surviving descending pathways, can benefit from spinal stimulation, the effects of descending commands on motor outputs produced by spinal stimulation are unclear. Here, we show that descending commands amplify and shape the stimulus-induced muscle responses and torque outputs. During the wrist torque tracking task, spinal stimulation, at a current intensity in the range of balanced excitation and inhibition, over the cervical enlargement facilitated and/or suppressed activities of forelimb muscles. Magnitudes of these effects were dependent on directions of voluntarily produced torque and positively correlated with levels of voluntary muscle activity. Furthermore, the directions of evoked wrist torque corresponded to the directions of voluntarily produced torque. These results suggest that spinal stimulation is beneficial in cases of partial lesion of descending pathways by compensating for reduced descending commands through activation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections to motoneurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>stimulation</kwd><kwd>descending command</kwd><kwd>voluntary movement</kwd><kwd>motor output</kwd><kwd>monkey</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 18H05287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Yukio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 18H04038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Yukio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 20H05489</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Yukio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 20H05713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Yukio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI JP18J11771</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaneshige</surname><given-names>Miki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 20K19377</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaneshige</surname><given-names>Miki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020963</institution-id><institution>Moonshot Research and Development Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJMS2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Yukio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spinal stimulation at balanced currents of excitation and inhibition boosts voluntarily produced torque production.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Electrical stimulation to the spinal cord is a promising method to restore motor function after the impairment of descending pathways through spinal cord injury or stroke.

Under these conditions, however, the excitability of motoneurons is too low to observe the effect of inhibitory spinal interneurons on motor outputs, thus, investigations during voluntary movements are necessary.</p><p>Paresis is a weakness of voluntary movements caused by partial lesion of descending pathways and is a major symptom in spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, 2021</xref>) and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ramnemark et al., 1998</xref>), as well as a major target for therapeutic spinal stimulation. Although individuals with paresis have difficulty controlling their limb movements, they can produce weak muscle activity driven by the preserved descending pathways. In this case, artificial activation of preserved spinal circuits by spinal stimulation can be combined with the influence of preserved descending commands. Although a few studies have examined spinal stimulation in awake animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sharma and Shah, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barra et al., 2022</xref>), the modulation of muscle responses to spinal stimulation by descending commands has not been fully clarified. Descending commands for controlling voluntary limb movements are generated in the motor cortex and activate spinal motoneurons and interneurons. Numerous studies have shown that neural activity in the primary motor cortex represents various movement parameters such as the direction of joint movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caminiti et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cisek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crammond and Kalaska, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Georgopoulos et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Georgopoulos et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwartz et al., 1988</xref>) and the amount of muscle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buys et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheney et al., 1985b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fetz and Cheney, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lemon et al., 1986</xref>). We hypothesized that such parameters during voluntary movement modify the motor outputs evoked by spinal stimulation.</p><p>Here, we investigated the effects of voluntary commands on muscle responses of the upper limb and wrist joint torque induced by subdural spinal stimulation on the cervical enlargement during an eight-directional wrist torque tracking task in monkeys. Results showed that spinal stimulation (150–1350 µA) produced facilitation and/or suppression effects on muscle activities in multiple muscles. The magnitude of these muscle responses showed directional tuning and positively correlated with the level of background muscle activity. Moreover, spinal stimulation boosted torque production in the direction corresponding with the direction of voluntary torque production. These findings suggest that spinal stimulation at an appropriate current is beneficial in a partial lesion of descending pathways to compensate for reduced descending commands by activating excitatory and inhibitory trans-synaptic connections to spinal motoneurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Experiments were performed using two macaque monkeys.

A total of 469 muscular conditions in 16 muscles changed the type of PStEs, Facilitation or Suppression, depending on the direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A dominant PStEs type, indicated with a plus symbol (e.g. Facilitation+ and Suppression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), was determined by the comparison between the sums of each PStE for the eight target locations. Only one muscular condition in the intrinsic hand muscles showed no response in any of the target locations. Polar plots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref> show the magnitudes of Facilitation (red on bottom-left panel), Suppression (blue on bottom-center panel), and background EMG (green on bottom-right panel) during the hold period for the peripheral targets. These magnitudes were significantly tuned in direction, showing the preferred direction (PD, p&lt;0.05, bootstrap). Especially in PStEs of Facilitation, the magnitude of PStEs in the peripheral target close to the PD of background EMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, 270° and 315°) was generally larger compared with that in the center target and smaller in the peripheral target opposite to the PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, 90° and 135°). Significant PDs were observed in the 603 muscular conditions in 16 muscles for Facilitation (Spinal PD of Facilitation), 333 muscular conditions in 16 muscles for Suppression (Spinal PD of Suppression), and 1006 muscular conditions in 16 muscles for background EMG. It should be noted that the Spinal PDs often appear to display similar angles to the PD of background EMG (compare polar plots between bottom-left/bottom-center and bottom-right panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Directional tuning of the stimulus-induced muscle responses during wrist torque tracking task.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Muscle responses to spinal stimulation during the hold period for the eight-peripheral (peripheral panels) and the center targets (center of peripheral panels).

When both Spinal PDs of Facilitation and Suppression were obtained in a single muscular condition (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the Spinal PDs of Facilitation and Suppression were analyzed separately for the population data. The distributions of Spinal PDs of Facilitation (top-left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and Suppression (top-right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) were significantly nonuniform and tuned in the ulnar and radial directions, respectively. Similarly, the PD of background EMG (middle panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) also showed nonuniform distributions and were similar with the respective Spinal PD. To omit the effect of directional tuning of the background EMG, we computed the Normalized Spinal PDs for Facilitation and Suppression (bottom panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) by subtracting the PD of background EMG from the Spinal PD. If the PD of background EMG is identical with the Spinal PD, the Normalized Spinal PD should manifest as a distribution centered at 0°. Indeed, Normalized Spinal PDs were significantly tuned around the predicted value of 0° (bottom panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that muscle responses induced by spinal stimulation were tuned depending on the directions of voluntary torque production and that the PDs of induced muscle responses were identical to the PDs of voluntary activation of the corresponding muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Effect of current intensity on the evoked muscle responses</title><p>Next, we investigated how current intensity affected the magnitudes and directional tuning of the induced muscle responses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> show examples of directional tuning of PStEs at different current intensities.

The magnitudes of Facilitation increased, and the magnitudes of Suppression decreased with increasing current intensities. In addition, Spinal PDs of Suppression (70 and 180 μA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; 70 μA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and Facilitation (1000 μA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; 200 and 1000 μA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) at lower currents corresponded to the PDs of background EMG, while stimulation at higher currents indicated either no PD (1700 μA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or a significant PD at almost the opposite direction of the PD for background EMG (1700 μA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

On the other hand, medium (150 μA and 1000 μA) and higher (1700 μA) current stimulations induced Facilitation and resulted in a saturation of Facilitation, with no significant correlations (two-sided Pearson’s correlation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <italic>r</italic>=0.862, p=0.06; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <italic>r</italic>=0.611, p=0.27; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <italic>r</italic>=–0.788, p=0.11). Moreover, higher currents at 1700 μA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) tended to reduce the magnitudes of Facilitation on higher background EMG. PStEs during the hold period for the center target increased as current intensity increased, showing a simple input-output property of stimulus-indued muscle responses (‘center target,’ insets on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). In general, including the hold period for the center target, the magnitudes of PStEs at low stimulus currents were linearly increased depending on the magnitudes of background EMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, the magnitudes of PStEs of Facilitation at medium currents were often larger during hold period for the center target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref> insets) compared to that during voluntary torque production even though the magnitude of background EMG was identical between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>, rightmost panels).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Effect of current intensity on the relationship between the stimulus-induced muscle responses and background electromyograms (EMGs).</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Examples of stimulus-intensity-dependent modulation of post-stimulus effects (PStEs) on background EMGs.

During voluntary torque productions at the wrist in eight different directions and 45<sup>o</sup> apart, spinal stimulation over the C6-T2 region produced facilitation and/or suppression effects on muscle activities in multiple muscles of the upper limb. The magnitude of these muscle responses was tuned by voluntary commands that controlled the direction of torque production and the level of background muscle activity. The stimulus-induced muscle responses were also associated with current intensity. At lower currents (&lt;1350 μA), the PDs of muscle responses corresponded to those of background muscle activity. The underlying mechanisms were explained by the observation that the magnitudes of muscle responses positively correlated with the levels of muscle activity, reflecting the level of descending commands to spinal motoneurons. This relationship disappeared at higher currents (≥1350 μA). Moreover, the induced wrist torques were modulated by directions of voluntary torque and stimulus currents. Appropriate currents (150–1350 μA) evoked torques toward the same direction as voluntary torque production. Thus, spinal stimulation at balanced currents of excitation and inhibition in spinal circuits boosts torque production in directions corresponding to the direction of voluntary torque production.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Current-dependent activation of neural circuits</title><p>The type of induced muscle responses and the direction of evoked torques during the task changed depending on the stimulus current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The number of muscles showing suppression effects and its magnitude decreased, while those of facilitation effects increased as current intensity increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Similarly, lower currents suppressed voluntary torques, while medium currents boosted torques toward the same direction as voluntary torque production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Onset latencies of evoked muscle responses were shorter with increasing current intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B and D</xref>). Such current-dependent effects indicate that the recruited neural elements changed as the stimulus current increased during voluntary torque production.</p><p>Since the subdural arrays were placed over the dorsal rootlets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), electrical currents are likely to first drive the afferent fibers adjacent to the stimulus sites, indicating that a major component of stimulus effect could be driven by spinal reflex via large diameter and low threshold afferent fibers such as Ia, Ib, and cutaneous afferents. Suppression effects are mediated, at least in part, by a disynaptic link via inhibitory interneurons, while the facilitation effects are via excitatory monosynaptic premotoneuronal afferent fibers and/or facilitatory interneurons. The gain of such mono- and polysynaptic spinal reflexes depends on motoneuronal excitability, which is modulated by voluntary descending commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capaday and Stein, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Verrier, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zehr and Chua, 2000</xref>). In line with these considerations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guiho et al., 2021</xref> recently proposed a model of spinal circuitry driven by spinal electrical stimulation. In their model, the discharges of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons elicited by spinal stimulation are assumed to be integrated into motoneuron activity receiving corticospinal drives. The current study extends this model so that the voluntary descending commands are integrated with afferent inputs at spinal interneurons as well as motoneurons. Spinal stimulation at low and medium currents (&lt;1350 µA) induced facilitation and/or suppression effects in multiple forelimb muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Magnitudes of these effects were proportional to the level of background EMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which depends on the amount of descending commands and suggests that descending commands amplified the functions of intraspinal neural elements such as excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections to motoneurons. This leads to the correspondence between PDs of stimulus-induced muscle responses and background EMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, top and medium panels) and positive correlations between the magnitude of stimulus-induced muscle responses and background EMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, top and medium panels). The magnitude of stimulus-induced muscle responses would depend on excitability and number of spinal motoneurons and interneurons in the subliminal fringe.</p><p>On the other hand, higher currents (≥1350 µA) induced a large magnitude of facilitation effects in most muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>) and showed the disappearance of Spinal PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> bottom panel) or no correlation between the magnitudes of background EMG and stimulus-induced muscle responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, bottom-left panel). These results indicate that current spread to the ventral aspect of the spinal cord leads to direct activation of motor axons, as well as recruitment of ascending pathways in the dorsal columns and dorsal rootlets. Previous studies reported that the shortest latency of muscle responses in the forearm by intraspinal microstimulation in the cervical enlargement was 2.8 ms due to the direct excitation of spinal motoneurons axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perlmutter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takei and Seki, 2010</xref>). Our results showed that the latency of stimulus-induced muscle responses was shorter at higher currents, and the shortest latency was 2.5 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) which corresponded with the results in the previous reports. Thus, subdural stimulation at higher currents in present study most likely resulted in the direct activation of motor axons. Also, higher currents evoked stereotypical torque responses in the ulnar-flexion direction irrespective of the presence/absence or the direction of voluntary torque production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This result might be due to the number and volume of wrist flexor and ulnar muscles being greater than the antagonist muscles so that the evoked torques were induced in the ulnar-flexion direction. During low descending commands with lower background EMG, higher currents induced larger facilitatory muscle responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, left), indicating that many subthreshold neural elements, including both neurons within the subliminal fringe and deeper membrane potentials, were activated by higher currents. In contrast, during higher descending commands with higher background EMG, many motoneurons and motor axons are under the refractory period. Thus, higher currents could activate the few remaining subthreshold motoneurons and motor axons, causing smaller facilitatory muscle responses compared with lower descending commands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, right). Accordingly, during a higher level of descending commands at higher currents, Spinal PD at higher currents became opposite of the PD of background EMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, bottom-left panel), and stimulus-induced muscle responses became independent or showed a negative correlation with background EMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>, bottom-left panel).</p><p>As shown in our results of onset latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), facilitation effects were observed at as weak intensity as suppression effects. However, results showed suppressed voluntary torques at lower currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), indicating stronger suppression effects via inhibitory interneurons. The neural mechanisms underlying the suppressed voluntary torques are unclear, but afferent inputs mediated by Ia presynaptic inhibition to motoneurons or autogenic inhibition to agonist motoneurons via inhibitory interneurons might be possible mechanisms for suppression effects at lower currents. The inhibitory influence mediated by presynaptic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eccles et al., 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eccles et al., 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rudomin and Schmidt, 1999</xref>) is known to act on afferents but not corticospinal inputs to motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jackson et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, during muscular contraction, autogenic inhibition to agonist motoneurons via inhibitory interneurons is driven by Ib afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Houk, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lundberg and Malmgren, 1988</xref>). Our results suggest that lower currents predominantly result in these effects on the agonist motoneurons and suppress voluntary torque. The inter-muscular relationship characterized by the PDs of background EMGs in the wrist muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) demonstrate that the monkeys consistently engaged each muscle as agonist and that antagonistic voluntary contractions were rare irrespective of stimulus currents (see polar plots of background EMGs of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). This result indicates that the presumed different activation in the spinal excitatory and inhibitory interneurons at different current intensity is not supported by the change of wrist torque production strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Voluntary command tunes stimulus-induced muscle responses</title><p>Directional tuning of neural activity during voluntary movements is observed in each hierarchical neural element from the cerebral cortex to muscles.

Furthermore, the PD of induced muscle responses was identical to the PD of background EMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Interestingly, at medium currents, the stimulus-induced facilitatory responses were sometimes smaller when the responses were recorded in the antagonistic muscles against the wrist torque direction regardless of the background EMG activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that spinal reciprocal inhibitory function was evolved by the descending commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meunier and Pierrot-Deseilligny, 1998</xref>). Together, our findings indicate that voluntary commands amplify the functions of spinal circuits, including excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections to motoneurons activated by spinal stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Spinal stimulation activates divergent pathways</title><p>Spinal stimulations at both rostral and caudal sites induced facilitation and suppression effects to extensive upper-limb muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In addition to divergent innervations from afferent fibers at a distant stimulation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Fyffe, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and Fyffe, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ishizuka et al., 1979</xref>), muscle responses in the caudally innervated muscles from rostral sites are thought to be generated via descending pathways in the dorsolateral funiculus, such as corticospinal and rubrospinal pathways, as well as descending propriospinal tracts. Muscle responses in rostrally innervated muscles from caudal sites are produced via ascending pathways, such as the spinocerebellar pathway, dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, and ascending propriospinal tracts. However, muscles innervated by motoneurons located near the stimulation site produced larger magnitudes of muscle responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, left, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), indicating that the motor nucleus for each muscle is innervated dominantly by adjacent afferent fibers rather than distant ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 1978</xref>).</p><p>Stimulations at most stimulus sites showed that the PDs for facilitation and suppression effects were similar to those for background EMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). The correspondence in the PDs between the stimulus-induced muscle response and background EMGs indicates that changes in the amount of voluntary descending commands principally account for the torque direction-dependent modulation in the evoked muscle response. Such change in the evoked muscle response suggests that spinal stimulation produced trans-synaptic inputs to motoneurons that can be spatiotemporally summated by voluntary descending inputs. However, an exception was observed in some cases of rostrally innervated muscles that showed facilitation effects. The Spinal PDs for facilitation in the rostrally innervated muscles from caudal sites were opposite to those for background EMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, bottom-left panel). The magnitude of these responses was quite small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, left panel), but this feature of responses was similar to the response at higher current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, lower panel). These results suggest that some motoneurons of rostrally innervated muscles may not receive excitatory ascending inputs from afferents of the caudal part of the spinal site. Although there is a considerable distance between them, current targeting to the caudal site might spread to ventral roots of rostrally innervated muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for clinical application</title><p>In general, an advantage of spinal stimulation is that a single electrode produces facilitation and suppression effects on synergistic muscle groups in multi-joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nishimura et al., 2013</xref>), which is different from neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Since NMES activates the motor end plates or muscle fibers directly, muscular contraction is accomplished with an inverted recruitment order that large diameter muscle fibers are preferentially activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McNeal, 1976</xref>), leading to rapid fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prochazka, 1993</xref>). In contrast, spinal stimulation at an appropriate current recruited motoneurons trans-synaptically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) via afferent fibers, so that motoneurons are activated in a natural recruitment order, which, in turn, reduces fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bamford et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Since our study aimed to capture fundamental characteristics of descending commands on motor outputs to spinal stimulation, we used single pulses for spinal stimulation and investigated their muscle responses during voluntary motor task, instead of high frequency stimulation which has been used for therapeutic spinal stimulation. Using single pulse stimulation, we were able to characterize suppressive effects on muscle responses and joint torque that were obtained when motoneurons were voluntarily preactivated. An important finding demonstrated in the present study is that the current of 150–1350 μA in the range where excitation and inhibition coordinated induces appropriate effects to enhance descending commands and functions of spinal circuits, thus, boost torque production in a direction corresponding with the direction of voluntary torque production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). On the other hand, regardless of the directions of voluntary torque production, lower-current (&lt;150 μA) stimulation suppressed torque, and higher-current (≥1350 μA) stimulation induced stereotypical torque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), indicating that the induced torques at these current intensities interfere with voluntary commands. Thus, careful selection of current intensity is necessary to enhance voluntary torque production. We believe that our findings obtained in intact animals may be applicable to individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury or stroke in which the function of spinal circuits and descending pathways are preserved. In future studies, the current intensity that produces balanced excitation and inhibition for spinal stimulation should be used to compensate the weakened descending commands and restore impaired upper limb motor functions after damage to descending pathways.</p><p>Epidural stimulation of the spinal cord has been commonly used in the treatment for chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Epstein and Palmieri, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Compton et al., 2012</xref>), and there is increasing interest in further applications for the restoration and/or rehabilitation of motor functions after damage in descending pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angeli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harkema et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capogrosso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Courtine et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van den Brand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wenger et al., 2016</xref>). Subdural electrodes are more invasive than epidural electrodes but have the advantage of selectively activating a specific group of spinal motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sharpe and Jackson, 2014</xref>). Therefore, subdural stimulation may be beneficial to restore dexterous hand control which requires independent control of muscles and fingers. However, the effectiveness of subdural stimulation in controlling dexterous hand movements and the long-term stability of motor output needs to be determined in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The experiments were performed using two male Japanese macaque monkeys (<italic>Macaca fuscata</italic>; monkey H, weight 8.1 kg; monkey W, weight 4.9 kg).

Throughout the experiments, the monkeys were housed in individual cages at an ambient temperature of 23–26°C and a 12 hr on/off light cycle. The animals were fed regularly with diet pellets and had free access to water. They were monitored closely, and animal welfare was assessed on a daily basis or, if necessary, several times a day.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Surgery</title><p>All surgeries were performed under sterile conditions and general anesthesia, starting with a combination of intramuscular injections of ketamine (5 mg/kg) and xylazine (0.5 mg/kg), followed by intubation and isoflurane (1–2%) inhalation to maintain anesthesia throughout surgery. During surgery, vital signs were carefully monitored, including respiratory/circulatory parameters (respiratory rate, inspiratory carbon dioxide concentration, saturation of percutaneous oxygen, and heart rate) and body temperature. There was no evidence of tachycardia or tachypnea during surgical procedures and no major deviation in the heart or respiratory rate in response to noxious stimuli. The absence of reflexive movements to noxious stimuli and a corneal reflex was also used to verify the level of anesthesia. Ceftriaxone (20 mg/kg) and ketoprofen (2 mg/kg) were administered preoperatively and postoperatively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgery to place a subdural electrode array on the spinal cord</title><p>We chronically implanted a platinum subdural electrode array (Unique Medical Corporation, Tokyo, Japan; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) over the dorsal-lateral aspect of the cervical enlargement on right side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) corresponding to the hand performing the task. A subdural electrode array with seven channels was implanted in monkey H over the rostral C6 to caudal T1 region. A subdural electrode array with six channels was implanted in monkey W over the caudal C6 to rostral T2 region. The electrodes had a diameter of 1 mm and a center-to-center inter-electrode distance of 3 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A silver plate (3×2 mm) placed on spinal vertebra was used as a reference electrode. In both monkeys, laminectomy was performed on the C7 vertebra, and the lamina and dorsal spinous process of C7 were removed. An incision was made in the dura mater under the C7 vertebra. In monkey W, laminectomy was also performed on the C4 vertebra, and an incision was made in the dura mater under the C4 vertebra. The subdural electrode array was slid into the subdural space from the caudal incision site on C7 vertebra level and placed over the dorsal-lateral aspect of the C6-T2 spinal segments on the right side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The electrode array was bonded with cyanoacrylate glue to the spinal surfaces at each laminectomy point. The wires from the electrodes were routed into a silicone tube, which was glued with dental acrylic to bone screws placed in T1 spinal process, and routed toward the monkey’s head to a connector. The laminectomy was covered with gelatin, and a reference electrode was inserted into the space between the dorsal cervical vertebrae and back muscles.

In both monkeys, wires were implanted in the following 16 muscles: three elbow muscles (BB, BR, and Triceps), six wrist muscles (PT, FCR, PL, FCU, ECU, and ECR), five digit muscles (FDS, FDP, EDC, ED4, 5, and APL), and two intrinsic hand muscles (ADP and ADM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral task</title><p>Prior to the surgeries, the monkeys were trained to perform an isometric, 2D, eight-target wrist torque tracking task. The monkeys controlled the 2D position of a cursor on a video monitor with four-directional wrist torques: flexion, extension, ulnar flexion, and radial flexion. The cursor was adjusted to the center of eight peripheral targets when the wrist torques were neutral. When the cursor stayed on the center position for 0.8 s, one of the eight cursors appeared as a go-cue instruction. Then, the monkey was required to maintain torque within the target for 0.7–0.8 s to receive a juice reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Each of eight targets was presented in randomized order.

Each stimulus train was delivered with an interval of 1000 ms. The evoked movements and muscle twitches were detected by visual inspection and further monitored by direct muscle palpation. The movement threshold was defined as the minimum current at which the evoked muscle twitch was observed by visual inspection. Additional doses of ketamine were given as needed to eliminate spontaneous movements during the recording sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data collection</title><p>During the experiments, the trigger pulses of stimulation, EMGs recorded from the implanted wires into muscles, and task parameters, such as target positions, timing trial events, and wrist torques (torque X, flexion-extension; torque Y, radial-ulnar), were recorded simultaneously using a Cerebus multichannel data acquisition system (Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) at a sampling rate of 2 kHz. The EMGs were bandpass filtered at 5–1000 Hz for offline analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>StTA of rectified EMGs</title><p>Muscle responses were investigated using the StTA of rectified EMGs at each current intensity and stimulus site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheney et al., 1985b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheney and Fetz, 1985a</xref>). The StTA of rectified EMGs depicts both facilitative and suppressive effects induced by stimulation. The averages of rectified EMG data were compiled over a 100 ms period (30 ms before the trigger to 70 ms after). To avoid contamination by stimulus artifacts, EMG signals for 0–2 ms after stimulation were excluded for analyses. Mean baseline activity and SD were measured from EMGs in the period from 30 to 10 ms preceding the stimulus trigger pulse. The significant stimulus-evoked facilitative (Facilitation) or suppressive (Suppression) effects were detected as sustained features (total duration of ≥1 ms) above or below 3 SD from the mean baseline, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Onset latency was defined as the beginning of the Facilitation or Suppression effects. The magnitude of the PStEs was quantified as the area above or below 3 SD from the mean baseline (red and blue hatched areas on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). PStEs typically showed an intermixture of Facilitation and Suppression at different latency in a single muscle (e.g. Facilitation followed by Suppression [first row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>] or Suppression followed by Facilitation [fourth row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>]). The present analyses focused on the first PStE, which appeared in shorter latency. Therefore, PStE induced by spinal stimulation showed either Facilitation or Suppression effect for the result of each StTA. When both Facilitation and Suppression were obtained from a single muscle (i.e. PStEs for Facilitation and Suppression changed by directions of voluntary torques), a dominant effect, which is determined by the comparison between the sums of each PStE for the eight target locations, was indicated with a plus symbol. PStEs were collected from a total of 1008 muscular conditions (Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A single muscular condition was defined as the result of PStEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) or torques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) observed from a single muscle in an experiment. For example, when PStEs for the eight-target locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) or PStEs for five different levels of background EMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) from a single muscle were produced, the result of 8-PStE or 5-PStE corresponded to one muscular condition.

The vector of PD was then calculated from this shuffled data. This process was repeated 1000 times, and the distribution of the angle of the PD vector was sorted by rank. The significance of PD angles for the background EMG and PStE (Spinal PD) was determined by computing the 95% bootstrap confidence interval (CI) of the sorted angular distribution and comparing with the actual angular data. A PD angle was significant if the actual angle fell outside the 95% CI of the distribution of bootstrapped angular data (p&lt;0.05). To investigate absolute differences between the PD of background EMG and the Spinal PD, the Spinal PD angle was normalized by subtracting the PD of background EMG (Normalized Spinal PD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Relationship between the magnitude of PStEs and the background EMGs</title><p>To investigate the relationship between the magnitudes of the background EMGs and PStEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), we classified individual peristimulus muscle activity into five different levels based on the magnitudes of background EMGs.

Mean baseline and SD were measured from the subtracted torque data in the period from 30 to 10 ms preceding the stimulus trigger pulse. The significant induced torques (Evoked Torque) were detected when the torque in either the flexion-extension or radial-ulnar direction or both were 10 SD above or below the mean baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

If the muscular condition induced both Facilitation and Suppression (i.e. PStEs changed by movement directions), the PD of background EMG was included into both the background EMG PDs of Facilitation and Suppression. To test whether distributions of Spinal PD, PD of background EMG, and directions of Evoked Torque showed any directional preference, we used Rayleigh test for uniformity of the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Tuning of motor outputs produced by spinal stimulation during voluntary control of torque directions in monkeys&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tamar Makin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Santosh Chandrasekaran (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers highly encourage the authors to include latency data (excitatory, inhibitory, and at high current intensities), as this is essential for the interpretation of the results. We hope this should be straightforward to include. The reviewers also all agreed that it would be useful to include examples and discussion of evoked responses during awake rest. If these data are available, they would substantially strengthen the results and interpretation of the manuscript.</p><p>In addition, there is a range of specific suggestions from the three reviewers to improve the clarity and readability of the manuscript. These are specific points and full reviews are listed below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper is densely written but readable. The main conclusions are supported adequately.</p><p>Several general points can improve the presentation:</p><p>The possible differences between subdural and epidural stimulation regimes are not adequately discussed in the evaluation of the results in the broader context. Similarly, the discussion should provide more discussion of the meaning of the data here and limitations in the context of e.g., incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) or discomplete SCI. In contexts after injury with variable descending modulatory controls, will the intact mechanisms here transfer? For example, could the stimulation after SCI ever worsen the quality of voluntary control through residual surviving pathways?</p><p>It would be very useful to supply an analysis of the distributions of latency of the inhibitory effects and excitatory effects: (1) all inhibitory or excitatory together, or (2) broken out by response type (E, I, E/I +/-). Also please discuss does latency vary much with stimulus strength? These statistics would add further information to the data here and help readers interpret some aspects.</p><p>The term 'conditions' is used repeatedly but is not well-defined. This term should be defined and used in a more precise way. (see lines 125, 138).</p><p>The term Spinal stim refers I think to the anesthetized experiment but should be better defined and qualified.</p><p>It would be useful in the section starting on Line 189 to create a plot of angular deviation of directional tuning from say a direction at 200uA and how this deviation and its variance changes with stimulation intensity. Presumably, there is a trade-off between the deviation and strength of effect which would in clinical conditions be important.</p><p>The term optimization is used a lot but this is not really correct. There is no optimization. Better would be 'range of balanced excitation and inhibition' or some such terminology.</p><p>A 'V-test' is mentioned at the end of methods but never described or citation provided and the term is highly ambiguous and needs clarifying.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>The main result seems more consistent with stimulus amplifying the voluntary control, or else voluntary control both amplifying and shaping the stimulation effect. The sentence:</p><p>&quot;Here, we show that descending commands amplify stimulus-evoked joint torque and the function of intraspinal elements.&quot; Does not capture completely accurately my understanding of the results.</p><p>Lines 37-42: It is important to clearly distinguish ISMS and supraspinal stimulation literature here, since the access and recruitment selectivity may be very different.</p><p>Bizzi, Mussa-Ivaldi and Giszter, Science 1991, Giszter Mussa-Ivaldi and Bizzi, J Neurosci 1993 and Mussa-Ivaldi, Giszter and Bizzi PNAS 1994 should likely be added to Loeb 1993 for spinal. Also Lemay and Grill, J Neurophys 2004l,</p><p>Line 44-45 In relation to the conclusion in this sentence, it is likely important to note that both Mussa-Ivaldi et al. 1994 and Lemay and Grill 2004 showed winner-take-all effects of stimulation in some instances, likely a strong indicator of inhibition mechanisms, although at points well above the drive to motor pools.</p><p>Line 52 -53 The Sharma and Shah J Physiol 2021 cervical spinal stimulation study in rats should be cited here or lines 60-61.</p><p>Line 63 the differences possible in subdural versus epidural stimulation regimes needs to be elaborated here or in discussion.</p><p>Line 76 rootlets (plural).</p><p>Line 88-89 Please also supply the current level here.</p><p>Line 178 Legend Part D:</p><p>&quot;Distributions of the PDs for PStEs (Spinal PD, top panels), PDs for background</p><p>EMGs that induced PStEs (Background EMG PD, middle panels) and normalized PDs for PStEs (Normalized Spinal PD, bottom panels).&quot; This is not very clear and should be unpacked.</p><p>Line 275 two different rostral and caudal sites??

Similarly, the discussion should provide more discussion of the meaning of the data here and limitations in the context of e.g., incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) or discomplete SCI. In contexts after injury with variable descending modulatory controls, will the intact mechanisms here transfer? For example, could the stimulation after SCI ever worsen the quality of voluntary control through residual surviving pathways?</p></disp-quote><p>We added discussion about the differences between subdural and epidural stimulation (lines 742-752) and the implication of our data and the limitations of spinal stimulation in patients with incomplete SCI in the Discussion section as follows (lines 722-741):</p><p>Lines 742-752</p><p>“Epidural stimulation of the spinal cord has been commonly used in the treatment for chronic pain (Epstein and Palmieri 2012, Compton et al. 2012), and there is increasing interest in further applications for the restoration and/or rehabilitation of motor functions after damage in descending pathways (Angeli et al., 2018; Gill et al., 2018; Harkema et al., 2011; Wagner et al., 2018; Barra et al., 2022; Capogrosso et al., 2016; Courtine et al., 2009; Van Den Brand et al., 2012; Wenger et al., 2016). Subdural electrodes are more invasive than epidural electrodes, but have the advantage of selectively activating a specific group of spinal motoneurons (Sharpe and Jackson, 2014). Therefore, subdural stimulation may be beneficial to restore dexterous hand control which requires independent control of muscles and fingers. However, the effectiveness of subdural stimulation in controlling dexterous hand movements and the long-term stability of motor output need to be determined in future studies.”</p><p>Lines 722-741</p><p>“Since our study aimed to capture fundamental characteristics of descending commands on motor outputs to spinal stimulation, we used single pulses for spinal stimulation and investigated their muscle responses during voluntary motor task, instead of high frequency stimulation which has been used for therapeutic spinal stimulation. Using single pulse stimulation, we were able to characterize suppressive effects on muscle responses and joint torque that were obtained when motoneurons were voluntarily preactivated. An important finding demonstrated in the present study is that the current of 150-1350 μA in the range where excitation and inhibition coordinated induces appropriate effects to enhance descending commands and functions of spinal circuits, thus, boost torque production in a direction corresponding with the direction of voluntary torque production (Figure 7). On the other hand, regardless of the directions of voluntary torque production, lower-current (&lt; 150 μA) stimulation suppressed torque and higher-current (≥ 1350 μA) stimulation induced stereotypical torque (Figure 7), indicating that the induced torques at these current intensities interfere with voluntary commands. Thus, careful selection of current intensity is necessary to enhance voluntary torque production. We believe that our findings obtained in intact animals may be applicable to individuals with incomplete SCI or stroke in which the function of spinal circuits and descending pathways are preserved. In future studies, the current intensity that produces balanced excitation and inhibition for spinal stimulation should be used to compensate the weakened descending commands and restore impaired upper limb motor functions after damage to descending pathways.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be very useful to supply an analysis of the distributions of latency of the inhibitory effects and excitatory effects: (1) all inhibitory or excitatory together, or (2) broken out by response type (E, I, E/I +/-).

Population data in Figure 8D shows the distributions of onset latencies of PStEs at four different current intensities during the hold period for the peripheral targets. The median onset latency of Facilitation effects was shorter than that of Suppression effects at all current intensities.

The inhibitory influence mediated by presynaptic mechanisms (Eccles et al., 1961, 1962; Rudomin and Schmidt, 1999) are known to act on afferents, but not corticospinal inputs to motoneurons (Jackson et al., 2006).

Stimulation at 50 Hz would not have provided such a fundamental feature of motor output induced by spinal stimulation. We agree with the reviewer's opinion that therapeutic spinal stimulation is often delivered at 50 Hz. Thus, the spinal stimulation at higher frequency should be investigated in future studies to explore the therapeutic effect of spinal stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors do not state how many trials were performed per current level?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a summary of the collected data as Table 1 and 2 in Supplementary File 1. Also, we added the number of trials performed in experiments in the Materials and methods section as described below. Please refer the response to your 1st comment as well.</p><p>Lines: 823-824</p><p>“Each experiment consisted of 63-1004 successful trials (Table 2 in Supplementary File 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were these results tested for stability across days?</p></disp-quote><p>It took many days to get our data with various stimulus conditions as described in the response to your previous comments. Therefore, we did not test the motor outputs to spinal stimulation in the same stimulus condition across days. To investigate the stability of motor outputs, another study will be needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that voluntarily evoked activity could vary based on factors such as motivation, how does that affect the efficacy of spinal stimulation?</p></disp-quote><p>We used a juice reward to maintain the animals' motivation while they performed the task. Animals were required to maintain torque within the target for 0.7-0.8 s to receive a juice reward and were trained in this task for over 7 months. Finally, we collected data only from successful trials while the animals' motivation was maintained.</p><p>Although Reviewer 2 raised this very interesting question, the current study was not designed to investigate the factor of motivation on muscle responses by spinal stimulation. Our study on the motivational control of motor output, published in J Physiology (Suzuki et al., 2021), may provide some insight into your question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors discuss the results in relation to polysynaptic inhibition and monosynaptic excitation that are present in the spinal circuits. I would highly encourage the authors to cite Guiho et al., JNE 2021 which proposes a potential novel model of spinal circuitry, and include it in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We cited this paper for additional discussion as follows:</p><p>Lines 588-593</p><p>“In line with these considerations, Guiho et al. (2021) recently proposed a model of spinal circuitry driven by spinal electrical stimulation. In their model, the discharges of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons elicited by spinal stimulation are assumed to be integrated into motoneuron activity receiving corticospinal drives. The current study extends this model so that the voluntary descending commands are integrated with afferent inputs at spinal interneurons as well as motoneurons.”</p><p>Added citation</p><p>Guiho T, Baker SN, Jackson A. 2021.

Some modifications to the figures and text could help to improve clarity:</p><p>1. In most figures, the PD vector uses the same color and line width as the rest of the polar plot. It would be helpful to highlight the PD vector by making the line thicker or a slightly different color.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the color and thickness of the PD vectors in Figures 2D, 3E, 4G, 4H, and 7F to highlight the vectors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is not currently clear how different levels of background EMG activity were achieved. Were the monkeys trained to vary this activity level or were these differences analyzed post hoc based on the activity they happened to produce during various trials?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s latter interpretation is correct. We did not prepare the task in which the monkey had to produce different magnitudes of wrist torque to track the target. We classified individual stimulus data based on the pre-stimulus background EMG level throughout the experiments. We added a description how different levels of background EMG activity were achieved in the Results section.</p><p>Lines 354-356</p><p>“EMG activity obtained from the 8-directional task was divided into 5 different levels of background EMGs for analysis, and PStEs were shown based on the magnitudes of background EMG (Figure 5A-C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The descriptions of Figure 7 are confusing (e.g. center of peripheral panels, outer peripheral panels).
