One of the largest risks bees face is poisoning of floral nectar and pollen by insecticides. Studies of bee detection of neonicotinoids have reported contradictory evidence about whether bees can taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and hence avoid them. Here, we use an assay for the detection of food aversion combined with single-sensillum electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of the buff-tailed bumblebee (<italic>Bombus terrestris</italic>) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape (<italic>Brassica napus</italic>). Bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing concentrations of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, or sulfoxaflor spanning six orders of magnitude, even when these solutions contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons through a slight reduction in firing rate or change in the rate of adaptation. These data provide strong evidence that bumblebees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using information from their mouthparts. As bees rarely contact floral nectar with other body parts, we predict that they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bees and other pollinators often encounter pesticides while collecting nectar and pollen from agricultural crops. Widely used to protect crops, pesticides are toxic to insects and have contributed to population declines in all bee species.</p><p>One way that bees might be able to avoid pesticides is using their incredibly good sense of taste, which can detect subtle differences between sugary solutions. Therefore, if pesticides taste bitter to them, bumblebees may be able to avoid feeding treated crops. However, it was not clear if bees can taste pesticides. Previous studies investigating whether they can taste a group of pesticides called “neonicotinoids” gave contradictory results. Furthermore, explicit behavioural tests of their ability to taste pesticides had not been performed.</p><p>To shed light on this, Parkinson et al. compared the responses of neurons within structures used for detecting taste in bumblees eating a pure sugar solution with those eating a solution containing pesticides. Experiments with a group of pesticides known as ‘cholinergic’ showed that neuron responses were the same whether the sugar solution contained pesticides or not. Secondly, by looking at bumblebee feeding behaviour, Parkinson et al. found that bees offered both pure and pesticide-laced sugar solutions would still drink the pesticide solution, even when it was toxic enough to make them very ill or kill them. This was the case regardless of which pesticide was used.</p><p>The experiments showed that bumblebees cannot use their sense of taste to avoid drinking pesticide-laced nectar, which is an important finding for policymakers making decisions about the use of pesticides on agricultural crops. It is possible that bees simply have a poor sense of bitter taste. However, in the future, these methods could be used to identify a compound that tastes bad to bees. Including such a compound in pesticides, could deter bees from feeding on pesticide-treated crops that do not require pollination, and help to restore their declining populations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bee</kwd><kwd>pesticide</kwd><kwd>neonicotinoid</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>gustation</kwd><kwd>taste</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S000402/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wright</surname><given-names>Geraldine A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIF/R1/19368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parkinson</surname><given-names>Rachel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PDF-546125-2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parkinson</surname><given-names>Rachel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bees are at risk of consuming harmful pesticides found in nectar because they cannot detect them using their mouthparts.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insect pollination is a critical ecosystem service. The most economically valuable pollinators are bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calderone, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garibaldi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang and An, 2018</xref>), especially domesticated bees that secure crop yield and quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meehan et al., 2011</xref>). In agricultural ecosystems, however, insecticides are widely used to protect crop yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 2007</xref>). Using insecticides impacts the health and survival of bees, contributing to the recent population declines of all bee species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goulson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Potts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Van der Sluijs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vanbergen et al., 2013</xref>). Hundreds of studies have shown that exposure to sublethal concentrations of neonicotinoid pesticides (i.e. imidacloprid, IMD, thiamethoxam, TMX, and clothianidin, CLO) in food impairs foraging behaviour, homing and orientation behaviour, and olfactory learning and memory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parkinson et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schneider et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Williamson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wright et al., 2015</xref>). Most studies administer pesticides in sugar solutions; bees consume the solution, and then a change in behaviour or performance is recorded. If bees could detect and avoid pesticides in food, however, these substances could be used to defend crops against pests without risk to bees. Only a few have explicitly tested whether bees can taste and avoid neonicotinoid pesticides in nectar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arce et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kessler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muth et al., 2020</xref>), but the conclusions of these studies are contradictory. In addition, other compounds that affect cholinergic signalling in the insect nervous system, such as sulfoxaflor, have been proposed as alternatives to neonicotinoids, but whether or not these compounds can be detected by the bee’s sense of taste has not previously been tested.</p><p>Insects detect non-volatile compounds (i.e. tastants) through activation of GRNs in contact chemosensilla on mouthparts, antennae, and tarsi which express receptor proteins that bind with specific types of ligands (e.g. sugars, non-nutrient ‘bitter’ compounds, salts, etc.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wright, 2016</xref>). When a taste receptor binds with its ligand, this sets off a signal transduction cascade that results in depolarisation of the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dethier, 1976</xref>). For example, several types of receptors tuned to bitter substances are expressed in a specialized subset of GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>). When these GRNs spike in response to stimulation, feeding reflexes are inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">French et al., 2015</xref>). Bitter compound detection is also accomplished by the inactivation of sugar-sensing GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">French et al., 2015</xref>). For compounds which are potentially toxic, simultaneous activation of GRNs that directly inhibit feeding reflexes and silencing of GRNs that activate feeding make it possible to form a rapid response in reaction to contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wright, 2016</xref>). Thus, we expected that if bees could detect neonicotinoids as bitter compounds, we would see activation of bitter-sensing GRNs and/or inactivation of sugar-sensing GRNs. Previously, we observed that stimulation of the mouthpart’s galeal sensilla with neonicotinoids in water did not elicit spikes from any GRNs, nor did we see a reduction in the rate of firing of sugar-sensing GRNs in the sensilla when stimulated with a mixture of sucrose and neonicotinoid compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kessler et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In a two choice assay, we unexpectedly found that when bees were given a choice between sucrose solution and sucrose containing field-relevant doses of IMD and TMX over a 24 hr period, the bees choose the neonicotinoid solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kessler et al., 2015</xref>). This could indicate that bees find neonicotinoid pesticides phagostimulatory, like sugars. However, we also failed to find evidence that neonicotinoid pesticides in water elicited spikes in any galeal GRNs including the nutrient/sugar sensing neurons. For this reason, we concluded that bees could not taste neonicotinoids in nectar or on their own in water. This conclusion, however, has been challenged by a study in free-flying <italic>B. terrestris</italic> foragers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arce et al., 2018</xref>). They found that free-flying bumblebees preferred specific concentrations of solutions laced with TMX, but only after a period of at least 10 days of feeding on the solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arce et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, the location of the solutions was randomised, forcing a choice at the point of feeding. These authors concluded that the only way bees could solve this problem was if they used their sense of taste to identify the preferred solution, arguing that further work needed to be done to identify the mechanism for sensation. Subsequently, however, another study in a different species of bumblebees (<italic>B. impatiens</italic>) using methods similar to ours reported that bees are neither attracted nor deterred from consuming sugar solutions containing neonicotinoids, consistent with the idea that they cannot detect the pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muth et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, whether or not bumblebees can taste neonicotinoids in food remains unresolved.</p><p>Bees have highly specialized mechanisms for encoding sugars which are different to those reported for any other insect species. For example, in bumblebee galeal sensilla, stimulation with sugars produces coherent spiking in 2 GRNs which burst in response to stimulation with high-value saccharide compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miriyala et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkinson et al., 2022b</xref>). We recently discovered that bumblebees also highly value the monosaccharide, fructose, and have a GRN tuned to detect it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkinson et al., 2022b</xref>). It is possible that changes to the burst pattern of firing could indicate that the presence of a compound such as a neonicotinoid in food. Furthermore, the type of sugar used to stimulate the sensilla could influence whether bees could taste neonicotinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkinson et al., 2022b</xref>). We also know that the labial palps are critical to toxin detection in other insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapman and Sword, 1993</xref>), and could house additional GRNs sensitive to bitter compounds like pesticides. Our previous work on neonicotinoid taste used sucrose to stimulate the galeal sensilla and did not analyse how pesticides might alter the burst structure of the galeal GRN response to sugars or test the labial palps. Clearly, deeper investigations could determine whether the mouthparts GRNs possess novel gustatory mechanisms for pesticide detection and provide critical information about the risk to bees of consuming the nectar of pesticide-defended crops in the field. They would also elucidate novel mechanisms for the detection of bitter compounds.</p><p>Here, we use a combination of sensitive behavioural assays and electrophysiology to test in detail whether bumblebee mouthparts have mechanisms to detect pesticides in nectar. Feeding assays using freely moving foragers make it possible to assess if bees detect and avoid potential toxins in food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). To definitively test whether bumblebees detect neonicotinoids on their mouthparts, we quantified the structure of feeding when the mouthparts of freely-moving bumblebees (<italic>B. terrestris</italic>) were stimulated with nectar-like solutions containing pesticides over a 2 min period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). We specifically tested a mixture of primarily fructose and glucose that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape (<italic>Brassica napus</italic>) with field-relevant concentrations of neonicotinoids. In addition, we comprehensively tested these solutions on the gustatory receptor neurons in the A-type sensilla on the galea and the labial palps of the bees’ mouthparts using electrophysiology to determine whether sensilla in multiple locations are able to detect neonicotinoids (IMD, CLO, and TMX) and the previously untested sulfoxamine pesticide, sulfoxaflor (SFX). The burst-spiking of the galeal GRNs was analysed for changes to structure and compared to the GRN response to the bitter compound, quinine (QUI), which has been reported previously to be a feeding deterrent to bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wright et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sugar solution composition is encoded by GRNs</title><p>Responses of bumblebee galeal GRNs to individual sugar compounds have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miriyala et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkinson et al., 2022b</xref>). Here, we tested whether a mixture of fructose, glucose, and negligible amounts of sucrose that mimics OSR nectar altered the GRN spiking responses compared to sucrose alone. We also expanded our investigation to include responses form GRNs in the labial palps, and tested A- and B-type sensilla on the labial palps and galea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that GRNs in each location had specific patterns of activation that characterised their responses to sugar stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Stimulation of galeal sensilla with sucrose or with OSR nectar produced bursts of spikes resulting from the co-activation of two GRNs (Gal1 and Gal2), as we found for individual sugars previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miriyala et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkinson et al., 2022b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Each labial palp sensillum (LP<sub>III</sub> and LP<sub>IV</sub>) contained two sugar-sensitive GRNs (LP<sub>III</sub> 1 and 2, LP<sub>IV</sub> 1 and 2), but these GRNs exhibited tonic firing patterns in response to stimulation instead of bursts of spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The spiking rates averaged over 1 s stimulation of Gal1 and the labial palp GRNs were unchanged towards the two stimuli, but the average rate of Gal2 and Gal3 when stimulated with sucrose was lower than the rate for stimulation with 10% OSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, LME, stimulus*GRN <italic>F<sub>6,1607</sub></italic>=9.16, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001).

We verified that bees do not have mechanisms on their mouthparts that enable them to taste neonicotinoids or sulfoxaflor when these compounds are present in nectar. Neonicotinoids and sulfoxaflor did not change the bursting of sugar-sensing neurons in the galea, nor did they elicit or inhibit spikes in labial palp neurons. Strikingly, we show that bumblebees do not avoid drinking OSR nectar solutions even when very high concentrations of common pesticides are present. Very high concentrations of these pesticides could produce a small but measurable reduction in the spiking of sugar-sensing GRNs, but these compounds never elicited spikes on their own. What’s more, these small changes in the rate of spiking did not translate into features that the clustering algorithm could use to differentiate pesticide laced stimuli from the control OSR solution. From these data, we conclude that the buff-tailed bumblebee’s mouthparts do not have mechanisms for the detection and avoidance of common cholinergic pesticides in nectar.</p><p>In the present experiments, we expected that if neonicotinoids and sulfoxaflor could be tasted by bees, they would exhibit the same responses in GRNs produced by other non-nutrient compounds (i.e. bitter responses). For this reason, we were mainly testing for the reduction of GRN spiking caused by the suppression of sugar-sensing GRNs, as all of the ‘bitter’ compounds we tested were presented to the sensilla in OSR nectar (a mixture of primarily fructose and glucose). The known bitter compound, QUI, clearly suppressed the activity of sugar-sensing GRNs in both labial palps and the galea, but it did not measurably alter the burst pattern of firing of the galeal GRNs. Importantly, our new data were able to confirm that field-relevant concentrations of pesticides did not significantly alter the pattern or rate of spiking of galeal or labial palp GRNs towards a nectar solution.</p><p>We used a clustering algorithm that integrated input from all the sensilla we recorded from over a 1 s time interval with every stimulus to identify whether population-level input made it possible to differentiate the stimuli. Although we were able to measure small but significant reduction in the responses of both labial palp and galeal neurons caused by the high concentrations (100 µM) of IMD, SFX, and TMX, this effect was not sufficient for the clustering algorithm to form classes of distinct stimuli for the OSR-pesticide mixtures. This is similar to what we observed for 0.1 mM QUI; although a small change in firing was detected, the clustering algorithm did not differentiate it from OSR. It is worth noting that the OSR background solutions in both cases were different: in the behavioural experiments the concentration of OSR was an average value of that naturally found in nectar. Our physiology experiments were performed using a 10% dilution of this solution. Different solutions were used because it was not possible to record from neurons with such a concentrated sugar solution, and in behavioural experiments, most bumblebees do not find 10% OSR sufficiently phagostimulatory to feed.</p><p>Our electrophysiological recordings are the first to report GRN responses from the bumblebee’s labial palps. The labial palps in other insects such as locusts are used to detect both phagostimulants and deterrant compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blaney and Chapman, 1970</xref>), so we might have rationally expected to observe labial palp GRNs that spike in response to QUI and cholinergic pesticides, but we did not. This could indicate that on the mouthparts, bitter compounds are only detected through the suppression of sugar-sensing GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Brito Sanchez et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that in the case of all bitter compounds tested, the output of the clustering algorithm matched the behaviour of the bees, as the bees did not reject any of the pesticide solutions or the 0.1 mM QUI solution after the first feeding bout. This could indicate that that small differences detected at the sensory periphery do not translate into a sufficient signal across the whole population of gustatory neurons to produce an aversion to foods containing potential toxins. Bumblebees did drink less overall of the 0.1 mM QUI solution compared to OSR, however the amount of time they spent in contact with the feeding solution was the same. This suggests that, while 0.1 mM QUI is not immediately aversive to bumblebees (i.e. by taste), they can integrate negative post-ingestive feedback within a 2-min feeding period. Compounds reach the hemolymph of honeybees within 30 s of ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simcock et al., 2018</xref>), and quinine causes malaise-like symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayestaran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurst et al., 2014</xref>), so it is feasible that the bumblebees in our behavioural assay factored in post-ingestive feedback while consuming 0.1 mM QUI. Unfortunately, when fed high concentrations of pesticides, post-ingestive feedback did not prevent bumblebees from consuming potentially lethal doses. For example, the LD50 for TMX in <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic> is approximately 6 ng/bee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Siviter et al., 2022</xref>), and bumblebees in our assay consumed a median amount of 3.5 ng of TMX when dissolved at 100 uM in OSR.</p><p>Our data also indicate that gustatory coding is more than the presence or absence of spikes arising from GRNs tuned to detect particular tastants. In bumblebees, it is clear that the pattern of spiking itself conveys information which is a feature that enables the brain to distinguish gustatory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkinson et al., 2022b</xref>). This supports the idea that encoding of gustatory stimuli is accomplished by the whole population of GRNs on a given body part (e.g. the proboscis) as was observed in multichannel recordings from the adult hawkmoth maxillary nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reiter et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, activity across the mouthparts GRN population that includes temporal input over time is likely to be used by the brain to differentiate taste stimuli and to facilitate the valuation of food quality. Our new data testing the difference between a nectar stimulus composed of a mixture of sugars (OSR) and sucrose clearly illustrates this. The changes in the rate of bursting and spiking in the galeal and labial palps were sufficient for the clustering algorithm to classify sucrose and OSR as separate stimuli. Although our behavioural assay did not show a difference, we would not expect it to, as it is an assay developed to study food rejection behaviour by bees, not differences in phagostimulation.</p><p>Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arce et al., 2018</xref> reported that <italic>B. terrestris</italic> were capable of selectively foraging on 30% w/v sucrose solutions containing TMX. This finding confirmed our previous data that honeybees and bumblebees prefer solutions containing TMX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kessler et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arce et al., 2018</xref> did not observe a preference for or against the solutions containing the neonicotinoids during the initial days of their experiments. We expect that if taste was the mechanism for the preference, the bees would have shown a preference for the TMX solution within the first foraging bout, similar to the time frame of our behavioural assay in this study (2 min). Instead, the authors found that the preference for the TMX solution developed over time. Similarly, in our previous work, we found that individual bees developed a preference for solutions containing TMX if they were confined to feed on a choice between sucrose and sucrose laced with pesticide over longer time period (i.e. 24 hr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kessler et al., 2015</xref>). We concluded that the preference was caused by the pharmacological action of TMX on cholinergic circuits involved in encoding reward in the insect brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnstedt et al., 2016</xref>), as we found no electrophysiological evidence to support that bees could taste neonicotinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kessler et al., 2015</xref>). This conclusion is consistent with the expectation that a preference resulting from post-ingestive reinforcement caused by amplification of the brain’s response to sugars would be expected to develop following long-term, repeated exposure to a pharmacological compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Palmer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wright et al., 2013</xref>). If TMX caused bees to associate a higher ‘reward value’ with food found in a particular location, they would learn to return to it in preference over other solutions. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arce et al., 2018</xref> switched the feeders between training and testing phases, this may not have been sufficient to rule out the possibility that bees could learn the location of the food within a single feeding bout.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arce et al., 2018</xref> conducted their experiments using gravity feeders in an enclosed arena, allowing bees to consume solutions ad libitum. Since the feeders did not have visual or olfactory cues, the authors inferred that the bees were capable of tasting the TMX in the solution. However, gravity feeders do not simulate how bees feed on real flowers. These feeders have large openings that allow multiple bees to feed simultaneously, enabling them to contact the solution with all body parts, including the tarsi and antennae. While it is possible that the sensilla on the antennae or tarsi could detect TMX, it seems unlikely given that honeybees have limited bitter detection in these locations, only observed when the sensilla are contacted with concentrations of compounds like QUI that are &gt;1 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Brito Sanchez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Brito Sanchez et al., 2014</xref>). The field-relevant concentrations of the pesticides we tested are between 3–6 orders of magnitude lower in concentration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kessler et al., 2015</xref> for review); such dilute concentrations of a bitter compound present in a highly concentrated sugar solution would be difficult for most organisms to detect.</p><p>Floral morphology such as corolla length has often co-evolved with particular groups of pollinators with longer mouthparts; a long corolla protects nectar when visitors are efficient and reliable pollinators. In many flowers, nectar is hidden deep within the corolla such that the only contact that bumblebees have with it is via the distal end of the proboscis (also the location where most of the sensilla are). For example, in OSR flowers, nectaries are located at a depth of 5–8 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cresswell et al., 2001</xref>) and the nectar cannot be contacted otherwise unless the bee bites through the petals. In addition, bees learn to handle flowers quickly to improve their foraging efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heinrich, 1976</xref>) and even extend the proboscis in anticipation of entering the corolla prior to landing. Thus, they are unlikely to contact nectar using gustatory sensilla on their antennae or tarsi while foraging. For this reason, it is likely that nectar palatability is largely determined by the sensilla on the proboscis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bumblebee colonies</title><p>Bumblebee colonies (<italic>Bombus terrestris audax,</italic> Biobest, Westerlo, Belgium) were maintained at laboratory conditions (22–27°C and 35–40% RH) at the University of Oxford and fed ad libitum with the proprietary sugar syrup provided with the colonies (BioGluc, Biobest, Westerlo, Belgium) containing fructose (37.5%), glucose (34.5%), sucrose (25%), maltose (2%), oligosaccharides (1%), and the preservatives potassium sorbate (E202) 0.15% and citric acid (E330) 0.06% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wäckers et al., 2017</xref>).

No solvents are needed at these concentrations as all pesticides used are readily soluble in water at concentrations far exceeding 1 mM. In order to assess field-relevant concentrations of each chemical, a concentration series of each of imidacloprid (IMD, Sigma Aldrich, CAS: 138261-41-3), thiamethoxam (TMX, Sigma Aldrich, CAS: 153719-23-4), clothianidin (CLO, Sigma Aldrich, CAS: 210880-92-5), and sulfoxaflor (SFX, Chem Service, CAS: 946578-00-3) was made via tenfold serial dilution using OSR to produce nectar containing the pesticides at 1000, 100, 10, and 1, and 0 nM (pure OSR). Concentrations of IMD, TMX, and CLO in floral nectar range from 1.3 to 64 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wood and Goulson, 2017</xref>), and SFX can reach concentrations as high as 71.4 μM (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 2014). Additionally, 0.1 mM of each chemical dissolved in OSR was assessed alongside 0.1 mM and 1.0 mM QUI ((-)-Quinine hydrochloride dihydrate, Sigma Aldrich, CAS: 6119-47-7) in OSR, which functioned as positive controls for the effects of a bitter tastant. A concentration of 0.1 mM was chosen for the pesticides as this encompasses the higher range of SFX found in nectar, and allowed us to see if extremely high concentrations of IMD, TMX, and CLO could be detected by bees.

To minimise inclusion of nest bees (i.e. bees that never or rarely forage), only workers with a thorax width &gt;4.0 mm were used in these experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goulson et al., 2002</xref>). In order to motivate the bees to feed during the assay, bees were deprived of food between 3 and 6 hr. Bees were held in individual plastic holding vials at laboratory conditions in total darkness throughout the starvation period. Following the starvation period, individual bees were transferred into a 15 ml falcon tube, modified such that the tip of the tube was removed and a small (10 mm x 20 mm) steel mesh was affixed contiguous with the resulting hole. Bees could extend their proboscis through this hole to reach the feeding solutions, whilst the mesh served as a surface for the bees to grip onto to maintain their position during feeding. The tube was then affixed to a polystyrene holder with dental wax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A 60 mm long, 100 μL glass capillary tube was filled with a test solution and scanned onto a computer at 600 dpi to produce an image from which the start volume could be measured.

This syringe functioned as a pipette bulb to maintain the feeding solution at the tip of the microcapillary. The capillary was held in place in the apparatus via a 1.0 ml modified syringe affixed to a micromanipulator. A DinoLite digital microscope camera (Model AM4815ZT, DinoLite, The Netherlands) was positioned 20 cm above the feeding site where the bees accessed the test solutions. This was connected to a computer and set to record using DinoLite Digital Microscope software (DinoLite, The Netherlands) at a frame rate of 640X480 at ×25 magnification. All feeding behaviour was recorded for later analysis.</p><p>Once a bee was positioned in the apparatus, they were given 3 min to habituate to their environment before the assay began. Following this, bees were encouraged to extend their proboscis by touching the bee’s terminal antennomers with a droplet (~3.5 µL) of 0.5 M sucrose (Sigma Aldrich) dissolved in deionised water. Once the bee extended their proboscis, the droplet was presented to the bees’ mouthparts for them to consume. Each bee was given up to 5 min to extend their proboscis and consume the droplet. Bees that did not do so were removed from the experiment. When the bee finished consuming the droplet, the microcapillary tube containing the test solution was presented to the bees extended mouthparts. The test phase began once the bee’s proboscis contacted the test solution, and the bee was given 2 min to consume the solution. After feeding, microcapillaries were re-scanned to measure the end volume. A sample size of 15 bees per group was pre-determined using a power analysis and the results from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>All experimenters were blind to the experimental treatments.

The number of feeding bouts and their duration can be used to evaluate the phagostimulatory or deterrent activity of the compounds tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). To identify bouts of feeding behaviour, videos were played back at 50% speed and periods of contact between the bees’ mouthparts and the solution were scored using the Noldus Observer (Noldus, the Netherlands).

We recorded from ‘A-type’ sensilla from the galea (Gal), which are known to produce bursting spike trains in response to sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miriyala et al., 2018</xref>) and the third and fourth segments of the labial palps (LP<sub>III</sub> and LP<sub>IV</sub>, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Bumblebees were prepared for electrophysiology as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miriyala et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkinson et al., 2022b</xref>). Briefly, bees were cold-anaesthetised and harnessed with the proboscis extended. The mouthpart nerves were severed by making an incision at the base of the mouthparts to prevent movement. The galea and labial palps were oriented for access to the sensilla using dental wax and wire pins. Sensilla were stimulated for 5 s with a borosilicate (Clark capillary glass 30–066, GC150TF-10) recording electrode (20 µm tip diameter, made with a Narishige PC-10 electrode puller) filled with the test solution. Signals were acquired with a pre-amplifier (TasteProbe; Syntech, Germany), amplified (AC amplifier 1800, A-M Systems, USA), digitised at 30 kHz (DT9803 Data Translation) and stored using DataView (version 11.5).</p><p>Pesticides (IMD, CLO, TMX, SFX) were tested in a background of 10% OSR. Pesticides were tested using a concentration gradient (1, 10, 100, and 1000 nM) and also at 0.1 mM. Additionally, QUI was tested in 10% OSR at concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 mM. A minimum inter-stimulus interval of 3 min was used to prevent sensory adaptation. We obtained recordings from n=12 bee per compound and tested 2–4 sensilla per mouthpart location (6–12 sensilla per bee). To ensure the pesticides or QUI were not imposing a toxic effect on the taste sensilla, we included recordings at the beginning and end of each stimulation series with 10% OSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Solutions were tested in a randomised order and treatments were counterbalanced over time to eliminate any effects of colony age on taste responses. Sample sizes were pre-determined with a power analysis and based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkinson et al., 2022b</xref>).

Briefly, after band-pass filtering (300–2500 Hz, second order butterworth filter) and normalisation, spikes were detected using the peakfinder function with adequate thresholds manually set for each recording. Interspike intervals were used to detect the end of burst positions (EOB). Using this method, we detected three GRNs within the galeal electrophysiological recordings, as seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkinson et al., 2022b</xref>). GRNs of the labial palps were non-bursting, and visual inspection of the data suggested that two GRNs were present in these recordings. The spike waveforms for each recording were compared to differentiate the spikes from the putative units. Waveforms were aligned from the peak +/-2ms, and the Matlab singular value decomposition (SVD) function was used to obtain the principal components of the spike waveforms. Waveforms were then projected onto the space spanned by the first two principal components, and k-means clustering was used to assign the waveforms to units for each recording. Using this method, two (or in some cases just one) GRNs were obtained from each recording, with the unit labelled GRN1 represented by larger waveform amplitudes and higher spike frequencies in response to sugars.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analyses and data presentation</title><p>We performed all further analyses in R version 4.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">R Development Core Team, 2016</xref>). Average firing rates of the 7 GRN types (Gal GRNs 1–3, LP<sub>III</sub> GRNs 1–2, and LP<sub>IV</sub> GRNs 1–2) across mouthpart locations were compared. Firing rates of a given GRN type were averaged across sensilla from a single animal, and log transformed (log<sub>10</sub>(average_rate +1)) to fit a normal distribution. We compared electrophysiological responses across stimuli using linear mixed effects models (LME, lmerTest package) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuznetsova et al., 2017</xref>) with Gaussian distributions and ‘bee ID’ as the random effect (avg_rate ~stimulus*GRN+(1|BeeID)).

Post hoc analyses were performed using estimated marginal means (emmeans package, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lenth et al., 2018</xref>) with Tukey’s adjustment for family-wise error rates. Significant effects were denoted with asterisks (*,&lt;0.05; **&lt;0.001; ***,&lt;0.0001).</p><p>We also assessed the temporal patterns of GRN activity over time. Time series spike data were averaged by animal for a given GRN type, and firing rates were calculated in 0.1 s bins from 0.1 to 1.1 s. Because the labial palp GRNs did not display a bursting pattern, we averaged the firing rate within each bin across all four labial palp GRNs. We assessed the bursting pattern of galeal GRNs (Gal 1 and 2) was assessed using two measures: the burst length (number of Gal1 spikes per burst) and burst rate. We constructed firing rate histograms (firing rate versus time) using these measurements over 1 s of stimulation, and compared stimuli with LME models (temporal_parameter ~stimulus + bin+(1|BeeID)) implemented in the lmerTest package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuznetsova et al., 2017</xref>). We denoted significant differences in the resulting slopes between stimuli on plots with letters, assessed with the estimated marginal means (emmeans) package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lenth et al., 2018</xref>) with Tukey’s adjustment for family-wise error rates. To assess differences in the complete temporal code of all 7 GRNs across mouthparts, we aligned the binned spike times in series for each GRN. For each animal and stimulus, there was a vector of 70 bins (ten 0.1 s bin per GRN type, aligned for 7 GRNs). To reduce the variability in responses between animals and balance the scale of responses across GRNs, we normalised the responses across GRN replicates within each animal by dividing by the average responses of each GRN to 10% OSR. The normalised responses of single GRNs were then averaged across replicates for each animal. We applied t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the dimensionality of the temporal data into two components for each dataset (OSR vs sucrose, QUI, and pesticides), using Euclidean distance as the distance metric. The results from the t-SNE were subsequently clustered to reveal the grouping of responses by stimulus. To predict the optimal cluster count, we employed Monte Carlo reference-based consensus clustering (M3C, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">John et al., 2020</xref>), an unsupervised learning technique that aggregates across multiple k-means clustering runs. If the optimal number of clusters (k) was greater than one, we included clustering on the t-SNE plots.</p><p>Measurements of feeding behaviour (volume consumed, first bout, and cumulative bout) were compared using t-tests LME, with ‘colony’ as a random effect: (feeding_measurement ~stimulus + (1|ColonyID)), or (feeding_measurement ~stimulus + concentration+(1|ColonyID)) (lmerTest package) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuznetsova et al., 2017</xref>), with emmeans <italic>post hoc</italic> tests (emmeans package) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lenth et al., 2018</xref>) and Tukey’s adjustment for family-wise error rates. The non-significant interaction term (stimulus*concentration) was removed for all pesticide concentration gradient models due to increased model fit (using AIC and BIC). Behavioural data that was not normally distributed was log transformed. For all boxplots, the median is indicated by a line, bounds of the box mark the 1st and 3rd quartile, and whiskers extend to 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR).

The study directly follows up on a previous study conducted by the same team (Kessler et al. 2015, Nature), which was partly questioned by another more recent study (Arce et al. 2018, Proc R. Soc. B). The authors apply a combination of electrophysiological measurements and behavioral feeding tests to answer this question.

The stats questions have been addressed to my satisfaction. In terms of interpretation, however, several suggestions and comments were provided from an ecological perspective, which was deemed important, while the authors have expressed their intent to concentrate on the electrophysiological mechanism. Given that this study was motivated by conflicting results from earlier research, which were frequently employed to discuss the authors' findings, I still find that the discussion needs to be expanded in order to encompass a wider context.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89129.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript is part of the Wright lab's ongoing studies that investigate whether the bumblebee B. terrestris can detect the presence of pesticides when feeding. Previously, they showed that B. terrestris cannot detect neonicotinoids and would prefer food containing neonicotinoids (Kessler et al. 2015). However, in that paper, they showed that B. terrestris cannot taste neonicotinoids but did not provide evidence on why B. terrestris prefer food containing neonicotinoids. In the current paper, the authors continue to suggest that B. terrestris cannot taste neonicotinoids as well as another insecticide, sulfoxaflor, based on additional behavioral experiments and electrophysiological experiments focusing on specific GRNs. While the data from these experiments continue to suggest that B. terrestris cannot taste these insecticides using their mouthparts, whether B. terrestris can actually perceive these insecticides, and why this species prefers food containing these compounds remains unknown.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors provided additional evidence that B. terrestris cannot taste neonicotinoids with their mouthparts. The authors have addressed my concerns regarding overgeneralization and that parts of the manuscript were written in a way that sounded combative with studies from other groups that had come to slightly different conclusions from their previous paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89129.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Parkinson</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Oxford</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Oxford</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Oxford</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Oxford</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dorling</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Oxford</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Oxford</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Hannah</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Imperial College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Haslam</surname><given-names>Martha</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Oxford</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Oxford</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>McDermott-Roberts</surname><given-names>Alex E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Oxford</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Oxford</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wright</surname><given-names>Geraldine A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Oxford</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Oxford</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>Response to Public Reviews</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>We thank this reviewer for their comments on our paper. We have adjusted the methods section to ensure it is clear, including an updated description of the stastics and in some cases updated stastical methods to ensure uniformity in analyses across datasets. The discussion has been modified so that the message regarding our results is set appropriately in the literature.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>We are grateful to this reviewer for their insight. We have modified the text of the discussion to address the points of this reviewer, including providing a greater focus on the significance of our results without overgeneralizing. We have addionally reframed our argument regarding the detection of pescides by <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic> to more carefully consider conflicing results from other papers.</p><p>Response to Recommendaons For The Authors</p><p>Response to Reviewer #1</p><p>We thank this reviewer for their thoughtful comments and ideas. We have made several changes to the text of the manuscript to improve the clarity of our writing, and we are grateful to the reviewer for raising several important points that we had not sufficiently discussed in the paper previously. We feel the paper has been improved with the inclusion of a more thorough discussion and clarified methods. Please see below our responses to the points they raised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A few general thoughts that I had when reading your manuscript: I assume you have only tested the acve pescide ingredients, but not the formula generally applied in the field. Given that these formulas contain addional compounds but the acve ingredients, might it not be possible that they could be perceived by bees?</p></disp-quote><p>For this study, we were interested specifically with the taste of active pesticide compounds, although we agree it could be interesting to explore the taste of other formula compounds, it was not within the scope of this paper to test these.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there an alternave to quinine as a negave control? As you state, quinine is generally used in studies and likely oen in concentraons which are beyond what can be seen in e.g. floral nectar, which might explain its aversive effect. I would like to see it tested in natural concentraons and ideally in combinaon with other potenally toxic plant secondary metabolites (PSMs).</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of including quinine in our study was to provide an in-depth characterizaon of “bitter” taste responses using the sensilla on bumblebee labial palps and galea (i.e., through the atenuation of GRN firing). This was not to show how bumblebees may interact with plants containing quinine in the field, or other PSMs. It would indeed be interesting to explore other plant secondary metabolites, however this was beyond the scope of our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L177-187 AND 233-238 Could you, please, provide a photo or schemac drawing to illustrate your assay?I have a very hard me picturing the actual set-up.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided a labeled diagram of the bumblebee mouthparts and sensillum types (Fig 1A), as well as an image of the bumblebee feeding from a capillary in the behavioural assay (Fig 1G). Further details about the feeding assay (including a JoVe video) can be found with the Ma 2016 paper that we cite throughout our methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L219 Why did you choose 5 sec here?</p></disp-quote><p>This feeding bout duration was selected based on the criteria defined in Ma et al 2016. We have added a citation to that sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L221-224 How precisely was the behavior scored? Just length of bouts or also repeated short contacts? Please, specify.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the first bout duration and the cumulative bout duration in our analyses. A sentence has been added to specify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L231/233 Please, provide some brief details here, as many readers may find it annoying to find and read another study for methods' details.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added three sentences in the methods to further explain the electrophysiological method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L238-245 See also my general methods comment: concentraons used for pescides and quinine differ quite substanally, which may explain their different effects on the bees' percepon. Are the concentraons used for quinine realisc? If not that is totally fine for a negave control, but it would be interesng to see a comparison of effects conducted for similar concentraons.</p></disp-quote><p>The concentrations used of quinine were selected so that they would elicit a known “biter response” – these concentrations are not meant to be field-realistic, and our data (and others, e.g., Tiedeken et al 2014) show that lower concentrations of quinine are not detected by bumblebees.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L277-301 I assume that this is a standard stascal approach to analyze electrophysiological data. However, I am really struggling with fully understanding what you did here. It might be good to add some addional explanaon/detail, e.g. on why you constructed firing rate histograms or how you derived slopes (aren't smulus and bin categorical variables?).</p></disp-quote><p>Firing rate histograms are indeed very commonly used for visualizing neuron spikes over me. We have changed the text somewhat in an effort to make it more clear. Likewise, the “slopes” were derived from the LMEs, and in this case “bin” is a connuous me variable – any me variable will involve some binning depending on the resolution used but should not be considered categorical.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L291-295 As you were averaging and normalizing your data, could you, please, provide some informaon on variaon within animals?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included information on the coefficient of variation for spike rates across sensilla for a given animal/smulus (CV range, median, and IQR).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L295 I assume t-SNE represent a mulvariate approach for ordinaon, correct? Can you explain why you chose to use this approach? Did you use Euclidean Distance?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, t-SNE is a mulvariate technique for dimensionality reduction. It is parcularly well-suited for the visualizaon of high-dimensional datasets, as it can reveal the underlying structure of the data by embedding it in a lower-dimensional space (e.g., 2D) while preserving the local structure of the data as much as possible. We used t-SNE because it has been shown to be effecve in visualizing clusters of similar data points in high-dimensional data. Euclidean distance was used as the distance metric for the t-SNE embedding. Euclidean distance is the default distance metric for most implementaons of t-SNE and is appropriate for connuous data like the spike counts in this study. We have adjusted the methods to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L304 Why did you not always use LMEs?</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the text to show that we used LME for all comparisons, and the statistics have been updated accordingly in the results secon. None of the outcomes changed with the implementation of LME for all tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L306 Would it not make sense to also include the interacon between smulus and concentraon in your models?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a sentence to explain that the interacon term was removed due to it being nonsignificant, and the models without the interacon term having beter model fit (determined by having lower AIC and BIC values).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>L337, 339 and more: I would prefer to see actual p-values, not just &quot;p &gt; 0.05&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been adjusted on L337 and 339. As far as we are aware, there are no other instances where exact p-values were not given (except when p &lt; 0.0001).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion:</p><p>L470 This is true, but the bees' behavior changed significantly, indicang that they may respond to this small change in firing paterns already?</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the bees’ behaviour changed significantly with 0.1mM QUI, but this was not the case with the pescides. Bees drank less overall of 0.1mM QUI than OSR because of the rapid posngesve effects of this compound. It’s important that the duraon of the first bout was not affected (i.e., they didn’t directly avoid it by taste upon first encountering it, as they do with 1mM QUI), but just that they drank less of the 0.1mM QUI over 2 minutes. Post-ingesve effects may occur as quickly as 30s aer inial consumpon. For the pescides, the small changes in GRN firing were not associated with any effects on consumpon or our other measures of feeding behaviour, and we suggest this results from a lack of rapid negave posngesve consequences. We now include further discussion of these important points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L481 But they consumed significantly less of the 0.1 mM QUI!?</p></disp-quote><p>This is true, but they did not reject it (i.e., not drink it at all), and there were no changes in the amount of me the bees spent in contact with the 0.1mM QUI soluon compared to OSR. We have adjusted the text for clarificaon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L504/505 AND 520/521 AND 533-536 I see your point, but I am wondering whether the bees may need some me but are generally able to learn the taste of pescides, which may explain why e.g. Arce et al. only saw an effect over me. For example, learning to 'focus' on the pescide taste may require some internal feedback (bees not feeling well) or larvae feedback. If I understood right, you tested workers only, which might be less sensive than queens or larvae. I think these aspects should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we invesgated the mechanism of taste detecon of pescides. We agree that bees likely use posngesve mechanisms to learn to associate the locaon (or another cue) of a food source with posive or negave posngesve cues. ‘Focus’ is a higher-order process that involves increased atenon to sensory smuli but does not affect sensaon at the level of the receptor. We show that bees are unable to taste pescides using the gustatory receptors on their mouthparts, so post-ingesve learning would not be able to associate the pescides with any taste cue. Indeed, there may be caste-specific differences with foraging queens, however a discussion of this would be beyond the scope of our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also recommend broadening the scope of your discussion. For example, you only focus on nectar, while the story might be different for pollen, which is also contaminated with pescides but represents a different chemical matrix with potenally different taste properes. Also, unlike nectar, pollen is collected with tarsae and hence on contact with other bee body parts.</p><p>I would also like to see a discussion of your study's implicaons for other bee species and other potenally toxic compounds (e.g. PSMs).</p></disp-quote><p>We do not include any data in this paper regarding tarsal or antennal taste or other potenally toxic compounds. In this paper we present one mechanism of biter taste percepon (i.e., of quinine) and specifically show that the buff-tailed bumblebee is unable to taste certain pescides using their mouthparts. To avoid overgeneralizing, we have not included discussions about other species or compounds, which may or may not share similaries with our study.</p><p>Response to Reviewer #2</p><p>We thank this reviewer for their comments. We have adjusted the text to avoid overgeneralizaons with our conclusions, and atempted to soen language in the discussion that may have been construed as combave towards the Arce et al (2018) paper. We hope this reviewer finds these adjustments to be in line with their expectaons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In two parts of the manuscript, the authors made broad predicons and conclusions beyond what the evidence in the paper can support and wrote &quot;Future studies will be necessary to confirm this.&quot; (Lines 508-509) and &quot; Future studies that survey a greater variety of compounds will be necessary to confirm this.&quot; (563-564). Instead of making conclusions based on what experimental data in future studies may support, I would ask the authors instead to make conclusions that their current study can support based on experimental evidence in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed these predicons that extend beyond the scope of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 315 &quot;GRNs encode differences in sugar soluon composion&quot;. The logic of the tle is wrong.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Since this study is only performed in one bumblebee species, then I would suggest that the tle be more specific e.g., &quot;Mouthparts of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris exhibit poor acuity for the detecon of pescides in nectar&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made this change.</p></body></sub-article></article>
