They participate in sculpting the extracellular matrix, sensing the microenvironment, and communicating with other resident cells. Recent studies have revealed transcriptomic heterogeneity among fibroblasts within and between organs. To dissect the basis of interorgan heterogeneity, we compare the gene expression of murine fibroblasts from different tissues (tail, skin, lung, liver, heart, kidney, and gonads) and show that they display distinct positional and organ-specific transcriptome signatures that reflect their embryonic origins. We demonstrate that expression of genes typically attributed to the surrounding parenchyma by fibroblasts is established in embryonic development and largely maintained in culture, bioengineered tissues and ectopic transplants. Targeted knockdown of key organ-specific transcription factors affects fibroblast functions, in particular genes involved in the modulation of fibrosis and inflammation. In conclusion, our data reveal that adult fibroblasts maintain an embryonic gene expression signature inherited from their organ of origin, thereby increasing our understanding of adult fibroblast heterogeneity. The knowledge of this tissue-specific gene signature may assist in targeting fibrotic diseases in a more precise, organ-specific manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group

mortality and morbidity in developed countries, accounting for about 45% of deaths in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bitterman and Henke, 1991</xref>). Despite the impactful prevalence of chronic organ fibrosis, current antifibrotic drugs are both inefficient and nonspecific to this condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friedman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henderson et al., 2020</xref>). Fibroblasts, main players in fibrosis, have gained increased attention for their capacity to perform functions far beyond their canonical secretion of extracellular biological scaffolding and formation of scar tissue after injury. Recent literature poses the organ fibroblast as a major regulatory hub that senses local microenvironment imbalances and controls tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>) upon activation and phenotypic differentiation into the profibrotic myofibroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pakshir et al., 2020</xref>). They are also involved in immunomodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Van Linthout et al., 2014</xref>), by producing and responding to cytokines that activate immune cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forte et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyd et al., 2020</xref>), through organ-specific regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krausgruber et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Organ fibroblasts have been historically difficult to identify and study in vivo, due to their vague functional definition and lack of adequate markers that label organ fibroblast pools completely and specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Swonger et al., 2016</xref>). Recent advances in lineage tracing and multiomics single-cell analyses have revealed a significant heterogeneity of fibroblasts within and among tissues, and we are just beginning to understand how fibroblast heterogeneity correlates with distinct functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henderson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shaw and Rognoni, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lynch and Watt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LeBleu and Neilson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffin et al., 2020</xref>). Despite being morphologically similar, spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells located in stromal tissues, fibroblasts acquire specialized functions related to their anatomical position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krausgruber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Slany et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foote et al., 2019</xref>). They appear to retain a positional memory of the embryonic developmental axis: anterior–posterior, proximal–distal, and dermal–nondermal, possibly reflecting their role in conveying positional identity in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rinn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rinn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackema and Charité, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2002</xref>). The retention of positional molecular information through to adulthood suggests organ fibroblasts respond to molecular cues that drive body compartmentalization. Fibroblast heterogeneity within an organ tends to arise from the distinct embryological origin and/or anatomical localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lynch and Watt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muhl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forte et al., 2020</xref>), while interorgan differences have been mostly ascribed to the matrisome, as shown by the transcriptomic comparison among fibroblasts from muscular tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muhl et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Having previously reported that fibroblasts isolated from the adult mouse heart retain a cardiogenic transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Furtado et al., 2014a</xref>), we show here that fibroblasts isolated from different adult organs similarly retain the expression of transcription factors and other gene sets involved in the determination of organ formation and patterning during embryonic development. This signature is captured in nascent embryonic organ fibroblasts and retained in adult fibroblasts under culture in isolation or in coculture with parenchymal cells from different organs. Further ectopic transplantation of fibroblasts into a different organ in vivo demonstrates the strength of the organ molecular signature despite new microenvironmental challenges. The robustness of the fibroblast organ transcriptome signature shown here supports its importance for organ interaction, connectivity, and function. In addition, knockdown of selected organ development transcription factors in cardiac fibroblasts deregulated the expression of genes involved in inflammation, fibrosis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, further supporting the relevance of these genes in fibroblasts function. In summary, our study uncovers stable expression of organ-specific, development-related signature genes in adult fibroblasts, thus offering new prospects for possible antifibrotic therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell homeostasis and ECM components comprise a generic fibroblast gene signature</title><p>To compare the gene signature of fibroblasts from different organs and eliminate potential RNA contaminants from other organ cell types, dissociated adult murine tissues were cultured for 5 days, followed by sorting for CD45−CD31−CD90+ fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Furtado et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

Similarly, IPA analysis revealed that the most significantly affected canonical pathways were related to fibrosis (hepatic fibrosis signaling, GP6 signaling); cell migration (Axonal Guidance Signaling); acute phase response, inflammation, and cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Interestingly, Cardiac Hypertrophy Signaling (including profibrotic signals AngII, TGFβ, and IGF1) and HIF1a signaling were predicted to be downregulated in KFs and upregulated in HFs and TFs, possibly inferring a better resilience of KFs to the kidney capsule environment.</p><p>Among the top 10 upregulated genes in transplanted fibroblasts, 6 were shared by the ectopically transplanted HFs and TFs, including the serum amyloid A <italic>Saa3,</italic> secreted during the acute phase of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forte et al., 2020</xref>); two metabolic enzymes, <italic>Slc27a2,</italic> primarily expressed in kidney and liver involved in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation, and <italic>Pck1</italic> key regulator of gluconeogenesis; the cytochrome gene <italic>Cy2j5</italic> involved in vasorelaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agba et al., 2020</xref>); the kidney abundant protein <italic>Kap,</italic> androgen-regulated, proximal tubule-specific not expressed at detectable levels in tissue other than the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toole et al., 1979</xref>)<italic>, Fut9</italic> a fucosyltransferase with the highest expression in adult pancreas, placenta, kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7k</xref>).

However, recent advances in lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomic have revealed an extensive intra- and interorgan heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henderson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LeBleu and Neilson, 2020</xref>). Multiorgan studies show that B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rocha-Resende et al., 2020</xref>), endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paik et al., 2020</xref>), fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muhl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Han et al., 2018</xref>), and transcriptomes tend to cluster separately based on the organ of origin, suggesting a strong influence of the anatomical location or the local microenvironment on the cell state. A recent study has shown that, despite the likely tissue-specific imprinting, fibroblast subclusters across multiple organs present a common hierarchy with two universal subtypes, with distinct localization within the tissue (Col15a1+ – parenchymal; Pi16+ – adventitial), which in turn generate other more specialized or activated fibroblasts states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buechler et al., 2021</xref>). While our study did not prove or disprove this hypothesis, we were not able to unbiasedly classify our cell subtypes based on this principle. However, our data are in agreement with abovementioned studies that identified subclusters based on organ of origin.</p><p>We previously reported that fibroblasts isolated from the adult mouse heart retain a cardiogenic transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Furtado et al., 2014a</xref>). Here, we compared primary cultures of fibroblasts isolated from organs of different anatomical positions to expand our previous analysis and assess whether development-related genes contribute to the fibroblast interorgan functional heterogeneity. The results of this analysis highlight the presence of an organ-enriched positional code, and the expression of core genes that represent the developmental signature of fibroblast organ origin previously thought to be restricted to the parenchymal component. These molecular profiles are established during embryogenesis, consistent with the fact that organ fibroblasts are not generated from a common progenitor pool but arise independently in different body segments and organs during embryonic development and persist to adulthood.</p><p>As in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Furtado et al., 2014a</xref>), we chose to analyze cultured fibroblasts to reduce the risk of contamination from parenchymal cell mRNA. Fibroblast expression patterns in culture were recapitulated in freshly isolated single cells, mostly enriched in activated or myofibroblast-like fibroblast subclusters. These gene signatures can predict the tissue of origin of a mixed population of primary cultured cells analyzed at the single-cell level. Using the heart as a model, we show that signature genes contribute to organ fibroblast function, as evidenced by the deregulation of several profibrotic and proinflammatory genes with knockdown of core transcription factors <italic>Gata4</italic> (expressed in all fibroblast types) and <italic>Tbx20</italic> (cardiac specific) in cultured adult cardiac fibroblasts. These results place <italic>Gata4</italic> upstream of <italic>Tbx20,</italic> both of which upregulate distinct profibrotic signals, modulate genes involved in extracellular modulation and cell adhesion, and have opposite effects on cytokine–cytokine receptor expression, confirming that the core cardiogenic program in cardiac fibroblasts is involved in regulating their function.</p><p>Dermal fibroblasts from different sites of the body have shown different efficiency of reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sacco et al., 2019</xref>), but not much is known about other fibroblast tissue-specific functions. The coculture studies presented here further reinforce the importance of fibroblast core transcriptomes for specialized organ function: while interspersion of cardiac fibroblasts within CM cultures facilitated the propagation of the electric pulse forming a syncytium, cocultured kidney fibroblasts clustered separately and inhibited CM contraction, both in 2D and 3D assays. These findings carry repercussions to in silico organ bioengineering, where combining the correct match of diverse organ cell types may be essential for proper organ formation. Indeed, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac stromal cells enhance maturation of cardiac microtissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giacomelli et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, the source and type of organ scaffolding, mainly deployed by fibroblasts, is essential for the recreation of organs in a dish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that skin fibroblasts and mesenchymal cells from different organs keep a positional identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rinn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rinn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackema and Charité, 2008</xref>). For mesenchymal cells, the <italic>Hox</italic> code was maintained also in culture, although whether this depended on cell-to-cell contact remained to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackema and Charité, 2008</xref>). Here, we show that adult fibroblasts, isolated from a variety of organs, preserve the expression of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in culture, but that tissue-specific <italic>Hox</italic> genes were downregulated after ectopic transplantation under the kidney capsule, suggesting that cellular environment can induce reprogramming of positional codes. Interestingly, control kidney fibroblasts also presented changes in the <italic>Hox</italic> code after transplantation, possibly reflecting the adaptation to the space between the capsule and the cortex, with the decrease of the mesenchyme gene <italic>Hoxd10</italic> and increase of <italic>Hoxd3</italic> important for the maintenance of an epithelial phenotype in adult kidney. All three transplanted fibroblast types (heart, tail, and kidney) presented an activated phenotype, involving initiation of the acute phase response, profibrotic signals, and metabolic changes. While transplanted heart and tail fibroblasts showed a clearer activation of proinflammatory pathways, genes associated with cell migration, and HIF1a signaling; transplanted kidney fibroblasts appeared more resilient in their native milieu, with the activation of pathways related to proliferation and upregulation of genes indicative of a more epithelial cortex-like phenotype. Both heart and kidney fibroblasts retained a ‘memory’ of their organ of origin, defined by the resilient expression of the core of development-related genes when compared to tail fibroblast control. It remains to be determined if this memory can be erased by a longer residence in the ectopic microenvironment. In light of recent studies on endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yucel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jambusaria et al., 2020</xref>), we propose that the expression of organ-specific genes, previously thought to be restricted to parenchymal cells, may form the basis for organ cohesiveness and performance.</p><p>In summary, adult fibroblasts maintain a lasting blueprint of the organ in which they reside, reflective of their developmental origin, which likely plays a role in the orchestration of the tissue-specific homeostasis and reparative response. Exploiting the organ-specific properties of fibroblasts may be a valuable strategy for the targeted control of organ fibrosis, an integral feature of organ failure and disease progression affecting a multitude of pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All experiments were performed with young adult (8–12 weeks old) C57BL/6J, <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1.1(CAG-cas9*,-EGFP)Fezh</sup></italic>/J (<italic>ROSA<sup>Cas9-EGFP</sup></italic>), <italic>ROSA<sup>mt/mg</sup></italic> (JAX Stock# 007576)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>Col1a1-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yata, 2003</xref>) male mice and <italic>Col1a1-GFP</italic> E16.5 embryos.

Of great interest is that compelling evidence is provided that these transcriptional signatures have direct translational consequences. This is shown through coculture experiments, where coculture of cardiomyocytes with non-cardiac fibroblasts impairs integration and contractility, while cardiac fibroblasts integrate with cardiomyocyte cultures to create functional beating tissue. This memory is shown to be malleable: three days post implantation in the renal capsule, explanted fibroblasts largely maintained their original transcriptomic signature, while also showing the onset of adaptation to a new microenvironment. In addition, markers are identified which allow the separation of fibroblasts based on their anatomical origin. Considering the lack of tissue-specific markers for fibroblasts, this is a significant advance.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71008.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Noble</surname><given-names>Paul W</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02pammg90</institution-id><institution>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.06.03.446915">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.03.446915v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Paul Noble as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript has strengths in: Figure 7 transplant data were strong; The authors have provided extensive data; Functional confirmation in cardiac lineage was very convincing. The recommendations are:</p><p>1. Verification and gene list. A weakness in the initial gene analysis is there are so many genes and pathways mentioned and used (Figure 2a) that it is difficult to determine why the genes in Figure 2 (b-g) were the ones chosen to be validated. The qPCR validation seems to support the hypothesis that these genes have organ specific expressions but their selection (top gene? Specific pathway node? Candidate gene?) from the initial analysis is unclear. It would help to simplify the schematic for Figure 2a and highlight the specific genes that are being validated. This is further compounded by the figure 3 data, which shows mixed results (PAX8 does not really seem to be expressed in the kidney and FOXD1 seems to have an odd pattern of expression; FOXA2 seems to be expressed in some nuclei and not others of the lung) and non-direct comparison between multiple organs.</p><p>2. The clusters of the scRNA-seq from both freshly isolated and cultured fibroblasts seem to be due to the batch effects, as it is not very possible that not a single overlapped cell was identified. The listed organ specific genes in heatmaps were hand-picked? as they are identical. Are there any specific genes between fresh isolated and cultured fibroblasts in each organ? A better suggestion should be listing all the shared maker genes and organ specific genes in both freshly isolated and cultured fibroblasts and discussing a little bit the possible related functions.</p><p>3. Immunocytochemistry validation should also include the staining on the negative fibroblasts to confirm the &quot;organ specific markers&quot; in Figure 3. More convincing staining experiments should be on the sections of freshly isolated organs with proper and necessary controls.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The reviewer has some comments on the data presentation, analysis and overall experimental approach that are listed below:</p><p>Data presentation:</p><p>1) Figure 6i: -LOG(p-value) should be underneath of the X-axis. It does not make sense to show pathways that are not significant, i.e. -LOG(p-value) &lt; 1.3.</p><p>2) Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 and Figure supplement 2 are confusing. Figure5 – S1 shows mainly lung, and Figure 5 – S2 shows heart, and it is not clear why both figures also have some data on the kidney.</p><p>Analysis:</p><p>1) The authors have added single-cell profiling of fibroblasts from the published mouse dataset (Han et al. 2018). However, it would have been more informative to include instead published datasets on human fetal and adult tissues, as these datasets for the heart, kidney and lung are available.</p><p>2) Why was microarray and not RNA-seq has chosen to perform gene expression analysis? It is much better to have RNA-seq data instead of as it makes datasets easier to compare with other published datasets.</p><p>Experimental approach:</p><p>1) The authors used cultured fibroblasts to avoid contamination from parenchyma cells. However, this approach is not ideal, especially because the authors report that cultured cells present an activated/myofibroblast-like phenotype compared to freshly isolated cells. It might also be helpful to describe more in-depth the activated phenotype upon culture compared to freshly isolated cells. Are these get downregulated upon ectopic transplantation?</p><p>2) Tissue-specific functionality of fibroblasts in vitro (3D cardiac tissue function) and in vivo (ectopic transplantation) are performed after just 3 days, which might be not sufficient to reveal more differences or similarities. It might be interesting to have these compared to a prolonged period upon co-culture or transplantation, such as three weeks. The reviewer also finds it surprising that the authors observe the change in HOX genes expression as early as 3 days after transplantation, as one would think this should take longer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors provide a well-written and comprehensive study of the positional &quot;memory&quot; and specialization of fibroblasts. As such, I have only minor comments. Please find below my part-by-part comments to the manuscript.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>The final sentence of the abstract does not fit with the narrative of the paper, it is too much of a future perspective.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Buechler et al. (Nature, 2021) defined in their fibroblast atlas two universal fibroblast populations, from which tissue-specific fibroblasts appear to be derived. The present manuscript does not provide such a cell type: rather than a continuum of states, discrete organ-specific cell states are found. The authors should comment on this discrepancy. Furthermore, the discussion should integrate the present findings with those of Buechler, who touches upon the concept of spatial fibroblast heterogeneity, making the manuscript a direct extension of his findings.</p><p>Line 409 seems like an overstatement, as the concept of fibroblasts as a cell type is not at stake here. Rather, the definition of cell state might require an amendment, taking into consideration anatomical location or the local microenvironment to which a cell is exposed.</p><p>Figures</p><p>The added value of Figure 1 is lost to me. It does not provide much information and would in my view better be suited for the supplements. Regarding Figure 1, lines 108 to 110 can be removed. The statement that is it surprising for a cell type designated mainly as ECM-producing to be rich in transcripts for nuclear and cytosolar proteins is confusing and should therefore be omitted. A cell's primary function does not mean that transcripts related to that function should by default make up the majority of the transcriptome.</p><p>Why are averaged raw signals used in Figure 2, rather than normalized expressions?</p><p>Figure 5 contains two clusters which cannot be linked back to the organ of origin. Perhaps regressing out the genes of the Hox cluster and the cell cycle can solve this issue?</p><p>Figure 6j is missing the cardiomyocyte signature in the Tbx20 KD, while it is the positive control.</p><p>Figure 8c does not have a legend. In 8d it would help to move the word 'FDR' next to the legend's color scale.</p><p>Results</p><p>The first subtitle mentions metabolic components. As these were part of larger gene sets, such as housekeeping, the cytoskeleton, proliferation, this word should be substituted by e.g. homeostatic. No metabolic profiling was performed.</p><p>The description of population &quot;KidneyA&quot; in lines 217 to 221 aims to explain a relatively higher expression of genes related to in the response to injury, linking this to tubular cells acquiring mesenchymal phenotypes in vivo. Considering the relative size of the cluster, this seems unlikely to me. It would be of interest to generate a module score for the genes associated to the collagenase-response described by O'Flanagan et al. (Genome Biology, 2019) and test if this cluster is not simply a group of fibroblasts with a stronger reaction to the enzymatic digestion. This can be done easily in Seurat v3 using the AddModuleScore() function.</p><p>Line 276: the use of the abbreviation 'HF' for heart failure is not defined. Considering that the abbreviation eHF is coined a few lines earlier to refer to heart fibroblasts, this leads to possible confusion.</p><p>Materials and Methods</p><p>Lines 493 and 610 mention 10cm dishes, which I believe should be 10 cm² dishes.</p><p>Lines 488 and 607 do not mention the basal medium in which the digestion took place.</p><p>Line 491 does not state the percentages of sodium pyruvate and pen/strep in the medium.</p><p>Line 493 contains a typo in the TrypLE.</p><p>Line 541: &quot;log2 transformation and quantile normalization was done using R scripts and public Bioconductor packages&quot;. This is too vague to be reproducible, please elaborate and cite the packages used for the analysis.</p><p>Line 578: a citation of edgeR is missing (Robinson, Bioinformatics, 2010).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Adult mouse fibroblasts retain organ-specific transcriptomic identity&quot; for further consideration by eLife. Your revised article has been evaluated by Paul Noble (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Please address the batch effect issue as outlined by reviewer #3 as it impacts the significance of the findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The new version of manuscript has satisfactorily answered my concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed all my comments, and I have no additional comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have adequately addressed most of my comments in both the revisions and their responses. One issue which does persist in my opinion, and which is also mentioned by Reviewer 1 is the grouping of the cells in the scRNA-seq analysis. From a biological perspective at least some overlap would be expected in an analysis only including one cell type. However, there is a very strong separation based on organ, highly resembling a batch effect. In their response to Reviewer 1, the authors mention this could not be possible as all samples were sequenced in the same 10x lane. I believe that by this they mean the same 10x chip, as running 8 samples in the same lane would require additional multiplexing. Regardless, even within the same chip, some technical variation can be expected between lanes.</p><p>On this topic the authors also refer to figure 6 of the Mouse Cell Atlas (MCA) paper, but this does not make sense as different dimensionality reduction methods were used between these two papers. The MCA uses tSNE projection, which prioritizes finding local communities, while in this paper UMAP was used, which focuses preserving the global structure of the data. A side effect of the mathematical differences between these methods is that intercluster distance does not have much meaning in tSNE space, but reflects variation in a UMAP projection. Consequently, separation by organ in a UMAP projection as seen here does indeed support the claim of the manuscript. However, the strong separation of samples derived from the same organ (e.g. the two kidney samples) undermines this reasoning, as it implies the presence of a batch effect aiding in the separation. This is not sufficiently addressed by the authors.</p><p>– The caption of Figure 2 says b-g, while this should be b,c.</p><p>– Figure 7 is labelled a-i, l-m. The panel letters should be updated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71008.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Gene Ontology annotation of these organ-enriched genes revealed terms associated with organ development programs; genes in those development related GO terms are shown in the Cytoscape plot (Figure 2 of the re-submission); we have clarified this point in the figure captions (Figure 2, 3) and text. The expression of developmental genes was validated by qPCR on bulk RNA extracted from sorted primary cultured adult fibroblasts and from embryonic fibroblasts (E16.5).</p><p>In Figure 3 we validated the expression of the same genes at the protein level using immunocytochemistry. As the reviewer rightly pointed out, the expression of markers like Pax8 and Foxa2 seem to be restricted to certain fibroblasts subtypes (i.e., Pax8 expression is mostly observed in GFP low kidney fibroblasts; Foxa2 nuclear expression seems restricted to smaller lung fibroblasts, not observed in myofibroblast-like cells), showing that despite the selection for CD45- CD31- CD90+ cells, we are still working with populations of fibroblasts in different states. Therefore, we confirmed the expression of the organ-enriched gene signature in scRNAseq data from freshly isolated fibroblasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The rationale behind the choice is that the core genes preserved under culture conditions are most likely the strongest molecular signature for the cell type. Therefore, we kept looking for this signature in further experiments.</p><p>We can exclude a significant batch effect, as the freshly isolated cell data (same dataset subset used in Figure 6 of Mouse Cell Atlas papers) and cultured fibroblasts data (generated by this paper, using fibroblasts cultured under the same conditions and captured in one lane of the 10xChromium) were analyzed separately, and no data integration was performed. Performing data integration would indeed cause batch effects and the resulting bias would outweigh the limited additional insights.</p><p>Genes shown in Figure 5b/5e are shared between freshly isolated and cultured fibroblasts.

We have not included negative controls in the figure previously, but all controls were performed for every experiment. We have now added the negative staining images (secondary antibody only) for the immunocytochemistry experiments on primary <italic>Col1a1-GFP</italic>+ fibroblasts (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>The rationale behind performing the staining on primary isolated cells is that parenchymal cell staining can confound visualization of results. For example, Tbx20 is also expressed by other cell types of the heart, including cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. Performing staining in isolated fibroblasts, clearly displays the overlap between GFP+ fibroblasts and the desired antibody. We are confident the stainings are not artifactual as: 1. primary antibodies show expected expression patterns; 2. negative controls are clean and 3. the protein expression data provided here matches our single cell RNA data analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The reviewer has some comments on the data presentation, analysis and overall experimental approach that are listed below:</p><p>Data presentation:</p><p>1) Figure 6i: -LOG(p-value) should be underneath of the X-axis.

From the freshly isolated stromal cells aggregate (Mouse Cell Atlas 2018), only lung and kidney showed multiple sub-clusters, which are further explored in Supplement 1 (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1). From the in-house scRNAseq dataset on combined cultured fibroblasts, only heart and kidney showed multiple subclusters (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2).</p><p>Please note that the analyses are unbiased, so the number of sub-clusters found per organ has not been pre-defined by us. For both studies (fresh isolated cells re-analyzed and cultured cells run in house) we input cells from various organs (kidney, lung, heart, etc).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Analysis:</p><p>1) The authors have added single-cell profiling of fibroblasts from the published mouse dataset (Han et al. 2018).

Embryonic analysis is complicated since organ fibroblasts are only nascent at late fetal time-points.</p><p>However, to satisfy the reviewer’s request we have now performed additional analyses of two longitudinal datasets in the mouse:</p><p>a. lung E16.5 and E17.5 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE156329, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102551)</p><p>b. kidney E15.5, E17.5, P0 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE149134, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2020.11.002).</p><p>We analyzed these datasets separately without data integration, due to the different samples and sequencing conditions. The lung data confirmed the presence of our adult lung fibroblast signature (e.g. Foxf1, Bmp3; left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) in the Col1a2+;Vim+ subpopulation of embryonic lung fibroblast (~5500 cells). Thy1 was not significantly expressed at this stage in lung cells, therefore this marker was excluded from the analysis. The time-course expression further revealed the dynamic change of this signature over two developmental time-points. Confirmation was obtained using Module Score analysis (right panel; ‘lung embryonic fibroblasts’ violin plots, generated by the <italic>AddModuleScore</italic>() function in Seurat v3 with default parameters), where the lung fibroblast signature was above the expression of n=100 randomly selected control genes (dashed line) for a subpopulation of lung fibroblasts at E16.5 and E17.5. The module score of E17.5 fibroblasts (3 replicates in different colors – green, cyan and purple) is higher than that of E16.5 fibroblasts (red), suggesting cell maturation plays a role in cementing the adult core molecular code.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71008-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Similarly, the embryonic longitudinal kidney data for Thy1+, Col1a2+, Vim+ (~1000 cells) confirmed the adult kidney fibroblast signature was present in embryonic fibroblasts (e.g. Pax8; left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Similar to the embryonic lung fibroblast data, the aggregated expression of the kidney fibroblast signature was above the expression of n=100 randomly selected control genes (dashed line) for a subpopulation of kidney fibroblasts at E15.5 and E17.5 (right panel; ‘kidney fibroblasts’ module score violin plots, generated by the <italic>AddModuleScore</italic>() function in Seurat v3 with default parameters).

It is much better to have RNA-seq data instead of as it makes datasets easier to compare with other published datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason is historical. The microarray data has been performed many years ago and is publicly available but remains unpublished. At the time, microarray technology in mice was mature and high-quality probes were fully established while the RNA-seq technology was emerging. The generated data were robust for cross-tissue interrogation, network analysis, and Hox code analysis. We rationalized that the original bulk microarray data was high quality and we deemed unnecessary to repeat it using RNA-seq posteriorly. However, all data further generated for this manuscript has utilized RNA-seq.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experimental approach:</p><p>1) The authors used cultured fibroblasts to avoid contamination from parenchyma cells. However, this approach is not ideal, especially because the authors report that cultured cells present an activated/myofibroblast-like phenotype compared to freshly isolated cells. It might also be helpful to describe more in-depth the activated phenotype upon culture compared to freshly isolated cells. Are these get downregulated upon ectopic transplantation?</p></disp-quote><p>Myofibroblasts and their markers are very well characterized in the literature<sup>1,2</sup>. Based on the GEO terms found in this work and previous literature, cells in culture tend to heterogeneously acquire a myofibroblast phenotype due to growth factors in the serum, including TGFB<sup>3</sup>. On the contrary, freshly isolated cells show a homeostatic phenotype, Acta2 negative<sup>4</sup>.</p><p>From the single-cell data analyses of both freshly isolated fibroblasts (Figure 4a-c, Figure 4-Source Data 1, Figure Supplement 1 in the revised version) and primary cells in culture (Figure 4d-f, Figure 4-Source Data 2, Figure Supplement 2 in the revised version), we noticed that, when multiple subtypes were present, the signature genes identified from the microarray analysis of the CD45-CD31- Thy1+ fibroblasts tended to be relatively more expressed in the subpopulation with an activated/myofibroblast phenotype. It is interesting that transplanted cells did show increase in GEO terms related to myofibroblast activation, inflammation and fibrosis (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Our interpretation is that transplanted cells may see the kidney capsule as a foreign/insult environment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Tissue-specific functionality of fibroblasts in vitro (3D cardiac tissue function) and in vivo (ectopic transplantation) are performed after just 3 days, which might be not sufficient to reveal more differences or similarities. It might be interesting to have these compared to a prolonged period upon co-culture or transplantation, such as three weeks. The reviewer also finds it surprising that the authors observe the change in HOX genes expression as early as 3 days after transplantation, as one would think this should take longer.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a good point. We thought to analyze the transplanted cells after a short time because those were primary fibroblasts transplanted in syngeneic (non-immunocompromised mice), not pluripotent cells as in the classic teratoma assays<sup>5</sup>. In the abovementioned study, luminescence from Fluor-tagged embryonic stem cells disappeared by one week and reappeared 2-7 weeks after transplantation, suggesting the selection of a few resistant clones. In our case, the short transplantation period reduced the chance of sub-selection of transformed cells and the risk of fusion with recipient cells.</p><p>We have not tried to keep them for longer periods, and unfortunately, we are not able to perform additional wet-lab experiments at this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Abstract</p><p>The final sentence of the abstract does not fit with the narrative of the paper, it is too much of a future perspective.</p></disp-quote><p>The final sentence has been revised accordingly and now reads as:</p><p>“In conclusion, our data reveal that adult fibroblasts maintain an embryonic gene expression signature inherited from their organ of origin, thereby increasing our understanding of adult fibroblast heterogeneity.

We believe our data do not contradict Buecheler et al.’s findings, but the nature our initial analysis does not allow us to explore the full fibroblasts state continuum. Our aim is to identify tissue-specific fibroblast signature genes, as opposed to a generic signature, although such genes were incorporated into the original Figure 1 (now Figure 1—figure supplement 1b-c; Figure 1-Source Data 1).</p><p>However, to answer the point raised by the reviewer, we have generated module scores for each of our tissue-enriched signature gene list and enquired whether these expression signatures can be preferentially enriched in any of the two steady-state pan-tissue fibroblast subpopulations described by the Buecheler et al. dataset (violin plots below). We did not observe any common pattern across the different tissues. In general, gene expression was relatively similar among all clusters, with the exception of gonad and heart, that show a tendency toward a relatively higher expression in the parenchymal cluster, and skin with a relatively higher expression in the adventitial cluster.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71008-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 409 seems like an overstatement, as the concept of fibroblasts as a cell type is not at stake here.

We have removed the last part of paragraph 1 referring to the cellular localization of commonly expressed genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why are averaged raw signals used in Figure 2, rather than normalized expressions?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2 is now Figure 1. The idea behind using raw signal instead of normalization is that tail can also be a queried sample in this particular figure. This way we could present all tissues in separate plots. Comparisons were only made between the expression of Hox gene members within the same organ, which could be made based on absolute expression levels. In this case, normalization was not required and would not change the ranking between Hox genes within the same tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 contains two clusters which cannot be linked back to the organ of origin. Perhaps regressing out the genes of the Hox cluster and the cell cycle can solve this issue?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe those clusters are likely due to non-fibroblasts populations, because the single-cell analysis was done on primary cells (cultured for 5-days) sorting only based on the viability markers not on CD45-CD31-Thy1+, as in the initial bulk microarray analyses.</p><p>We have already regressed out the cell cycle genes in the presented analysis, but we thought regressing out the Hox genes (very strong in those non-fibroblasts populations) would alter our clustering.</p><p>The Hox code signature is very strong in these clusters; regressing Hox genes would dilute all signatures in all clusters. Although we can’t explain what these cells are, we kept them in the plot for transparency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6j is missing the cardiomyocyte signature in the Tbx20 KD, while it is the positive control.</p></disp-quote><p>The ‘cardiomyocyte signature genes’ we not the positive control. These genes are found in cardiac fibroblasts, albeit at much lower levels than what would be expected for a cardiomyocyte (we estimate ~100 fold or so lower). We have routinely encountered sarcomeric cardiomyocyte genes in cardiac fibroblasts, except for the bona-fide marker myosin heavy chain. We believe that the core transcriptional signature in cardiac fibroblasts generates some spurious low level expression of sarcomeric genes in these cells, although it seems this expression has no biological relevance, considering that cardiac fibroblasts have no sarcomere structures. This reinforces the need to use isolated cultured cells to determine the core transcriptional identity, as carry over RNA could certainly impact such findings.</p><p>For the plots in 6j we selected representative genes for each category that were significantly regulated in the KD. Cardiomyocyte signature genes (<italic>Tnnt2, Tnnc1</italic>) were differentially regulated in the Gata4KD but were not differentially expressed in the Tbx20KD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 8c does not have a legend.

We have corrected this and the corresponding legend is: “Multidimensional scaling plot calculated on the top 500 genes post-normalization, to visualize the level of transcriptomic similarity among all the samples.” Additionally, we have moved FDR near the legend scale.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results</p><p>The first subtitle mentions metabolic components.

Considering the relative size of the cluster, this seems unlikely to me. It would be of interest to generate a module score for the genes associated to the collagenase-response described by O'Flanagan et al. (Genome Biology, 2019) and test if this cluster is not simply a group of fibroblasts with a stronger reaction to the enzymatic digestion. This can be done easily in Seurat v3 using the AddModuleScore() function.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the ‘Module Score’ analysis as per the reviewer’s suggestion. We used the kidney marker genes, as well as the collagenase-response genes (“core 512 genes”), as described in O'Flanagan et al.<sup>7</sup>, to assess the module score based on the Mouse Cell Atlas single-cell data (see panels A, B, C in violin plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>). The data showed that the “KidneyA” population (Panel A) was distinct from the “Kidney B” population (Panel B), based on each corresponding subpopulation marker identified in this study. The same kidney cells however did not show any difference in module scores when using the collagenase-response genes (Panel C), showing that the Kidney A and B sub-populations are not the result of differential reaction to enzymatic digestion. Thus, we maintain our hypothesis that the “KidneyA” cluster corresponds to tubular cells acquiring mesenchymal phenotypes.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71008-sa2-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 276: the use of the abbreviation 'HF' for heart failure is not defined.

One issue which does persist in my opinion, and which is also mentioned by Reviewer 1 is the grouping of the cells in the scRNA-seq analysis. From a biological perspective at least some overlap would be expected in an analysis only including one cell type. However, there is a very strong separation based on organ, highly resembling a batch effect. In their response to Reviewer 1, the authors mention this could not be possible as all samples were sequenced in the same 10x lane. I believe that by this they mean the same 10x chip, as running 8 samples in the same lane would require additional multiplexing. Regardless, even within the same chip, some technical variation can be expected between lanes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and the opportunity to clarify this further. The primary cultured fibroblasts from different organs were mixed in one single lane of the 10x Chromium chip, without multiplexing. We identified the clusters based on the expression of the organ-specific core genes identified from the initial bulk microarray experiment and validated via ICC, and qPCR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On this topic the authors also refer to figure 6 of the Mouse Cell Atlas (MCA) paper, but this does not make sense as different dimensionality reduction methods were used between these two papers. The MCA uses tSNE projection, which prioritizes finding local communities, while in this paper UMAP was used, which focuses preserving the global structure of the data. A side effect of the mathematical differences between these methods is that intercluster distance does not have much meaning in tSNE space, but reflects variation in a UMAP projection. Consequently, separation by organ in a UMAP projection as seen here does indeed support the claim of the manuscript. However, the strong separation of samples derived from the same organ (e.g. the two kidney samples) undermines this reasoning, as it implies the presence of a batch effect aiding in the separation. This is not sufficiently addressed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We have confirmed the separation between organ fibroblasts observed in our single-cell data by cross-validating with the Mouse Cell Atlas data. Three independent clustering methods were employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>), including UMAP (Panel A), t-SNE (Panel B) and PHATE (PMID:31796933, Panel C), all showing a clear separation between organ fibroblasts.
