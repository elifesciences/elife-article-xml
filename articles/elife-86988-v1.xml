ecosystem function and resilience. As such, understanding the role of biodiversity in ecosystem function and its response to climate perturbation is increasingly important, especially in tropical systems where responses to changes in biodiversity are less predictable and more challenging to assess experimentally. Using large-scale transplant experiments conducted at five neotropical sites, we documented the impacts of changes in intraspecific and interspecific plant richness in the genus <italic>Piper</italic> on insect herbivory, insect richness, and ecosystem resilience to perturbations in water availability. We found that reductions of both intraspecific and interspecific <italic>Piper</italic> diversity had measurable and site-specific effects on herbivory, herbivorous insect richness, and plant mortality. The responses of these ecosystem-relevant processes to reduced intraspecific <italic>Piper</italic> richness were often similar in magnitude to the effects of reduced interspecific richness. Increased water availability reduced herbivory by 4.2% overall, and the response of herbivorous insect richness and herbivory to water availability were altered by both intra- and interspecific richness in a site-dependent manner. Our results underscore the role of intraspecific and interspecific richness as foundations of ecosystem function and the importance of community and location-specific contingencies in controlling function in complex tropical systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biodiversity</kwd><kwd>ecosystem function</kwd><kwd>herbivores</kwd><kwd><italic>Piper</italic></kwd><kwd>plant-insect interactions</kwd><kwd>water availability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1442103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dyer</surname><given-names>Lee A</given-names></name><name><surname>Richards</surname><given-names>Lora A</given-names></name><name><surname>Parchman</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Smilanich</surname><given-names>Angela M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1442075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tepe</surname><given-names>Eric J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EN-2133818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richards</surname><given-names>Lora A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimental <italic>Piper</italic> gardens across five neotropical sites reveal complex contingencies in the influence of species and population-level biodiversity on the flow of resources to insect herbivores and ecosystem resilience to changes in water availability.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As climate change and anthropogenic activity alter ecosystems at unprecedented rates, it has become critical to understand the consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystem processes and the maintenance of ecosystem processes through species interactions. A complex mix of anthropogenic forces are eroding multiple dimensions of global biological diversity, including plant intraspecific, interspecific, and functional diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morris, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oliver and Morecroft, 2014</xref>). Plant diversity affects herbivore abundance and diversity, thereby influencing biomass allocation and energy fluxes between trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ebeling et al., 2018</xref>). Because losses of plant diversity can destabilize the flow of resources to higher trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ebeling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Naeem and Li, 1997</xref>), understanding the connection between biodiversity and trophic interactions is necessary to predict the consequences of the loss of primary producer biodiversity on ecosystem traits such as resilience to environmental perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elmqvist et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oliver et al., 2015</xref>). While climate change is associated with increased absolute precipitation in some regions and decreased precipitation in others, IPCC models predict mid-century increases in the frequency of extreme precipitation events in Central and South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Easterling et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O’Gorman and Schneider, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Field et al., 2014b</xref>), a phenomenon already observable in many ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischer and Knutti, 2016</xref>). Measuring how precipitation change will affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function is therefore increasingly important, particularly in diverse tropical systems.</p><p>Very few multi-site, manipulative diversity experiments have been reported from tropical areas compared to temperate environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarke et al., 2017</xref>), limiting our knowledge of the role of biodiversity in ecosystem function in the most species-rich regions of the planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gentry, 1992</xref>). In the context of several established hypotheses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), we investigate how multiple dimensions of plant diversity affect ecosystem processes at five neotropical sites and explore how diversity modulates how ecosystems respond to changes in water availability at three of those sites. We focus on ecosystem responses that represent changes in energy fluxes between trophic levels as measured by herbivory, herbivore diversity, and plant mortality. By altering plant uptake of nutrients and plant defense production, abnormal levels of precipitation can alter herbivore pressure, affecting the movement of resources into higher trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">White, 1974</xref>). As such, extreme dry and wet periods of climate are expected to strongly perturb plant-insect interactions and thereby alter ecosystem function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">White, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Côté and Darling, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koricheva et al., 1998</xref>). The insurance hypothesis suggests that greater biodiversity can act to stabilize ecosystems and improve their resilience to environmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Naeem and Li, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yachi and Loreau, 1999</xref>). While greater interspecific plant richness is expected to lead to increased diversity in higher trophic levels due to the accumulation of specialist herbivores, field studies have demonstrated both positive and neutral effects of interspecific plant richness on ecosystem resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klaus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lanta et al., 2012</xref>). Despite traditional views that interspecific richness has a greater impact on ecosystem processes than intraspecific diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hughes et al., 2008</xref>), recent research suggests that plant intra- and interspecific richness can have similar effects on ecosystem productivity and consumer abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raffard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koricheva and Hayes, 2018</xref>). As changes to intraspecific richness can alter the diversity of resources available to herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crutsinger et al., 2006</xref>), it is necessary to consider both inter- and intraspecific diversity when investigating the effects of biodiversity loss on ecosystem processes.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Path models and explanatory hypotheses.</title><p>Causal path labels refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Hypothesis</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Causal paths</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Sites tested</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Bottom-up diversity:</bold><break/>Host plant diversity impacts insect richness through multiple mechanisms, such as reducing host density, masking or amplifying host signals, or altering the proportion of specialist herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agrawal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbosa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Root, 1973</xref>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">All models;<break/>paths A, C</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">All sites</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Neighborhood effects:</bold><break/>Plant diversity directly affects herbivory through mechanisms which do not alter herbivore diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agrawal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbosa et al., 2009</xref>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">All models;<break/>paths B, D</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">All sites</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Water affects herbivore diversity:</bold> Changes in water availability induce changes to plant nutrition and defenses which can benefit or harm different herbivore taxa, leading to changes in herbivore diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gely et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lenhart et al., 2015</xref>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Models I, II;<break/>path G</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Water affects herbivory:</bold> Water addition directly affects plant physiology, altering both the nutritive quality of plant tissue and the ability of plants to combat herbivores and leading to changes in herbivory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">White, 1974</xref>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Models I, III;<break/>path F</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>We conducted common garden experiments at five sites across Central and South America to test the insurance hypothesis by quantifying (1) the relative strength of intra- and interspecific plant richness in driving ecosystem function and (2) the effects of increased water availability on ecosystem function.

First, the strength of effects of intraspecific richness on higher trophic levels is comparable to that of interspecific richness, supporting our predictions and corroborating recent studies demonstrating the importance of intraspecific richness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raffard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koricheva and Hayes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cook-Patton et al., 2011</xref>). However, the direction of the effect of intraspecific richness on herbivory, insect richness, and plant survival can vary dramatically from the direction of effect of interspecific richness, in contrast to our predictions. Second, we found that perturbations in water availability can have complex effects on herbivores and plant survival, and that these effects can be modulated by plant diversity in a context-sensitive manner. While our prediction that water availability would influence herbivory across sites was supported, our results suggest that biodiversity loss and climatic perturbations may have dramatically different effects on ecosystem function at local scales, which may diminish our ability to predict how local communities will change as anthropogenic stressors increase.</p><p>As we did not directly measure plant stress or nutrition, it is difficult to determine the exact mechanism through which water addition reduced herbivory. The presence of an El Niño weather pattern during the course of the Peru experiment may have led the water addition treatment to relieve plants from drought stress, while water addition in Costa Rica and Ecuador may have added to water stress in treated plants as these sites received an above average level of rainfall during the course of the experiment. Despite this, water addition consistently suppressed herbivory in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru under natural levels of <italic>Piper</italic> diversity, suggesting that predicted increases in precipitation in the next century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Field et al., 2014a</xref>) will dramatically alter the flow of resources from primary producers. Although we were only able to record the richness of insect herbivory patterns, this measure is indicative of the functional diversity of insect herbivores on <italic>Piper</italic> and changes to this value represent changes in interactions between <italic>Piper</italic> and higher trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho et al., 2014</xref>). As such, the additional reduction in effects of water addition on insect richness when <italic>Piper</italic> richness was low suggest that biodiversity loss in tropical systems will alter the ability of higher trophic levels to respond to environmental perturbations.</p><p>While our prediction that increased <italic>Piper</italic> interspecific richness would lead to increased insect diversity was met in the majority of sites, interspecific richness was associated with decreased insect diversity in Costa Rica and Peru. As herbivore taxa can be differently affected by manipulations of diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agrawal et al., 2006</xref>), variation in the direction of the effect of intra- and interspecific richness may be due in part to variation in the composition of insect communities and herbivore pressure measured across sites. Changes in neighborhood effects when small numbers of plant species dominate a community can lead either to the reduction or increase of herbivore pressure, dependent both on the nature of plant species lost and on herbivore species present in a given community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbosa et al., 2009</xref>). As such, local variation in community composition has the potential to greatly alter the effects of both climate change and biodiversity loss on ecosystem function.</p><p>Although experimental methods varied somewhat between study sites, this cannot fully explain the level of heterogeneity observed in ecosystem response. For example, the methods employed in Costa Rica and Ecuador were nearly identical, and yet the directions of effect of intra- and interspecific diversity on insect richness were reversed in these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). There was considerable variation in both biotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and abiotic factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) across sites, which may have contributed to the heterogeneity observed in ecosystem response to <italic>Piper</italic> diversity. Regardless of how biodiversity loss affects ecosystem function at large scales, variation in abiotic and biotic factors at locals scales can alter these effects, reducing our ability to predict how anthropogenic activity will alter ecosystem function. This is especially relevant in tropical systems, which have been the subject of far fewer studies of ecosystem function than temperate ecosystems. As such, our knowledge of local effects on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function remains limited in these systems.</p><p>A long-standing question in ecology has been the extent to which ecosystem function increases with biodiversity and if this relationship plateaus at a level past which ecological redundancy predominates. Recent results from less complex temperate grassland systems suggest that these ecosystems can be described by a mostly linear relationship between richness and function, where even rare species make unique contributions to ecosystem function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Isbell et al., 2011</xref>). In these systems, high contingency can be expected, where ecosystem-level effects will depend on most of the interacting species. In contrast, we might expect that diverse, tropical communities could be characterized by greater ecological redundancy and thus be subject to less contingency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Naeem, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosenfeld, 2002</xref>). Despite these expectations, our results demonstrate heterogeneity in ecosystem response to changes in both intraspecific and interspecific richness in five tropical sites, suggesting that complexity in these systems may not reduce the contingency effects of biodiversity loss. Understanding the impact of biodiversity loss in tropical forests is fundamental to our ability to conserve those systems, and our findings highlight the importance of approaching the study of changes in ecosystem function as context-sensitive responses in complex ecosystems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study sites and focal plant genus</title><p>We conducted a large-scale transplant experiment replicated across five sites spanning 42° latitude in the Neotropics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) encompassing a range in annual precipitation from 1271 to 4495 mm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Experimental plants were propagated from cuttings of naturally occurring <italic>Piper</italic> plants (typically with three nodes and zero to one leaves). At each site a subset of naturally occurring <italic>Piper</italic> species was selected to act as a species pool for each experimental plot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These species were selected to constitute a breadth of genetic and functional diversity representative of the <italic>Piper</italic> community present at each site. In all sites except Uaimii, experimental plots measured 4 m in diameter and contained 12 <italic>Piper</italic> individuals, planted either in pots with locally derived soil (for experiments manipulating water availability) or directly into the ground (for experiments without water additions in Mogi-Guaçu and Uaimii; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and cultivated without fertilizer or irrigation. Interspecific richness treatment levels consisted of single species monoculture plots, two species plots, and high richness plots with the maximum number of species available to produce cuttings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The minimum number of <italic>Piper</italic> species in a high richness plot was 3 in Uaimii, and the maximum was 12 in Costa Rica and Ecuador. In plots with more than one species, species were randomly sampled from the species pool for that site.</p><p>An intraspecific richness treatment was crossed with the interspecific richness treatment. Intraspecific richness was manipulated by clones taken from a single mother plant (low richness) or individual cuttings all taken from unique mother plants (high richness). In the high intraspecific richness treatment, cuttings were from different <italic>Piper</italic> individuals growing at least 10 m apart, to eliminate the likelihood of a shared root system thus representing genetically unique individuals. In Costa Rica and Ecuador, the high interspecific richness plots only included individuals from unique mother plants because all cuttings were taken from different species.</p><p>A water addition treatment was crossed with the inter- and intraspecific richness treatments in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru in order to examine how IPCC predicted regional mid-century increases in precipitation in these regionsmay affect herbivory and trophic interactions. Plants were cultivated in 5–6 L pots with drainage holes. Each potted plant under the water addition treatment was watered with 2 L of water twice per month in Costa Rica and Ecuador. In Peru, 2 L of water were added to plants every 3 months. Water was rapidly applied as a flooding event to completely saturate the soil. Plant cultivation periods lasted in excess of 1 year at all sites, and as such water was added in both the wet season and dry season. Experimental plots were randomly located in the study sites; in Mogi-Guaçu and Uaimii they were organized in three replicate blocks. There was a minimum of 20 m between plots in blocks and 100 m between blocks. Randomly located plots were separated by a minimum of 50 m. Experimental periods lasted between 1.4 and 2.8 years, depending on the site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), and all measurements of herbivory were conducted on leaves that were initiated during these periods. Cuttings were replaced if they died during the first 3 months of the experiment. One of the authors was present at all of the sites for multiple visits to ensure as much standardization of treatment applications as possible.</p><p><italic>Piper</italic> mortality resulted in a reduction in species richness in many plots and the loss of some treatment combinations, notably the loss of all <italic>Piper</italic> in unwatered, low intraspecific richness plots in Peru (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Plots originally planted as high interspecific richness treatments had a final richness of between 1 and 12 species in Costa Rica, 9 and 11 species in Ecuador, 1 and 3 species in Peru, 2 and 4 species in Mogi, and only 2 species in Uaimii.</p><p>To determine the effects of site variation in natural levels of precipitation on the outcomes of the water addition treatment, the absolute level of precipitation and precipitation anomalies relative to climate normals were collected for each month of the experimental periods in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Climate data for Costa Rica were obtained from La Selva Biological Station. Data for Ecuador and Peru were obtained using TerraClimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abatzoglou et al., 2018</xref>), and an interpolation error in the precipitation for Peru in February 2016 was corrected using data from the National Service of Meteorology and Hydrology of Peru (SENAMHI).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Measures of herbivory and insect richness</title><p>Plots were open to naturally occurring herbivores, and herbivory was recorded by taking photographs of all the experimental leaves at the end of the experimental period. Additional photos were taken every 3 months in Uaimii and Mogi-Guaçu, and in the first 5 months of the experiment in Costa Rica. These data were used to measure herbivory and to determine the types of herbivores feeding on leaves based on patterns of damage. When herbivores were observed on plants, they were photographed but were left to continue feeding so as to not interfere with the experiment. Herbivory was quantified by eye for each type of herbivore on each leaf by a single parataxonomist with extensive experience measuring herbivory on <italic>Piper</italic> following established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dyer et al., 2010</xref>). The amount of leaf area consumed was measured in relation to the total leaf area by visually dividing the leaf into equal sized segments to determine the percent area missing. This was measured as a continuous value to the greatest possible accuracy, typically 1–5% of the total leaf area. Insect herbivores were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible based on their damage patterns (genus for specialist Lepidoptera, family for generalist Lepidoptera, family for Coleoptera, order for Orthoptera). Direct observations of herbivores were rare, so only damage patterns were used in analyses. As insect damage patterns on leaves are tightly correlated with insect richness in tropical forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho et al., 2014</xref>), the different types of damage recorded were used as proxy for the richness of above ground insect herbivores on <italic>Piper</italic>. Hereafter, the term ‘insect richness’ refers to the richness of insect herbivore damage patterns on plants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analyses</title><p>The percentage of leaf tissue consumed by each insect taxon (based on damage patterns) on individual leaves was summed to determine the total percentage of herbivory on each leaf, and the variance in herbivory was calculated as the variance in leaf damage within each plant in a plot. Due to high mortality rates across sites, <italic>Piper</italic> interspecific richness in each plot was the final number of <italic>Piper</italic> species present in each plot at the end of the experiment (rather than the number of species planted) and was analyzed as a continuous covariate rather than a categorical treatment. Because most plant deaths occurred early in the experiments, final <italic>Piper</italic> interspecific richness more accurately reflects the local plant richness experienced by herbivores. Interspecific diversity for each plot was analyzed as the proportion of the interspecific diversity present in the species pools at each site. This enabled easier comparisons between intra- and interspecific richness, as intraspecific richness was only quantified as low and high, where high treatments represent the maximum intraspecific richness available at each site. The effect of intra- and interspecific diversity on each response variable is reported as the change in response as diversity changes from the lowest possible value at each site to the highest.</p><p>The effects of intraspecific richness, interspecific richness, and water addition on percent leaf area consumed, the percentage of damaged leaves, variance in herbivory, and insect richness were analyzed across and within sites using HBMs. This framework acts as the Bayesian equivalent of a random-effects model where site is a random effect, allowing for generalized parameter estimates across sites. Analyses testing <italic>Piper</italic> intraspecific richness and interspecific richness were conducted using data from all sites; the effects of water addition and its interactions with richness were conducted using data from Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Peru. Due to high mortality in Peru, interactions between the water addition and intraspecific richness treatments could not be modeled for measures of herbivory or insect richness, and were only tested for survival.</p><p>We acknowledge that treatment-level combinations were not the same across the different sites, but experimental designs of this nature are encompassed within the framework of random-effects models, where different levels of random factors, such as site or year, consist of treatment levels that are unique to that site or year. This type of experimental design goes back to the origins of mixed models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fisher, 1919</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Henderson et al., 1959</xref>), and the lack of interactions between fixed and random effects increases generality in these models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abelson, 1995</xref>). Even at a single site, manipulated variables in ecological experiments do not even consist of the same manipulations across all of the units of replication, as they suffer from problems such as multiple versions of treatments, interference, and noncompliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimmel et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>BSEMs were constructed for each site using all treatments as exogenous variables and insect richness and herbivory as endogenous variables. Three path models were developed under the assumptions that (1) intraspecific and interspecific richness may influence herbivory both directly and indirectly by modulating insect richness, (2) water addition may influence both herbivory and insect richness, and (3) insect richness may influence herbivory directly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Models I-III were tested in Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Peru, while a model without the water addition variable was used to analyze data from Mogi-Guaçu and Uaimii (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additional models incorporating interactions between intraspecific richness, interspecific richness, and water availability were tested in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru.</p><p>Models were run at the leaf level for herbivory and insect richness, and at the plant level for the percentage of leaves with damage, variance of herbivory, and <italic>Piper</italic> survival. For all HBMs and BSEMs, model convergence was estimated visually using traceplots and an <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> discriminatory threshold of 1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gelman and Rubin, 1992</xref>). Model fit was determined via PPCs using the sum of squares of the residuals as the discriminatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gelman et al., 1996</xref>). A PPC near 0.5 indicates a high model fit, while values near one or zero indicate poor fit. BSEMs were further compared using the deviance information criterion.</p><p>All Bayesian models were written in JAGS via the jagsUI package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kellner et al., 2021</xref>) using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with weakly informative priors. Residuals were modeled as normally distributed based on PPC comparisons between models. Models using gamma distributions for herbivory and binomial distributions for damage presence and mortality were found to consistently underestimate the magnitude of variance in the data based on PPC. For the majority of models, MCMC runs were conducted for 10,000 iterations using the first 1000 iterations as a burn-in phase to generate posterior distributions of parameter estimates for each response variable. HBMs modeling interactions required 20,000 iterations with the first 5000 as burn-ins for all models to consistently converge. Mean parameter estimates and 95% credible intervals (CIs) were calculated for all responses. 95% CIs which do not cross the y-axis are typically associated with less than a 2.5% type S error rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gelman and Tuerlinckx, 2000</xref>). A posterior PD was calculated based on the percentage of the posterior distribution responding in the same direction as the median response. A PD of 95%, for example, indicates that the same direction of response (e.g. a positive or negative response) was observed in 95% of iterations, regardless of the magnitude of the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Makowski et al., 2019</xref>). PDs less than 95% indicate lower confidence that a relationship exists, but can still be interpreted as the probability that an effect exists.</p><p>To analyze the effects of the experimental treatments on plant survival, survivorship curves were constructed for all sites. Analyses of <italic>Piper</italic> survival were based on the initially planted interspecific richness treatment of each plot because mortality occurred early in the experiment. The effects of water addition, intra- and interspecific richness, and species identity on <italic>Piper</italic> survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models. All data were analyzed using R software v4.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">R Development Core Team, 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Mean parameter estimates and probability of direction (PD) for the effects of increases in intraspecific diversity, interspecific richness, water availability, and insect richness on measures of herbivory, plant mortality, and insect richness.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-86988-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Study site characteristics and experimental details.</title><p>*Climate data from La Selva Biological station are for the experimental period (2015–2018) and were provided by the Organization for Tropical Studies.

The results are clear that lack of water leads to lower plant survival and altered herbivory. The results varied substantially among sites. The caveats are that ecosystem processes beyond water availability are not investigated although they are brought into play in the title and in the paper, that herbivory beyond leaf damage was not reported (there might be none, reader needs to be shown the evidence for this), that herbivore diversity is defined by leaf damage (authors need to give evidence that this is a valid inference), that the plots were isolated from herbivores beyond their borders, that the effects of extreme climate events were isolated to Peru, that intraspecific variation in the host plants needs to be explained and interpreted in more detail, the results as reported are extremely complicated, the discussion is overly long and diffuse.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86988.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This is an important and large experimental study examining the effects of plant species richness, plant genotypic richness, and soil water availability on herbivory patterns on Piper species in tropical forests.</p><p>A major strength is the size of the study and the fact that it tackled so many potentially important factors simultaneously. The authors examined both interspecific plant diversity and intraspecific plant diversity. They crossed that with a water availability treatment. And they repeated the experiment across five geographically separated sites.</p><p>The authors find that both water availability and plant diversity, intraspecific and interspecific, influence herbivore diversity and herbivory, but that the effects differ in important ways across sites. I found the study to be solid and the results to be very convincing. The results will help the field grapple with the importance of environmental change and biodiversity loss and how they structure communities and alter species

the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #1 for identifying the major caveats of the paper, and have split them out into separate comments below to address them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment (1) The caveats are that ecosystem processes beyond water availability are not investigated although they are brought into play in the title and in the paper</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: We disagree that water availability is the only ecosystem process investigated in this study, as herbivory, plant mortality, and the maintenance of diversity in higher trophic levels are important processes within ecosystems. We have added text to the abstract and introduction clarifying that we consider these response measures to be ecosystem processes. Further language to this effect already exists in the abstract, methods, and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment (2) That herbivory beyond leaf damage was not reported (there might be none, the reader needs to be shown the evidence for this)</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: This is typically how herbivory is assessed in ecological studies, and our focus is on folivores. There may be additional herbivory in the form of fluid-sucking insects, shoot/root herbivory, etc., but these were not assessed. It would be interesting to assess these other forms of herbivory to see if they respond similarly with additional studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment (3) That herbivore diversity is defined by leaf damage (authors need to give evidence that this is a valid inference)</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: We thank reviewer #1 for pointing out the lack of written support for this claim. We have modified the methods (lines 138-139; 214-217) to clarify that this is a useful proxy for insect richness in the Piper system, and have added citations demonstrating it has been found to correlate well with insect richness in tropical forests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment (4) That the plots were isolated from herbivores beyond their borders</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: This was not an assumption of the study. We have modified the methods (line 200) to make this clearer to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment (5) That the effects of extreme climate events were isolated to Peru</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: This was not an assumption of the study, rather it is an observation. While we consider it important to include observed climate differences between sites in the interpretation of our results, it was not necessary for there to be extreme climate events at other sites as we consider manipulated water availability to represent changes in precipitation that are expected to occur at these sites with climate change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment (6) That intraspecific variation in the host plants needs to be explained and interpreted in more detail</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: We thank reviewer #1 for identifying that our current explanations needed development. We have modified the introduction to explore potential mechanisms relating intraspecific diversity to ecosystem function based on recent studies, and have modified the discussion to bring focus to why the effects of intraspecific differ from interspecific.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Comment (1) Pare this material down to simpler results. The most significant to me is the intraspecific variation in damage. Were this broken out and reported in some detail it could be quite interesting. I find the results to be a confusing blizzard of multiple factors that differ among sites; after reading the paper twice I could not recall the takeaway lesson beyond that drought wrecks the diversity of herbivores and sometimes even kills the host plant.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: We agree that the results are complicated given the variation in effects among sites, but this variation and complexity is important – and is in itself is one of the takeaway points. Unfortunately, nature is not simple. We have made several large edits to the results section, including the removal of methodological and otherwise redundant information, to hopefully bring the major takeaways into focus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Comment (1) This is an important and large experimental study examining the effects of plant species richness, plant genotypic richness, and soil water availability on herbivory patterns on Piper species in tropical forests.</p><p>A major strength is the size of the study and the fact that it tackled so many potentially important factors simultaneously. The authors examined both interspecific plant diversity and intraspecific plant diversity. They crossed that with a water availability treatment. And they repeated the experiment across five geographically separated sites.</p><p>The authors find that both water availability and plant diversity, intraspecific and interspecific, influence herbivore diversity and herbivory, but that the effects differ in important ways across sites. I found the study to be solid and the results to be very convincing. The results will help the field grapple with the importance of environmental change and biodiversity loss and how they structure communities and alter species interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: We thank reviewer #2 for their kind words.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Comment (1) I was confused about why the authors measured species diversity/richness as a proportion of the species pool. This means that the metric of richness decreases if species are added to the species pool but not the plot/experiment. I think I understand it, but I suggest the authors explain this choice.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: We thank reviewer #2 for pointing out that this was confusing. We have clarified the methods (lines 228-232) to explain that this choice was made to allow easier comparison between intra- and interspecific richness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment (2) One of the stronger estimated relationships was a positive effect of plant species richness on insect richness. I found it a little hard to interpret this relationship. Is this just because there are host species specialists? So, with more host species there are more herbivore species? Or does insect richness increase multiplicatively with increasing plant species richness? One way to look for this would be for the authors to examine the relationship between plant species richness and the average number of herbivore damage types per plant species.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: We agree that this is important for the reader to understand and have added text to the introduction and discussion sections explaining that this is the expectation based on theory and other empirical studies. We have additionally added text to the discussion (lines 386-388) pointing out that this pattern was not observed at all sites. While we agree that it would be interesting to explore if this effect was additive or multiplicative, we do not believe this is in the scope of the paper due to the methods used to measure insect richness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment (3) Unless I missed it, some important information about the models was missing. E.g., what distributions were assumed for each of the variables? Any transformations?</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: We thank reviewer #2 for pointing this out, this information has been added to the methods (lines 272-274)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment (4) Why is there no model with water addition affecting insect richness directly but not percent herbivory directly?</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: While we originally decided to not include this model due to lack of theoretical support and low statistical performance, we have added references to this model (now model II) in the methods and results for consistency and to make model performance clearer to the reader. We have additionally moved supplemental table S1 to the main text to make the models and hypotheses tested by each model more accessible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment (5) Fig. 2. What are the percentages above the figures? Maybe PD values?</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: These values are now clarified in the figure caption</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment (6) L364 &quot;can differ dramatically&quot; This is vague and confusing. Differ in what way? From each other? Did the authors really expect plant richness to have the same effect on herbivory and plant survival? What would it mean anyway for plant richness to have the same effect on herbivory and plant survival?</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: We agree that the language here is confusing and thank reviewer #1 for drawing our attention to it. We have modified the discussion (lines 363-365) to clarify that the direction of effect of intraspecific richness can vary from the direction of effect of interspecific richness, rather than the effects on different response variables varying from each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment (7) L 375 &quot;only meaningful differences&quot; This statement feels a little overly strong. It seems like there is a good argument for this, but there could be other things going on.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: We agree that the language here was unnecessarily strong, and have modified the discussion (lines 398-403) to focus on the lack of difference between methodologies at these two sites, and the observed differences in climate and community structure at each site.</p></body></sub-article></article>
