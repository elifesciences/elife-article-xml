A substantial body of literature investigated accompanying neurophysiological changes, focusing on the most dominant feature of the human EEG signal: the alpha oscillation. Recent developments in EEG signal-processing show that conventional measures of alpha power are confounded by various factors and need to be decomposed into periodic and aperiodic components, which represent distinct underlying brain mechanisms. It is therefore unclear how each part of the signal changes during brain maturation. Using multivariate Bayesian generalized linear models, we examined aperiodic and periodic parameters of alpha activity in the largest openly available pediatric dataset (N=2529, age 5-22 years) and replicated these findings in a preregistered analysis of an independent validation sample (N=369, age 6-22 years). First, the welldocumented age-related decrease in total alpha power was replicated. However, when controlling for the aperiodic signal component, our findings provided strong evidence for an age-related increase in the aperiodic-adjusted alpha power. As reported in previous studies, also relative alpha power revealed a maturational increase, yet indicating an underestimation of the underlying relationship between periodic alpha power and brain maturation. The aperiodic intercept and slope decreased with increasing age and were highly correlated with total alpha power. Consequently, earlier interpretations on age-related changes of total alpha power need to be reconsidered, as elimination of active synapses rather links to decreases in the aperiodic intercept. Instead, analyses of diffusion tensor imaging data indicate that the maturational increase in aperiodic-adjusted alpha power is related to increased thalamocortical connectivity. Functionally, our results suggest that increased thalamic control of cortical alpha power is linked to improved attentional performance during brain maturation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>1/f</kwd><kwd>alpha</kwd><kwd>brain development</kwd><kwd>thalamocortical connectivity</kwd><kwd>DTI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100014_175875</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langer</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007214</institution-id><institution>Velux Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langer</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Applying decomposition of oscillatory and aperiodic signal components to developmental EEG data provides a solution for the problems in the investigation of alpha power during brain maturation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Childhood and adolescence are critical stages of the human lifespan, in which the brain undergoes various and complex micro- and macroscopic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Giedd et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lebel et al., 2008</xref>). The typical emergence of mental illnesses during childhood and adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>) further indicates fundamental maturational reorganization. It is therefore particularly important to understand these maturational changes in brain structure and function, which are accompanied by neurophysiological changes. A substantial body of literature has focused on investigating these neurophysiological changes with electroencephalography (EEG) (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Perone, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Segalowitz et al., 2010</xref>). Cognitive functions such as attention and memory, which undergo critical changes during maturation, have frequently been associated with EEG alpha activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Foxe and Snyder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Klimesch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Klimesch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Niedermeyer, 1999</xref>). This lead to the notion that developmental changes in alpha activity reveals mechanisms of cortical manifestations of cognitive function. Indeed, numerous studies have investigated developmental changes in this alpha oscillation and reported evidence of an increase in the individual alpha frequency (IAF) at around 7–14 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cragg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Díaz de León et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Klimesch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lindsley, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Marcuse et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Niedermeyer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Somsen et al., 1997</xref>). However, the evidence is less clear about the amplitude of this alpha oscillation, termed alpha power. Absolute power was found to decrease with increasing age in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Díaz de León et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gasser et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harmony et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lindsley, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Whitford et al., 2007</xref>) but not in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clarke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Somsen et al., 1997</xref>). A potential confound is the utilization of fixed-frequency boundaries (e.g. 8–13 Hz), which neglects the slowing of the IAF during development. For instance, peak frequency in childhood is around 6 Hz but increases to 10 Hz in adolescents. Hence, age-related power decreases are underestimated when the slower alpha oscillation of younger children is not properly captured by predefined frequency limits, which leads to lower power values. Consequently, individualized alpha frequency bands need to be extracted, which are centered on the individual IAF of each subject (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Donoghue et al., 2021</xref> for simulations visualizing confounding effects of the peak frequency on band power). In addition, thickening of the skull and other maturational processes that are unrelated to changes in neural activity manifest as changes in overall neural power. Thus, they pose a crucial confound in interpreting the relationship between alpha power and age. To overcome this latter limitation, studies have examined alpha power as relative to the overall power of the spectrum, relative alpha power, which has yielded more consistent results indicating an increase of alpha power with increasing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clarke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cragg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Díaz de León et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harmony et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">John et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Somsen et al., 1997</xref>). However, relative power measures of different frequency bands are by definition highly interdependent, as the frequency band of interest is normalized by the power of all the other frequency bands measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gómez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Somsen et al., 1997</xref>). For example, power changes in other frequency bands, such as the theta band, manifest as changes in relative alpha power, even though the true oscillatory alpha power may remain stable (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, non-oscillatory changes in the power spectrum introduce confounds in the analysis of relative band power measures (see simulated example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>). This was previously observed by simulations in previous studies showing that non-oscillatory changes affect both relative band power measures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Donoghue et al., 2021</xref> and band power ratio measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donoghue et al., 2020a</xref>). Therefore, the extent to which these earlier works on alpha power and brain maturation are in effect confounded by changes in other frequency bands, by non-oscillatory variations, or by a slowing of the IAF remains unclear. To address this question, true alpha oscillatory power needs to be separated from other, non-oscillatory signal components.</p><p>Recent methodological developments have provided a means by which this separation can be achieved. These new approaches decompose measured power into periodic and aperiodic signal components (see Figure 4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Donoghue et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hughes et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wen and Liu, 2016</xref>). The aperiodic signal (i.e. ‘1/f signal’) is characterized by its intercept and slope, as its amplitude decreases with higher frequencies f. The aperiodic signal contains important physiological information (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">He, 2014</xref> for a comprehensive review of the functional significance and potential generative mechanisms of aperiodic activity). More specifically, the aperiodic slope has been linked to the synchronicity of activity in the underlying neural population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Usher et al., 1995</xref>) and its balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, the aperiodic slope is also modulated by task performance and sensory stimulation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">He, 2014</xref>). Conversely, the aperiodic intercept has been linked to general spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Voytek and Knight, 2015</xref>). Overall, the aperiodic signal needs to be considered during the analysis of spectral power rather than measuring power relative to the absolute zero (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Donoghue et al., 2020b</xref>). Applying this new approach of spectral decomposition allows to extract an aperiodic-adjusted measure of alpha power, which is independent of oscillatory activity in other frequency bands and changes in overall power and aperiodic activity.</p><p>Recent studies adopted this methodology and found age-related changes in the aperiodic signal (i.e., decreased intercept and flattened slope) during childhood and adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cellier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hill et al., 2022</xref>) and from childhood to middle age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donoghue et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">He et al., 2019</xref>). These results further pointed out the importance of considering the aperiodic signal in the investigation of alpha power during brain maturation. However, it remains largely unknown how aperiodic-adjusted alpha power evolves during this critical phase of life. The few studies performed so far have not found any significant association between aperiodic-adjusted alpha power during childhood and adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cellier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hill et al., 2022</xref>) and from childhood to middle age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">He et al., 2019</xref>). Due to comparatively small sample sizes in these studies, it remains unclear whether the aperiodic-adjusted alpha power truly remains stable in this period of life or whether too little statistical power was provided to detect changes in this newly emerging measure of alpha power. Furthermore, conventional measures of total and relative alpha power were either not reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cellier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hill et al., 2022</xref>), or did not show any relation to age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">He et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, comparisons and integration of these results with the large body of literature investigating maturational changes in total and relative alpha power remain limited.</p><p>To overcome limitations of previous studies, we analyzed the currently largest openly available pediatric EEG data set (N=2529), comprising children adolescents and young adults aged between 5 and 22 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2017</xref>) and validated the results in a second, preregistered analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/7uwy2">https://osf.io/7uwy2</ext-link>) of a dataset consisting of 369 children, adolescents, and young adults aged between 6 and 22 years.</p><p>Based on animal studies investigating cortical and subcortical neural generators of alpha activity in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bishop, 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lopes da Silva, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Steriade et al., 1990</xref>), it is generally assumed that the thalamus and thalamocortical interactions strongly modulate cortical alpha activity. It can thus be hypothesized that changes in the alpha oscillation in the maturing brain are driven by structural changes of the thalamus and thalamocortical connectivity. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study investigated the relationship between anatomical maturation of the thalamus and its connectivity and alpha oscillatory power during childhood and adolescence. To close this gap, we further examined how thalamic structural changes relate to the observed changes in the different measures of alpha power. We employed magnet resonance images (MRI) to operationalize changes in the thalamus in terms of thalamic volume, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to estimate thalamocortical connectivity by white matter integrity of the thalamic radiation. This was done in a subsample of the larger main dataset, for which magnet resonance images (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were additionally available.</p><p>Taken together, the present study aims to delineate the role of alpha oscillations during brain maturation by investigating conventional and newly emerging alpha oscillatory parameters, aperiodic signal components (see Table 7) and its underlying anatomical basis in a large sample of children, adolescents and young adults. Our first goal is to replicate previous literature that reported an age-related increase of the IAF, increased relative alpha power and decreased total alpha power during brain maturation. However, we hypothesize that the relation of alpha band power and brain maturation is no longer present when adjusting alpha power for the aperiodic signal component and for the age-related increase of the IAF. Additionally, based on previous literature we expect a decrease in the aperiodic intercept and a flattening of the aperiodic slope during brain maturation. Finally, as the aperiodic-adjusted individualized alpha power is unbiased by changes in other frequency bands and the aperiodic signal component, and therefore is likely to provide the most accurate reflection of the true oscillatory activity, we hypothesize that this measure shows a significant association with thalamic anatomical measures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Main analysis</title><p>The relation of age to the various parameters estimated in the Bayesian regression model are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Visualization of data of the main HBN sample used in the Bayesian regression model.</title><p>Solid lines represent fitted regression lines.

Our results replicated the well-documented finding of an increasing IAF in this developmental phase of life from childhood to adolescence. The main aim of the study was to delineate the developmental trajectory of the power of the alpha oscillation by considering changes in the individual alpha frequency and aperiodic signal components in a large sample size. A significant decrease of total individualized alpha power was observed with increasing age across samples. However, when correcting for the aperiodic signal, the results changed considerably. The aperiodic-adjusted individualized alpha power increased significantly from childhood to adolescence, which is consistent with the results obtained from relative alpha power in the present study and in previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clarke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cragg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Díaz de León et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harmony et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">John et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Somsen et al., 1997</xref>). The aperiodic signal showed a decreased intercept during brain maturation and a flattened slope. Results were largely consistent across the subsample of the HBN dataset without any given diagnosis, the full HBN dataset, and the validation analyses. However, in the validation dataset and the HBN subsample without any given diagnoses, aperiodic-adjusted but not relative alpha power showed significant age-related increases, indicating a risk of false-negative results when investigating relative alpha power in brain maturation. The covariates of psychiatric diagnoses did not show any significant influences on oscillatory alpha or aperiodic signal parameters in the two datasets. Only in the Bayesian sequential updating analysis, combining both datasets, ADHD was associated with decreased aperiodic-adjusted alpha power. Future research is needed to investigate possible relations between psychiatric diseases and periodic and aperiodic EEG signal components in more detail, which is beyond the scope of the present report. Gender effects on alpha power and aperiodic signal components were found in the HBN dataset; however, these effects did not generalize on the validation sample. Importantly, when relating alpha power measures to anatomical measures derived from DTI, only aperiodic-adjusted and relative alpha power showed a significant relation to the white matter integrity of the thalamic radiations, but total alpha power did not.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Age related changes in IAF and total canonical alpha power</title><p>The often-replicated increase of IAF from childhood to adolescence was also observed here. Higher IAF was previously linked to better sensorimotor abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mierau et al., 2016</xref>) and increased memory performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Klimesch, 1999</xref>). It was hypothesized that the mechanism underlying the increased memory performance is an increase in the speed of information processing, which was directly linked to the IAF by various studies investigating reaction time paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jin et al., 2006</xref>; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Klimesch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Surwillo, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Surwillo, 1961</xref>). This matches the findings of generally increased speed of information processing from childhood to adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kail, 2000</xref>). Thus, the increasing IAF observed during brain maturation may represent the neurophysiological correlate of increased speed of information processing. It has further been hypothesized that this is related to developmental increases in myelination and axon size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cragg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Segalowitz et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In terms of alpha power analyses, the IAF increase induces a bias when alpha power is investigated with the canonical fixed-frequency bands, as was predominantly done in earlier investigations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clarke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Díaz de León et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gasser et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harmony et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Klimesch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Somsen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Whitford et al., 2007</xref>. Although some of these studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Díaz de León et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gasser et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harmony et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Whitford et al., 2007</xref>, found an age-related decrease in this total canonical alpha power measure, the present study only demonstrated a significant relationship between canonical alpha power and age in the large samples consisting of both healthy children, adolescents and young adults and those diagnosed with ADHD or other psychiatric disorders. In contrast, the age effect on the alpha power adjusted for changes in IAF (i.e. total individualized alpha power) was significant across all datasets. It showed an effect size three times larger than that of the total canonical alpha power. Thus, the developmental decrease on total alpha power may be underestimated when using canonical frequency bands. This is because the slower alpha oscillation of younger children is not properly captured by predefined band limits and thus yields a lower alpha power value. Thus, we highly recommend refraining from using canonical fixed-frequency bands when investigating age-related changes in alpha power.</p><p>Even after accounting for the age-related changes in IAF, interpreting changes in total individualized alpha power still remains problematic. As noted earlier (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benninger et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">John et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Matthis et al., 1980</xref>), a relative alpha power measure should be preferred over total alpha power, as the latter is more dependent on non-neurophysiological changes such as skull thickness and skin conductivity and is consequently less reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">John et al., 1980</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Relative vs. aperiodic-adjusted individualized alpha power</title><p>Relative individualized alpha power exhibited a positive relation to age in the full HBN sample, in contrast to the decrease in total individualized alpha power relative to the developmental trajectory. Thus, when overall changes in the power spectrum are taken into account, alpha power increased with increasing age. However, normalizing alpha power by the power of all the other frequency bands measured poses problems for the interpretation of results. Post hoc simulations indicate that changes in power in other frequency bands (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>) induce changes in relative alpha power even when true oscillatory alpha power is kept constant. Furthermore, changes in the aperiodic signal induce a confound in the relative alpha power measure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>). This is further supported by simulations performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donoghue et al., 2020a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Donoghue et al., 2021</xref>. Consequently, the increase in relative alpha power observed with increasing age needs to be interpreted with caution, as changes in other frequency bands and in the aperiodic signal can potentially bias this finding. Our study confirmed an age-related decrease of the aperiodic intercept and a flattening of the aperiodic slope. Hence, because these changes in the aperiodic signal could induce changes in relative alpha power even though the true oscillatory pattern remains stable, this relative measure is no conclusive indicator of a true age-related increase in alpha power.</p><p>Nonetheless, the present findings on the empirical data demonstrated that both aperiodic-adjusted alpha power and relative alpha power show similar results with respect to a maturational increase. Thus, our results are in line with previous findings reporting age-related increases in relative alpha power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clarke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cragg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Díaz de León et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harmony et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">John et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Somsen et al., 1997</xref>). Additionally, the analyses relating alpha power measures to possible neuroanatomical (thalamocortical connectivity) and behavioral (visual attention task performance) correlates yielded very similar significant positive associations with both relative and aperiodic-adjusted alpha power. Supplementary, post hoc correlational analyses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) showed highly comparable associations between the aperiodic signal components with relative alpha power (aperiodic intercept: <italic>r</italic>=0.34, aperiodic slope: <italic>r</italic>=0.35) and with aperiodic-adjusted alpha power (aperiodic intercept: <italic>r</italic>=0.34, aperiodic slope: <italic>r</italic>=0.36), hence indicating no distinct confounding effects of either the aperiodic intercept or slope on relative alpha power. Moreover, these analyses showed a high correlation (<italic>r</italic>=0.88) between aperiodic-adjusted and relative alpha power. However, this also indicated still considerable residual unexplained variance (22.6%) between these two measures of alpha power. In fact, Bayesian regression model results demonstrated that maturational changes are underestimated when investigating relative alpha power (<italic>b</italic>=0.14) compared to aperiodic-adjusted alpha power (<italic>b</italic>=0.23), which is also reflected in post hoc performed correlational analyses between age and the two measures of alpha power (<italic>r</italic> <sub>relative alpha power</sub> = 0.11, <italic>r</italic> <sub>aperiodic-adjusted alpha power</sub> = 0.21). Importantly, the aperiodic-adjusted individualized alpha power showed consistent significant age-related increases in the main HBN sample, the HBN subsample of children without any given diagnosis, and the validation dataset. Conversely, the relative individualized alpha power only showed a significant association with age in the largest main HBN sample. Therefore, our results indicate that there is a risk of false negative results when investigating relative alpha power changes from childhood to young adulthood in sample sizes commonly used in neurophysiological studies. Hence, the developmental increase on periodic alpha power may be underestimated when using relative alpha power indices, which might be explained by a potential confounding bias of the aperiodic signal components and power in other frequency bands on the relative alpha power (see supplementary simulation studies in Appendix 1). Overall, aperiodic-adjusted alpha power should be preferred over relative alpha power when analyzing developmental trajectories during brain maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Age-related increase in aperiodic-adjusted individualized alpha power</title><p>A significant increase in aperiodic-adjusted individualized alpha power with increasing age was observed across samples. As discussed above, this measure of alpha power most likely reflects the true oscillatory changes in this phase of life, because its extraction is independent of changes in the aperiodic signal and other frequency bands. The separation of periodic and aperiodic activity minimizes confounding factors such as the observed maturational decreases in overall power (i.e. in the aperiodic intercept) or the maturational flattening of the aperiodic slope, which are inseparable in conventional measures of alpha power. This is further supported by post hoc correlational analyses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). High correlations were observed between total alpha power and the aperiodic intercept (<italic>r</italic>=0.83) and the aperiodic slope (<italic>r</italic>=0.63), which were considerably smaller in aperiodic-adjusted alpha power (aperiodic intercept: <italic>r</italic>=0.33, aperiodic slope: <italic>r</italic>=0.35). Thus, compared to aperiodic-adjusted alpha power, findings on age-related decreases in total alpha power are likely to be much more strongly driven by changes in the aperiodic signal, in particular by the decrease observed in the aperiodic intercept. Consequently, one could interpret that changes in total alpha power reflect changes in the aperiodic signal rather than periodic alpha power. Although other recent studies using smaller sample sizes and varying age ranges did not find an association of aperiodic-adjusted alpha power and brain maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cellier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hill et al., 2022</xref>), the present study provides strong evidence for an age-related increase across two large datasets.</p><p>Previous studies on age-related changes of alpha power during brain maturation speculated that decreased total oscillatory power may be due to synaptic pruning processes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cragg et al., 2011</xref>) and thus reflect decreased spiking activity. The increase in aperiodic-adjusted alpha power provides new insights into these interpretations: Decomposing the neural power spectra rather indicates that these processes relate to changes in the aperiodic signals intercept (see discussion section ‘Maturational changes in aperiodic signal components’). Another speculative hypothesis was that the observed developmental changes in the alpha band reflect structural changes in the thalamus and thalamocortical connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cragg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Whitford et al., 2007</xref>). However, this specific link was not formally investigated, but was based on early work on animal models, which explored adult cortical and subcortical neural generators of alpha activity. These models suggested that, in the adult animal brain, interacting thalamocortical loops may primarily be involved in the generation of the alpha rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bishop, 1936</xref>). Subsequent animal studies provided further evidence that the neural generators of alpha oscillations may be the occipital cortex, under strong guidance of the visual thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lopes da Silva, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lopes da Silva et al., 1973</xref>). So far, to the best of our knowledge, no studies were conducted to investigate if human maturational changes in the different measures of alpha power relate to anatomical changes in the thalamus and its connectivity. To close this missing link, we tested whether the resting-state alpha oscillatory power measures extracted here are related to anatomical measures of thalamic volume and thalamocortical connectivity, here measured by white matter integrity of the thalamic radiation. A significant positive relationship between white matter integrity of the thalamic radiation and aperiodic-adjusted individualized alpha power was observed. Thus, the current study provides evidence that the increase in aperiodic-adjusted alpha power (and relative alpha power) during brain maturation is related to increases in thalamocortical connectivity. The statistical models also indicated that this relation is not purely based on co-maturation of alpha power and structural connectivity, because significant relations were found between these measures after controlling for effects of age and the total intracranial volume. Total alpha power did not show any significant relation to these anatomical measures; hence, it is further indicated that this measure of alpha power is confounded by aperiodic signal components or non-neurophysiological changes during brain maturation. After age and total intracranial volume were controlled for, no association was found between thalamic volume and any of the alpha power measures. It could therefore be speculatively hypothesized that changes in cortical alpha oscillations are not related to anatomical changes in the thalamus. Instead, the increases observed in alpha power may relate to improved connectivity between the neural generators in the thalamus and cortical neural populations.</p><p>Alterations in thalamocortical connectivity have been positively linked to attention and working memory performance in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Charlton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hughes et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Ystad et al., 2011</xref>) and infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcauter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ball et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, these cognitive functions have typically also been associated with the amplitude of alpha oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bazanova and Vernon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Foxe and Snyder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Klimesch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Klimesch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Klimesch, 2012</xref>) and are well known to improve during brain maturation. Furthermore, a highly influential simultaneous EEG and fMRI study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Laufs et al., 2003</xref>) hypothesized, based on correlations between cortical EEG and the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in frontoparietal regions, that adult resting state alpha power is linked to internally focused attention. These findings indicate that maturational increases of thalamic regulation of cortical alpha power may relate to improvements in attentional performance. In fact, post hoc analyses supported this hypothesis by providing evidence that oscillatory alpha power is linked to performance in visual attention tasks, assessed by performance in the Flanker task. While age, gender, and handedness were controlled for, relative and aperiodic-adjusted individualized alpha power showed significant positive relations to the attentional performance when adjusting for multiple statistical comparisons, but total individualized alpha power did not. Taken together, contrary to findings based on total alpha power, aperiodic-adjusted individualized alpha power increased during brain maturation and seems likely to be related to increased thalamocortical connectivity. Functionally, this increase in alpha power is linked to improvements in attentional performance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Maturational changes in aperiodic signal components</title><p>The decreases in the aperiodic intercept and slope with increasing age are in line with previous observations in different age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cellier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donoghue et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">He et al., 2019</xref>). One explanation for this decrease of the aperiodic intercept may lie within maturational changes that are unrelated to neural mechanisms. As previous studies on EEG changes during brain maturation have suggested (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dustman et al., 1999</xref>), the thickening of the skull increases its resistance. This increased resistance could lead to the observed decrease in broadband EEG power, here reflected in a decrease in the aperiodic intercept. However, this maturational effect was also found in broadband power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gómez et al., 2017</xref>) and the aperiodic intercept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">He et al., 2019</xref>) in studies using magnetoencephalography (MEG), which is not affected by skull thickness.</p><p>Alternatively, as previous studies have shown that the aperiodic intercept is related to the overall spiking activity of the underlying neural population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miller et al., 2009</xref>), the decrease observed in the aperiodic intercept may reflect a reduced parieto-occipital spiking activity during brain maturation. This observation may be related to the finding that as much as 40% of synapses in the striate cortex are eliminated during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Huttenlocher and de Courten, 1987</xref>). This is further supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Whitford et al., 2007</xref>, who found a reduction of gray matter volume in parietal cortex co-occurring with a decrease in broadband EEG power during brain development, suggesting that this may reflect synaptic pruning processes. Yet, more research is needed to delineate possible mechanisms underlying this age-related decrease observed in the aperiodic intercept. An alternative explanation for the finding of a decreased intercept needs to be considered: As pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">He et al., 2019</xref>, a maturational flattening of the aperiodic signal imposes a decrease in the intercept due to the high correlation between the aperiodic intercept and slope (also observed in the main HBN dataset, <italic>r</italic>=0.89, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). To estimate whether the observed decrease of the aperiodic intercept is larger than expected by the rotation of the aperiodic slope requires estimation of not only the decrease of the aperiodic slope, but also the frequency at which the aperiodic signal rotates. Future research is needed to provide means by which this estimation can be achieved, considering also interindividual differences in the rotation frequency.</p><p>The flattening of the aperiodic signal in this age range may also be reflected in the commonly observed age-related decrease of power in low frequencies accompanied by an increase in power in higher frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cragg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Whitford et al., 2007</xref>). This phenomenon was speculated to be related to the elimination of synapses or changes in white matter structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Segalowitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Whitford et al., 2007</xref>); however, no significant relation of the aperiodic slope with white matter integrity of the thalamic radiation was found in the analyses performed here. An additional post hoc analysis also indicated no relation between the aperiodic signal parameters and global white matter integrity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Yet, considering a shift of the aperiodic slope in the interpretation of this shift in power of frequency bands could provide additional insights into this little-understood result. Flattening of the aperiodic slope has been linked to changes in the excitation–inhibition ratio of the neural population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gao et al., 2017</xref>), particularly to an increase in local excitatory feedback. This shift in the excitation–inhibition ratio causes temporally decorrelated spikes and thus increases in neural noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Voytek and Knight, 2015</xref>). This is supported by earlier studies relating a decreased aperiodic slope to more asynchronous activation patterns in neural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Usher et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, the flattened slope observed here might reflect increases in neural noise during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McIntosh, 2010</xref>). This may seem contradictory, as aging research has linked an increase in neural noise to age-related cognitive decline from adulthood to old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>). However, increasing neural noise might rather have beneficial effects in the earlier processes of brain maturation. Reviewing maturational studies that used EEG and fMRI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McIntosh, 2010</xref> concluded that the maturing brain develops from a deterministic to a more stochastic system in which the increased neural noise leads to enhancement of functional network potential.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Limitations</title><p>A limitation of the present study is the composition of the samples investigated, as they contain a large proportion of children, adolescents, and young adults in whom psychiatric disorders were diagnosed. Consequently, the samples are not representative of the general population in this age range. This may present a confound to the analysis of age trajectories of alpha power and the aperiodic signal, because psychiatric disorders have previously been linked to differences in resting state EEG band power (for a comprehensive review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Newson and Thiagarajan, 2018</xref>) and the aperiodic slope (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Robertson et al., 2019</xref>). However, control analyses using only healthy subsamples showed very similar results to analyses of the full sample. Additionally, the main and the validation analysis controlled for possible confounding effects by adding a categorical diagnosis variable as an additional predictor. No significant associations were found between clinical diagnoses and either oscillatory or aperiodic signal components within either dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has demonstrated the relevance of taking the alpha peak frequency and aperiodic signal components into account when assessing age-related changes in spectral power during brain maturation. Our results indicate that there is significant variation of aperiodic activity during childhood and adolescence, which poses a confound to earlier work. Moreover, canonically defined frequency bands render age-related changes in IAF and power inseparable. Accounting for these confounding factors, and using the largest openly available pediatric sample, the present report demonstrates that aperiodic-adjusted alpha power increases during brain maturation. Although previous recent studies did not find any relation between aperiodic-adjusted alpha power and age, the here applied robust statistical models provide strong evidence for an age related increase in a large dataset and across several control analyses. Moreover, the results on aperiodic-adjusted individualized alpha power and the aperiodic signal intercept and slope were confirmed in an independent preregistered validation study, indicating that these spectral EEG measures are robust markers of the maturing brain.</p><p>In addition, the spectral decomposition into periodic and aperiodic signal components provides explanations for the previous ambiguous results of studies investigating total or relative alpha power changes during brain maturation. The present study provides evidence that the maturational decreases in total alpha power are conflated by the maturational changes of the aperiodic signal components. Thus, previous interpretations that total alpha power may be related to the elimination of active synapses need to be reconsidered, as the decomposition of the neural power spectrum reveals that these processes may rather relate to decreases of the aperiodic intercept. Furthermore, the current report provides partial support of previous literature on age-related increases in relative alpha power, as these effects could only be replicated in the large dataset, but not in the smaller samples. Consequently, aperiodic-adjusted alpha power should be preferred over relative alpha power, as the latter measure underestimated age-related changes of true periodic alpha power and therefore yielded a risk of false negative results. Instead, aperiodic-adjusted alpha power increases with increasing age, and likely reflects the development of thalamocortical connectivity. Functionally, these maturational changes may relate to increased attentional performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All analysis code described below is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/4nzyk/">https://osf.io/4nzyk/</ext-link>.

The room was equipped with a chinrest to minimize head movements. Subjects were informed that EEG would be recorded while they rested with their eyes alternately open or closed. Instructions for the tasks were presented on the computer screen, and a research assistant answered questions from the participant from the adjacent control room through an intercom. Compliance with the task instructions was confirmed through a live video-feed to the control room. The task procedure was that participants rested with their eyes open for 20s (a total of 1min 40s), followed by 40s (a total of 3min 20s) with their eyes closed, repeated five times. Prerecorded verbal instructions automatically informed the participants when to open or close their eyes via loudspeakers. Participants were asked to maintain a fixed gaze on the fixation cross throughout EO blocks. The total duration of the EEG recording was 5min. The alternating order of EO and EC was designed to avoid fatigue and maintain vigilance. The duration of EC blocks was twice as long as EO blocks because eyes-closed data is more robust and contains fewer artifacts. This protocol has been used in various previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Langer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Langer et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Electroencephalography recording and preprocessing</title><p>The EEG was recorded at a sampling rate of 500 Hz using a high‐density 128‐channel EEG Geodesic Netamps system (Electrical Geodesics, Eugene, Oregon). The recording reference was at Cz, the vertex of the head, and impedances were kept below 40 kΩ.</p><p>All analyses were performed using MATLAB 2018b (The MathWorks, Inc, Natick, Massachusetts, United States). EEG data was automatically preprocessed using the current version (2.4.3) of the MATLAB toolbox Automagic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pedroni et al., 2019</xref>). Our pipeline consisted of the following steps. First, bad channels were detected by the algorithms implemented in the clean_rawdata eeglab plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/Plugin_list_process">http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/Plugin_list_process</ext-link>). A channel was defined as a bad electrode when data recorded by that electrode was correlated at less than 0.85 with an estimate based on other channels. Furthermore, a channel was defined as bad if it had more line noise relative to its signal than all other channels (four standard deviations). Finally, a channel was considered bad if it had a longer flat-line than 5 s. These bad channels were automatically removed and later interpolated using a spherical spline interpolation (EEGLAB function eeg_interp.m). The interpolation was later performed as a final step before the automatic quality assessment of the EEG files (see below). Next, data was filtered using a high-pass filter (–6 dB cut off: 0.5 Hz). Line noise artifacts were removed by applying Zapline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheveigné, 2020</xref>), removing seven power line components. Subsequently, independent component analysis (ICA) was performed. Components reflecting artifactual activity were classified by the pretrained classifier ICLabel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019</xref>). Components which were classified as any class of artifacts, including line noise, channel noise, muscle activity, eye activity, and heart artifacts, with a probability higher than 0.8 were removed from the data. Subsequently, residual bad channels were excluded if their standard deviation exceeded a threshold of 25 μV. Very high transient artifacts (&gt;±100 μV) were excluded from the calculation of the standard deviation of each channel. However, if this resulted in a significant loss of channel data (&gt;25%), the channel was removed from the data. After this, the pipeline automatically assessed the quality of the resulting EEG files based on four criteria: A data file was marked as bad-quality EEG and not included in the analysis if, first, the proportion of high-amplitude data points in the signals (&gt;30 μV) was larger than 0.20; second, more than 20% of time points showed a variance larger than 15 microvolt across channels; third, 30% of the channels showed high variance (&gt;15 μV); and fourth, the ratio of bad channels was higher than 0.3. Finally, 13 of 128 electrodes in the outermost circumference, attached to chin and neck, were excluded from further processing as they capture little brain activity and mainly record muscular activity. Additionally, 10 EOG electrodes were separated from the data and not used for further analysis, yielding a total of 105 EEG electrodes. Data was then referenced to the common average reference.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Spectral analysis</title><p>Spectral analysis was performed on data from the concatenated five blocks of the eyes-closed condition. Only data from the eyes-closed condition was analyzed, because this data contains fewer artifacts and generally shows the strongest alpha oscillatory activity. The first and the last second of each eyes-closed block was discarded to exclude motor activity related to opening and closing the eyes and auditory activity due to the prompt from the speakers. The remaining data was concatenated, resulting in a total of 190s of continuous EEG data. This data was again segmented into 2s epochs, and each epoch containing large amplitude artifacts (&gt;+90 μV, &lt; –90 μV) was excluded from further processing. In 37subjects, more than 50% of trials exceeded this threshold; thus, these subjects were not included in subsequent analyses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>). For the remaining data, on average, 2.95% of trials were excluded by this criterion. Power spectral densities (PSDs) were then calculated using Welch’s Method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Welch, 1967</xref> implemented in the EEGLab toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Delorme and Makeig, 2004</xref>). Zero padding was applied to provide a frequency resolution of 0.25Hz in the 2s sliding time windows within Welch’s algorithm. Averaging the individual PSDs of each window resulted in a smoothed power spectrum that complies with the requirements of the specparam algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Donoghue et al., 2020b</xref>) used subsequently (see Specparam algorithm and aperiodic-adjusted alpha power). Additionally, PSDs were transformed to log scale to scale results equal to outputs from the specparam algorithm, which only operates in log power space. In the following, we describe the two approaches to extracting total alpha power and aperiodic-adjusted alpha power together with the aperiodic signal.

This individualized alpha power measure was chosen over a canonically defined alpha range, 8–13Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Babiloni et al., 2020</xref>), as the shift of the IAF during maturation might introduce a bias when power is averaged within a fixed-frequency window.

Consequently, the specparam algorithm parametrizes the PSD by iteratively fitting the aperiodic background curve (L) to the observed smoothed spectral signal, resulting in two parameters: the aperiodic intercept b and the aperiodic exponent χ (i.e. slope, the smaller χ, the flatter the spectrum).<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Illustration of the two components (left) superimposed in the measured neural power spectrum (right).</title><p>The dark blue bar (right) indicates how total power is assessed relative to the absolute zero.

The current release (1.0.0) of the specparam toolbox from the github repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof">https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Donoghue, 2022</xref>) was used. The algorithm was used with these settings: peak width limits: [0.5, 12]; max number of peaks: infinite; minimum peak height: 0; peak threshold: 2 sd above mean; and aperiodic mode: fixed. The resulting periodic signal P (“Oscillatory Signal” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) was used to extract aperiodic-adjusted canonical alpha power (average across 8–13 Hz) and aperiodic-adjusted individualized alpha power (average across a [–4 Hz to +2 Hz] window centered on the IAF).</p><p>Data was only used for further analysis when the model fit of the specParam model was above a threshold of R<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.90.</p><p>In the analysis of the main HBN sample, an overall high specParam model fit was observed across the sample (mean R<sup>2</sup>=0.9943, sd = 0.0098). Similar model fits were observed in the validation dataset (mean R<sup>2</sup>=0.9941, sd = 0.0120). Model fit was assessed for each of the five occipital electrodes separately (see 4.2.7). Across all subjects, only 11 out of 9,705 model fits were below the cut-off of R<sup>2</sup> &lt;0.90 in the HBN sample, and 6 out of 1,675 in the validation sample. Consequently, in 99.94% of subjects, all five electrodes could be used to estimate the average occipital periodic and aperiodic parameters. For those subjects with insufficient model fits for specific occipital electrodes, the average occipital periodic and aperiodic parameters were calculated from the average of the remaining electrodes with adequate model fit. In the HBN sample, the numbers of occipital electrodes available in these subjects were: Two (N=1 subject), three (N=1 subject), and four (N=6 subjects). In the validation sample, these numbers of available electrodes were similar: Three (N=2 subject), four (N=2 subjects). No subject was excluded based on the specParam model fit.</p><p>A series of control analyses were conducted: The first control analyses indicated a small but significant relation between age and gender with the specParam model fit (see Appendix 4). Controlling for this in the statistical model by adding the specParam model fit as an additional predictor did not change any of the main results (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table1">Appendix 4—table 1</xref>). Additional control analyses were subsequently performed to investigate whether possible overfitting of the specParam models (mean R<sup>2</sup>=0.9943, see above) confounded the results. Following the guidelines of Ostlund et al.’s (2022), specParam model fitting parameters and data exclusion criteria were adapted to minimize both overfitting and underfitting of the model (for the details about this approach see Appendix 5). Results were highly consistent with the main results reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and did not indicate any changes to the main results (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app5table1">Appendix 5—table 1</xref>). Finally, a control analysis using the periodic alpha peak power from the specParam algorithm instead of average individualized band power showed highly consistent results and did not change any conclusions (see Appendix 6, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app6table1">Appendix 6—table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>Electrode cluster analysis</title><p>To test the hypothesis derived from literature review, an electrode-cluster-based analysis was performed. This cluster was based on data from the parietal and occipital electrodes, here referred to as the parieto-occipital cluster (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These electrodes were chosen because of the strong prominence of Oz and Pz electrodes in research on EEG alpha oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Klimesch, 1999</xref>) and previous findings for age effects on alpha band power in these electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clarke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cragg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gasser et al., 1988</xref>). To account for individual anatomical differences, the following electrodes were selected to create a more robust cluster: E72 (POz), E75 (Oz), E62 (Pz), E67 (PO3), E77 (PO4). All parameters described above were extracted for each electrode and subsequently averaged within this cluster. Prior to statistical analyses, data was excluded from further processing if any extracted parameter exceeded a threshold of three standard deviations above or below the mean of the sample (excluded N=30, mean age = 12.58, sd = 3.92).

Additionally, for supplementary analyses, model two was also fitted to measures of canonical alpha power (i.e. total canonical alpha power, relative canonical alpha power and aperiodic-adjusted canonical alpha power).</p><p>To correct for multiple comparisons, the significance level was adjusted. We assumed a high correlation between the total of 9 outcome variables (including the canonical alpha power measures, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2C</xref>), as many of the dependent variables represent various characteristics of the individual alpha oscillations. To account for this, we first calculated the effective number of tests of all dependent variables using Nyholt’s approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nyholt, 2004</xref>). Following this approach, the significance level (0.05) was then adjusted using the Šidák correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nyholt, 2004</xref>). Subsequently, the credible intervals (CIs) of the posterior distributions were calculated from the newly estimated levels of significance. The resulting significance level was 0.0083, yielding 99.17% credible intervals. We refrained from calculating Bayes factors for point estimates as evidence of the effect being zero or unequal to zero, as these Bayes factors, which are based on the Savage–Dickey ratio, depend strongly on the arbitrary choice of the prior distribution of each effect.

The Flanker task of the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gershon et al., 2013</xref>) was employed as a measure of attentional performance. In each of the 40 trials of this task, a set of stimuli is presented to participants, who are asked to indicate the direction (left or right) of the central stimulus. These stimuli are either arrows, for participants of the age 8 years or older, or fish, for children younger than 8 years. Therefore, participants need to focus attention on the central stimulus and suppress information from surrounding stimuli, which may be congruent or incongruent to the direction with the central stimulus. Thus, the task aims to measure inhibitory control and visual selective attention. This data was collected as part of the HBN study. Participants performed a computerized version of the task in a separate assessment without neurophysiological recording.

Electrodes were placed according to the international 10–20 system using an electrode cap with tin electrodes (Electro-cap International Inc, Eaton, Ohio, USA). Data was referenced to the linked earlobes, and impedances were kept below 5 kΩ. Data was filtered between 0.5 and 50 Hz, and the same artifact correction as described in Electroencephalography recording and preprocessing was subsequently applied. The electrodes used for the parieto-occipital electrode cluster were Pz, P3, P4, O1, and O2. The same exclusion criteria as described above were applied.

For this tool the settings were as follows: 8 iterations, smoothing full-width-half-max parameters of [10, 6, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0] for each respective iteration, enabled outlier detection and replacement for slice-wise and multiband group outliers and additional 8 iterations for slice-to-volume correction. (5) Outlier detection of MRI parameters and robust parameter estimation was performed with the function ‘irlls’ applying iterative reweighted linear least squares (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Collier et al., 2015</xref>). (6) Using the function ‘dki_fit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Veraart et al., 2013</xref>) we performed tensor fitting and extraction of diffusivity measures based on weighted linear least squares estimation. (7) For the extraction of DTI parameters we used the function ‘dki_parameters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Veraart et al., 2011</xref>).

Second, the Talairach transformation was computed which is an affine transform to the MNI305 atlas. Third, intensity normalization was applied, which corrects deviations in intensity for later intensity-based segmentation. All voxel’s intensity was scaled such that the white matter mean intensity was 110. Fourth, skull tissue was removed from the intensity normalized image and a brain mask was created. Next automatic subcortical segmentation was performed. For this, the intensity non-uniformity corrected (NU-corrected) image was co-registered to the Gaussian Classifier Atlas (GCA). Based on the GCA model the image was first normalized and nonlinearly transformed to the GCA atlas. In a next step, regions corresponding to the neck were removed from the NU-corrected image. Further, a transformation was applied of the NU-corrected image without the neck to the GCA image containing the skull. Lastly, subcortical structures were labeled in accordance with the GCA model and statistics on the segmented subcortical structures computed and summarized.</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-4"><title>Appendix 4</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s12"><title>Control analysis: Influence of specParam model fit</title><p>Control analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between the specParam model fit and age, gender and diagnoses (no diagnoses, ADHD, other diagnosis) controlling for recording site and handedness (EHI) in the full HBN dataset.

Alternatively, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Donoghue et al., 2020b</xref>, the periodic peak in the alpha range could be extracted from the specParam algorithm as an indicator of individual alpha power. A control analysis was performed on the main HBN dataset to investigate whether results are consistent when applying both periodic measures of alpha power. Therefore, the highest Gaussian oscillatory peak detected by the specParam algorithm was found in a search window (7.5 Hz to 13.5 Hz) and its height was extracted as the individual alpha power. The analyses described in 4.2 were repeated, using the specParam oscillatory peak height instead of the average of the aperiodic-adjusted power spectrum in the individual alpha range. Results are highly consistent across the two approaches.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Barbara Shinn-Cunningham as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Wen Li (Reviewer #2); Thomas Donoghue (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revision:</p><p>(1A) The relation of this paper to previous work, in particular in regards to previous methodological issues and empirical claims relating to aperiodic activity, needs to be clarified.</p><p>(1B) Overall, the manuscript should more carefully balance raising the awareness of the aperiodic confound in power indices and alarming the field as to the validity of the extant findings. Words like &quot;contradiction&quot; may be overly alarming when the relative power index yields consistent results as the adjusted power index.</p><p>(1C) The key finding of this report is that periodic α power increases with age, which is a notably different result from some of the previous literature, as well as from the analyses within this paper that analyze total power in the α range. The interpretation of this finding provided in the paper is that the decrease in power is driven by the change in aperiodic activity, which is a sensible interpretation given the results. This interpretation could be further motivated with some minor additional analyses. If the effect of total α power reflects the change in the aperiodic activity, but periodic α power does not, then this implies that the total power and aperiodic measures should be highly correlated, whereas the periodic power and aperiodic parameters should be much less so. If this can be shown, it would help to demonstrate the interpretation.</p><p>(2A) Please further describe and report quality control measures of the spectral models.</p><p>(2B) It is interesting that when using the specParam approach, the α measure that is used is not the periodic peak from the model fit, but a measure of power from the aperiodic-adjusted log power spectrum. Is there a reason this was chosen instead of using the peak parameters from the model? Are the results the same if analyzed using the peak parameters?</p><p>(3) This paper can have even greater conceptual and methodological impact on the field by focusing on &quot;relative&quot; as opposed to &quot;total&quot; power. It is also helpful to clarify which aspects of aperiodic signal (intercept or slope) and to what extent contributes to the confound in the relative α power.</p><p>(4) Related to points #2 and #3, please illuminate how &quot;distorted&quot; the relative α power measure is in real biologically valid datasets. Simple correlations across these α measures could be examined to shed light on their relationship. As relative α power shows similar correlation with age as the aperiodic-adjusted α power, the authors may also directly compare these two power indices to quantify the difference.</p><p>(5) The correlation between aperiodic-adjusted α power and white matter integrity of the thalamocortical radiation is very interesting. Given the very strong association of the aperiodic α indices with age, it would be helpful to examine their correlation with the thalamocortical radiation. Also, given the common use of relative α power in the literature, it is useful to examine its correlation with thalamocortical radiation.</p><p>(6) Please address the limitations of the analysis relating changes in offset and exponent. It is unclear if there is a clear way to do this analysis in an interpretable way without estimating the rotation frequency across the group, which is itself a tricky problem, so if that can't be done in the context of this paper, that analysis may need to be removed.</p><p>(7) Please describe and report the Flanker analysis in the Results, including discussing the interpretations in terms of the effect size and difference in parameter values. There could also be further description of this analysis in the methods, including a brief description (or citation for) the Flanker task, and notes on whether this data is collected with or without EEG data, and if it is collected during at the same time as the resting state EEG data that is analyzed.</p><p>(8) The sample is not homogeneous or representative. While the control analysis has ruled out ADHD-related confounds, it is still important to note that in the Abstract and discuss that in the Discussion.</p><p>(9) Throughout the manuscript participants are referred to as &quot;children.&quot; However, the sample is between 6 and 22 years (at some point it says 21; but the oldest participant is 21.9y, so 6 to 22 years should be written instead). Please rephrase with: the sample consisted of children, adolescents and young adults. Moreover, in the additional analysis with the extreme groups the older group is called &quot;older children.&quot; Again, part of this group are in fact young adults.</p><p>(10) The abstract uses the term 'aperiodic offset', whereas the remainder of the paper uses 'aperiodic intercept'. This should be consistent.</p><p>(11) In the abstract, lines 40-42, the phrasing is unclear on what exactly the finding regarding the isolated periodic α activity is, and this could potentially be made clearer.</p><p>(12) On lines 266-267, the report of the analyses regarding the anatomical measures of the thalamus are not clearly reported. Given the organization of the methods, in which this is presented before the methods, some brief notes that, for example, the measures of the thalamic radiation are DTI measures, would be useful, since as presented it is unclear how this paragraph relates to the claim in the abstract that α power relates thalamo-cortical connectivity.</p><p>(13) On line 398, the word &quot;reflects&quot; seems to suggest more of a causal link than is supported by the correlational analysis. This should be edited.</p><p>(14) Line 404-406: this sentence needs to be reformulated.</p><p>(15) Line 721: The EHQ acronym does not seem to be introduced.

We agree that focusing more strongly on relative α power, which is a commonly used measure of α activity, can have greater impact on the field.</p><p>While theoretical considerations have questioned previous results in the relative α band power, the main finding when comparing aperiodic-adjusted and relative α power is that relative α power, similar to the aperiodic-adjusted α power, indicates an age-related increase with continuing brain maturation.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have conducted correlational analyses between aperiodic-adjusted and relative α power. The results revealed that both measures are highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.88). However, this finding also indicates that 22.6% of the variation in aperiodic-adjusted α power is not explained by relative α power. In our analyses on the association between α power and brain maturation, the measure of relative α power yielded false negative results: Although we observed a significant age-related increase in relative α power in the full HBN sample (final included N = 1770), there were no significant effects in the HBN sample without any given diagnosis (N = 190) or in the validation sample (N = 310). In contrast, aperiodic-adjusted α power consistently showed significant age-related increases across these samples. Furthermore, correlations with age are considerably higher in adjusted α power (<italic>r</italic> = 0.21) than in relative α power (<italic>r</italic> = 0.11). This leads to the conclusion that the two indices of α power are in fact related and that confounding factors in the computation of relative α power (as shown in the simulations in Appendix 1 – Figure 1) may weaken its association with age and can therefore cause null findings. Therefore, we argue that aperiodic-adjusted α power should be preferred for the analysis of brain maturation.</p><p>As also suggested, we further conducted correlation analyses between all major indices: total, relative, and aperiodic-adjusted α power and aperiodic intercept and slope.

However, when controlling for the aperiodic signal component, our findings provided strong evidence for an age-related increase in the aperiodic-adjusted α power. As reported in previous studies, relative α power also indicated a maturational increase, yet the effect is of considerably smaller magnitude, thus indicating an underestimation of the underlying relationship between periodic α power and brain maturation. This underestimation might be explained by the fact that changes in other frequency bands and in the aperiodic signal can potentially affect the measures of relative α power as shown by simulation studies.”</p><p>Results (2.1):</p><p>“To investigate the inherent associations between the different measures of α power and aperiodic activity, we further conducted a post hoc correlational analysis. This analysis aimed to illuminate the differences and similarities between the three measures of α power and the potential confounding effects of the aperiodic signal. The two aperiodic indices, intercept and slope, were highly interlinked, and both exhibited high correlations with total individualized α power. At the same time, both aperiodic-adjusted and relative individualized α power indicated a considerably weaker association with the aperiodic indices. Furthermore, whereas relative and aperiodic-adjusted α power were highly related, this association was weaker between relative and total α power and aperiodic-adjusted and total α power.

[…]</p><p>General discussion:</p><p>“The aperiodic-adjusted individualized α power increased significantly from childhood to adolescence, which is consistent with the results obtained from relative α power in the present study and in previous literature (Clarke et al., 2001; Cragg et al., 2011; Díaz de León et al., 1988; Harmony et al., 1995; John et al., 1980; Somsen et al., 1997). The aperiodic signal showed a decreased intercept during brain maturation and a flattened slope. Results were largely consistent across the subsample of the HBN dataset without any given diagnosis, the full HBN dataset, and the validation analyses. However, in the validation dataset and the HBN subsample without any given diagnoses, aperiodic-adjusted but not relative α power showed significant age-related increases, indicating a risk of false-negative results when investigating relative α power in brain maturation.</p><p>[…]</p><p>Importantly, when relating α power measures to anatomical measures derived from DTI, only aperiodic-adjusted and relative, but not total α power showed a significant relation to the white matter integrity of the thalamic radiations”</p><p>Discussion “Relative vs. aperiodic-adjusted individualized α power”:</p><p>“Post hoc simulations indicate that changes in power in other frequency bands (see Appendix 1 – Figure 1A) induce changes in relative α power even when true oscillatory α power is kept constant. Furthermore, changes in the aperiodic signal induce a confound in the relative α power measure (see Appendix 1 – Figure 1B). This is further supported by simulations performed by Donoghue et al. (2020a) and Donoghue et al. (2021). Consequently, the increase in relative α power observed with increasing age needs to be interpreted with caution, as changes in other frequency bands and in the aperiodic signal can potentially bias this finding. Our study confirmed an age-related decrease of the aperiodic intercept and a flattening of the aperiodic slope. Hence, because these changes in the aperiodic signal could induce changes in relative α power even though the true oscillatory pattern remains stable, this relative measure is no conclusive indicator of a true age-related increase in α power.</p><p>[…]</p><p>Importantly, the aperiodic-adjusted individualized α power showed consistent significant age-related increases in the main HBN sample, the HBN subsample of children without any given diagnosis, and the validation dataset. Conversely, the relative individualized α power only showed a significant association with age in the largest main HBN sample. Therefore, our results indicate that there is a risk of false negative results when investigating relative α power changes from childhood to young adulthood in sample sizes commonly used in neurophysiological studies. Hence, the developmental increase on periodic α power may be underestimated when using relative α power indices, which might be explained by a potential confounding bias of the aperiodic signal components and power in other frequency bands on the relative α power (see supplementary simulation studies in Appendix 1). Overall, aperiodic-adjusted α power should be preferred over relative α power when analyzing developmental trajectories during brain maturation.”</p><p>Discussion “Conclusions”:</p><p>“Furthermore, the current report provides partial support of previous literature on age-related increases in relative α power, as these effects could only be replicated in the large dataset, but not in the smaller samples.

Consequently, the samples are not representative of the general population in this age range. This may present a confound to the analysis of age trajectories of α power and the aperiodic signal, because psychiatric disorders have previously been linked to differences in resting state EEG band power (for a comprehensive review, see Newson and Thiagarajan, 2018) and the aperiodic slope (e.g., Robertson et al., 2019). However, control analyses using only healthy subsamples showed very similar results to analyses of the full sample. Additionally, the main and the validation analysis controlled for possible confounding effects by adding a categorical diagnosis variable as an additional predictor. No significant associations were found between clinical diagnoses and either oscillatory or aperiodic signal components within either dataset.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My main suggestions for this paper are to:</p><p>(1) Clarify the relation of this paper to previous work, in particular in regards to previous methodological issues and empirical claims relating to aperiodic activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this elaborate and helpful comment on the contextualization of our work.</p><p>We acknowledge that the suggested simulations of previous work (Donoghue, T., Dominguez, J., and Voytek, B., 2020; Donoghue, T., Schaworonkow, N., and Voytek, B., 2021) provide important findings on possible confounds in relative band power measures and in fact made similar points as our supplementary simulation examples. Therefore, the new version of the manuscript provides suitable citations to this previous work in the introduction section (lines 98-103) and put less emphasis on the supplementary simulation studies performed in the present report:</p><p>“Additionally, non-oscillatory changes in the power spectrum introduce confounds in the analysis of relative band power measures (see simulated example in Appendix 1 – Figure 1B). This was previously observed by simulations showing that non-oscillatory changes affect both relative band power measures (Donoghue, Schaworonkow, and Voytek, 2021) and band power ratio measures (Donoghue, Dominguez, and Voytek, 2020a).”</p><p>Because the simulations performed in Donoghue, T., Schaworonkow, N., and Voytek, B. (2021) also provide evidence for confounding effects of oscillatory peak frequencies in power measures, we further cited this work when introducing the problem of fixed frequency band analysis in brain maturation (lines 79-86):</p><p>“A potential confound is the utilization of fixed-frequency boundaries (e.g., 8–13 Hz), which neglects the slowing of the IAF during development. For instance, peak frequency in childhood is around 6 Hz but increases to 10 Hz in adolescents. Hence, age-related power decreases are underestimated when the slower α oscillation of younger children is not properly captured by predefined frequency limits, which leads to lower power values. Consequently, individualized α frequency bands need to be extracted, which are centered on the individual IAF of each subject (see also Donoghue et al. (2021) for simulations visualizing confounding effects of the peak frequency on band power).“</p><p>In response to the comment that the paper understates previous work on aperiodic activity, we would like to clarify: Our statement on lacking evidence for the reported significant association between age and aperiodic signal components and aperiodic-adjusted α power referred specifically to the context of brain maturation in the age range here investigated. We further refined this statement, differentiating between evidence for maturational changes in aperiodic signal components and in aperiodic-adjusted α power. As suggested by the reviewer, we updated the corresponding paragraph including references to Donoghue et al. (2020) and Hill et al. (2022) (lines 125-140):</p><p>“Recent studies adopted this methodology and found age-related changes in the aperiodic signal (i.e., decreased intercept and flattened slope) during childhood and adolescence (Cellier, Riddle, Petersen, and Hwang, 2021; Hill, Clark, Bigelow, Lum, and Enticott, 2022) and from childhood to middle age (Donoghue et al., 2020a; He et al., 2019). These results further pointed out the importance of considering the aperiodic signal in the investigation of α power during brain maturation. However, it remains largely unknown how aperiodic-adjusted α power evolves during this critical phase of life. The few studies performed so far have not found any significant association between aperiodic-adjusted α power during childhood and adolescence (Cellier et al., 2021; Hill et al., 2022) and from childhood to middle age (He et al., 2019). Due to comparatively small sample sizes in these studies, it remains unclear whether the aperiodic-adjusted α-power truly remains stable in this period of life or whether too little statistical power was provided to detect changes in this newly emerging measure of α power. Furthermore, conventional measures of total and relative α power were either not reported (Cellier et al., 2021; Hill et al., 2022), or did not show any relation to age (He et al., 2019). Hence, comparisons and integration of these results with the large body of literature investigating maturational changes in total and relative α power remain limited.”</p><p>In addition, following the reviewer's helpful comment, we added a reference to the review of He (2014) when introducing the aperiodic signal (lines 111-121):</p><p>“The aperiodic signal contains important physiological information (see He 2014 for a comprehensive review of the functional significance and potential generative mechanisms of aperiodic activity). More specifically, the aperiodic slope has been linked to the synchronicity of activity in the underlying neural population (Miller, Sorensen, Ojemann, and den Nijs, 2009; Usher, Stemmler, and Olami, 1995) and its balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity (Gao, Peterson, and Voytek, 2017). Importantly, the aperiodic slope is modulated by task performance and sensory stimulation (e.g., He, 2014). Conversely, the aperiodic intercept has been linked to general spiking activity (Voytek and Knight, 2015). Overall, the aperiodic signal needs to be considered during the analysis of spectral power rather than measuring power relative to the absolute zero (e.g., Donoghue et al., 2020b).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Describe and report quality control measures of the spectral models.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the lack of reporting quality control measures from the specParam models. Indeed, we had applied the criteria as described in the preregistration to the analyses of both the main HBN dataset and the validation dataset, but these were not described and reported in the main manuscript. We updated the corresponding method section by adding:</p><p>Methods (4.2.6):</p><p>“Data was only used for further analysis when the model fit of the specParam model was above a threshold of R<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.90.</p><p>In the analysis of the main HBN sample, an overall high specParam model fit was observed across the sample (mean R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9943, sd = 0.0098). Similar model fits were observed in the validation dataset (mean R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9941, sd = 0.0120). Model fit was assessed for each of the five occipital electrodes separately (see 4.2.7). Across all subjects, only 11 out of 9705 model fits were below the cut-off of R<sup>2</sup> &lt;0.90 in the HBN sample, and 6 out of 1675 in the validation sample. Consequently, in 99.94% of subjects, all five electrodes could be used to estimate the average occipital periodic and aperiodic parameters. For those subjects with insufficient model fits for specific occipital electrodes, the average occipital periodic and aperiodic parameters were calculated from the average of the remaining electrodes with adequate model fit. In the HBN sample, the numbers of occipital electrodes available in these subjects were: Two (N = 1 subject), three (N = 1 subject) and four (N = 6 subjects). In the validation sample, these numbers of available electrodes were similar: Three (N = 2 subject), four (N = 2 subjects). No subject was excluded based on the specParam model fit.”</p><p>Based on the reviewer’s comment, we further investigated the relation between the specParam model fit and age, gender, and diagnoses (no diagnoses, ADHD, other diagnosis), controlling for recording site and handedness (EHI) in the full HBN dataset:<disp-formula id="sa2equ1"><mml:math id="sa2m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thickmathspace"/><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thickmathspace"/><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Significant associations were found for age (b = -0.0002, p = 6.63e-10) and gender (b female = -0.0015, p = 7.73e-15).

I'm not sure if there is a clear way to do this analysis in an interpretable way without estimating the rotation frequency across the group, which is itself a tricky problem, so if that can't be done in the context of this paper, that analysis may need to be dropped.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable contribution. Following this comment, we tested how strongly the conclusion of our analyses are affected by changing the rotation frequencies. Figure 2c in the main manuscript visualizes the aperiodic signal for the 20% youngest and the 20% oldest participants. We agree with the reviewer that this figure indicates a larger rotation frequency than the 19Hz used initially, therefore we reran our analysis using increasingly large rotation frequencies from 19 Hz up to 40 Hz. While the bootstrap analysis still provides strong evidence for an age-related decrease of the aperiodic intercept at 25 Hz (99.98% of 10.000 bootstraps show smaller intercept than expected by the mere rotation of the aperiodic signal), this evidence decreases with increasing frequency (35 Hz: 63% of the bootstraps show smaller intercept than expected by rotation; 40 Hz: only 18% of the bootstraps show smaller intercept than expected by rotation). The reviewer correctly pointed out that estimating the true rotation frequency is a non-trivial problem, especially considering interindividual variance in the rotation frequency. Thus, we decided to drop this analysis from the manuscript. Instead, we discussed this issue in the Discussion section.</p><p>Discussion “Maturational changes in aperiodic signal components”:</p><p>“An alternative explanation for the finding of a decreased intercept needs to be considered: As pointed out by He et al. (2019), a maturational flattening of the aperiodic signal imposes a decrease in the intercept due to the high correlation between the aperiodic intercept and slope (also observed in the main HBN dataset, r = 0.89, see Table 2). To estimate whether the observed decrease of the aperiodic intercept is larger than expected by the rotation of the aperiodic slope requires estimation of not only the decrease of the aperiodic slope, but also the frequency at which the aperiodic signal rotates. Future research is needed to provide means by which this estimation can be achieved, considering also interindividual differences in the rotation frequency.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Describe and report the Flanker analysis in the Results, including discussing the interpretations in terms of the effect size and difference in parameter values. There could also be further description of this analysis in the methods, including a brief description (or citation for) the Flanker task, and notes on whether this data is collected with or without EEG data, and if it is collected during at the same time as the resting state EEG data that is analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In the initial submission, the continuous variables (Flanker score, age, total α power, aperiodic-adjusted α power) were not standardized; therefore, the magnitude of the regression coefficients were neither interpretable nor comparable. We adjusted this oversight by z-transforming the continuous variables and reran the analysis, adding relative α power as a dependent variable, in line with reviewer #1’s recommendations. In the new analysis of the association between aperiodic-adjusted α power and performance in the Flanker task, the Flanker score showed a standardized β of 0.073, which was highly significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001) while controlling for the effect of age. Thus, we are confident that the relationship between aperiodic-adjusted α power and Flanker task performance is of sufficient magnitude to be interpreted, indicating an effect size of almost one third of the magnitude of the very prominent age effect; the effect of age in this model was 0.233 (p &lt;0.001). The effect of Flanker task performance on total α power was considerably smaller, showing a drop of effect size magnitude by a factor of 1.7 (standardized β = 0.043) compared to the magnitude of the effect on adjusted α power. This effect also fails to reach significance when adjusting the significance level for multiple comparisons using the Nyholt correction (adjusted significance level = 0.0264, p = 0.047). Additionally, based on the valuable comment #1 of reviewer #2 on the importance of focusing on the findings in relative α power, we added this measure in the analysis of Flanker task performance (see also answer #1 to reviewer #1). Results indicate similar effects of Flanker task performance on relative α power (standardized β = 0.068, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) as on aperiodic-adjusted α power. However, we note that the comparison between the different measures of α power was not the focus of this analysis, as preceding analyses had indicated that aperiodic-adjusted α power should be preferred over total α power when investigating brain maturation.</p><p>In the new version of the manuscript, we restructured the presentation of the Flanker task analysis, providing more details in the method section (4.5), moving the results from the supplement to the Results section (2.4) and updating the corresponding Discussion section:</p><p>Methods (4.5):</p><p>“Post hoc analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between the different measures of α power and attentional performance. The Flanker task of the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery (Gershon et al., 2013) was employed as a measure of attentional performance. In each of the 40 trials of this task, a set of stimuli is presented to participants, who are asked to indicate the direction (left or right) of the central stimulus. These stimuli are either arrows, for participants of the age 8 year or older, or fish, for children younger than 8 years. Therefore, participants need to focus attention on the central stimulus and suppress information from surrounding stimuli, which may be congruent or incongruent with the direction of the central stimulus. Thus, the task aims to measure inhibitory control and visual selective attention. This data was collected as part of the HBN study. Participants performed a computerized version of the task in a separate assessment without neurophysiological recording. The score was calculated based on a combined measure of accuracy across trials and reaction time (Zelazo et al., 2014). Age standardized scores were automatically extracted by the NIH test software (for more details, see National Institutes of Health and Northwestern University.: http://www.healthmeasures.net/2-uncategorised/209-nih-toolbox-technical-manuals-for-ac). The final sample size, for which both task data and EEG were available, was N = 1757 (age range, 5-22 years, mean age = 10.81, sd = 3.44).</p><p>The score in the Flanker task was used as the predictor in the linear models. The univariate linear models controlled for age, gender, and handedness (EHI) and were defined as:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>α power ∼ Flanker score + age + gender + EHI</p></disp-quote><p>All predictors and outcome variables were standardized (z-transformed). The models were fitted separately for three outcome variables: total individualized α power, relative individualized α power, and aperiodic-adjusted individualized α power. To account for multiple comparisons with three different measures of α power, the effective number of tests was calculated using Nyholt’s approach, and Šidák correction was applied to adjust the significance level of 0.05 (Nyholt, 2004), yielding a corrected significance level of 0.0264.”</p><p>Results (2.4):</p><p>“Post hoc analyses were performed to investigate the relation between the different measures of α power and performance in a visual spatial attention task: the Flanker task of the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery (Gershon et al., 2013). Both relative and aperiodic-adjusted individualized α power showed a significant positive association with task performance while controlling for effects of age and gender. The effect of Flanker task performance on total α power showed a considerably smaller effect size (standardized β dropped by a factor of 1.7 compared to aperiodic-adjusted α power) and failed to reach significance level when adjusting for multiple comparisons. Table 5 summarizes the results of the linear models.”</p><p>Discussion “Age-related increase in aperiodic-adjusted individualized α power”:</p><p>“In fact, post hoc analyses supported this hypothesis by providing evidence that oscillatory α power is linked to performance in visual attention tasks, assessed by performance in the Flanker task. While age, gender and handedness were controlled for, relative and aperiodic-adjusted individualized α power showed significant positive relations to the attentional performance when adjusting for multiple statistical comparisons, but total individualized α power did not.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
