Some, such as dengue virus, exhibit the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease, making vaccine-based routes of fighting infections problematic. The pH-dependent conformational change of the envelope (E) protein required for fusion between the viral and endosomal membranes is an attractive point of inhibition by antivirals as it has the potential to diminish the effects of ADE. We examined six flaviviruses by employing large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of raft systems that represent a substantial portion of the flaviviral envelope. We utilised a benzene-mapping approach that led to a discovery of shared hotspots and conserved cryptic sites. A cryptic pocket previously shown to bind a detergent molecule exhibited strain-specific characteristics. An alternative conserved cryptic site at the E protein domain interfaces showed a consistent dynamic behaviour across flaviviruses and contained a conserved cluster of ionisable residues. Constant-pH simulations revealed cluster and domain-interface disruption under low pH conditions. Based on this, we propose a cluster-dependent mechanism that addresses inconsistencies in the histidine-switch hypothesis and highlights the role of cluster protonation in orchestrating the domain dissociation pivotal for the formation of the fusogenic trimer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>flavivirus</kwd><kwd>enveloped virus</kwd><kwd>benzene-mapping</kwd><kwd>cryptic pockets</kwd><kwd>constant-pH simulations</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001381</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF2017NRF-CRP001-027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marzinek</surname><given-names>Jan K</given-names></name><name><surname>Anand</surname><given-names>Ganesh S</given-names></name><name><surname>Bond</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001348</institution-id><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zuzic</surname><given-names>Lorena</given-names></name><name><surname>Marzinek</surname><given-names>Jan K</given-names></name><name><surname>Bond</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000770</institution-id><institution>University of Manchester</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zuzic</surname><given-names>Lorena</given-names></name><name><surname>Warwicker</surname><given-names>Jim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Benzene mapping simulations of envelope protein rafts from six different flaviviruses reveal a conserved cryptic site whose cluster of ionisable residues is likely responsible for orchestrating pH-dependent conformational changes during fusion, thereby representing an attractive target for antiviral development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flaviviruses belong to a family of enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses which are transmitted by arthropod vectors, predominantly mosquitoes and ticks. The family includes human pathogens such as dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), Zika, tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV), which can be subdivided into a neurotropic and non-neurotropic group of infectious agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gaunt et al., 2001</xref>). The non-neurotropic group of flaviviruses, associated with haemorrhagic disease, is primarily transmitted via <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and is mainly present in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kraemer et al., 2015</xref><sup>)⁠</sup>. In recent years, partly as a result of global warming, the mosquito distribution has been rapidly expanding into temperate regions and is now co-distributed with the majority of the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brady et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kamal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kraemer et al., 2019</xref>)⁠.</p><p>Flaviviral particles consist of an internal nucleocapsid and a surface-facing envelope, which is composed of a membrane and two types of embedded viral proteins. An envelope (E) protein is exposed to the surface of the virus and appears as a first point of contact between the virus and host immune system, whereas a smaller membrane (M) protein, which plays a role in viral maturation, localizes underneath the E protein and is concealed from the exterior. Both proteins are embedded in the viral membrane via transmembrane (TM) helices, and together they form stable heterotetrameric (E<sub>2</sub>M<sub>2</sub>) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kostyuchenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sirohi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sevvana et al., 2018</xref>). In the mature virion, 90 E<sub>2</sub>M<sub>2</sub> units are organised in a tight-knit herringbone-like pattern with three heterotetramers arranged in parallel to form a raft. In total, 30 rafts form a complete viral envelope and are likely a functional unit for immune recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sevvana et al., 2018</xref>⁠; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flaviviral raft structure and domain organisation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A top-down view on the flaviviral envelope protein raft consisting of three E<sub>2</sub>M<sub>2</sub> heterotetramers organised in a parallel fashion.

A gradually acidifying environment inside the compartment (~pH 5–6.5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Randolph and Stollar, 1990</xref>)⁠ triggers a large-scale conformational change within the envelope whereupon E proteins dissociate from their E<sub>2</sub> dimeric state, which lies flat on the surface of the virus, and instead form trimeric spikes with conserved fusion loops positioned at the tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Modis et al., 2004</xref>⁠). The fusion loops anchor the virus to the host membrane, effectively creating a bridge that spans the gap between the viral and endosomal membranes. A series of putative conformational changes in the spike trimer catalyse membrane fusion, penetrating the endosome and allowing for the viral nucleocapsid with its RNA genome to be released into the host cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harrison, 2015</xref>)⁠.</p><p>The identity of the exact residues responsible for triggering this dramatic sequence of conformational changes remains unclear, but the majority of research has been focussed on several conserved histidine residues as the most likely pH-sensing candidates, guided by the principles of the ‘histidine switch hypothesis’. This hypothesis presupposes histidines to be pH-sensing residues responsible for triggering conformational changes in viral fusion proteins that are dependent on pH. The hypothesis hinges on the property of the histidine side chain having its p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> close to physiological pH (p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> = 6.0), and therefore presumes that only histidines are able to change protonation state under the relatively mild pH changes occurring inside the living cell. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments on recombinant subviral particles of TBEV demonstrated that a single His317 mutation (residue numbers corresponding to DENV2) was sufficient for inhibiting a membrane fusion step, likely because of impaired dissociation of E protein dimers. Double His244/His282 mutants had a reduced stability of fusogenic trimers, which also impaired fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fritz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stiasny et al., 2011</xref>)⁠. A mutation in His144 could not yield stable subviral particles and its effect on the fusion step could therefore not be determined. However, subsequent research on WNV reporter virus particles has brought into question the histidine-switch hypothesis of the pH-dependent conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nelson et al., 2009</xref>)⁠. Even though mutations of His144 and His244 significantly affected the fusion process, substitutions to non-titratable Met/Asn and aromatic residues, respectively, resulted in partial rescue of infectivity.</p><p>One of the best researched flaviviruses is DENV (serotypes 1–4) which poses a serious health risk because it can lead to dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gould, 1998</xref>)⁠. More serious forms of the disease have been linked to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), where a first infection produces anti-DENV antibodies specific against one strain, which then imperfectly cross-react with another strain during a subsequent infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Halstead, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balsitis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guzman et al., 2013</xref>)⁠. This unexpected detrimental effect of the host’s immune system has been linked to subtle differences in E protein sequences among DENV serotypes, inefficient viral maturation resulting in a high number of immature particles presenting in the extracellular space, as well as to a striking heterogeneity of DENV particle morphology observed under various environmental conditions associated with temperature and pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Modis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Junjhon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fibriansah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morrone et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fibriansah et al., 2021</xref>)⁠. The mechanism of ADE is most likely multifaceted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morrone and Lok, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wirawan et al., 2019</xref>)⁠, but predominantly includes anti-DENV antibodies interacting with the Fcγ receptor (FcγR) leading to enhanced viral internalisation into the endosome, from which the virus can escape by utilising its fusogenic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balsitis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Williams et al., 2013</xref>)⁠. The aggravation of disease caused by antibodies puts into question conventional routes of fighting viral infection, which usually involve vaccines designed to promote humoral immunity and a strong antibody response to the presence of a virus. Sanofi’s <italic>Dengvaxia</italic>, the only dengue vaccine currently in use, has been shown to be serotype-dependent and can lead to ADE in those who have not contracted the virus prior to vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guy et al., 2017</xref>)⁠.</p><p>An alternative to antibody-reliant approaches for fighting viral infections are antiviral drugs which may act upon various stages of the viral life cycle. There have been numerous attempts to apply drug design to target flaviviruses, and they have usually focussed on the non-structural viral proteins involved in viral replication or polyprotein processing, as well as some host targets involved in viral assembly (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boldescu et al., 2017</xref>⁠). Recent studies have demonstrated that cyanohydrazone molecules bind to a pocket on the E protein to inhibit viral entry at micromolar concentrations for DENV2, Zika, and JEV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Wispelaere et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2019</xref>)⁠. The pocket in question is located at the domain I-domain II interface of the E protein, is cryptic in nature, and was fortuitously observed in crystal structures of the DENV2 soluble portion of the E protein (sE) bound to a single <italic>n</italic>-Octyl-<italic>β</italic>-D-Glucoside (β-OG) detergent molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Modis et al., 2003</xref>)⁠. The effectiveness of these antivirals in blocking the early stages of the viral life cycle without causing ADE encourages exploration of other possible druggable sites on flaviviral envelopes. It also highlights the potential of utilizing drug design approaches targeting cryptic sites that may be of functional importance to the virus.</p><p>One of the methods focussed on detection of potential drug-binding sites is a co-solvent simulation approach that exploits the property of preferential binding of small organic molecules onto protein surfaces with which they can establish favourable interactions. Such surfaces are known as hotspots and their detection is a critical step for rational drug design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeLano, 2002</xref>)⁠. To that aim, the probes resembling common functional drug moieties (such as benzene or hydrocarbons) are preferably used, as their binding location and mode of interaction may be instructive for a subsequent drug design step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guvench and MacKerell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tan et al., 2016</xref>)⁠. On top of being a frequent component of drug-like molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kolb and Caflisch, 2006</xref>)⁠, benzene is also apolar in nature. This property is useful for uncovering cryptic sites which are at least partially hydrophobic in character and therefore only transiently appear in a detectable ‘open’ conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schmidtke and Barril, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oleinikovas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kuzmanic et al., 2020</xref>)⁠.</p><p>Here, we use large-scale co-solute molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the behaviour of six flaviviral rafts (DENV1-4, YFV, and Zika) and reveal conserved cryptic pockets in the presence of benzene probes. To that aim, we establish a raft model as a realistic representation of the viral envelope that successfully reproduces the features of curvature and interchain contacts, while being attainable in an all-atom level description and thus providing a precise insight into physicochemical properties applicable to the envelope as a whole. The dynamics of the ~400,000 atom raft systems are explored using a total simulation sampling time of over 14 µs. We investigate a landscape of potentially druggable sites on the envelope surface, compare pocket conservation across viral strains in relation to their sequence similarity, and propose conserved and functionally important sites with potential for drug targeting and inhibition of the early stages of the viral life cycle. Finally, we elaborate on the functional importance of a proposed cryptic site by highlighting a conserved charged cluster of residues that includes the key histidine residue, His144, explore its behaviour in different pH-environments using a constant pH-simulation approach, and propose a cluster-dependent mechanism of DI-DIII dissociation essential for formation of the fusogenic trimer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Benzene binding increases solvent protein accessibility without affecting the secondary structure</title><p>High concentrations of apolar probes can potentially lead to undesirable unfolding events by invading and disrupting the hydrophobic core of the protein, resulting in a shift towards biologically irrelevant conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, in the current work, we first confirmed that the addition of benzene to flaviviral raft systems increases the total SASA without affecting protein secondary structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). The unperturbed secondary structure suggests that the increased SASA of the sampled conformations of the rafts is not due to protein unfolding, but instead is a result of subtle side chain rearrangements, benzene incorporation into protein-protein interfaces, and cryptic pocket opening events. Additionally, very similar RMSF profiles for water-only and benzene simulations demonstrated that the overall dynamic fluctuations were comparable in behaviour despite the differences in solvent composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Highly dynamic loop regions (such as the N153 glycan loop) had fractionally lower RMSFs compared to water-only simulations. This effect might be due to stabilisation imposed by benzene interacting with the disordered loop regions and the ordered surface beneath, thus providing a stable interaction surface for the flexible portions of the protein.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Global raft properties for all six viral serotypes showing the effect of benzene probes added to the solvent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The total SASA across all viral systems increases with the addition of hydrophobic benzene probes to the solvent. The first 50 ns of each simulation was considered as equilibration and therefore omitted from the analysis. (<bold>B</bold>) The number of residues participating in secondary structure (defined as constituent elements of ⍺-helices, β-sheets, β-bridges, or turns) remains largely unaffected in benzene systems and closely corresponds to the values describing the experimentally derived cryo-EM structures. (<bold>C</bold>) The RMSF values describing whole-residue fluctuations are similar across solvent types and viral serotypes.

Even though the polyprotein sequence similarity between the presently explored flaviviruses is relatively high (42% for all six serotypes and 71% for DENV serotypes only), a large number of mutations localise on the surface-exposed portions of the envelope protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). This is unsurprising in the context of viral evolution, as mutations arise in the surface-exposed areas in order for the virus to evade the host immune response. However, certain exposed regions of the E protein are highly conserved because they play specific functional roles in the viral life cycle and are therefore less likely to accumulate mutations.</p><p>Shared sites of benzene binding reflect residue conservation patterns on the E protein and mostly localise around the conserved fusion loop and at the pr-binding interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The fusion loop (residues 98–111) is conserved among flaviviruses as it inserts into the endosomal membrane, which is essential for catalysing the membrane fusion event leading to genome release into the host cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allison et al., 2001</xref>). Similarly, the pr portion of the prM protein protects the fusion loop from premature insertion during the maturation process, and its interaction surface on the E protein is therefore also conserved to a high degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heinz et al., 1994</xref>;⁠ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>).

The external E protein surface is mostly unconserved and correspondingly showed a significant degree of variability in benzene binding patterns across serotypes. Notably, a central portion of DII was benzene-depleted (conservatively, residues 58–65, 120–125, 215–235, 252–267), suggesting that it is unlikely to be an attractive drug-binding hotspot. The width of this depleted band was sequence-dependent, with it being the narrowest in DENV4 and the widest in YFV. There are currently no known flaviviral antibodies that specifically target the central band of the raft, corroborating the observation that poor benzene binding sites are also unlikely to be involved in the formation of protein-protein interfaces. The benzene interaction sites slightly differed depending upon the position of the chain within the raft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Protein-protein interfaces that were positioned on the raft edges were more easily accessible to benzene molecules than the interfaces engaged in interchain interactions. Despite this, benzene mapping was highly similar across chains and displayed clear serotype-specific patterns of binding.</p><p>The areas of frequent benzene binding also matched increases in SASA, showcasing the role of benzene in exposing protein sites that predominantly remain hidden in water-only simulations. The TM regions of the E proteins and the M proteins showed little increase in SASA, which is explained by the fact that those regions are sequestered within the membrane and are, for the most part, out of reach of benzene molecules.</p><p>Correlation analyses of serotype properties, especially SASA, recapitulated phylogenetic relationships between the viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Serotypes that are more closely related generally exhibited more similar dynamic behaviour, highlighting the importance of sequence conservation in yielding shared characteristics such as SASA, benzene binding, or pocket formation. Interestingly, not all residue-based properties showed an equally high degree of correlation with sequence – notably, the RMSF correlations were poorly reflective of flaviviral evolutionary relationships, suggesting a more complex interplay of properties causing residue fluctuations than sequence alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

We observed that the ratios of open/closed states of the pocket differ greatly depending upon the particular virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), with the biggest pocket exposure attributed to DENV4 followed by DENV2, with YFV exhibiting comparatively the lowest pocket SASA even in the presence of benzene. Pocket properties were also affected by solvent composition, with simulations containing benzene manifesting, on average, higher SASA values. Benzene molecules can enter the hydrophobic pocket and transiently interact with residues lining the site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The number of benzenes that occupied the pocket during the course of the trajectory was in direct correlation with the pocket SASA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), with DENV2 and DENV4 showing the highest propensity for accommodating benzene molecules within the pocket, both in terms of number and frequency. In contrast, YFV β-OG pockets were the least likely to contain any benzene. Therefore, the presence of benzene probes in the system modified pocket exposure and, consequently, its SASA, either by locking the pocket in an open conformation or by inducing the opening of the pocket in the first place.</p><p>The observed open/closed ratios of the β-OG pocket were not equivalent for all chains in the system; instead, they were dependent on the position of the chain within the raft. The edge 3-fold chains appeared to have the highest median SASA value, an effect that was in particular exaggerated for DENV2 and DENV4 systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This might be due to the fact that the edge chains were unconstrained by the neighbouring elements on one side, allowing for greater flexibility of the protein and easier opening of the pocket.</p><p>We clustered pockets based on SASA and contact properties to separate the sampled conformations into two clusters corresponding to open and closed states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The DENV4 pocket appeared to be predominantly sampled in an open conformation; the DENV2 pocket was in an open state only half as often as compared to DENV4. Contrastingly, DENV1 and DENV3 exhibited very few open conformations. This variability is reflective of a relatively low conservation of residues (53%) among the DENV group of viruses – an attribute that also highlights the potential difficulty in developing pan-flaviviral therapeutics targeting the β-OG site.</p><p>The evident differences in pocket exposure can only be partially explained by the differences in the residues lining the pocket, and it is likely that the pocket opening is influenced in the wider context of protein residues outside of the binding site. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Wispelaere et al., 2018</xref>⁠ identified a mutation in DENV2 that is detrimental to antiviral compound binding, even though the point-mutation M196V is outside of the β-OG pocket. These findings suggest that the pocket opening might be allosterically affected by residues outside the binding cavity, either by modifying its shape, frequency of opening, or by affecting the stability of the interactions with its binding ligands.</p><p>Remarkably, the SASA value measured for the open β-OG pocket in the crystal DENV2 sE structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Modis et al., 2003</xref>)⁠ closely corresponded to the mean pocket value in simulated DENV2, suggesting that the benzene simulations successfully sampled biologically relevant open conformations of the pocket that match experiment. Despite some of the serotypes exhibiting predominantly closed states of the pocket even with the addition of benzene, those β-OG pockets are not necessarily absent. Instead, the kinetics of site opening might be serotype-dependent, resulting in pockets of some of the viruses predominantly residing in closed states. Thus, successful inhibition of the fusion events in Zika in the presence of β-OG pocket-binding inhibitors suggests that the pocket is sufficiently druggable, despite its presently observed low fraction (13.1%) of open states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The ⍺ pocket located on the domain interfaces is conserved and contains a buried cluster of charges</title><p>Our previous studies of a single DENV2 E<sub>2</sub>M<sub>2</sub> heterotetramer identified a novel cryptic pocket (referred to as <bold>⍺</bold>) located on domain interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zuzic et al., 2020</xref>;⁠ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

SASA was also less affected by the location of the chain within the raft for the ⍺ pocket, likely due to the fact that it is positioned peripherally and is therefore less dependent on intra-raft contacts.

Considering that the charge cluster is broken apart in the postfusion trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Modis et al., 2004</xref>)⁠, it is expected that a decrease in pH would be accompanied by disruption of the cluster. The cluster underwent a charge shift as consequence of lowering pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which indeed led to a gradual increase in disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), most noticeable following a total cluster charge shift from 0 to +3.</p><p>In high and neutral pH environments, the cluster was mainly in the D<sup>-</sup>H<sup>0</sup>E<sup>-</sup> state, corresponding to protonated N-ter and Arg9 and deprotonated Asp42, His144 and Glu368, resulting in a total cluster charge of 0. The residues within the cluster were predominantly in close contact and formed a tightly interacting unit on the DI-DIII interface. When assessed across all pH values, this close-contact state dominated the conformational landscape as it occurred in 95% of all sampled structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Notably, the remaining conformations, characterised by looser residue association, were enriched at positive cluster charges occurring at low pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This uneven distribution of conformations across charge states suggests a dissociation effect linked with acidic pH conditions, despite its relatively low occurrence as compared to the compact conformation. The constant-pH simulations did not include titrations of the N-ter or Arg9 and instead contained a fixed +1 charge at all pH values. However, given that the intrinsic p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values for both residues are in the basic range (p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> = 9.6 and p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> = 12.0) and their predicted p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values are 7.4±0.2 and 9.45±1.9, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), it is likely that both residues remain largely protonated in the acidic environment of the endosome.</p><p>Specific patterns of charge distribution across residues had different effects on cluster stability, even when the total charge remained unchanged: D<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup>E<sup>-</sup> (protonated His144) had little effect on cluster disruption, while D<sup>-</sup>H<sup>0</sup>E<sup>0</sup> (protonated Glu368) introduced a charge imbalance effect leading to the disturbance of the overall cluster structure. The cluster at +1 charge was a significant presence in the pH 5–6 range, relevant in the context of the endosomal pH-dependent conformational change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Transition of the total cluster charge to the +2 value resulted in substantial destabilisation of the DI-DIII interface, specifically in a D<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup>E<sup>0</sup> state (protonated His144 and Glu368). The switch to this charge state was accompanied by a protein-wide conformational change in the sE dimer with DIII shifting upwards from its initial position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The disruption was linked to Arg9 decoupling from the rest of the residues to point away from the cluster. At very low pH (0–2), the cluster exhibited a total charge of +3 (D<sup>0</sup>H<sup>+</sup>E<sup>0</sup>, corresponding to all-residue protonation), and this was associated with even greater disruption of cluster contacts and conformational changes that manifested as DIII shifting away from DI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Notably, this change appears to be different from the conformational switch observed in the D<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup>E<sup>0</sup> state as it was predominantly linked to Glu368 distancing from the remainder of the cluster residues.</p><p>Even though we observed protein-wide conformational changes only in more extreme pH environments than are observed within the endosome, it is evident that at least one associated pattern of charge (D<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup>E<sup>0</sup>) can occur at pH 5, suggesting that this route of DI-DIII disruption at endosomal pH is possible. Alternatively, the observed increase in intra-cluster distances at total charge zero suggests that it might also lead to DI-DIII dissociation in the context of better sampling or a more expansive representation of the viral particle surface.</p><p>Based on our findings, we propose that the drivers of conformational change at low pH are more complex than the simplistic histidine switch hypothesis, which limits possibilities for pH-sensing residues exclusively to histidines. As shown in our simulations, the solitary His144 protonation event has little effect upon overall sE dimer stability; instead, the conformational change appears to be inextricably linked to an interconnected network of conserved titratable residues that jointly contribute to the pH-dependent formation of the fusogenic spike. The cluster effect might also explain incongruous results in loss-of-function experiments which have shown that E proteins with an H144N mutation can still undergo the fusion event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nelson et al., 2009</xref>)⁠, suggesting that His144 plays a part, but is not indispensable for triggering trimer formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Limitations</title><p>In this work, we modelled the portion of the flaviviral envelope with the aim of detecting cryptic pockets on its protein components, but we omitted 1–2 glycan molecules (at position N67 for DENV1-4 only, and at N153 for all addressed flaviviral species). At the time of conducting the research, the benzene mapping method had not been verified against systems containing sugar moieties, and we hypothesised that the shielding effect of glycans might hinder effective benzene exploration of the protein surface. Furthermore, the experimental data available regarding glycan types on each glycosylation site is scarce and is dependent on the viral species and the examined host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hacker et al., 2009</xref>)⁠. However, the ⍺ pocket that contains the cluster of charges implicated in pH-dependent conformational change is located underneath the N153-glycan loop and as such, it is expected to at least partially affect the dynamics of pocket opening. This aspect of flaviviral envelope dynamics remains unaddressed at this time, and a topic for the future.</p><p>The membrane was modelled under geometric and compositional constraints. The curvature of the membrane was induced by introducing position restraints on C⍺ atoms of the TM helices. The membrane consisted of three phospholipid species only, and it did not include sphingolipids or cholesterol, both of which are suggested to be functionally important for flaviviral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martín-Acebes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carro and Damonte, 2013</xref>⁠). Taking into consideration the simplicity of the membrane composition model, as well as the application of position restraints in the lipid-proximal areas of proteins, detailed analysis of protein-lipid interactions was not pursued. Instead, the membrane served as a low-dielectric and solvent-excluding ‘shield’ that mimicked the approximate environment of the viral envelope and disallowed benzene to interact with the underside of the modelled raft.</p><p>The constant-pH simulations were performed on a truncated model of the E protein dimer, and the titrations were performed only on a small number of ionisable residues (specifically, the identified cluster charge residues and conserved histidines). The constant-pH method utilised the Generalised Born solvation model to attempt protonation, while the conformational sampling was performed in an explicit water environment. These aspects of the constant-pH simulation setup may be limiting in terms of accuracy of the used model and the comprehensiveness of the protonation sampling. Therefore, the future continuation of this research may involve constant-pH simulation approaches that allow for simulations of bigger systems and with titration coordinates applied to all acid-ionisable residues, such as a recently developed method reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aho et al., 2022</xref>⁠.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Perspectives on cryptic hotspot discovery in flaviviruses</title><p>Prophylactic or therapeutic approaches for fighting flaviviral disease that utilise vaccines or antibodies might be suboptimal because of the danger of ADE. Instead, antiviral drugs that could target the flaviviral life cycle could be an effective alternative. Specifically, a potential drug targeting the early stages of the life cycle would not have to be membrane-soluble as it would target the viral particle in the extracellular environment. Furthermore, inhibiting the fusion step would contribute to prevention of ADE, because it would pre-empt viral escape from the endosome prior to degradation. Hence, antiviral drugs would not only offer protection on their own, but could also act in concert with vaccines. The inhibitory action of antiviral drugs by binding to the β-OG pocket has already been demonstrated for a range of flaviviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Wispelaere et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2019</xref>)⁠, likely by preventing a hinge-like movement of the DI-DII interface necessary for formation of the fusogenic trimer. Similarly, targeting drug-like molecules to the ⍺ pocket could modulate charge cluster behaviour, effectively disrupting the pH-dependent dissociation of DI-DIII that is an essential step in the endosomal conformational change. Consistent with the cluster disruption and domain dissociation observed under low pH conditions, the surface area of the ⍺ pocket also increases with the net charge of the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). A drug molecule binding inside the pocket and stabilising it – both under neutral or low pH conditions – could conceivably prevent domain dissociation and pH-induced conformational changes of the viral envelope.</p><p>His144 is the most accessible to benzene probes in all examined flaviviral serotypes and thus likely to be a primary interaction moiety for potential antiviral drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Our simulations show that benzene interactions with His144 also lead to an increased disorder within the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>), which is an effect that would need to be considered in the context of drug design. Nonetheless, the proximity of other cluster residues suggests that all of them have the potential to play a role in drug-binding and in turn be modulated in their response to a low pH environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our simulation studies of DENV1-4, YFV and Zika rafts provide a detailed perspective of the dynamic behaviour of flaviviral envelopes in the presence of benzene. We elaborated on a wider context of shared hotspot characteristics and potentially druggable cryptic pockets that could be utilised in the inhibition of the early stages of the viral life cycle. We have demonstrated that conserved surfaces share not only residue identity, but also similar patterns of benzene binding and increased SASA, highlighting the importance of residue conservation in the context of detection of shared binding hotspots. We also provided a detailed view of the β-OG pocket behaviour in different flaviviral species that exhibited a high degree of serotype specificity when examined for pocket opening events.</p><p>Furthermore, the ⍺ pocket was mapped across flaviviral serotypes and revealed a relatively consistent profile in terms of conservation, size and opening kinetics. It contained a cluster of conserved ionisable residues, and its position at the domain interfaces prompted further exploration of its role in pH-dependent conformational changes using constant-pH simulations. The conserved cluster displayed increased disorder at lower pH values and interdomain dissociation (a prerequisite for the formation of the fusogenic trimer). Protonation-driven disruption of the DI-DIII interface suggests its critical role in the endosomal pH-dependent conformational change. We also hypothesise that the cluster as a whole – as opposed to the usually considered histidine residues only – plays a role in the conformational shift, corroborating previous experimental observations that histidines alone might not be the only pH-sensing residues responsible for the orchestration of the pH-dependent conformational switch. Collectively, our findings provide a link between the sequence-dependent dynamic behaviour of hotspots and the mechanistic overview of their functional roles, and offer a comprehensive foundation for rational drug design targeting the envelope of flaviviruses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Benzene mapping of flaviviral rafts</title><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>Raft modelling</title><p>A raft encompasses a large surface area of the viral envelope and therefore exhibits a distinct curvature in its quaternary structure, which manifests itself in angled contacts between neighbouring E proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Such crystal structures are thus unable to fully replicate native interchain contacts present in the spherical particle, highlighting the necessity of using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures to produce a reliable raft assembly. Currently, there are only two published cryo-EM structures of the mature DENV particle at atomic resolution, both of which are of the DENV2 serotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Renner et al., 2021</xref>)⁠.

His282, although present in the structure and implicated in pH-dependent conformational change, was excluded from the selection as it is natively interacting with the stem region (not present in this setup) and was therefore in a biologically irrelevant environment. Native disulfide bonds were included in the structure. The sE dimer was placed in an octahedron box and solvated with ~84,000 TIP3P water molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>)⁠ and neutralising 0.15 M NaCl.</p><p>The simulations were performed with the Amber ff99SB force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hornak et al., 2006</xref>)⁠ modified to include additional parameters relevant for constant-pH. Bond radii of Asp and Glu residues were reduced as carboxylate oxygens were defined with two hydrogens on each protonation site. All constant-pH simulations were performed using the Amber20 simulation software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Case et al., 2005</xref>)⁠. The system was initially minimised using a combination of steepest descent and conjugate gradient algorithms performed in 5,000 cycles and with protein backbone position restraints defined with a force constant of 4184 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>nm<sup>–2</sup> (10 kcal mol<sup>–1</sup>Å<sup>–2</sup>). The system was then gradually heated to 310 K over 400 ps by applying Langevin thermostat with a collision frequency of 5.0 ps<sup>–1</sup>. The <italic>NPT</italic> equilibration step was performed for 4 ns with Langevin dynamics maintaining a constant pressure of 1 atm defined by a collision frequency of 1.0 ps<sup>–1</sup>. The production steps of constant-pH simulations were run under 10 pH conditions across the scale of pH = 0, 1, 2, … 9. Production runs were simulated for 22 ns each in the <italic>NPT</italic> ensemble, with attempted protonation state changes every 100 simulation steps (0.2 ps). Protonation attempts were performed by Monte Carlo sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mongan et al., 2004</xref>)⁠ based on transition free energies derived from generalised Born electrostatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bashford and Case, 2000</xref>)⁠ and with the Metropolis criterion used to determine if the protonation change should be accepted or not. All simulations were run with a 2 fs integration step, applying a SHAKE constraint algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ryckaert et al., 1977</xref>)⁠ to all bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Short-range electrostatic and Van der Waals interaction cutoffs were both set to 0.8 nm. Long-range electrostatics interactions were calculated using the PME method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darden et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Essmann et al., 1995</xref>⁠).</p><p>Constant-pH simulations were run in quadruplicates, resulting in a total production time of 880 ns.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Analysis procedures</title><sec id="s3-3-1"><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>Flaviviral polyprotein sequences were accessed from GenBank using following accession codes: DENV1 strain PVP159: AEM92304.1; DENV2 strain NGS-C: P14340.2; DENV3 strain H87: P27915.1; DENV4 strain H241: Q58HT7.1; YFV strain 17D: P03314.1; Zika strain H/PF/2013: A0A024B7W1.1. Sequence similarity was determined using the Sequence Identity and Similarity (SIAS) software. Multiple sequence alignment of the E and M proteins was performed using MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edgar, 2004</xref>)⁠. Alignment visualisation and generation of the neighbour-joining (NJ) tree was performed using Jalview 2.11.1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Waterhouse et al., 2009</xref>)⁠.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen José Faraldo-Gómez as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jana Shen (Reviewer #2); Mikael Lund (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A more thorough analysis of the constant pH simulations, especially whether the cryptic binding site(s) identified with fixed-protonation-state simulations is (are) likely to change when pH dependence is included. Analysis of charge capacitance is also recommended.</p><p>2) Further clarification of some methodological details, such as the treatment of membrane.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the study has been conducted and analyzed rather carefully. I have only a few questions.</p><p>1. Glycan has been shown to be important in several recent SARs-Cov-2 spike protein simulations. The authors didn't include the glycan component explicitly. It will be useful to further comment on potential technical challenges that motivated this approximation and its limitations.</p><p>2. Many viral envelop proteins (e.g. the HIV) contain a rather high concentration of cholesterol, which appears to play a major role in modulating not only the membrane property but also the structure and assembly of the envelope proteins. The authors didn't include cholesterol in their model. It will be useful to comment on the potential implications.</p><p>3. The cryptic binding sites were characterized mainly by the SASA values. Are there other characterizations that might be more relevant for future drug design, such as the volume of the cavity?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– A major weakness of the paper appears to be the flawed design of the simulation. The benzene mapping simulations were conducted using fixed protonations which are not specified in the paper, and thus they do not address any pH response. Why wouldn't the authors conduct the constant pH simulations first to determine protonation states and then use these protonation states to conduct conventional MD with benzenes?</p><p>– Another major weakness is that the conclusions are not very clear at least in my assessment. The authors claimed the α pocket to the cryptic pocket, but this conclusion can not be discerned from the presented figures. In fact, in Figure 2, 3 and others, the y values of the region around residue 144 is discontinuous. Not sure why. The conclusion of the constant pH part is very vague, and I can't understand what it is exactly.</p><p>– Overall, there are too many plots that are tangentially relevant. I suggest they can be moved to SI and instead focus the plots on the data that support the conclusions.</p><p>– It is unclear what exactly the histidine switch hypothesis is. The discussion needs to be more specific. Related to this, it is unclear how the determined protonation states address the hypothesis.</p><p>– The convergence of protonation state sampling should be included in the SI.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic>– p5, line 32. One or two commas would elevate readability– p6, line 4. I wonder if &quot;mixed-solvent&quot; is the right term here. The benzene concentration is 0.6 M and is, compared to &gt;50 M water, rather a co-solute.</p><p>– Membrane curvature: Curvature is imposed by MD constraints as detailed in the Method section. I understand that the membrane is not the focus of the analysis, but how does this curvature co-exist with the PBC of the simulation box? The scheme implies that the membrane + raft is surrounded by replicas.</p><p>– Figure 2A: Why do the +bnz plots initially drift? If part of the equilibration, I would have expected them to start at the -bnz levels.</p><p>– Figure 4C: It's not obvious how to interpret the &quot;violin&quot; plots: the distributions have no scale; and showing two mirrored halves seems redundant. The same comment applies to Figure 6A.</p><p>p13-14. Here I suggest revising the use of &quot;rate(s)&quot; as it took me a while to realise that the discussion is not about kinetics, but statics. I suspect that to many readers, &quot;rate&quot; would imply a dynamic property. Perhaps &quot;ratio&quot;, &quot;quotient&quot;, or &quot;fraction&quot; could be alternatives.</p><p>– Figure 6: This plot is packed with information and is used to support a detailed discussion about the role of the found charge cluster. I think that it works well. At pH is data in Fig6a obtained? I understand that the PCA is based on the indicated residue-residue distances. Another way to describe charge-charge interactions is via an electric multipole expansion of the cluster charges. Perhaps an analysis involving the dipole and quadrupole moment could be revealing. Merely a thought.</p><p>– Cluster response to pH changes. Figure 6a/b analyses the net-charge of the cluster which probes the overall protonation state. To judge how a pH change would affect the cluster, the charge capacitance, C=-^2 should be straightforward to extract. Measuring the charge fluctuations, it can be directly linked to a charge response due to a pH change. See e.g. doi:10.1017/S003358351300005X. Along the same lines, I wonder of fluctuations in SASA or Rg would reveal information of how easily the cluster is perturbed. Finally, I would have liked to see how the PCA would change in the presence of benzene.</p><p>p22, line 19: I think it would be useful to know exactly how many benzene molecule. Is it sufficient to saturate the protein surfaces? Or is there a deficit which could affect the number of observed contacts.</p><p>p22, Section 4.1.1. I would prefer to have slightly more information about the setup: &quot;semi-isotropic&quot; could be more specific as well as details about update intervals of the barostat and thermostat.</p><p>p24, line 17: Does this mean that solvent and other solutes are not part of the (de)protonation acceptance criterion? That is, is all explicit solvent replaced by a continuum? If so, could one not use a much cheaper constant pH scheme for conformational sampling?</p><p>p26, line 13: I much appreciate that the authors have made the effort to deposit the electronic material on Zenodo. This is a nice and very helpful gesture to the community!</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82447.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A more thorough analysis of the constant pH simulations, especially whether the cryptic binding site(s) identified with fixed-protonation-state simulations is (are) likely to change when pH dependence is included.

We also assessed the convergence of protonation state sampling in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1.</p><p>Although we examined using charge capacitance to further elaborate on the effect of the charge cluster protonation on protein conformation, we believe that this analysis would not be appropriate for our specific case. Proton-exchange in the used constant-pH simulation method was allowed only for small number of residues, so the changes in protonation states across the pH values do not accurately describe the changes in the overall charge. We provide more details on this topic in response to the reviewer below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Further clarification of some methodological details, such as the treatment of membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>We added clarifications to the Methods section: namely, we specified position-restrained residues in the TM domain (4.1.1 Raft modelling); we included the number of benzene molecules used in our simulation systems (4.1.3 Benzene mapping simulation setup); we also added more details about the used barostat (4.1.4 Benzene mapping simulation protocol). Finally, we reasoned about our chosen system setup (regarding glycosylation and membrane composition) in the 2.6 Limitations section. There we also reflected on the possible limitations of the chosen constant-pH simulation method. Further details are provided below in response to the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, the study has been conducted and analyzed rather carefully. I have only a few questions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments, and appreciate the opportunity to reply to the questions/suggestions below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Glycan has been shown to be important in several recent SARs-Cov-2 spike protein simulations. The authors didn't include the glycan component explicitly. It will be useful to further comment on potential technical challenges that motivated this approximation and its limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the role of glycans in the viral envelopes. It is indeed one of the key components of the envelope, and its omission from the model was due to challenges in using the benzene mapping in the presence of glycans. At that point, the applicability of the benzene flooding approach had been verified only against systems containing protein and membrane components, but not with glycans (since then, we have successfully applied this method to the glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Zuzic et al., 2022: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2022.05.006)). We were also concerned that the addition of glycans would hinder benzene access to the tightly-packed protein surface, necessitate an even bigger simulation box and, consequently, require more benzene probes, which would result in an unmanageable amount of exclusions between all probe molecules. Motivated by this important comment, we have now included a “Limitations” section in our paper and elaborated on the reasoning behind using the unglycosylated form of the E protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Many viral envelop proteins (e.g. the HIV) contain a rather high concentration of cholesterol, which appears to play a major role in modulating not only the membrane property but also the structure and assembly of the envelope proteins. The authors didn't include cholesterol in their model. It will be useful to comment on the potential implications.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an excellent point on the weaknesses of the modelled membrane, and we acknowledge the potential drawbacks of our chosen membrane composition. The used lipid composition data was based on the lipidomics analysis of DENV2 expressed in C6/36 mosquito cells (Zhang et al., 2012: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M112.384446), but this research failed to address lipid types other than phospholipids. Other studies have highlighted the abundance of sphingolipids in West Nile virus (Martin-Acebes et al., 2014: https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.02061-14) and the critical role of cholesterol for DENV infection in mammalian cells (Carro and Damonte, 2013: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.03.005). Additionally, ordered lipid densities (possibly PE) have been observed in the cryo-EM structure of Spondweni, Zika, and DENV2 envelope (DiNunno et al., 2020: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18747-4), and the conservation of the pocket across flaviviral species suggests functional relevance of the bound lipid, possibly linked to envelope stabilisation.</p><p>In the benzene mapping segment of this research, the membrane predominantly served to provide a hydrophobic medium for the TM helices, shielding the TMs and the underside of the proteins from interacting with the solvent molecules. Considering that the main aim of the benzene mapping was to examine transient cryptic pockets accessible from the viral surface, we put forward that the membrane appropriately served its purpose in this case.</p><p>Nevertheless, in light of the key point highlighted by the reviewer, we have also included a paragraph addressing the membrane composition under the 2.6 Limitations section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The cryptic binding sites were characterized mainly by the SASA values. Are there other characterizations that might be more relevant for future drug design, such as the volume of the cavity?</p></disp-quote><p>The volume measurements of the cryptic sites can be problematic due to the fact that: (i) they are highly dynamic and transient in nature, (ii) surface edges of both observed pockets are defined by flexible loops, the positions of which can excessively affect the value of the reported volume; (iii) the pocket-mapping algorithms that are applicable to simulation trajectories are for the most part imprecise, as the pocket coordinates and boundaries are insufficiently well defined. Specifically, pocket-mapping algorithms rely on extrinsic properties — namely, 3D coordinates within a simulation box — to define a pocket of interest and to calculate its volume. This makes the alignment of the pocket (essentially, an “empty space”) within and across trajectories a non-trivial task, particularly taking into consideration the highly dynamic properties of cryptic pockets. Additionally, defining the pocket edges towards the surface is arbitrary and for the most part requires human input to filter excessively mapped or “spilled” pocket edges. In practice, this is a noteworthy issue when attempting to make a meaningful comparison between different simulation systems.</p><p>Considering the factors above, we refrained from reporting on volume measurements in this paper, as we deemed them to be too imprecise. Instead, we opted for a more comparable measure of the pocket expanse that is SASA, which circumvents some of these issues by using the measurement relating to the “filled” space (surface areas of the residues lining the pocket). Previously, we reported the volume of the ⍺ pocket (2.20 ± 0.51 nm<sup>3</sup>) based on the smaller DENV2 E<sub>2</sub>M<sub>2</sub> model (Zuzic et al., 2020: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00370).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– A major weakness of the paper appears to be the flawed design of the simulation. The benzene mapping simulations were conducted using fixed protonations which are not specified in the paper, and thus they do not address any pH response. Why wouldn't the authors conduct the constant pH simulations first to determine protonation states and then use these protonation states to conduct conventional MD with benzenes?</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, the initial aim of the study was entirely unmotivated from elucidating the pHdependent mechanism of conformational changes in flaviviral envelopes. Instead, our primary goal was to detect cryptic pockets on the flaviviral rafts, which is why we set out to utilise the benzene mapping method on the raft with fixed protonation states from the start. Since the aim was to discover envelope pockets that could potentially be a target prior to cellular entry, the ionization state of amino acids were set according to the neutral pH of the extracellular environment.</p><p>Only after the benzene mapping study was conducted, we observed the unusual cluster of conserved residues in the α pocket that merited further investigation. Therefore, the pH-dependence became relevant post factum, which then motivated our constant-pH simulations to further probe the role of the discovered cluster.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Another major weakness is that the conclusions are not very clear at least in my assessment. The authors claimed the α pocket to the cryptic pocket, but this conclusion can not be discerned from the presented figures. In fact, in Figure 2, 3 and others, the y values of the region around residue 144 is discontinuous. Not sure why. The conclusion of the constant pH part is very vague, and I can't understand what it is exactly.</p></disp-quote><p>The cryptic nature of the α pocket is presented in Figure 5 —figure supplement 1, where we compared the pocket SASA across simulations in the absence (-bnz) and presence of benzene (+bnz). This is also indicated in the main text (under section 2.4 The ⍺ pocket located on the domain interfaces is conserved and contains a buried cluster of charges).</p><p>The apparent discontinuities in the figures showing properties measured on a sequence residue-basis are due to the sequence alignment – since different flavivirus envelope proteins vary in length and/or contain deletions/insertions – thereby ensuring that the corresponding key residues are vertically aligned. We attempted to make that point clearer in the figure legends.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the weaknesses in our explanations of the conclusions regarding constant pH simulations. We have now reformulated our conclusions (section 3) in order to make it clearer for the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Overall, there are too many plots that are tangentially relevant. I suggest they can be moved to SI and instead focus the plots on the data that support the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we understand that the title mainly highlights exploration of the pH-dependence of the cluster of charges, the conclusions drawn from this research are multi-faceted, and require understanding of both the benzene-based cryptic pocket discovery, as well as the pH-dependent conformational effect of the charged cluster. The figures follow the “trajectory” of the conducted research and assume that the reader is not entirely familiar with the benzene mapping approach or its implications, which is why three out of six figures are dedicated to addressing this research segment.</p><p>We are suggesting that the figures are relevant for understanding the overall results of the research, including model features (Figure 1), benzene mapping method verification (Figure 2), effects of benzene on the raft surface (Figure 3), analysis of the positive control β-OG pocket (Figure 4), main features of the ⍺ pocket (Figure 5), and finally, the effect of pH on the charged cluster behaviour (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is unclear what exactly the histidine switch hypothesis is. The discussion needs to be more specific. Related to this, it is unclear how the determined protonation states address the hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important omission of the histidine-switch hypothesis explanation. We have now included more details of the hypothesis in the introduction, and also reinstated it in the conclusion of section 2.5 (Disruption of the ⍺ pocket charge cluster at low pH) to hopefully make things clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The convergence of protonation state sampling should be included in the SI.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for this important suggestion and we have now included the convergence of pK<sub>a</sub> values for all examined residues in the Supplementary Information (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– p5, line 32. One or two commas would elevate readability</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the sentence was clumsily formulated. We have now split the statement into two parts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– p6, line 4. I wonder if &quot;mixed-solvent&quot; is the right term here. The benzene concentration is 0.6 M and is, compared to &gt;50 M water, rather a co-solute.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment as we had not considered the accuracy of the used term. Indeed, the hydrophobicity of benzene, as well as the ratio of the two components, would most accurately classify benzene as a co-solute. We have introduced this correction in p6, line 12. When addressing a wider group of pocket detection methods that are based on different solvent components (including, but not limited to benzene), we used the term “co-solvent” as a more frequently used and broader description of the approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Membrane curvature: Curvature is imposed by MD constraints as detailed in the Method section. I understand that the membrane is not the focus of the analysis, but how does this curvature co-exist with the PBC of the simulation box? The scheme implies that the membrane + raft is surrounded by replicas.</p></disp-quote><p>This is the correct understanding of the simulation setup. The membrane exists in the PBC context, which means that it forms an undulating landscape. This is not ideal or physiologically relevant for the context of viral envelopes (although under certain dengue viral morphologies something like it has been observed), but the membrane analysis was not focused on any great detail, as it was not deemed sufficiently accurate. Instead, the curvature was induced by retaining position restraints on C⍺ atoms of the TM helices in order to preserve accurate inter-chain contacts and angles between envelope monomers, which are the key factors in sampling the external cryptic surface.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2A: Why do the +bnz plots initially drift? If part of the equilibration, I would have expected them to start at the -bnz levels.</p></disp-quote><p>The first 50 ns that were excluded from the analysis were a part of the production run, during which the benzene probes were free to move and bind onto the protein surface. Therefore, SASA of the +bnz systems drifts towards higher values as compared to the -bnz systems. We opted to exclude this from our plot visualisation in Figure 2A and B to remain consistent with all the other conducted analyses (all of them excluded the first 50 ns of the production run).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4C: It's not obvious how to interpret the &quot;violin&quot; plots: the distributions have no scale; and showing two mirrored halves seems redundant. The same comment applies to Figure 6A.</p></disp-quote><p>Perhaps the most convenient way to interpret violin plots is to imagine them as vertical density plots in which the area represents the abundance of data points at any given value of y. Unlike “standard” density plots, where the density is represented by an area that occupies only the positive values of the y-axis, violin plots utilise both positive and negative values of the central axis, giving them a symmetrical shape.</p><p>Figure 4C is a swarm plot, which means that individual measurements across frames are represented as non-overlapping points which, as a result, approximate a violin plot shape (but does not fully correspond to it). The area covered by data points is therefore affected by the number of sampled points. In 4C, +bnz systems are sampled more as compared to -bnz (they consist of 5 and 3 repeats, respectively), which also means that the total area covered by points in +bnz is bigger as compared to -bnz systems.</p><p>This is unlike “true” violin plots (such as Figure 6A), in which the number of samples is not directly correlated with the total area of the violin(s) at a given discrete value of x. In other words, even though the majority of the samples in Figure 6A belongs to a cluster of charge 0, the area of this violin plot is the same as the much less sampled state with cluster charge of +3.</p><p>In conclusion, we thank the reviewer for pointing out the issues with interpretability of these plots. We have therefore added clarifications in figure texts (both for Figure 4C and 6A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p13-14. Here I suggest revising the use of &quot;rate(s)&quot; as it took me a while to realise that the discussion is not about kinetics, but statics. I suspect that to many readers, &quot;rate&quot; would imply a dynamic property. Perhaps &quot;ratio&quot;, &quot;quotient&quot;, or &quot;fraction&quot; could be alternatives.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for this comment, as we believe that the suggested term modification improved the accuracy of our claims. Instead of using the term “rate”, we instead now refer to the “ratio of open/closed states” of the pocket.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 6: This plot is packed with information and is used to support a detailed discussion about the role of the found charge cluster. I think that it works well. At pH is data in Fig6a obtained? I understand that the PCA is based on the indicated residue-residue distances. Another way to describe charge-charge interactions is via an electric multipole expansion of the cluster charges. Perhaps an analysis involving the dipole and quadrupole moment could be revealing. Merely a thought.</p></disp-quote><p>The data in Figure 6A contains cumulative radius of gyration measurements across all simulated pH values (pH 0-9). We have now added this clarification in the Figure text.</p><p>We considered expanding our analyses by determining the dipole moment for the cluster, but we were hindered by some analysis implementation issues. Namely, it is unclear to us how to extract information about partial charge changes of our titratable residues from the constant-pH simulations (implemented in Amber). Calculating the dipole moments from simulations with fixed charges would be relatively easy, as the dipole moment would be (only) a function of atom positions. However, the constant-pH simulations allow for the changes of partial charges of atoms included in the titratable residue. As far as we understand, to calculate this we would require information about the fluctuations in partial charge for all relevant atoms and across all trajectory frames. Obtaining this information from the run simulations was, sadly, not obvious to us.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Cluster response to pH changes. Figure 6a/b analyses the net-charge of the cluster which probes the overall protonation state. To judge how a pH change would affect the cluster, the charge capacitance, C=-^2 should be straightforward to extract. Measuring the charge fluctuations, it can be directly linked to a charge response due to a pH change. See e.g. doi:10.1017/S003358351300005X. Along the same lines, I wonder of fluctuations in SASA or Rg would reveal information of how easily the cluster is perturbed. Finally, I would have liked to see how the PCA would change in the presence of benzene.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out an interesting approach to quantifying molecular charge fluctuations expressed as a protein property of capacitance, which we have not considered before. We used the Eq. 12 from the linked article to calculate protein charge capacitance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), as our constant-pH simulations were run in a titration regime (pH 0-9).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>sE protein dimer capacitance as a function of pH.</title><p>The charge fluctuation was allowed on twelve residues of the simulation system (six on each monomer): His27, Asp42, His144, His244, His317, Glu368.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82447-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>However, we are reluctant to include this analysis in the publication, as the main limitation of the constant-pH method is the fact that the proton-exchange was allowed only for a limited number of titratable residues (as detailed in the Methods section 4.2. Constant-pH MD simulations on DENV2 soluble E protein dimer). This results in an incorrect picture of the net charge on the simulated protein, as only a selection of residues underwent titration, whereas the other residues were assigned a fixed protonation state. Furthermore, the envelope model used for constant-pH simulations was truncated (it contained only the soluble E protein dimer), which would also be a limitation in assessing the capacitance of a much larger multimer forming the viral envelope.</p><p>The constant-pH simulations are therefore useful for elaborating on the shorterrange effects of cluster residue (de)protonations and their effect on inter-domain stability. However, they cannot give us an accurate picture of the overall variance in mean charge, as it is a property that hinges upon the “titration regime” of the whole protein – or in this case, the viral envelope.</p><p>The mapping of cluster changes in the presence of benzene cannot be provided within the scope of this study, as benzene-flooding simulations were performed under the fixed protonation state regime only. We instead included an additional analysis of the ⍺ pocket, namely the mapping of the pocket surface area across different protonation states of the cluster (Figure 6 —figure supplement 4). As the constant-pH simulations were run with a reduced-size envelope model and only on DENV2, the absolute numbers of pocket SASA are not as informative as with the raft simulations (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1). Nonetheless, the general trend of pocket expansion is consistent with our observations of cluster disruption and domain dissociation under low-pH conditions. Using this information, we have further elaborated on the implications of the ⍺ pocket targeting by drug molecules and their potential mechanism of inhibition in Section 2.7 Perspectives on cryptic hotspot discovery in flaviviruses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p22, line 19: I think it would be useful to know exactly how many benzene molecule. Is it sufficient to saturate the protein surfaces? Or is there a deficit which could affect the number of observed contacts.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the information about the number of added benzene molecules (1148 per system) in the manuscript under the section 4.1.3 Benzene mapping simulation setup.</p><p>Our best guess is that the saturation level was not reached with this number of benzenes (in preliminary studies of DENV2 rafts with 0.8 M benzene, we did not observe unfolding effects), but there was a concern that the addition of too many benzene molecules would have undesirable effects in terms of membrane behaviour, subsequent unfolding, or the abundance of nonspecific “noise” contacts between proteins and probes. Therefore, we did not pursue the upper bounds of the saturation value (which is unknown for our specific system).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p22, Section 4.1.1. I would prefer to have slightly more information about the setup: &quot;semi-isotropic&quot; could be more specific as well as details about update intervals of the barostat and thermostat.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more detail about compressibility and time constants of both thermostat and barostat to the manuscript (under the section 4.1.4 Benzene mapping simulation protocol).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p24, line 17: Does this mean that solvent and other solutes are not part of the (de)protonation acceptance criterion? That is, is all explicit solvent replaced by a continuum? If so, could one not use a much cheaper constant pH scheme for conformational sampling?</p></disp-quote><p>This understanding of the (de)protonation criterion being assessed in the generalised Born implicit solvent model is correct, and we acknowledge it as a downside of the applied method. We did not consider use of the cheaper implicit solvent for conformational sampling (as implemented by Baptista et al., https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1497164), as the main bottleneck of the constant-pH simulation approach was not the computational expense, but method availability. The computational cost of the simulation was not considered as a major factor in our method selection, and we decided to use the explicit water model where possible. This was presumed to provide enhanced credibility in conformational sampling. Therefore, the method which combines an explicit water model during fixed protonation states and an implicit model for (de)protonation updates was deemed appropriate at the time.</p><p>If we were to conduct similar research in future, we may opt for an all-explicit water model in constant pH simulations, as was recently developed by Groenhoff and Hess groups and implemented in Gromacs (Aho et al., 2022: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00516). Motivated by this comment, we included a remark about the constant-pH simulation approach and the future direction in the 2.6 Limitations section of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p26, line 13: I much appreciate that the authors have made the effort to deposit the electronic material on Zenodo.
