Project: Cancer Biology,</ext-link> we published a Registered Report (Phelps et al., 2016) that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper ‘Coding-independent regulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN by competing endogenous mRNAs’ (Tay et al., 2011). Here, we report the results. We found depletion of putative PTEN competing endogenous mRNAs (ceRNAs) in DU145 cells did not impact <italic>PTEN</italic> 3’UTR regulation using a reporter, while the original study reported decreased activity when <italic>SERINC1</italic>, <italic>VAPA</italic>, and <italic>CNOT6L</italic> were depleted (Figure 3C; Tay et al., 2011). Using the same reporter, we found decreased activity when ceRNA 3’UTRs were overexpressed, while the original study reported increased activity (Figure 3D; Tay et al., 2011). In HCT116 cells, ceRNA depletion resulted in decreased PTEN protein levels, a result similar to the findings reported in the original study (Figure 3G,H; Tay et al., 2011); however, while the original study reported an attenuated ceRNA effect in microRNA deficient (Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup>) HCT116 cells, we observed increased PTEN protein levels. Further, we found depletion of the ceRNAs <italic>VAPA</italic> or <italic>CNOT6L</italic> did not statistically impact DU145, wild-type HCT116, or Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cell proliferation. The original study reported increased DU145 and wild-type HCT116 cell proliferation when these ceRNAs were depleted, which was attenuated in the Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells (Figure 5B; Tay et al., 2011). Differences between the original study and this replication attempt, such as variance between biological repeats, are factors that might have influenced the results. Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>metascience</kwd><kwd>PTEN</kwd><kwd>ceRNA</kwd><kwd>microRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009827</institution-id><institution>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><institution>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</institution></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is funded by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, provided to the Center for Open Science in collaboration with Science Exchange.

For each of these papers, a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Phelps et al., 2016</xref>) for a paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tay et al., 2011</xref> and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.</p><p>In 2011, Tay et al. reported <italic>PTEN</italic> was modulated through competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), which are protein-coding RNA transcripts that compete for microRNAs through common micoRNA response elements (MREs). Testing four candidate <italic>PTEN</italic> ceRNAs Tay and colleagues reported that for three of these candidate ceRNAS (<italic>SERINC1</italic>, <italic>VAPA</italic>, and <italic>CNOT6L</italic>) silencing the ceRNAs impacted the activity of a luciferase construct engineered with the 3’UTR of <italic>PTEN</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tay et al., 2011</xref>). Using the same reporter construct, overexpression of the 3’UTRs of these ceRNAs were reported to increase luciferase activity suggesting inhibition of <italic>PTEN</italic> 3’UTR was relieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tay et al., 2011</xref>). These effects were reported to be dependent on microRNAs since inhibition of PTEN protein expression when ceRNAs were depleted was abrogated when DICER, a key part of the microRNA machinery, was disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tay et al., 2011</xref>). Two ceRNAs, <italic>VAPA</italic> and <italic>CNOT6L</italic>, when depleted also resulted in increased cell proliferation and phosphorylation of AKT when depleted, which was attenuated when DICER was disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tay et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The Registered Report for the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tay et al., 2011</xref> described the experiments to be replicated (Figures 3C-D, 3G-H, 5A-B, and Supplemental Figures S3A-B), and summarized the current evidence for these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Phelps et al., 2016</xref>). Since that publication additional studies have reported finding other ceRNAs of <italic>PTEN. TNRC6B</italic> was identified as a ceRNA of <italic>PTEN</italic> with depletion of <italic>TNRC6B</italic> reported to decrease PTEN mRNA and protein expression in the prostate cancer cell lines DU145, 22RV1, and BM1604 and increase cell proliferation in DU145 and PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zarringhalam et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zarringhalam et al., 2017</xref> also used <italic>CNOT6L</italic> in their study and reported depletion of <italic>CNOT6L</italic> produced similar results as <italic>TNRC6B</italic> depletion. <italic>DNMT3B</italic> and <italic>TET3</italic> were recently reported to be ceRNAs of <italic>PTEN</italic> with miR-4465 identified as a microRNA regulating these three transcripts via their 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Roquid et al., 2019</xref>). Multiple studies have reported a growing list of potential ceRNAs, which includes mRNAs, pseudogenes, lncRNAs, and circRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebert and MacRae, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). For example, the lncRNA <italic>BGL3</italic> has been identified as a ceRNA for <italic>PTEN</italic> to regulate Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation in chronic myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2015</xref>) and c-Myc has been reported as a potential ceRNA for PML/RARα in acute promyelocytic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>). Prediction of putative ceRNAs are being reported using a variety of computational methods and data sources that construct ceRNA interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Park et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Song et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Swain and Mallick, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yue et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, recently it has been reported that 3’UTR shortening of transcripts of predicted ceRNAs could be a potential mechanism of repressing tumor-suppressor genes, including <italic>PTEN</italic>, in trans by disrupting ceRNA cross-talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2018a</xref>).</p><p>At the same time, whether physiological changes of ceRNAs can modulate microRNA activities remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai and Wan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Thomson and Dinger, 2016</xref>). Experiments designed to test the feasibility of the ceRNA hypothesis, have reported that microRNA-binding sites are generally much higher than the number of microRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denzler et al., 2014</xref>). This would suggest that under physiological conditions ceRNA perturbation would likely lead to a change too small to be detected and to produce biological consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broderick and Zamore, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denzler et al., 2014</xref>). Mullokandov and colleagues reported that only the most abundant microRNAs mediate target suppression as over 60% of detected microRNAs have no discernable activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mullokandov et al., 2012</xref>). Bosson and colleagues suggested that the microRNA-target ratios determined the respective susceptibility to ceRNA-mediated regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosson et al., 2014</xref>). This model has been further examined and Denzler and colleagues reported that while microRNA levels did not affect site competition, they defined microRNA-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denzler et al., 2016</xref>). The experimental strategies currently used for studying the ceRNA hypothesis are also limited, especially when attempting to represent the in vivo levels of endogenous RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai and Wan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jens and Rajewsky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Thomson and Dinger, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The outcome measures reported in this Replication Study will be aggregated with those from the other Replication Studies to create a dataset that will be examined to provide evidence about reproducibility of cancer biology research, and to identify factors that influence reproducibility more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ceRNA depletion on <italic>PTEN</italic>-3’UTR luciferase reporter activity</title><p>We independently replicated an experiment to test if putative <italic>PTEN</italic> ceRNAs modulate the 3’UTR of <italic>PTEN</italic>. This experiment used a chimeric luciferase construct tagged with the <italic>PTEN</italic> 3’UTR (Luc-<italic>PTEN</italic>-3’UTR) to uncouple regulation of <italic>PTEN</italic> via 3’UTR-targeting microRNAs from <italic>PTEN</italic> mRNA transcription and protein stability. This is similar to what was reported in Figure 3C and Supplemental Figure S3A of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tay et al., 2011</xref> and described in Protocol 1 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Phelps et al., 2016</xref>). DU145 cells were co-transfected with Luc-<italic>PTEN</italic>-3’UTR and siRNAs targeting the same putative <italic>PTEN</italic> ceRNAs as the original study. Knockdown efficiency was examined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The average reduction in gene expression relative to control siRNA was 65% when <italic>SERINC1</italic>, <italic>VAPA</italic>, <italic>CNOT6L</italic>, or <italic>PTEN</italic> were targeted, but was only 21% for <italic>ZNF460</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), despite transfection efficiency being at least 90% based on a fluorescent transfection indicator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Luciferase activity was decreased in <italic>PTEN </italic>depleted cells (average RLU = 12%) relative to control siRNA (average RLU = 100%); however, luciferase activity when the putative <italic>PTEN</italic> ceRNAs were targeted for depletion were similar to control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). All planned comparisons were not statistically significant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend). The original study reported statistically significant decreased luciferase activity with siRNA-mediated depletion of <italic>SERINC1</italic> (average RLU = 70%), <italic>VAPA</italic> (average RLU = 48%), <italic>CNOT6L</italic> (average RLU = 70%), or <italic>PTEN</italic> (average RLU = 20%), but not for knockdown of <italic>ZNF460</italic> (average RLU = 109%), compared to control siRNA (average RLU = 100%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tay et al., 2011</xref>). The range of luciferase values reported in the original study had relative standard deviations (RSDs) (control = 9%; <italic>SERINC1</italic> = 10%; <italic>VAPA</italic> = 6%; <italic>CNOT6L</italic> = 5%; <italic>ZNF460</italic> = 8%; <italic>PTEN</italic> = 5%) that were much smaller than the RSDs observed in this replication attempt (control = 36%; <italic>SERINC1</italic> = 57%; <italic>VAPA</italic> = 36%; <italic>CNOT6L</italic> = 50%; <italic>ZNF460</italic> = 33%; <italic>PTEN</italic> = 19%), which is one of the factors that could influence if statistical significance is reached, particularly since the sample size of this replication attempt was determined a priori to detect the effect based on the originally reported data. The original study also reported an achieved knockdown of 90% or greater when <italic>SERINC1</italic>, <italic>VAPA</italic>, <italic>CNOT6L</italic>, or <italic>PTEN</italic> were targeted, but was 65% for <italic>ZNF460</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tay et al., 2011</xref>). The difference in achieved knockdown between the original study and this replication attempt is a possible reason for the differences in Luc-<italic>PTEN</italic>-3’UTR outcomes. A higher level of knockdown might be required to observe an effect with this experimental design. Although, unlike experiments that evaluate protein function where a higher level of knockdown or a longer period of time is usually needed to observe a phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curtis and Nardulli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">O’Keefe, 2013</xref>), the putative ceRNA function of these mRNAs should correspond to the level of knockdown. Thus, a 65% knockdown would have been expected to capture ~72% of the effect observed in the original study that reported a 90% knockdown. To summarize, for this experiment, we found results that were not statistically significant where predicted, varied in direction relative to the original study for the putative <italic>PTEN</italic> ceRNAs, and in the same direction as the original study for cells transfected with siPTEN.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Luciferase activity in DU145 cells co-transfected with siRNA against <italic>PTEN</italic> ceRNAs and a luciferase-<italic>PTEN</italic> 3’UTR reporter construct.</title><p>DU145 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter with a fragment of the 3’UTR of <italic>PTEN</italic>.

Further, the original study reported lower RSDs for PTEN protein levels across all the siRNA conditions in the Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells compared to the wild-type HCT116 cells (Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup>: 0.1–9% vs wild-type: 8–17%), while this replication attempt observed larger RSDs compared to the original study, especially for Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells (Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup>: 29–61% vs wild-type: 12–46%). Importantly, the individual biological repeats were largely consistent relative to the control siRNA condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This difference in variance between the original study and this replication attempt could influence if statistical significance is reached. To summarize, for this experiment, we found results that were generally in the same direction as the original study, varied in terms of statistical significance, and in Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells effects that were of a larger magnitude than the original study.

For Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells, depletion of <italic>PTEN</italic> resulted in increased cell proliferation compared to control siRNA with a similar magnitude as wild-type cells, depletion of <italic>VAPA</italic> resulted in an increased proliferation compared to control siRNA, but not at the same magnitude as occurred in wild-type cells, while depletion of <italic>CNOT6L</italic> resulted in a slight decrease in cell proliferation compared to control siRNA. To test if depletion of the putative <italic>PTEN</italic> ceRNAs increased proliferation in wild-type HCT116 cells and were attenuated in the Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells, we performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the AUC for each biological repeat. The ANOVA result was statistically significant for the siRNA main effect (<italic>F</italic>(3,24) = 12.1, p=5.20×10<sup>−5</sup>). Thus, the null hypothesis that there is no difference in cell proliferation when the putative <italic>PTEN</italic> ceRNAs or <italic>PTEN</italic> was depleted, whether or not it was conducted in wild-type or Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells, can be rejected. The main effect for cell type (<italic>F</italic>(1,24) = 1.81, p=0.191) was not statistically significant, indicating the null hypothesis that there is no difference in cell proliferation between wild-type or Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells can not be rejected, and the interaction effect was not statistically significant (<italic>F</italic>(3,24) = 0.734, p=0.542). These results suggest that while there were differences in cell proliferation when the putative <italic>PTEN</italic> ceRNAs or <italic>PTEN</italic> were depleted, it was similar between cell lines suggesting a lack of an attenuated ceRNA effect. We also conducted six comparisons using the Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons, making the a priori adjusted significance threshold 0.0083. According to this criterion, depletion of <italic>PTEN</italic> in wild-type or Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells resulted in statistically significant increases in cell proliferation compared to control siRNA. Depletion of <italic>VAPA</italic> or <italic>CNOT6L</italic> did not result in a statistically significant increase in cell proliferation compared to control siRNA in wild-type HCT116 cells. Additionally, depletion of <italic>CNOT6L</italic>, but not <italic>VAPA</italic>, resulted in a statistically significant decrease in cell proliferation compared to <italic>PTEN-</italic>depleted Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells. The original study reported reduced expression of <italic>VAPA</italic> or <italic>CNOT6L</italic> in wild-type HCT116 cells resulted in a statistically significant increase in cell proliferation compared to control siRNA similar to what was observed with <italic>PTEN</italic> siRNA, which was statistically significantly attenuated in the Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tay et al., 2011</xref>). Further, the original study (Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup>: 1–15%; wild-type: 5–10%) and this replication attempt (Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup>: 6–19%; wild-type: 5–10%) observed similar RSDs. To summarize, for this experiment we found results that varied in statistical significance and varied in direction relative to the original study for the putative <italic>PTEN</italic> ceRNAs, but were in the same direction as the original study for cells transfected with siPTEN.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Meta-analyses of original and replication effects</title><p>We performed a meta-analysis using a random-effects model, where possible, to combine each of the effects described above as pre-specified in the confirmatory analysis plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Phelps et al., 2016</xref>). To provide a standardized measure of the effect, a common effect size was calculated for each effect from the original and replication studies. Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> is the standardized difference between two means using the pooled sample standard deviation, while the effect size Glass’ delta is the standardized difference between two means using the standard deviation of only the control group. Glass’ delta was used when the variance between the control and treatment conditions were not equal in the original or replication study experiments. The estimate of the effect size of one study, as well as the associated uncertainty (i.e. confidence interval), compared to the effect size of the other study provides one approach to compare the original and replication results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Errington et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Valentine et al., 2011</xref>).

The other effects were inconsistent in whether the direction of the effect was the same between the two studies, if the effect size of one study was within the confidence interval of the other study, or both.

The Western blot results with the phospho-AKT antibody were inconsistent and largely absent of a signal. This was not due to the Western blot technique as other antibodies gave reliable singles, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Instead, the result is likely due to the lack of phosphatase inhibitors included in the lysis buffer. Of note, the original study also did not use phosphatase inhibitors.

Competing Endogenous mRNAs&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Nilsen as Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers concurred that the paper presented a sincere and thorough attempt to replicate the results of &quot;Coding-independent regulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN by competing endogenous mRNAs&quot; (Tay et al., 2011). A major conclusion is that Errington and colleagues were not able to reproduce the results of the Tay et al., 2011 paper. Both of the reviewers also questioned the validity of the ceRNA hypothesis, a hypothesis that serves as the foundation for Tay et al., 2011. The overall sentiment was to accept the paper provided that the authors revise the manuscript to address the points raised by reviewers 1 and 2.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The present paper reports the results of a Replication Study detailed in the Registered Report (Phelps et al., 2016). The authors tried to replicate a few selected experiments from the paper &quot;Coding-independent regulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN by 45 competing endogenous mRNAs&quot; (Tay et al., 2011), and compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.</p><p>This paper reports that this replication study does not support the findings in the original study for several replicated experiments.</p><p>For example, the replication study demonstrated that depletion of putative PTEN competing endogenous mRNAs (ceRNAs) in DU145 cells did not impact PTEN 3'UTR regulation using a reporter, while the original study reported decreased activity when SERINC1, VAPA, and CNOT6L were depleted. The authors suggest that differences between the original study and this replication attempt, such as level of knockdown efficiency and cellular confluence, are factors that might have influenced the results. Specifically, the average reduction in gene expression relative to control siRNA in the replication study was 65% when SERINC1, VAPA, CNOT6L, or PTEN was targeted, but was only 21% for ZNF4. In contrast, the original study reported an achieved knockdown of 90% or greater when SERINC1, VAPA, CNOT6L, or PTEN was targeted, but was 65% for ZNF460 (Tay et al., 2011). Since the purpose of the Replication Study is to replicate the original study, are there reasons or technical difficulties that prevent the authors from conducting the experiments with the same level of knockdown of SERINC1, VAPA, CNOT6L, PTEN, and ZNF460?</p><p>In addition, the replication study showed that over-expression of ceRNA 3'UTRs resulted in decreased activity, while the original study reported increased activity. Further, the replication study found depletion of the ceRNAs VAPA or CNOT6L did not statistically impact DU145, wild-type HCT116, or Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cell proliferation, while the original study reported increased DU145 and wild-type HCT116 cell proliferation when these ceRNAs were depleted, which was attenuated in the Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells. I assume that sample size of each replication experiment was determined with the variance estimated from the original study. I am wondering whether there is any significant difference in variances between the original study and the replication study and whether this difference can partially explain the discrepancy between the original study and the replication study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>As part of the Reproducibility Project, the authors attempt to replicate selected experiments from Tay et al., 2011, who interpreted their results as evidence that PTEN is regulated through a mechanism involving competing endogenous mRNAs (ceRNAs). Although most of the results of Tay et al. do not appear to be reproducible, the authors of the current paper appear to have done what they could do to rigorously repeat the earlier experiments.</p><p>1) The Introduction provides many examples of other putative ceRNAs that have been proposed to regulate PTEN in the past five years (Introduction, third paragraph). However, no mention is made of either the controversy regarding the ceRNA hypothesis or the fact that experiments designed to test the feasibility of the ceRNA hypothesis have indicated that these proposed ceRNAs are expressed at levels that are far too low to enable their physiological variability in expression to impact expression of PTEN or other miRNA targets through the proposed ceRNA mechanism [see Denzler et al., 2016, and references therein]. The issue is that for each miRNA the number of target sites in the transcriptome is very high (typically estimated to exceed 50,000 sites per cell), and thus a physiologically feasible change in the level of a putative ceRNA has little hope of perceptively influencing the regulation other targets--it's just not possible because each putative ceRNA contributes such a small fraction of the total sites for each miRNA. Listing these numerous examples of putative ceRNAs proposed in the last five years without also mentioning either the controversy or the data calling into question the ceRNA hypothesis might mislead readers into thinking that the ceRNA hypothesis advocated by Tay et al., 2011, is plausible and generally accepted by the miRNA research community.</p><p>2) When discussing the results of experiment #1, the authors suggested that their inability to reproduce the results of the original study might be attributable to their inability to match the knockdown efficiencies achieved in the original study. They were able to knockdown the putative ceRNAs with an average efficiency of 65%, whereas the original study reported an average knockdown efficiency of 90%. When knocking down these putative ceRNAs, it would have indeed been better to have been able to reproduce the knockdown efficiencies of the original paper, and if the goal of the experiment was to evaluate the function of the protein products of these mRNAs, then the weaker knockdowns would have been a major concern, since a 65% knockdown is often not sufficient to observe reduced protein function. However, when evaluating the putative ceRNA function of these mRNAs, the weaker knockdown is less of a concern. Here, a 65% knockdown should capture 65% of the ceRNA effect, which corresponds to nearly three quarters of the effect expected with a 90% knockdown (0.65/0.90 = .72). Thus, the inability to detect any hint of a ceRNA effect in an experiment in which most of the effect was expected is informative. The original paper interpreted the results of these knockdowns from the perspective of the ceRNA hypothesis, and the current paper would be more informative if it did the same.</p><p>3) The summary of the results of the experiments with Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells (Abstract and subsection “ceRNA depletion on PTEN expression”, last paragraph) does not convey the large difference between the results observed in the two studies. In this experiment, it is not the direction of the change that matters--it's the magnitude of the change that matters. The original study observed small differences (&lt; 1.2-fold) when performing the knockdown of putative ceRNAs in Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells, which were interpreted as evidence of an attenuated ceRNA effect. The attempt to repeat this result found large differences (1.4- to 2.9-fold), which cannot be simply interpreted as an attenuated ceRNA effect. Although this discrepancy between the two studies is correctly summarized later (subsection “Meta-analyses of original and replication effects”, fourth paragraph), it is not clearly stated when it is first described (subsection “ceRNA depletion on PTEN expression”, last paragraph) or summarized in the Abstract. Thus, as with the results of experiment #1, the results of this experiment would be more informative if viewed from the perspective of the ceRNA hypothesis. Although it would be beyond the scope of this paper to come up with new hypotheses to explain any results that differ from those of the original paper, it would be appropriate to state whether the results of the replication attempt support the ceRNA hypothesis put forward in the original paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56651.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The present paper reports the results of a Replication Study detailed in the Registered Report (Phelps et al., 2016).

These criteria were stated in the Registered Report (e.g., Protocol 1, step g. 1.). As with other Replication studies, this is one of many differences that can be considered when interpreting the results of the replication to the original study. However, as raised by reviewer #2 the concern is larger with experiments evaluating protein function. So it is possible, but we did not explore, what conditions would be necessary to achieve a level of knockdown as reported in the original study, while maintaining a healthy cell culture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the replication study showed that over-expression of ceRNA 3'UTRs resulted in decreased activity, while the original study reported increased activity. Further, the replication study found depletion of the ceRNAs VAPA or CNOT6L did not statistically impact DU145, wild-type HCT116, or Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cell proliferation, while the original study reported increased DU145 and wild-type HCT116 cell proliferation when these ceRNAs were depleted, which was attenuated in the Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells. I assume that sample size of each replication experiment was determined with the variance estimated from the original study. I am wondering whether there is any significant difference in variances between the original study and the replication study and whether this difference can partially explain the discrepancy between the original study and the replication study.</p></disp-quote><p>This replication attempt, like all of the replication attempts in the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, were designed to perform independent replications with a calculated sample size to detect the originally reported effect size with at least 80% power based on the originally reported data, which included the means, standard deviations, and sample sizes provided by the original authors. Specifically for the questions raised in this comment: For overexpression of ceRNA 3’UTRs we observed larger RSDs than the original (original: 6-13%; replication: 12-17%), but likely not large enough to fully explain the difference between the original and replication studies. For the cell proliferation experiment, we observed similar RSDs in wild-type and Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells, especially for VAPA and CNOT6L (original: wild-type: VAPA = 8%, CNOT6L = 8%; Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup>: VAPA = 15%, CNOT6L = 6%; replication: wild-type: VAPA = 5%, CNOT6L = 10%; Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup>: VAPA = 12%, CNOT6L = 19%). But for DU145, while the control siRNA conditions were similar between the studies, the original RSDs were much lower in the original study compared to the replication, so is a factor that could influence if statistical significance is reached. In the revised manuscript we included the relative standard deviations (RSDs) for both the original and replication results for all experiments to provide a direct comparison as well as the impact this could have on whether statistical significance is reached.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>As part of the Reproducibility Project, the authors attempt to replicate selected experiments from Tay et al., 2011, who interpreted their results as evidence that PTEN is regulated through a mechanism involving competing endogenous mRNAs (ceRNAs). Although most of the results of Tay et al. do not appear to be reproducible, the authors of the current paper appear to have done what they could do to rigorously repeat the earlier experiments.</p><p>1) The Introduction provides many examples of other putative ceRNAs that have been proposed to regulate PTEN in the past five years (Introduction, third paragraph). However, no mention is made of either the controversy regarding the ceRNA hypothesis or the fact that experiments designed to test the feasibility of the ceRNA hypothesis have indicated that these proposed ceRNAs are expressed at levels that are far too low to enable their physiological variability in expression to impact expression of PTEN or other miRNA targets through the proposed ceRNA mechanism [see Denzler et al., 2016, and references therein]. The issue is that for each miRNA the number of target sites in the transcriptome is very high (typically estimated to exceed 50,000 sites per cell), and thus a physiologically feasible change in the level of a putative ceRNA has little hope of perceptively influencing the regulation other targets--it's just not possible because each putative ceRNA contributes such a small fraction of the total sites for each miRNA. Listing these numerous examples of putative ceRNAs proposed in the last five years without also mentioning either the controversy or the data calling into question the ceRNA hypothesis might mislead readers into thinking that the ceRNA hypothesis advocated by Tay et al., 2011, is plausible and generally accepted by the miRNA research community.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional references in the revised manuscript to present a more balanced view of the ceRNA hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) When discussing the results of experiment #1, the authors suggested that their inability to reproduce the results of the original study might be attributable to their inability to match the knockdown efficiencies achieved in the original study. They were able to knockdown the putative ceRNAs with an average efficiency of 65%, whereas the original study reported an average knockdown efficiency of 90%. When knocking down these putative ceRNAs, it would have indeed been better to have been able to reproduce the knockdown efficiencies of the original paper, and if the goal of the experiment was to evaluate the function of the protein products of these mRNAs, then the weaker knockdowns would have been a major concern, since a 65% knockdown is often not sufficient to observe reduced protein function. However, when evaluating the putative ceRNA function of these mRNAs, the weaker knockdown is less of a concern. Here, a 65% knockdown should capture 65% of the ceRNA effect, which corresponds to nearly three quarters of the effect expected with a 90% knockdown (0.65/0.90 = .72). Thus, the inability to detect any hint of a ceRNA effect in an experiment in which most of the effect was expected is informative. The original paper interpreted the results of these knockdowns from the perspective of the ceRNA hypothesis, and the current paper would be more informative if it did the same.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have included this in the discussion of the results of experiment #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The summary of the results of the experiments with Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells (Abstract and subsection “ceRNA depletion on PTEN expression”, last paragraph) does not convey the large difference between the results observed in the two studies. In this experiment, it is not the direction of the change that matters--it's the magnitude of the change that matters. The original study observed small differences (&lt; 1.2-fold) when performing the knockdown of putative ceRNAs in Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup> HCT116 cells, which were interpreted as evidence of an attenuated ceRNA effect. The attempt to repeat this result found large differences (1.4- to 2.9-fold), which cannot be simply interpreted as an attenuated ceRNA effect. Although this discrepancy between the two studies is correctly summarized later (subsection “Meta-analyses of original and replication effects”, fourth paragraph), it is not clearly stated when it is first described (subsection “ceRNA depletion on PTEN expression”, last paragraph) or summarized in the Abstract. Thus, as with the results of experiment #1, the results of this experiment would be more informative if viewed from the perspective of the ceRNA hypothesis. Although it would be beyond the scope of this paper to come up with new hypotheses to explain any results that differ from those of the original paper, it would be appropriate to state whether the results of the replication attempt support the ceRNA hypothesis put forward in the original paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have included revisions in the discussion of the PTEN protein expression experiment as well as the Abstract to more accurately reflect how the replication results differ from the original study and the impact this has on the microRNA-dependent manner of the ceRNA hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
