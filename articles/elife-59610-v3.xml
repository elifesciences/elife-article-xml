During the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), maternal products are cleared and zygotic genome activation occurs (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vastenhouw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamm and Harrison, 2018</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, the first 13 mitotic divisions involve rapid nuclear cycles (nc), that include only a short DNA replication S phase and no G2 phase, and the nuclei are not enclosed in separate membrane compartments but instead present in a shared cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foe and Alberts, 1983</xref>). This streamlined division cycle likely relates to the fast development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, permitting rapid increase in cell number before gastrulation in a matter of a few hours. Gene expression is initiated during the early syncytial stage, as early as nc7, and continues to the cellularized blastoderm stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali-Murthy and Kornberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kwasnieski et al., 2019</xref>). Gene expression patterns may be transient or continuous, lasting through gastrulation or beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kvon et al., 2014</xref>). This process is controlled by a specific class of transcription factors called pioneer factors, which bind to closed chromatin cis-regulatory regions to create accessible binding sites for additional transcription factors during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2014</xref>). The pioneer Zelda (Zld) is a ubiquitous, maternal factor that binds to promoters of the earliest zygotically expressed genes and primes them for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harrison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>). It was unknown whether a similar regulation exists in other animals until the zebrafish Pou5f1, homolog of mammalian Oct4, was shown to act in an analogous manner to Zld in that it controls zygotic gene activation in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Leichsenring et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A complete understanding of how widespread activation of zygotic gene expression is achieved is lacking, but several regulatory mechanisms have been proposed. One model suggests that a decrease in histone levels over time due to dilution during nuclear division provides an opportunity for the pioneer factors that drive zygotic gene expression to successfully compete for DNA access and activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shindo and Amodeo, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamm and Harrison, 2018</xref>). Chromatin accessibility can also be more specifically modulated by targeted action of transcriptional factors at regulatory loci. For example, Zld is pivotal for the MZT as it increases accessibility of chromatin at enhancers thereby allowing binding of other transcriptional activators at these DNA regions which facilitates initiation of zygotic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yáñez-Cuna et al., 2012</xref>). Zld binds nucleosomes, another characteristic of pioneer factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McDaniel et al., 2019</xref>), and therefore loss of Zld leads to a global decrease in zygotic gene expression as many enhancer regions remain inaccessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Through its effects on chromatin accessibility, Zld has been shown to influence the ability of morphogen transcription factors, Bicoid and Dorsal, to support embryonic patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foo et al., 2014</xref>). While Zld is clearly pivotal for supporting MZT, some genes continue to be expressed even in its absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nien et al., 2011</xref>). As chromatin accessibility in the early embryo has recently been shown to be a dynamic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bozek et al., 2019</xref>), it is possible that Zld contributes in a stage-specific manner and that other as yet unidentified pioneer factors contribute to the extended process of zygotic genome activation.</p><p>The embryo undergoes a widespread state change after the 14th nuclear division, termed the midblastula transition (MBT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foe and Alberts, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shermoen et al., 2010</xref>). This developmental milestone is marked by dramatic slowing of the division cycle and cellularization of nuclei before the onset of embryonic programs of morphogenesis and differentiation. Cell membranes encapsulate nuclei to form a single-layered epithelium. In addition, at nc14, developmental changes relating to DNA replication occur; namely a lengthened S-phase and the introduction of G2 phase into the cell cycle. MBT is also associated with clearance of a subset of maternally provided mRNAs, large-scale transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome, and an increase in cell cycle length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). We hypothesized that other late-acting pioneer factors manage the MBT in addition to or in place of Zld.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene <italic>odd-paired</italic> (<italic>opa</italic>) encodes the founding member of the Zinc finger in the cerebellum (Zic) protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aruga et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hursh and Stultz, 2018</xref>). The important regulatory role of Zic (ZIC human ortholog) in early developmental processes has been established across major animal models and also implicated in human pathology (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aruga and Millen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Houtmeyers et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>opa</italic> is a broadly expressed gene of relatively long transcript length (~17 kB) that is activated during mid-nc14 and serves a number of important functions throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cimbora and Sakonju, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benedyk et al., 1994</xref>). Opa protein has a DNA-binding domain containing five Cys2His2-type zinc fingers, and shares homology with mammalian Zic1, 2, and three transcription factors. While mutants exhibit a pair-rule phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jürgens et al., 1984</xref>), the broad expression pattern of <italic>opa</italic> contrasts with the typical 7-stripe pattern of other pair-rule genes. Rather than providing spatial information as do most other pair-rule transcription factors, Opa instead acts as a timing factor to broadly regulate the expression of segment polarity genes including the transition of pair-rule genes to segmental expression patterns (i.e. from 7- to 14-stripes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clark and Akam, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benedyk et al., 1994</xref>). <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos die before hatching and in addition to aberrant segmentation, they also exhibit defects in larval midgut formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cimbora and Sakonju, 1995</xref>). During midgut formation, Opa regulates expression of a pivotal receptor tyrosine kinase required for proper morphogenesis of the visceral mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mendoza-García et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, at later stages, Opa supports temporal patterning of intermediate neural progenitors of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdusselamoglu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies suggested that Opa can influence the activity of other transcription factors to promote gene expression. A well-characterized target of Opa in the early embryo is <italic>sloppy-paired 1</italic> (<italic>slp1</italic>), a gene exhibiting a segment polarity expression pattern and for which two distinct enhancers have been identified that are capable of responding to regulation by Opa and other pair-rule transcription factors including Runt (Run; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cadigan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Prazak et al., 2010</xref>). One of these, the <italic>slp1</italic> DESE enhancer, mediates both Run-dependent repression and activation and Opa plays a central role by supporting Run’s activating input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hang and Gergen, 2017</xref>). Additionally, our recent study showed that Run regulates the spatiotemporal response of another enhancer, <italic>sog_Distal</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ozdemir et al., 2011</xref>; also known as <italic>sog_Shadow</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hong et al., 2008</xref>) to support its expression in a broad stripe across the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis on both sides of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koromila and Stathopoulos, 2019</xref>). Using a combination of fixed and live imaging approaches, our analysis suggested that Run’s role changes from repressor to activator over time in the context of <italic>sog_Distal</italic>; late expression requires Run activating input. These analyses of <italic>slp1</italic> DESE and <italic>sog_Distal</italic> regulation support the view that Opa might provide temporal input at enhancers.</p><p>The current study was initiated to investigate whether Opa supports late expression through the <italic>sog_Distal</italic> enhancer. Previous studies had not linked Opa to the regulation of DV patterning. Nevertheless, through mutagenesis experiments coupled with in vivo imaging, we provide evidence that Opa does regulate expression of the <italic>sog_Distal</italic> enhancer. Further, we show that Opa’s role is indeed late-acting, occurring in embryos at mid-nc14 onwards, whereas the enhancer initiates expression at nc10. Given its ability to regulate key embryonic enhancers in a temporal manner, we hypothesized that Opa may play a general role in activating zygotic gene expression during late MZT, much as Zld does earlier. To assay Opa’s genome-wide effects on gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the embryo, we used a combination of sequencing approaches: RNA-seq transcriptome profiling, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) and single-embryo Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq). Our whole-genome data demonstrate that Opa contributes to patterning the embryo by serving as a general timing factor, and possibly as a pioneer, to broadly influence zygotic transcription in nc14, as the embryo undergoes cellularization, during late phase of the maternal-to-zygotic transition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Opa regulates the <italic>sog_Distal</italic> enhancer demonstrating a role for this gene in DV axis patterning</title><p>In a previous study, we created a reporter in which the 650 bp <italic>sog_Distal</italic> enhancer sequence was placed upstream of a heterologous promoter from the <italic>even skipped</italic> gene (<italic>eve.p</italic>), driving expression of a compound reporter gene containing both a tandem array of MS2 sites and the gene <italic>yellow</italic>, including its introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koromila and Stathopoulos, 2017</xref>). We used this reporter to assay gene expression supported by the <italic>sog_Distal</italic> enhancer in the early embryo. While this enhancer becomes active at nc10 and continues into gastrulation, in this study we focused on late expression through <italic>sog_Distal</italic> during nc13 and nc14. Due to its length (i.e. ~45 min compared to ~15 min for nc13 at 23°C) nc14 was assayed in four, roughly 12 min intervals: nc14A, nc14B, nc14C, and nc14D. Live movies were analyzed using a previously defined computational approach tailored to spatiotemporal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koromila and Stathopoulos, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In our previous study, mutation of the single Run binding site in the <italic>sog_Distal</italic> enhancer led to expansion of reporter expression early (i.e. nc13 and early nc14) but loss of expression late (i.e. nc14C and nc14D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koromila and Stathopoulos, 2019</xref>). These results suggested that Run’s role switches from that of repressor to activator in the context of <italic>sog_Distal</italic> enhancer during this time. Other studies also suggested that Run can function as either repressor or activator depending on context, as the response of a given enhancer to Run is influenced by the presence or absence of other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hang and Gergen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Prazak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Swantek and Gergen, 2004</xref>). This is the case for <italic>slp1</italic>, where Opa is required for Run-dependent activation of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Swantek and Gergen, 2004</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that Opa might also influence Run’s activity with respect to the <italic>sog_Distal</italic> enhancer; specifically, that Opa functions to support late expression of <italic>sog_Distal</italic>, when Run switches to providing activating input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koromila and Stathopoulos, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In concordance with this hypothesis, the <italic>sog Distal</italic> 650 bp enhancer sequence contains five putative 12 bp Opa binding sites, based on comparison with the vertebrate Zic3 consensus motif (JASPAR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). We introduced 2–4 bp mutations at these five sites (i.e. <italic>sogD_ΔOpa</italic>) and assayed MS2-MCP reporter expression by in vivo imaging of nascent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lucas et al., 2013</xref>). We found that expression was relatively normal up to stage nc14B but then exhibited a visually apparent decrease at nc14C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Quantitative analysis of MS2-MCP signal in embryos containing either the wildtype <italic>sog_Distal</italic> or <italic>sogD_ΔOpa</italic> reporters using a previously described analysis pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koromila and Stathopoulos, 2019</xref>) confirms that <italic>sog_Distal</italic> expression is greatly reduced at nc14C for the mutant reporter compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A similar loss of late expression only (i.e. nc14C onwards) was observed when even a single Opa site is mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, B', E</xref>) and this decrease is comparable to when the Run site is mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koromila and Stathopoulos, 2019</xref>). These results support the view that Opa promotes expression through <italic>sog_Distal</italic> from nc14C onwards, possibly, by supporting Run’s switch from repressor to activator (see Discussion).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Opa is required to support activation of reporter expression at late nc14, just preceding gastrulation.</title><p>In this and all other subsequent figures lateral views of embryos are shown with anterior to the left and dorsal up, unless otherwise noted.

Opa expression is absent at nc13, first observed at nc14B, and achieves its mature pattern approximately by nc14C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Two different anti-Opa rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate chromatin obtained from two embryo samples of average age 3 hr (roughly stages 5–6, encompassing nc14) or 4 hr (roughly stages 6–8, later than nc14) (see Methods). For the 3 hr ChIP-seq dataset, the MACS2 peak caller was used to identify 16,085 peaks, providing an estimate of the number of genomic positions occupied by Opa in vivo at this developmental timepoint. 200 bp regions centered at these peaks were analyzed using the HOMER program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) to identify overrepresented sequences that align to transcription factor binding motifs (see Materials and methods). The most significant hit, present in over 19% of all peaks, is a 7 bp core sequence with homology to the 12 bp Opa JASPAR consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, compare with 1G; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) as well as to mammalian homolog Zic transcription factors (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lim et al., 2010</xref>). A second motif exhibiting extended homology with the JASPAR Opa consensus was also identified through analysis of the Opa 3 hr ChIP-seq dataset, but this extended site is present at lower abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, D</xref>).

This suggests that ~6K peaks are occupied early-only (i.e. nc14; including late nc14 when enhancers associated with segmentation are active) and a roughly equal number are occupied late-only (following gastrulation, stage 6–8) possibly relating to Opa’s transition to a role in supporting visceral mesoderm specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mendoza-García et al., 2017</xref>) or other roles. Here, we focused on understanding Opa’s initial actions during nc14; therefore, region overlap analysis was used to identify common regions of occupancy for Opa and Zld, using several independently obtained ChIP-seq datasets inclusive of nc14: Opa (3 hr) and both Zld (nc13-14) and Zld (nc14 late) (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>, respectively) (see Materials and methods).

However, all Opa-bound regions - both Opa/Zld overlap and Opa only regions - are not affected upon <italic>zld</italic> knock-down (<italic>sh_zld</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-C, E-G</xref>), whereas Zld only regions are decreased in accessibility but only at an earlier timepoint, nc13, not at nc14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3H</xref> compare with 3D). While our results demonstrate that Opa, not Zld, regulates chromatin accessibility at nc14, we cannot exclude an accessory role for Zld.</p><p>To investigate Opa's mechanism of action, we compared the distance of <italic>opa</italic> motif to the nearest nucleosomes at nc14B between wildtype embryos and those that ectopically express <italic>opa</italic> to determine if evidence of nucleosome displacement could be inferred. ATAC-seq fragment sizes reflect nucleosome organization with a peak in the fragment-size distribution at 120–200 bp arising from DNA protected by a nucleosome. Ectopic expression of <italic>opa</italic> results in a trend toward shift in the positions of nucleosomes relative to binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>), suggesting that Opa displaces nucleosomes. To obtain more definitive evidence, we performed a quantitative analysis of our ATAC-seq data based on modeled nucleosome positions. The cumulative distribution of measured distances between 21440 unbound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and 4481 bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) Opa motif sites and modeled nucleosome dyad positions was determined using previously defined methods (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schep et al., 2015</xref>). We observe a shift to larger motif-nucleosome distance upon ectopic expression of <italic>opa</italic> compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>; red versus blue lines, respectively). These data support the view that Opa occupancy on DNA displaces nucleosomes. A recent study found that alternatively in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos there is a shift to smaller distance, which also supports the view that Opa is required to displace nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Soluri et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Opa-only occupied peaks require Opa to support accessibility at mid-nc14</title><p>Chromatin accessibility as characterized by single-embryo ATAC-seq revealed 88.5% overlap between the <italic>opa1</italic> and <italic>sh_opa</italic> closed chromatin peaks (versus open peaks in control), as well as 75% overlap between the <italic>sh_opa</italic> closed (accessible/open peaks in control) and <italic>UAS-opa</italic> open peaks (non-accessible/closed peaks in control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Accessibility was also examined at particular enhancers known to be bound by Opa. In particular, enhancer regions active in nc14 for genes expressed along AP and DV axes exhibit Opa-dependent changes in accessibility. For example, the <italic>VT15161 en</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kvon et al., 2014</xref>) exhibits an increase in accessibility in response to higher Opa levels, but a decrease in both <italic>sh_opa</italic> and <italic>opa1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, blue shaded region). Similar trends were identified for <italic>oc_Proximal, sog_Distal,</italic> and <italic>hb_stripe</italic> enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>; blue shaded regions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Perry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koromila and Stathopoulos, 2017</xref>). Moreover, the accessibility of these same enhancers was not affected in <italic>sh_zld</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, E, F</xref>). On the other hand, accessibility at other enhancer sequences, such as <italic>eve_3–7</italic>, was affected by changes in both <italic>opa</italic> and <italic>zld</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>; grey-shaded box). The Opa-bound regions fall into three classes: (i) regions that require Opa for accessibility (blue-shaded regions); (ii) regions that require both Opa and Zld for accessibility (grey-shaded regions); and (iii) regions that require Zld, but not Opa, for accessibility [mint-shaded regions; e.g. enhancer <italic>sog_intronic</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Markstein et al., 2002</xref>) and <italic>eve_LE</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujioka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>)]. Collectively, these results support the view that Opa can influence chromatin accessibility, but not all regions that are bound by Opa require this factor for accessibility (i.e. class iii). It is possible that at Opa-Zld overlap regions, in which both factors are bound, either Opa or Zld can suffice to support accessibility.</p><p>To determine whether the global effects on chromatin accessibility observed in <italic>opa</italic> mutants have consequences for patterning, we examined gene expression in mutant embryos and assayed for patterning phenotypes. We performed in situ hybridizations on wildtype and <italic>sh_opa</italic> embryos using riboprobes to detect endogenous transcripts for the genes <italic>sog</italic> and <italic>sna</italic>, expressed along the DV axis, and for <italic>hb</italic>, expressed along the AP axis. <italic>zld</italic> RNAi (<italic>sh_zld</italic>) mutants were also examined for comparison; loss of <italic>zld</italic> is known to affect both <italic>sog</italic> and <italic>hb</italic> as well as to cause a delay in <italic>sna</italic> expression that recovers by nc14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liang et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, embryos were examined at two stages, nc13 and nc14B, corresponding to timepoints before Opa is expressed or when it first initiates, respectively (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Even early, at nc13, <italic>zld</italic> mutant embryos exhibit loss of expression for all three genes examined (<italic>hb, sna</italic>, and <italic>sog</italic>), supporting the view that Zld is necessary for early gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,E</xref>). In contrast, little difference in expression was observed in <italic>opa</italic> mutants at nc13. This is unsurprising as <italic>opa</italic> is not expressed at nc13 and therefore would not be expected to affect patterning at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Later, at nc14C, <italic>opa</italic> mutants do exhibit expression defects, as both <italic>sog</italic> and <italic>hb</italic> expression is diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These expression defects likely relate to lack of Opa input at <italic>sog_Distal</italic>, <italic>hb_stripe</italic>, and <italic>hb_HG4-7</italic> enhancers that exhibit Opa-dependent changes in accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,A’</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Opa is a late-acting, pioneer factor whose action follows Zelda to drive a second wave of zygotic gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Aggregated signals and heatmaps of nc14B normalized ATAC-seq signal from wt and <italic>UAS-opa,</italic> as well as nc14D wt and <italic>opa</italic> RNAi (<italic>sh_opa)</italic> mutant embryos for downregulated (blue trace) and upregulated target genes as identified by RNA-seq (green trace).

Furthermore, only ChIP-seq regions that were present at the early timepoint exhibited decreased accessibility upon <italic>opa</italic> RNAi (i.e. 3 hr peaks as well as 3 hr + 4 hr overlap peaks). These data further support the view that Opa binding is dynamic and associated with changes in accessibility.</p><p>Finally, to provide additional insight into Opa’s function, we examined how Opa-dependent changes in chromatin accessibility correlate with changes in gene expression. Opa ATAC-seq peak regions were associated with the nearest gene transcription start site (TSS) to calculate overlap gene counts with <italic>opa</italic> mutant RNA-seq up- and down-regulated genes for nc14D embryos. Surprisingly, we found that Opa-dependent changes in chromatin accessibility occur near genes that are downregulated as well as those that are upregulated upon <italic>sh_opa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>; see Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In summary, our experiments indicate that Opa is a late-acting timing factor, and likely pioneer factor, which regulates gene expression throughout the embryo, along DV as well as AP axes. Opa, a non-canonical broadly expressed pair-rule gene, has only previously been implicated in AP axis patterning, but our initial analysis of the <italic>sog_Distal</italic> enhancer, which is active along the DV axis, led us to investigate a more general role for this factor. We show that <italic>opa</italic> mutants exhibit broad DV patterning changes in addition to previously identified AP patterning phenotypes and its role as a broadly-acting regulator of gene expression is supported by whole-genome gene expression profiling of <italic>sh_opa</italic> mutant embryos by RNA-seq. Opa likely acts directly to regulate gene expression, as Opa chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrates widespread binding throughout the genome, including at the <italic>sog_Distal</italic> enhancer. Additional data from single-embryo ATAC-seq provide insight into the mechanism by which Opa supports gene expression as <italic>opa</italic> knockdown affects chromatin accessibility at regions occupied by Opa but not by Zld, as determined by ChIP analysis. Chromatin accessibility in early embryos appears to be predominantly supported by Zld and then, once Opa is expressed in mid-nc14, the two factors seem to work together in this role. However, zygotic genes (or particular enhancers) associated with mid-nc14 to gastrulation or later, appear to be preferentially bound by Opa. Therefore, we suggest that Opa acts following the pioneer factor Zld to influence timing of zygotic gene activation at the whole-genome level by actively increasing late-acting enhancer accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Furthermore, Opa-bound regions (with and without Zelda) are enriched for late histone methylation, and this may relate either to Opa’s preference promoters or suggest a more causative function for Opa with respect to chromatin state. Opa’s regulatory impacts during development may therefore include both control of epigenetic marks as well as chromatin accessibility at promoters and/or promoter-proximal cis-regulatory elements. Further, in addition to supporting gene expression in a general manner by making chromatin accessible, Opa also presumably influences the activity of other transcription factors such as Run when co-bound to enhancers through mechanisms that are as yet not completely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koromila and Stathopoulos, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Prazak et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Through analysis of overrepresented motifs in the Opa ChIP-seq peak regions using the program HOMER, we identified a number of factors that may co-associate with Opa and provide additional insight into its function. For example, a motif matching the Dref binding consensus is enriched at Opa ChIP-seq peaks. Dref is highly enriched at promoters and has been implicated in multiple roles during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development including regulation of expression of signaling pathway components and chromatin organization including insulator and chromatin remodeling functions (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tue et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, as Dref has been linked to insulator function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gurudatta et al., 2013</xref>) and Zld has been shown to be associated with locus-specific TAD boundary insulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hug et al., 2017</xref>), future studies should examine whether temporal progression of gene regulatory networks is supported not only by the sequential action of pioneer factors to affect chromatin accessibility at enhancer/promoters but also by influencing chromatin conformation.</p><p>Regions of chromatin accessibility are thought to be established sequentially, where enhancers are opened in advance of promoters and insulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016a</xref>) and our results show enrichment of Opa binding near promoters. Opa may therefore influence gene expression timing by affecting accessibility at promoters, possibly, in combination with Dref. Alternatively, while the Trl/GAF motif was associated with all classes of peaks, it was enriched in Zld-only peaks. Furthermore, Trl/GAF and Dref were shown to be associated with early versus late embryonic expression (stage five and later), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Darbo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hochheimer et al., 2002</xref>). These results collectively support the view that Opa, like Dref, is a late-acting factor, and that Trl/GAF may work early with Zelda. However, other studies have shown that Trl/GAF acts coordinately but separately from Zld to support chromatin accessibility in regions that do not require Zld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Moshe and Kaplan, 2017</xref>).</p><p>More generally, the triggering of temporal waves of gene regulation in response to chromatin accessibility changes is a potentially widespread mechanism used to control developmental progression. A key future pursuit will be to understand how the expression of genes that act as triggers, such as <italic>opa</italic>, are regulated. To start, the <italic>opa</italic> transcript is over 17 kB in length, and this relatively long transcript size may contribute to its expression in late nc14 as previously studies have suggested that transcripts of this length are difficult (or impossible) to transcribe in earlier nuclear cycles due to short interphase length (i.e. nc13, etc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sandler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shermoen and O'Farrell, 1991</xref>). <italic>opa</italic> expression is also regulated by the nuclear-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio, whereas other genes like <italic>snail</italic> are not sensitive to N/C ratio but appear instead to be regulated by a maternal clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). It has been hypothesized that the initiation of N/C ratio-responsive genes is regulated by a maternal repressor, the activity of which is counteracted by increasing N/C ratio possibly through dilution (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamm and Harrison, 2018</xref>). Therefore, as a N/C-ratio responsive gene, <italic>opa</italic> expression may be regulated by maternal repression.</p><p>We propose that genes of different timing classes may be preferentially regulated by different pioneer factors, and that multiple factors may act coordinately to control stage-specific gene expression. For example, at nc14, which encompasses the MBT, Opa appears to be one timing factor acting, but Zld and possibly also other factors support this process. Despite significant expression changes in important regulators of this process such as <italic>Z600</italic>/<italic>frühstart</italic> (<italic>frs</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grosshans et al., 2003</xref>) in <italic>sh_opa</italic> embryos, no gross cellularization defects or changes in length of the cell cycle were detected. However, late <italic>Z600/frs</italic> expression at nc14D is associated with the dorsal ectoderm (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> in; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grosshans et al., 2003</xref>), and loss of Opa may present defects at later stages possibly in relation to function of dorsal tissues such as amnioserosa. In addition, Zld regulates expression of <italic>Z600/frs</italic> as well as a number of other genes involved in cellularization such as <italic>slam</italic>, <italic>halo</italic>, <italic>btsz</italic>, <italic>bnk</italic>, <italic>nullo</italic>, <italic>CG14427</italic>, and <italic>Sry-α</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). Of these genes, we also found evidence that Opa regulates expression not only of <italic>Z600/frs</italic> but also <italic>slam, halo</italic>, and <italic>bnk</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>: RNA-seq data). As <italic>opa</italic> expression is dependent on the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic volume (N/C-ratio sensing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lu et al., 2009</xref>), our data support the view that Opa sits at the top of a gene regulatory hierarchy that facilitates levels of expression of the genes above, which are involved in MBT, as well as other N/C-ratio sensing genes including <italic>sog</italic> and <italic>odd-skipped</italic>/<italic>CG3851</italic> (this study; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). Contrastingly, degradation of maternal transcripts, also an important part of the MBT, is not N/C-ratio dependent and likely relates to a function of Zld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liang et al., 2008</xref>) not Opa. It is possible that Opa supports expression of some but not all genes that regulate MBT. For example, Opa may not be involved in cell cycle pause as associated with <italic>zld</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liang et al., 2008</xref>), but may contribute to regulation of other cellular processes. GO analysis of genes downregulated in <italic>sh_opa</italic> mutants suggest that Opa regulates genes involved in biogenesis of cellular components, mitochondria and other organelles, metabolism, and vesicle organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, pioneer factors may exhibit spatially constrained functions. Opa’s expression in the embryonic trunk, but exclusion from the termini, suggest that additional late-acting factors may serve a pioneer role at the embryonic termini. For example, a recent study suggests that the transcription factor Orthodenticle (Otd) functions in a feed-forward relay from Bicoid to support expression of genes at the anterior of embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Datta et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, our analysis of the Zld ChIP-seq dataset identified enrichment for Cad transcription factor binding motifs in Zld-bound regions. Cad is localized in a gradient that emanates from the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mlodzik et al., 1985</xref>). It is possible that these factors, Otd and Cad, function to support the late-activation of genes expressed at the anterior and posterior termini, possibly also functioning as pioneer factors to facilitate action of particular late-acting enhancers in these domains where Opa is not present.</p><p>In addition, studies have shown that Zld influences morphogen gradient outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foo et al., 2014</xref>), and perhaps Opa does as well, during the secondary wave of the MZT. For example, activation of BMP/TGF-β signaling in the early embryo depends on the formation of a morphogen gradient of Decapentaplegic (Dpp) that corresponds in time with Opa expression (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stathopoulos and Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sandler and Stathopoulos, 2016</xref>). We suggest that temporally-regulated activators such as the late-acting, timing factor Opa may also support additional nuanced roles in the temporal regulation of morphogen gradient outputs to support patterning. For example, our previous study showed that BMP/TGF-β target genes exhibit different modes of transcriptional activation, with some targets exhibiting a slower response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sandler and Stathopoulos, 2016</xref>). <italic>opa</italic> mutant cuticles exhibit a pair-rule phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jürgens et al., 1984</xref>), but upon closer observation also exhibit a weak tail-up phenotype supporting a role for this gene in DV patterning, in particular, for support of BMP signaling target genes including <italic>doc2</italic> and <italic>doc3</italic> (e.g. the u-shaped group; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wieschaus and Nüsslein-Volhard, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Reim et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Opa is conserved, as it shares extended homology of protein sequence and DNA binding specificity with the Zic family of mammalian transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aruga et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hursh and Stultz, 2018</xref>). Zic family members are involved in neurogenesis, myogenesis, skeletal patterning, left-right axis formation, and morphogenesis of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grinberg and Millen, 2005</xref>). In addition, Zic family members have been shown to be important for the maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem (ES) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lim et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, Zic3 shares significant overlap with the Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 transcriptional networks and is important in maintaining ES cell pluripotency by preventing differentiation of cells into endodermal lineages.

RNA-seq libraries were constructed using NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB #E7770) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Resulting DNA fragments were end-repaired, dA tailed and ligated to NEBNext hairpin adaptors (NEB #E7335). After ligation, adaptors were converted to the ‘Y’ shape by treating with USER enzyme and DNA fragments were size selected using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter #A63880) to generate fragment sizes between 250 and 350 bp. Adaptor-ligated DNA was PCR amplified followed by AMPure XP bead clean up.

Bam format of data alignment files and GTF format of the UCSC dm6 reference gene file were loaded to Cuffquant module of Cufflinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref>) to quantify gene expression. Differential expression analysis was performed using Cuffdiff module of Cufflinks with default parameters, and FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) values were normalized by the geometric method that Cuffdiff recommends. To identify a gene or transcript as differentially expressed, Cuffdiff tests the observed log fold change in its expression against the null hypothesis of no change (i.e., that the true log fold change = 0). Because measurement error, technical variability, and cross-replicate biological variability might result in an observed log fold change that is nonzero even if the gene/transcript is not differentially expressed, Cuffdiff also assesses the significance of each comparison. A gene is considered significantly affected if the adjusted p-value (q-value) is less than 0.05 between two groups. Consistency of differentially expressed genes across replicate samples was assessed by visualizing gene z-score values in a heatmap (generated using the R heatmap.2 function). The Z-score value is calculated as sample FPKM value minus population mean, divided by population standard deviation. In addition, a volcano plot was generated to show gene log2(fold change of expression) vs. -log2(adjusted p-value of change).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ChIP-seq procedure</title><p>Opa-ChIP was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mendoza-García et al., 2017</xref>) using chromatin prepared from 100 mg of pooled collections of 3 hr (2.5–3.5 hr collection) and 4 hr (3.5–4.5 hr collection) <italic>y w[67c23]</italic> embryos with 10 ug affinity-purified anti-Opa antibodies from two different rabbits.

For calling of transcription factor binding sites, a workflow using bdgcmp and bdgpeakcall modules of the MACS2 peak caller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) was utilized. Peak calling was performed using merged replicate ChIP data (to improve the sensitivity of the peak calling by increasing the depth of read coverage) against input data (a proxy for genomic background). As noted, visual inspection of signal traces of both preimmune negative control data and genomic input data showed a clean background, thus mapped reads were merged to serve as background for ChIP-seq peak calling. Genomic regions with q-values of less than 10<sup>−5</sup> were defined as ChIP-seq peak regions. To understand overlapping of Opa and Zld binding sites across the genome, Opa and Zld peak regions were combined and overlapping peaks were merged. Combined regions that overlapped both Opa and Zld peaks were defined as Opa-Zld overlap regions; regions overlapping with either Opa or Zld peaks were defined as Opa-only and Zld-only regions respectively. Further de novo motif analysis was performed on different ChIP-Seq regions using the HOMER program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) with default parameters and with options -size 200 and -mask. The most enriched de novo motifs identified from Opa ChIP-seq peaks and from Zld ChIP-seq peaks were queried against the Opa-Zld overlap, Opa-only and Zld-only regions for comparison and for generating aggregation plots. Average ATAC-seq signals around different ChIP-seq regions were also calculated using the annotatePeaks.pl module of HOMER, with the -size 4000 -hist 10 options used for aggregation plots. Also different ChIP-seq regions were annotated and linked to the nearest gene transcription start sites. Functional gene annotation was performed using DAVID v6.7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jspcitation">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jspcitation</ext-link>). In addition, computeMatrix and plotHeatmap modules of deepTools were used to calculate and plot normalized histone mark and ATAC-seq signal intensities around different ChIP-seq regions.

First, to define the background, 150 bp peaks were called from the original data using HOMER (-localSize 50000 -minDist 50 -size 150 -fragLength 0) to capture most of the non-background regions. These 150 bp peaks were extended from the center to form 20000 bp ‘signal zones’. Outside these signal zones are ‘background zones’. Next, to sample the background noise, 100000 150 bp random regions were generated. Those 150 bp random regions that completely fell into the ‘background zones’ were regarded as ‘background regions’. The mean and standard deviation for the background noise were calculated from positive RPM scores of each nucleotide in these regions (ypbkg) based on log-normal distribution. Finally, RPM scores for the whole genome were centered and scaled based on the mean and standard deviation calculated, using one as pseudocount:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Integrative analysis of multi-omics data</title><p>ChIP-seq peak-associated genes and RNA-seq differentially expressed genes were subjected to overlapping count calculation, and the results were presented in a bar plot. To understand changes of chromatin accessibility surrounding transcription factor binding sites, ATAC-seq signals (average from three single embryo biological replicates; except for wt and <italic>sh_zld</italic> singled-end ATAC-seq data, as described above) within 1 kb genomic bins surrounding different categories of ChIP-seq regions were calculated, and presented in a box plot.

Peaks were called for the two merged samples using the method described above. We were particularly interested in the peaks that were less accessible in <italic>sh_opa</italic> embryos (n = 3). Therefore, the peaks called from the merged control sample (n = 3), were converted into broad peaks by extending 200 bp upstream and downstream and merging overlapped ones. These broad peaks were used as candidate input and differential peaks called from these processed datasets using the getDifferentialPeaks function (parameters: -size 200 F 2) from HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Nucleosome signature analysis</title><p>From the broad peaks called from merged <italic>UAS-opa</italic> and control ATAC-seq samples at nc14B using the method described above, we called nucleosome locations using NucleoATAC based on fragment size and using default parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schep et al., 2015</xref>). The peaks that had at least one nucleosome called by NucleoATAC were selected for downstream analyses. Genome motif scanning (fimo pipeline) using an Opa binding site consensus (JASPAR MA0456.1) revealed 25921 matches across the genome. These matches were further divided into 4481 ‘bound’ matched positions that overlap with Opa (3 hr) ChIP-seq peaks and 21440 ‘unbound’ ones that do not. Similarly, 3276 ‘bound’ and 22645 ‘unbound’ motif positions were also derived from those 25921 matches for Opa (4 hr) ChIP-seq peaks. For each of these four categories, matched motif positions that overlapped with the broad ATAC-seq called peaks (either <italic>UAS-opa</italic> or control samples) that also had at least one nucleosome called were identified. The distances between each motif location and its nearest nucleosome were recorded and plotted.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Chris Rushlow and Deborah Hursh for sharing fly stocks, Igor Antoshechkin and Henry Amrhein at the Millard and Muriel Jacobs Genetics and Genomics Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology for sequencing support, the lab of Josh Dubnau for assistance with Bioanalyzer samples, David Carlson and the Institute for Advanced Computational Science at the Stony Brook University, and Susie Newcomb, Leslie Dunipace and Frank Macabenta for assistance with experiments and comments on the manuscript.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Odd-paired is a late-acting pioneer factor coordinating with Zelda to broadly regulate gene expression in early embryos&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Erik Clark (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work can not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its present form. While all reviewers agreed that this work was of general interest, they all raised a number of concerns that require substantial additional experimentation that we think is outside the presently required 2 month time window. Given the general interest of the study, we do encourage you to consider these requested experiments. Should you be able to address these concerns we would be interested in seeing a substantially revised version of the paper submitted as a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Kormila et al. build on prior publications demonstrating that Runt activity at the sog distal enhancer transitions from a repressor to an activator by identifying Odd-paired (Opa)-binding to this regulatory element. They use live-embryo imaging to show that Opa-binding sites are required for late activation from this regulatory element and, using ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq analysis, they argue that Opa is a pioneer factor essential for a late wave of zygotic genome activation. While interesting, the genomic data as presented are somewhat superficially analyzed and do not support a clear role for Opa in driving chromatin accessibility, a defining feature of pioneer transcription factors.</p><p>1) The ChIP data would benefit from additional analysis. To determine biologically meaningful differences between the various ChIP peaks, the authors should analyze the relative peak heights for the 16,085 peaks. For example, are there any differences in relative peak heights for the peaks bound by Opa alone, Opa and Zld, or Zld alone? In Figure 3—figure supplement 1, it appears that the peaks uniquely bound by Opa at a single developmental time point (3h vs. 4h) are lower than the peaks shared between time points (assuming color indicates relative peak heights). If this is the case, these differences in binding may actually reflect variability in ChIP efficiencies for these lower peaks rather than meaningful biological changes. Relative peak heights can then be used in the analysis of the ATAC-seq to determine if those regions with the highest ChIP signal are correlated with accessibility.</p><p>2) For the ATAC-seq data statistical methods (i.e. DESeq2 or edgeR) should be used to identify significant changes in accessibility between wild-type and shRNA (<italic>opa</italic> or <italic>zld</italic>) embryos. How many regions lose accessibility overall? Once significant changes are identified, the overlap between these regions and binding of Zld and Opa can be directly tested. Are the regions that change in accessibility upon knockdown those with the highest ChIP-seq signal for the identified factor?</p><p>3) Better confirmation needs to be demonstrated for the shRNA knockdown. Given that the authors use anti-Opa and anti-Zld antibodies in Figure 1C to demonstrate protein expression this should be used on shRNA embryos to demonstrate protein knockdown and not just a decrease in the amount of RNA. Alternatively, western blots on bulk embryos should be used to demonstrate a decrease in levels of the protein products of the genes being targeted. In addition, because the Zld antibodies used in this manuscript have not been previously published information regarding antibody production and a demonstration of specificity needs to be included in the Materials and methods. Also, the staging of the single embryos used for the ATAC-seq should be noted.</p><p>4) The data presented alone do not allow the conclusion that Opa is a pioneer factor and thus the title for Figure 5 and some of the conclusions must be softened or additional data provided. There is no data presented that demonstrates that Opa establishes accessibility by accessing previously nucleosome-bound regions. In addition, there is a limited demonstration that the accessibility that is lost in an <italic>opa</italic> mutant has direct effects on either the ability of additional transcription factors to bind or gene expression. The prior analysis of Runt binding to the sog distal enhancer provides a mechanism for them to directly test the requirement for Opa-mediated accessibility in facilitating Runt binding. ChIP-qPCR for Runt on the sog distal enhancer reporter with the mutated Opa binding sites (Figure 1) and/or in the shRNAi knockdown would begin to address whether Opa has these additional defining features of a pioneer factor. In addition, the global effect of Opa-mediated accessibility on gene expression could be analyzed by RNA-sequencing.</p><p>5) There are a number of citations that should be added to the manuscript.</p><p>Kwasnieski et al., 2019 should be included with Ali-Murthy and Lott.</p><p>Xu et al., 2014 and Yanez-Cuna et al., 2014 should be included with Harrison, Liang and Nien.</p><p>Sun et al. Genome Research 2015 should be included with Schulz.</p><p>Some mention of Li et al., 2008 and the included demonstration that A/P factors bind D/V enhancers should be included.</p><p>Papers from which ChIP-seq data sets were analyzed should be cited.</p><p>Harrison et al., 2010 should be substituted for Schulz et al., 2015.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Based on the finding that the transcription factor <italic>opa</italic>, primarily known for its function during A/P segmentation, regulates the expression of a D/V enhancer (sog) at late stages, the authors question the role of <italic>opa</italic> at a whole genome scale. By performing <italic>opa</italic> ChIP-seq experiments as well as ATAC-seq in wt and embryos depleted for <italic>opa</italic>, the authors identify a new set of cis-regulatory regions bound by <italic>opa</italic> and whose accessibility is <italic>opa</italic>-dependent. By comparing these accessibility profiles to Zelda-dependent ones, the authors propose that <italic>opa</italic> acts a pioneer factor to control the timing of gene expression.</p><p>While the finding that <italic>opa</italic> controls accessibility and could act as a general timing factor during MBT that acts subsequently to Zld-mediated activation is novel and exciting, I have some reservations concerning the evidence supporting this finding. While the overall manuscript is promising, there are some issues with precision and rigor the authors should address. If these revisions are made, I would recommend this work for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>The title is “Odd-paired is a late acting pioneer factor…”. The defining properties of a pioneer factor are: a) protein binding to nucleosomal DNA; b) retention of the protein during mitosis; c) a general requirement for establishing/maintaining accessibility of the genome; d) cis-regulatory element binding prior to target gene activation; and e) a general function in reprogramming. While not all of these properties strictly need to be met to declare a TF a pioneer factor, the current manuscript only demonstrates that <italic>opa</italic> is necessary for accessibility. The title requires nuance, and the authors should discuss similarities and differences between <italic>opa</italic> and other pioneer factors within the body of the manuscript.</p><p>The claim that <italic>opa</italic> acts as a timing factor is not fully supported by the data. Zelda-mediated activation timing has been demonstrated by accelerating activation with extra Zld sites or delaying it via deletion of Zld sites (Foo et al., Crocker et al., Dufourt et al., Yamada et al., etc.). To support <italic>opa</italic> regulation of timing, similar experiments would strengthen this claim immensely. Alternatively, the authors could drive maternal expression of <italic>opa</italic> and examine the change in temporal behavior on their existing Sog-MS2 transgene.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Analysis of <italic>opa</italic> regulation of SogD-MS2 transgene</p><p>– In Figure 1A, a hole could be indicative of an unhealthy embryo. Moreover, Video 1 presented in the supplementary data does not correspond to these still images. The authors should provide images from a healthy embryo and show the corresponding video.</p><p>– In Figure 1, the number of videos should be indicated. Their quantification in terms of % of activation should be moved from the supplementary data to the main figure.</p><p>-In Figure 1—figure supplement 1, the authors should add the corresponding sog_unmutated control panels and the quantification of each genotype in terms of % activation.</p><p>– The images in Figure 1B suggest that reporter expression abnormally persists in the mesoderm of <italic>sogD_ΔOpa</italic> at nc14a. If true, the authors should comment on this result. Did the authors check that the <italic>opa</italic> mutations do not affect twi or sna binding sites?</p><p>2) ChIP-seq comparison of Zelda vs. <italic>opa</italic></p><p>– The reference for the Zelda ChIP-seq data should be indicated (subsection “Assay of overrepresented sites associated with Opa ChIP-seq peaks”).

If the accessibility results are similarly affected to those in <italic>opa</italic> RNAi then it would strengthen their conclusions.</p><p>– The author seems to have performed new ATAC-seq experiments on RNAi Zld, but the driver employed needs to be specified.

However, I think this experiment is less important than performing ATAC-seq in <italic>opa1</italic> mutants.</p><p>4) <italic>opa</italic> and chromatin accessibility</p><p>– Figure 4D suggests that accessibility seems much higher for Zelda/Opa common targets than for each TF target independently. Accessibility seems also higher for <italic>opa</italic> peaks compared to Zelda peaks. Is this data quantitative or semi-quantitative at all, and is there a way to explain that within the text? Can these curves be statistically compared? Can the authors produce similar graph at earlier and later stages?</p><p>– The accessibility results of Figure 4 should be complemented with Zelda and <italic>opa</italic> ChIP-seq tracks and organized to better emphasize the 3 groups of accessibility identified by the authors.</p><p>– It would be interesting to compare the <italic>opa</italic> peaks that are accessible independently of Zld to the genes that remain accessible in Zld mutants (Harrison, 2010, Schultz, 2015, Hannon, 2017).</p><p>I found figures 4 and 5 to be confusing. If the central idea of Figure 4 is to show that <italic>opa</italic> is responsible for chromatin accessibility, the authors should only present WT vs. <italic>opa</italic> RNAi. Then in Figure 5, they could add the Zelda RNAi comparison.</p><p>– Subsection “Opa-only occupied peaks require Opa to support their accessibility at mid-nc14”/Figure 4G: the tracks give no information on whether Zelda binds the eve LE enhancer. The authors could add the ChIP-seq tracks as performed in Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-B to clarify this. Additionally, the loss of accessibility in Zelda RNAi at this enhancer is shown but not commented on in the text.</p><p>– Also the panels of figures mentioned in the text are confusing and need revising. For example: Figure 3 is mentioned even though it does not show any accessibility data. Figure 4—figure supplement 1F does not exist.</p><p>– Subsection “Opa-only occupied peaks require Opa to support their accessibility at mid-nc14” paragraph three: The authors use the term <italic>opa1</italic> mutant, when in fact they are looking at <italic>opa</italic> RNAi-mediated transcript depletion, which is significantly different.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Opa is a zinc finger TF that is expressed broadly in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos during the latter part of cellularisation, gastrulation, and GBE. Koromila and colleagues use Opa ChIP-seq along with ATAC-seq from wt and <italic>opa</italic> RNAi embryos to show that Opa binds to thousands of regions across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome and is required for chromatin accessibility at many of them. The case study of the sog enhancer <italic>sog_Distal</italic> links these phenomena with effects on gene expression: mutating Opa binding sites present within this enhancer reduces the expression of a reporter gene at timepoints when Opa is expressed. The paper argues that Opa is an important pioneer factor that ushers in a second major wave of zygotic gene expression, separate and later than the one brought about by a different (and more extensively studied) zinc finger TF, Zelda. This is an important discovery, and along with a recent study from the Blythe lab that reaches similar conclusions, this paper will surely cause many researchers to investigate whether and how Opa is regulating their gene/developmental process of interest, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and beyond.</p><p>I do have some concerns about the staging of the embryos. In particular, the central claim of the paper is that Opa coordinates with Zelda in regulating gene expression, because it binds to many of the same genomic regions, and for some of these regions, <italic>opa</italic> knockdown and zld knockdown both affect accessibility. Simultaneous Opa+Zld binding is inferred by comparing Opa ChIP-seq peaks to a published Zld ChIP-seq dataset. However, the Zld dataset uses embryonic stages (nc13 and early nc14) from before Opa is expressed, meaning that the possibilities of simultaneous binding vs. sequential binding cannot be distinguished. If possible, I would have the authors re-run their analysis using the &quot;late nc14&quot; dataset from the same paper instead, which seems a more appropriate comparison for their purposes. As an optional extension, explicit comparison between the early and late Zld datasets could also give interesting hints as to the nature of any Opa/Zld interaction – for example when Opa starts binding to the genome in late nc14, does this cause Zld binding at these loci to increase or reduce, relative to other Zld-bound loci where Opa is absent?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Odd-paired is a pioneer-like factor that coordinates with Zelda to control gene expression in embryos&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

My key concerns have both been addressed by the authors – by 1) clarifying that the onset of Opa expression happens at nc14b and by 2) additionally comparing their Opa ChIP-seq dataset to a later Zld dataset, as requested. The authors have also carried out a considerable amount of new experiments and analysis (despite their current lab shutdown), and these new data strengthen their proposal that Opa is a key timing factor in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. The authors' responses to my original comments are reasonable. I don't think any further experiments or analyses are necessary but the text could be further edited for clarity.

The additional data strengthen the conclusions of the manuscript. Furthermore, the focus on the Opa (3h) data successfully streamline the manuscript such that the focus remains on the conclusions most robustly supported by the data. We have only minor issues that should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>1) The additional data with the ATAC-seq upon precocious expression of Opa and the analysis on nucleosome distance reported in Figure 5 are nearly identical to experiments published by Soluri et al., 2020. As such, this publication must be briefly discussed and cited. It is gratifying to show that these results are robust across laboratories and acknowledgement of this fact does not decrease the impact of this publication. We feel that this addition to the manuscript is necessary for acceptance.</p><p>2) Figure 3D is confusing as it appears that only a very small handful of genes are bound by Opa. This is obviously not the case as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1F, but the authors should consider a different way of highlighting specific genes. As it is, the black dots are labelled &quot;Opa only&quot; but these are clearly only a small fraction of the Opa only bound genes in this volcano plot. Similarly for the yellow Opa/Zld genes. It could be useful to report on the plot the % of down- and up-regulated genes that are proximal to an Opa binding site.</p><p>3) For the various heat maps, the order in which peaks are ranked should be clearly indicated. For example, in Figure 4F it is unclear whether each heat map is ranked separately or whether one can compare across heat maps. Similarly, the method for ranking peaks should be provided for Figure 5A and B.</p><p>4) There are a few typos/ formatting errors.</p><p>- Results paragraph three, the authors state that Opa expression is reduced at nc14c for a mutant reporter.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) The ChIP data would benefit from additional analysis. To determine biologically meaningful differences between the various ChIP peaks, the authors should analyze the relative peak heights for the 16,085 peaks. For example, are there any differences in relative peak heights for the peaks bound by Opa alone, Opa and Zld, or Zld alone? In Figure 3—figure supplement 1, it appears that the peaks uniquely bound by Opa at a single developmental time point (3h vs. 4h) are lower than the peaks shared between time points (assuming color indicates relative peak heights). If this is the case, these differences in binding may actually reflect variability in ChIP efficiencies for these lower peaks rather than meaningful biological changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We use heat maps to analyze relative peaks heights for the classes indicated (i.e. Opa alone, Opa and Zld, or Zld alone); yes, color indicates relative peak heights. Regarding the data in question (currently shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1), it is theoretically possible that the difference between Opa_early only and Opa-late only peaks relates to ChIP efficiencies. However, both experiments were conducted in duplicate and none of the Opa_early only or Opa-late only peaks were associated with negative control (input/preimmune ChIP).</p><p>In addition, when we examined chromatin accessibility at Opa ChIP-seq peaks present only at 3h, 4h, or continuously present in both samples, we found that the “late” occupied peaks (4h) were not forced open by increased Opa levels or closed upon loss (see Figure 6—figure supplement 1). In contrast, accessibility at Opa-bound regions identified by ChIP-seq only at the 3h timepoint (only early) or both 3h and 4h samples (i.e. present continuously, early and late) were influenced by Opa levels. This difference in behavior of peaks bound by Opa at these developmental timepoints (i.e. 3h only regions can open in response to Opa; but 4h only regions do not), in our opinion, provides support that these ChIP-seq defined binding events are meaningful and reinforces the view that Opa is influential at nc14.</p><p>For all these reasons, we believe the differences we observed in our ChIP-seq samples are biologically meaningful. Nevertheless, for most of our analyses in this study, we used the Opa (3h) dataset because we wanted to focus on nc14 and decrease the complexity/length.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relative peak heights can then be used in the analysis of the ATAC-seq to determine if those regions with the highest ChIP signal are correlated with accessibility.</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous experience with ChIP-seq data coupled with careful analysis of explanatory binding sites through mutagenesis/mutant analysis, leads us to believe that peak height is not the best predictor of the “importance” of a factor for supporting gene expression through the bound enhancer element; more often than not, mutation of binding sites within enhancers associated with smaller ChIP-seq peaks have bigger effects on gene expression outputs. At least this is what we learned from such an analysis of Twist transcription factor ChIP-seq binding versus function (Ozdemir et al., 2011).</p><p>Therefore, we instead chose to use RNA-seq data (new data/Figure 3) to filter the ATAC-seq datasets. For ATAC-seq, we assayed individual embryos (i.e. precisely timed samples) at both early (nc14B) and late (nc14D) timepoints, and added ectopic expression of Opa (UAS-<italic>opa</italic>) experiments. These new data and analyses, we believe, has strengthened our case for Opa being a generally-acting pioneer-like factor that regulates zygotic gene expression broadly in embryos.</p><p>In particular, we added signal aggregation plots in addition to the heatmaps from pair-end nc14D <italic>sh_opa</italic> and nc14B <italic>UAS_opa</italic> and used relative peak height to claim the ATAC-seq identified changes in accessibility. Please see new Figure 5A,B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1, as well as Figure 6A,B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the ATAC-seq data statistical methods (i.e. DESeq2 or edgeR) should be used to identify significant changes in accessibility between wild-type and shRNA (opa or zld) embryos. How many regions lose accessibility overall? Once significant changes are identified, the overlap between these regions and binding of Zld and Opa can be directly tested. Are the regions that change in accessibility upon knockdown those with the highest ChIP-seq signal for the identified factor?</p></disp-quote><p>We tested DESeq2 and edgeR for differential peak calling and could not obtain meaningful results, suggesting intrinsic data noise was present that was not amenable to a negative binomial statistical model. We acknowledge that our initial design of sample size (3 replicates per group) for ATACseq might be insufficient to get enough statistical power to support this particular analysis. We also tried a different statistical method, the getDifferentialPeaks function (parameters: -size 200 -F 2) from HOMER (Heinz et al., 2010), which returned 600 differential peaks among the 12023 in the control sample that became closed and was also parameter-sensitive. So we decided to use the default FDR for HOMER peak caller and looked for condition-specific peaks.</p><p>ATAC-seq data from control nc14D (accessible regions=12023 HOMER peaks, 3784 not overlapped with <italic>sh_opa</italic> peaks) and <italic>sh_opa</italic> nc14D (accessible regions=12739 HOMER peaks) samples suggest that 31.5% of the regions lose chromatin accessibility in the absence of Opa at nc14D. On the other hand, there is 88.5% overlap (3301 peaks) between the control-vs-<italic>opa1 mutant</italic> and control-vs-<italic>sh_opa</italic> chromatin peaks and 75% overlap (3187 peaks) between the <italic>sh_opa</italic>-vs-control and <italic>UAS_opa-vs-control</italic> peaks (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>We also noticed that ATACseq signals surrounding Opa ChIP-seq peak regions are broadly altered in both <italic>sh_opa</italic> and <italic>UAS_opa</italic> (heatmaps, Figure 5A,B): decreased accessibility in <italic>opa</italic> RNAi (<italic>sh_opa</italic>) and increased accessibility upon ectopic expression of Opa (<italic>UAS_opa</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Better confirmation needs to be demonstrated for the shRNA knockdown. Given that the authors use anti-Opa and anti-Zld antibodies in Figure 1C to demonstrate protein expression this should be used on shRNA embryos to demonstrate protein knockdown and not just a decrease in the amount of RNA. Alternatively, western blots on bulk embryos should be used to demonstrate a decrease in levels of the protein products of the genes being targeted. In addition, because the Zld antibodies used in this manuscript have not been previously published information regarding antibody production and a demonstration of specificity needs to be included in the Materials and methods. Also, the staging of the single embryos used for the ATAC-seq should be noted.</p></disp-quote><p>We show anti-Opa stainings in <italic>sh_opa</italic> in Figure 3A that demonstrate decreased Opa protein levels upon RNAi knockdown.</p><p>Additional information regarding how the Zld antibody was generated and tested has been included in the Materials and methods, as the reviewer suggested.</p><p>Details regarding the staging were added in the main text as well as in the figures: all ATAC-seq data is from single embryos from two stages: either nc14B (nc14+20min) or nc14D (nc14+45min), as specified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The data presented alone do not allow the conclusion that Opa is a pioneer factor and thus the title for Figure 5 and some of the conclusions must be softened or additional data provided. There is no data presented that demonstrates that Opa establishes accessibility by accessing previously nucleosome-bound regions. In addition, there is a limited demonstration that the accessibility that is lost in an opa mutant has direct effects on either the ability of additional transcription factors to bind or gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern and have chosen to refer to Opa as a “pioneer-like” factor in the title, but also did add additional data to support the view that it indeed functions as a pioneer factor. New paired-end ATAC-seq data were added, which besides providing better information regarding degree of chromatin accessibility also allowed us to identify nucleosome signatures. Thes new nucleosome signature data were added to Figure 5E,F and support the view that Opa establishes accessibility by accessing previously nucleosome-bound regions.</p><p>Regarding whether loss of <italic>opa</italic> has direct effects on gene expression, in new Figure 3 we have added singleembryo RNA-seq data for control versus <italic>sh_opa</italic> mutant embryos. Furthermore, regarding whether loss of accessibility has direct effect on TF binding/gene expression, we have selected representative loci for analysis in Figures 4 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1. For example, in the case of <italic>hb,</italic> Opa ChIP-seq (3h) data shows binding at both the <italic>hb_stipe</italic> and VT38550/<italic>hb_HG4-7</italic> enhancers that act at nc14 as shown in Figure 4 panel A’. New ATACseq data from nc14B <italic>opa</italic> ectopic expression (UAS-<italic>opa</italic>) and nc14D <italic>sh_opa</italic> samples suggest Opa affects accessibility at these sequences (Figure 5—figure supplement 1E). Furthermore, expression of the <italic>hb_stripe</italic> (and also likely VT38550/<italic>hb_HG4-7</italic>) is delayed in <italic>opa</italic> mutants (see nc14C; Figure 6D). We also note that our study is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that posterior <italic>hb</italic> expression is supported by VT38550/<italic>hb_HG4-7</italic> enhancer at nc14; there is clear Opa binding, but little Zld binding, associated with this region (Figure 4A). Collectively, these data for <italic>hb</italic> support the view that Opa acts at nc14, and contributes to gap gene (i.e. <italic>hb</italic>) expression.</p><p>Showing that the binding of another transcription factor, Zld, Bcd, Dl, and/or Twi, for example, is affected by loss of Opa would be of interest, but doing more ChIP is beyond the scope of the current study (and not possible due to current lab shutdown). We hope that the example above and additional data presented in the manuscript, is deemed satisfactory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The prior analysis of Runt binding to the sog distal enhancer provides a mechanism for them to directly test the requirement for Opa-mediated accessibility in facilitating Runt binding. ChIP-qPCR for Runt on the sog distal enhancer reporter with the mutated Opa binding sites (Figure 1) and/or in the shRNAi knockdown would begin to address whether Opa has these additional defining features of a pioneer factor. In addition, the global effect of Opa-mediated accessibility on gene expression could be analyzed by RNA-sequencing.</p></disp-quote><p>It would be interesting to determine if Run binding is affected by Opa, but we think this analysis is beyond the scope of the current study. We aim to follow up this idea in a future study.</p><p>However, we did analyze Opa’s effect on gene expression through RNA-seq. Single embryo RNA-sequencing experiments, performed on nc14D <italic>sh_opa</italic> and nc14D control samples, are shown in new Figure 3, and a list of the statistically significant down-regulated (as well as up-regulated) genes in <italic>sh_opa</italic> are presented in Figure 3—source data 1.

The defining properties of a pioneer factor are: a) protein binding to nucleosomal DNA; b) retention of the protein during mitosis; c) a general requirement for establishing/maintaining accessibility of the genome; d) cis-regulatory element binding prior to target gene activation; and e) a general function in reprogramming. While not all of these properties strictly need to be met to declare a TF a pioneer factor, the current manuscript only demonstrates that opa is necessary for accessibility. The title requires nuance, and the authors should discuss similarities and differences between opa and other pioneer factors within the body of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above in response to reviewer #1 comment 4, we understand the concern. We have chosen to refer to Opa as a “pioneer-like” factor in the title, but also did add additional data to support the view that it functions as a pioneer. New paired-end ATAC-seq data were added, which allowed identification of nucleosome signatures; these data were added to Figure 5E,F and supports the view that Opa establishes accessibility by accessing previously nucleosome-bound regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The claim that opa acts as a timing factor is not fully supported by the data. Zelda-mediated activation timing has been demonstrated by accelerating activation with extra Zld sites or delaying it via deletion of Zld sites (Foo et al., Crocker et al., Dufourt et al., Yamada et al., etc.). To support opa regulation of timing, similar experiments would strengthen this claim immensely. Alternatively, the authors could drive maternal expression of opa and examine the change in temporal behavior on their existing Sog-MS2 transgene.</p></disp-quote><p>Because (i) <italic>opa</italic> is expressed in nc14 and acts together with Zld (which works even earlier) as well as independently to support zygotic gene expression broadly throughout embryos and (ii) can affect the accessibility and expression of enhancers in nc14, we feel that referring to Opa as a timing factor is supported. Furthermore, we provide case examples that support the view that Opa functions as a timing factor. For example, in Figure 6D in situ data for <italic>hb</italic>, <italic>hb</italic> expression pattern is delayed in <italic>opa</italic> mutants (i.e. expression of hb_shadow enhancer perdures at nc14B, but yet the hb_stripe is delayed). Moreover, the new ATAC-seq data from nc14B <italic>opa</italic> ectopic expression (UAS-<italic>opa</italic>) suggests chromatin opening occurs at an earlier time, whereas that for nc14D <italic>sh_opa</italic> embryos suggests a loss of chromatin accessibility relative to equivalently staged wildtype.</p><p>Examining whether maternal expression of Opa or addition of Opa binding sites results in changes to the temporal behavior of the sog-MS2 transgenes would be of interest, but we do not have these data and hope to include this type of analysis in a future publication looking more closely at Opa mechanism of action. We hope that the broad array of data presented here currently: live imaging of MS2 reporter with deletion of Opa binding sites, whole genome ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq data – including nucleosome displacement analysis- is satisfactory for a first paper on this pioneer-like factor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Analysis of opa regulation of SogD-MS2 transgene</p><p>– In Figure 1A, a hole could be indicative of an unhealthy embryo.

Similarly, <italic>sog</italic> expression is not expanded in <italic>opa1</italic> mutant embryos (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1D).

Embryos used for Opa ChIP were a one hour time window collection centered at 3 h (2.5-3.5 hr), which encompasses nc14, but the Opa (4h) sample (3.54.5h) likely does not encompass nc14 (or it is greatly underrepresented). We compared only our Opa (3h) ChIP-seq sample to both Zelda nc13-nc14 and Zelda nc14 late ChIP-seq samples, and the results did not change much. Regarding the data presented in Figure 2, displaying a comparison of Zelda nc13-14 to Opa 3h, all the data was very similar when we compared Zelda nc14 late to Opa 3h except that we lost the Cad site enrichment from the Zld_only regions. To reduce the complexity, we only refer to the Zelda nc13-14/Opa 3h comparison, as it was comprehensive and the co-enrichment of Cad and Zld sites might be of interest to the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Investigating the role of opa vs. Zelda for chromatin accessibility</p><p>– The authors did not justify the need for single embryo ATAC-seq.

If the authors did precisely time their experiment, this value should be reported with the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for being unclear, as we definitely did precisely time the single embryos that were used for ATAC-seq analyses. Additional information regarding the stage of the embryos has been included in the updated figures and the main text; details about our collection approach was added to the Materials and methods. Specifically, single <italic>sh_opa</italic> and control embryos were assayed at nc_14D (nc14+45’), whereas UAS-opa and control embryos were assayed at nc14B (nc14+20’). Embryos were collected at 26°C, and moved to our microscope room (23°C); developmental progression was viewed under a microscope and embryos harvested at the appropriate timepoints (i.e. nc14+45min and nc14+20, respectively).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should explicitly state that they used the same Gal4 driver for RNAi Zelda and RNAi opa. (subsection “Global changes in chromatin accessibility result upon knock-down of Opa”)</p></disp-quote><p>The main text was updated accordingly. We used the same MTD-Gal4 driver (Petrella et al., 2007) in both cases. Furthermore, we also now note that this approach, using the sh Zld RNAi construct with MTD-Gal4, was used previously for Zld RNAi by Sun et al., 2015.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To underline that opa-bound enhancers are active later than Zelda-only enhancers, the authors should show RNA-seq tracks for the genes exemplified in Figure 3 A-H</p></disp-quote><p>A list of the RNA-seq values is provided in Figure 3—source data 1. For a subset of genes, these data are highlighted in Figure 3D. Because many genes expressed in the early embryo are controlled by multiple enhancers and Opa may affect only a subset, a loss of opa does not always lead to a large effect on total RNA expression levels for a gene.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors mention that the opa1 mutant phenotype is comparable to that of opa RNAi embryos, but this is not shown or cited from another publication. Figure Sup4 should be complemented by similar FISH/immunolabeling in opa RNAi embryos.</p></disp-quote><p>To address phenotypic comparison of <italic>opa1</italic> and <italic>sh_opa</italic> mutants, we added side-by-side comparison of <italic>sog</italic> and <italic>en</italic> staining and moved these data to a main figure (i.e. Figure 3B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The RNAi stock used to deplete opa is not homozygous viable (given the stock described in the Materials and methods), possibly suggesting off-target effects of the RNAi. To circumvent this possibility, the authors should perform single embryo ATAC-seq on opa1 mutants. If the accessibility results are similarly affected to those in opa RNAi then it would strengthen their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>According to Hu et al., 2013, the <italic>sh_opa</italic> construct HMS01185 has zero off targets. Nevertheless, single embryo <italic>opa1</italic> nc14D ATAC-seq was performed, and the data were compared with <italic>sh_opa</italic> – shown in Figure 5C,D,G. Differential peak analysis showed that, from the 3784 control peaks that were not accessible in <italic>sh_opa,</italic> 91.1% (3448 peaks) overlap with the peaks that were not accessible in <italic>opa1</italic> mutants vs. control at nc14D (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). Unfortunately, a more extended computational analysis using <italic>opa1</italic> was not possible due to low mapping rate (for unknown reasons); we are lacking a high quality <italic>opa1</italic> replicate sample. Due to the pandemic, the lab was shut down and we were not able to produce these additional data with opa1, but did add a statement about zero off targets for <italic>sh_opa</italic>. If anything, we are missing additional Opa effects by assaying the <italic>sh_opa</italic> phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The author seems to have performed new ATAC-seq experiments on RNAi Zld, but the driver employed needs to be specified. Could the authors compare their results with published single embryo ATAC-seq in Zelda mutants (Hannon, eLife, 2017)?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the same MTD.Gal4 driver for RNAi knockdown of both <italic>zelda</italic> and <italic>opa</italic>.</p><p>We used nc14D embryos for <italic>sh_zld</italic> ATAC-seq experiments, and also used single-end sequencing for this particular experiment. Hannon et al. used nc14B embryos for zld mutant embryo ATAC-seq and paired-end sequencing. We had intended to repeat the <italic>zld</italic> ATAC-seq sequencing using paired-end (as we did for <italic>opa</italic> samples), but due to the lab shut-down because of the pandemic – we were not able to. For these reasons (i.e. difference in stage and sequencing method), our experiment and those in the other study are not directly comparable. Our <italic>sh_zld</italic> experiments show different trends than <italic>sh_opa</italic>; as MTD-Gal4 is common to both (as well as to the UAS-opa mediated ectopic expression), we do not believe MTD-Gal4 is responsible for the accessibility changes we observe (which are opposite in the case of Opa: Figure 5—figure supplement 1, and vary between <italic>opa</italic> and <italic>zld</italic> knockdowns).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To be rigorous, the authors should have used a RNAi-white crossed with the same MTD-gal4 line as a control and not WT embryos. However, I think this experiment is less important than performing ATAC-seq in opa1 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>ATAC-seq in single <italic>opa1</italic> mutant embryos has been performed and presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. In addition, we compared <italic>opa1</italic> mutant and <italic>sh_opa</italic> (i.e. <italic>opa</italic> RNAi using short hairpin <italic>opa</italic> construct x MTD-gal4) embryos, as well as compared <italic>sh_opa</italic> RNAi to MTD-Gal4, UAS opa mediated-ectopic expression (“UASopa”): There is 88.5% overlap (3301 peaks) between the <italic>opa1</italic> and <italic>sh_opa</italic> closed chromatin peaks (versus open peaks in control), and 75% overlap (3187 peaks) between the <italic>sh_opa</italic> closed (accessible/open peaks in control) and <italic>UAS opa</italic> open peaks (non-accessible/closed peaks in control). See Figure 5—figure supplement 1A. The concordance of <italic>opa1</italic> and <italic>sh_opa</italic> phenotypes, and the opposite effect of <italic>sh_opa</italic> and UAS-<italic>opa</italic> support the view that the accessibility changes we detect are Opa-dependent.</p><p>As discussed in the comment above, unfortunately, while the experiments above were all sequenced using pair-end sequencing (repeat experiments conducted during the revision period), we were not able to repeat the sh zld experiments and as they were sequencing using single-end sequencing these sets were not comparable in large statistical tests.</p><p>However, we do detect different accessibility in <italic>sh_opa</italic> versus sh zld experiments; as both these crosses contained MTD-gal4, and <italic>opa1</italic> mutant and <italic>sh_opa</italic> results are concordant, it is unlikely that the gal4 alone grossly affected accessibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) opa and chromatin accessibility</p><p>– Figure 4D suggests that accessibility seems much higher for Zelda/Opa common targets than for each TF target independently. Accessibility seems also higher for opa peaks compared to Zelda peaks. Is this data quantitative or semi-quantitative at all, and is there a way to explain that within the text? Can these curves be statistically compared? Can the authors produce similar graph at earlier and later stages?</p></disp-quote><p>Statistics of accessibility have been provided at the reviewer's request (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1A: Venn diagram comparing the number of closed chromatin peaks in <italic>sh_opa</italic> (3784), <italic>opa1</italic> (3448) versus control at nc14D, and more open chromatin peaks in <italic>UAS opa</italic> versus control at nc14B). However, we decided to delete original Figure 4D, since it did not add additional meaningful biological information to our study, especially after the addition of all the new data, in particular the <italic>sh_opa</italic> RNA-seq (Figure 3C-E) that allowed us to focus chromatin accessibility analysis on a subset of genes that exhibit opa-dependent gene expression changes (Figure 6A,B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The accessibility results of Figure 4 should be complemented with Zelda and opa ChIP-seq tracks and organized to better emphasize the 3 groups of accessibility identified by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 4 was updated accordingly to show these suggested data, and currently displayed in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 B,C and E,F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be interesting to compare the opa peaks that are accessible independently of Zld to the genes that remain accessible in Zld mutants (Harrison, 2010, Schultz, 2015, Hannon, 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good idea, but we feel that more detailed comparisons between Opa and Zld action are best left for a future study that would be supported by enhancer analysis/mutagenesis etc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I found Figures 4 and 5 to be confusing. If the central idea of Figure 4 is to show that opa is responsible for chromatin accessibility, the authors should only present WT vs. opa RNAi. Then in Figure 5, they could add the Zelda RNAi comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the feedback, and have added new Figure 3 with new <italic>opa sh RNAi (sh_opa)</italic> data. We have worked to improve the flow, but note we did not add Zld RNAi to the main figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Opa-only occupied peaks require Opa to support their accessibility at mid-nc14”/Figure 4G: the tracks give no information on whether Zelda binds the eve LE enhancer.

Additionally, the loss of accessibility in Zelda RNAi at this enhancer is shown but not commented on in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original figures, information on Zelda binding at the eve LE enhancer was provided in Figure 3B.

In particular, the central claim of the paper is that Opa coordinates with Zelda in regulating gene expression, because it binds to many of the same genomic regions, and for some of these regions, opa knockdown and zld knockdown both affect accessibility. Simultaneous Opa+Zld binding is inferred by comparing Opa ChIP-seq peaks to a published Zld ChIP-seq dataset. However, the Zld dataset uses embryonic stages (nc13 and early nc14) from before Opa is expressed, meaning that the possibilities of simultaneous binding vs. sequential binding cannot be distinguished.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our Opa immuno-staining data, Opa protein is first expressed (detectable) at nc14B. The Zld ChIP-seq “early” data were taken from nc13-nc14 embryos, suggesting that there would be an overlap between Opa and Zld at nc14B, which is considered “early nc14”. In any case, we also compared our Opa 3h ChIP-seq dataset with the late nc14 Zld ChIP-seq dataset (see next point).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If possible, I would have the authors re-run their analysis using the &quot;late nc14&quot; dataset from the same paper instead, which seems a more appropriate comparison for their purposes. As an optional extension, explicit comparison between the early and late Zld datasets could also give interesting hints as to the nature of any Opa/Zld interaction – for example when Opa starts binding to the genome in late nc14, does this cause Zld binding at these loci to increase or reduce, relative to other Zld-bound loci where Opa is absent?</p></disp-quote><p>The &quot; nc14 late&quot; Zld ChIP-seq (GSM763062) dataset was also analyzed and new figures have been generated and updated accordingly.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is a much improved manuscript that has worked to address many of the significant concerns from the prior submission. The additional data strengthen the conclusions of the manuscript. Furthermore, the focus on the Opa (3h) data successfully streamline the manuscript such that the focus remains on the conclusions most robustly supported by the data. We have only minor issues that should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>1) The additional data with the ATAC-seq upon precocious expression of Opa and the analysis on nucleosome distance reported in Figure 5 are nearly identical to experiments published by Soluri et al., 2020. As such, this publication must be briefly discussed and cited. It is gratifying to show that these results are robust across laboratories and acknowledgement of this fact does not decrease the impact of this publication. We feel that this addition to the manuscript is necessary for acceptance.</p></disp-quote><p>We ectopically expressed <italic>opa</italic> and looked for changes in accessibility, whereas Soluri et al. looked at accessibility changes in <italic>opa</italic> mutants. These are opposite experiments. For that reason, our analytical results shouldn't be expected to be the same as those of Soluri et al. paper. It is consistent to the model that increasing levels of Opa leads to longer distances between the nearest nucleosome and the Opa-bound position because of increased nucleosome displacement. We added reference to this other study as well as a sentence describing their experiment as we are in agreement with the reviewer that it strengthens the view that Opa affects nucleosome positioning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 3D is confusing as it appears that only a very small handful of genes are bound by Opa. This is obviously not the case as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1F, but the authors should consider a different way of highlighting specific genes. As it is, the black dots are labelled &quot;Opa only&quot; but these are clearly only a small fraction of the Opa only bound genes in this volcano plot. Similarly for the yellow Opa/Zld genes. It could be useful to report on the plot the % of down- and up-regulated genes that are proximal to an Opa binding site.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3D was modified to remove Opa only and Opa/Zld designations, which instead are listed in new Figure 3—source data 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For the various heat maps, the order in which peaks are ranked should be clearly indicated.
