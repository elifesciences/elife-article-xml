to act upon. This requirement is known as crossover assurance and is one example of crossover control. While the conserved role of the ATPase, PCH-2, during meiotic prophase has been enigmatic, a universal phenotype when <italic>pch-2</italic> or its orthologs are mutated is a change in the number and distribution of meiotic crossovers. Here, we show that PCH-2 controls the number and distribution of crossovers by antagonizing their formation. This antagonism produces different effects at different stages of meiotic prophase: early in meiotic prophase, PCH-2 prevents double-strand breaks from becoming crossover-eligible intermediates, limiting crossover formation at sites of initial double-strand break formation and homolog interactions. Later in meiotic prophase, PCH-2 winnows the number of crossover-eligible intermediates, contributing to the designation of crossovers and ultimately, crossover assurance. We also demonstrate that PCH-2 accomplishes this regulation through the meiotic HORMAD, HIM-3. Our data strongly support a model in which PCH-2’s conserved role is to remodel meiotic HORMADs throughout meiotic prophase to destabilize crossover-eligible precursors and coordinate meiotic recombination with synapsis, ensuring the progressive implementation of meiotic recombination and explaining its function in the pachytene checkpoint and crossover control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>crossover</kwd><kwd>synaptonemal complex</kwd><kwd>synapsis</kwd><kwd>checkpoint</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM141835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhalla</surname><given-names>Needhi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25GM051765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ortiz</surname><given-names>Valery</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T34GM140956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herrera</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name><name><surname>Ortiz</surname><given-names>Valery</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By regulating the chromosome axis component and meiotic HORMAD, HIM-3, the conserved AAA-ATPase PCH-2 controls the number and distribution of meiotic recombination events.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that reduces chromosome number by half, resulting in the production of genetically diverse haploid gametes, so that fertilization during sexual reproduction restores diploidy. This process occurs in two stages: meiosis I, in which homologous chromosomes are partitioned, and meiosis II, in which sister chromatid are segregated. The regulation of meiosis is crucial for ensuring that both genetic recombination and chromosome segregation occur accurately. Errors in human meiosis are associated with birth defects, such as Down and Turner syndromes, infertility and miscarriages, underscoring the importance of understanding meiosis to human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hassold and Hunt, 2001</xref>).</p><p>During prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair and this pairing is stabilized through a process called synapsis, in which a protein structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC) holds homologs together. This close association between homologs during synapsis facilitates crossover formation, the process in which double-strand breaks (DSBs) are deliberately introduced into the genome, repaired by meiosis-specific mechanisms that exchange DNA between homologous chromosomes and generate the chiasmata, or linkage, that promotes accurate meiotic chromosome segregation. Therefore, disruptions in pairing, synapsis, or recombination prevents the formation of chiasmata and can lead to meiotic errors such as nondisjunction, resulting in aneuploid gametes.</p><p>In addition to the fundamental role that recombination plays in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation, crossover recombination accomplishes another important function: it generates new haplotypes for natural selection to act upon to drive evolution. Thus, to assure a random assortment of alleles on a population level, the distribution of crossovers may be as tightly regulated as their number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Veller et al., 2019</xref>). The significance of controlling both crossover number and distribution is clearly illustrated by the existence of mechanisms such as crossover assurance, in which every pair of homologous chromosomes gets at least one crossover; crossover homeostasis, in which the number of crossovers remains relatively invariant even if the number of recombination precursors change; and crossover interference, in which the presence of a crossover inhibits the formation of a crossover nearby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray and Cohen, 2016</xref>). DSBs typically vastly outnumber crossovers in most organisms and are introduced gradually throughout early prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Woglar and Villeneuve, 2018</xref>). Therefore, to accomplish this precise level of control, meiotic crossover recombination and the decision about which DSBs become crossover-eligible intermediates, and eventually, which crossover-eligible intermediates get designated as crossovers, is implemented progressively throughout meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cole et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Morgan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>). In many systems, transitions from DSBs to crossover-eligible intermediates, and crossover-eligible intermediates to crossovers, can be molecularly and/or cytologically monitored.</p><p>PCH-2, also known as TRIP13 in mammals, is an evolutionarily ancient AAA-ATPase that plays a significant role in regulating meiosis across different organisms, including <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (mice), <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (budding yeast), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (fruit flies), and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (worms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhalla, 2023</xref>). PCH-2 and its orthologs structurally remodel a family of proteins with HORMA domains (HORMADs) to control their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gu et al., 2022</xref>). HORMADs participate in a variety of signaling events and can exist in at least three structurally distinct conformations: a ‘closed’ conformation, which they adopt when they bind a short peptide sequence in their own protein sequence or another protein (also called a closure motif) and their C-terminus wraps around this motif to stabilize the interaction; an ‘open’ conformation when unbound, in which their C-terminus is discretely tucked against the HORMA domain; and an ‘extended’ conformation, which is an intermediate between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gu et al., 2022</xref>). PCH-2 and its orthologs convert the closed version of HORMADs to the open or extended versions, playing an important role in recycling HORMADs during signaling. During meiosis, closed versions of meiotic HORMADs assemble on chromosomes to form meiotic chromosome axes, which are essential for pairing, synapsis, and recombination between homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). The remodeling of meiotic HORMADs by PCH-2 to an ‘open’ or ‘extended’ conformation is thought to reduce the levels of HORMADs on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Börner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cuacos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lambing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wojtasz et al., 2009</xref>) and/or increase their dynamic association and dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Russo et al., 2023</xref>), modulating and coordinating homolog pairing, synapsis and recombination during prophase.</p><p>Despite being discovered as a pachytene checkpoint component in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">San-Segundo and Roeder, 1999</xref>), the conserved meiotic role of the PCH-2/HORMAD module has been difficult to characterize, in part, we have argued, because of the evolutionary innovation that is an inherent aspect of sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhalla, 2023</xref>). Moreover, in some systems, such as budding yeast and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herruzo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), PCH-2 orthologs not only remodel meiotic HORMADs on meiotic chromosomes but also perform this function in the cytoplasm to make meiotic HORMADs available for their role(s) in meiotic nuclei. This dual role can complicate functional analyses, particularly in <italic>pch-2</italic> null mutants. However, all meiotic systems exhibit defects in the number and distribution of crossovers when PCH-2 function is abrogated by mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Joyce and McKim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lambing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zanders and Alani, 2009</xref>). Unfortunately, the lack of a clear pattern when analyzing these defects in recombination in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants has contributed to an inability to develop a unified, integrated model of PCH-2 function in the field.</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, meiotic HORMADs localize to meiotic chromosomes independently of PCH-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the progressive implementation of meiotic recombination can be cytologically monitored in meiotic nuclei that are organized both spatially and temporally in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Woglar and Villeneuve, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we exploit this system to show that PCH-2 is required to control the number and distribution of crossovers by antagonizing their formation. This antagonism produces different consequences depending on the stage of meiotic prophase. In early meiotic prophase, PCH-2 inhibits DSBs from becoming crossover-eligible intermediates, ensuring that crossovers are more widely distributed than sites of initial DSB formation and/or homolog interactions. Later in meiotic prophase, PCH-2 is responsible for winnowing the numbers of crossover-eligible intermediates on synapsed chromosomes, contributing to the designation of crossovers and ultimately, crossover assurance. Genetic analysis demonstrates that PCH-2’s regulation of crossover-eligible intermediates is through one of three essential meiotic HORMADs, HIM-3. Finally, we link PCH-2’s effect on early DSBs in early meiotic prophase to cell cycle stage, demonstrating that both limit early DSBs from becoming crossovers. We propose that PCH-2’s remodeling of HIM-3 on meiotic chromosomes destabilizes crossover-eligible intermediates throughout meiotic prophase, contributing to the progressive implementation of meiotic recombination to control the number and distribution of crossovers, also known as crossover control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PCH-2 controls the number and distribution of crossovers in similar patterns on multiple chromosomes</title><p>We had previously shown that loss of PCH-2 reduced the frequency of double crossovers and genetic length of both an autosome (chromosome III) and the X chromosome, albeit not uniformly among genetic intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>). To determine whether a more obvious pattern could be observed, we expanded our analysis by monitoring recombination genetically in both wildtype and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutant animals using five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that spanned 95% of chromosomes, I, III, IV, and the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We excluded chromosome II from our analysis because of the potential difficulty combining Hawaiian SNPs with the <italic>pch-2</italic> mutation, which is linked to chromosome II, and chromosome V because of our use of the <italic>bcIs39</italic> transgene to identify cross progeny, which may disrupt recombination on that chromosome.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PCH-2 controls the number and distribution of crossovers in similar patterns on multiple chromosomes.</title><p>Genetic analysis of meiotic recombination in wildtype and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants.

In a majority of these double crossovers (69%), one crossover was at the end of the chromosome where pairing and synapsis initiate, also called the pairing center (PC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">MacQueen et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting some relationship between where chromosomes might make initial contacts and the likelihood of double crossovers. On all chromosomes analyzed, we observed no double crossovers in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants and this difference was statistically significant for chromosomes I, III, and X. Moreover, there was a striking and consistent shift of crossovers to the PC end of all four chromosomes tested. This shift in the distribution of crossovers to the PC ends of chromosomes was generally accompanied by a reduction in crossovers in the center of chromosomes. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the center of chromosomes are where DSBs are less numerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nadarajan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu et al., 2016</xref>) and where genes are more abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Consortium, 1998</xref>). In the case of the X chromosome and chromosome III, recombination at the non-PC end was also reduced and appeared to more closely resemble the physical map at this end of these chromosomes. Thus, PCH-2 ensures a wider distribution of crossovers across chromosomes, away from regions that are more likely to undergo early homolog interactions (PC ends) and with more DSBs (both the PC and non-PC ends of chromosomes), and toward the center of chromosomes, where DSBs are less abundant.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PCH-2 prevents exogenous DSBs early in meiotic prophase from becoming crossovers</title><p>We previously showed that PCH-2 promotes crossover formation and crossover assurance through its regulation of the meiotic HORMAD, HIM-3, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Russo et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, this promoting role seems linked to its localization to the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Patel et al., 2023</xref>). However, the observed shift in the distribution of crossovers in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants suggests that PCH-2 may also play a role in inhibiting crossovers and that this role may be occurring in early meiotic prophase, when chromosomes are undergoing initial homolog interactions. We had previously observed that meiotic nuclei in early prophase were more likely to produce crossovers when DSBs were induced by excision of the <italic>Mos</italic> transposon in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants than in control animals but experimental caveats limited our ability to properly interpret this experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To explicitly test this possibility, we took advantage of both the spatiotemporal organization of meiotic nuclei in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline and the observation that nuclei travel in an assembly line process at a stereotypical pace to late pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jaramillo-Lambert et al., 2007</xref>), where we can cytologically assess crossover formation by staining for the essential crossover factor, COSA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>).

In order to detect crossovers in late pachytene, control and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants germlines were stained for GFP::COSA-1, which allowed us to visualize crossovers, and DAPI, which allowed us to visualize DNA. In unirradiated control worms, 94% of late pachytene nuclei have six GFP::COSA-1 foci, one per chromosome pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In unirradiated <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants, the percentage of nuclei have six GFP::COSA-1 foci drops to 82%, primarily because of the significant increase in meiotic nuclei with less than six GFP::COSA-1 foci (17%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), consistent with our previous report that loss of PCH-2 leads to a decrease in crossover formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>).

In addition, we also observed a significant increase in nuclei with more than six COSA-1 foci in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants (wildtype: 2%, <italic>pch-2</italic>: 13%), demonstrating that loss of PCH-2 leads to increased crossover formation when nuclei in the transition zone get more DSBs.

In this experiment, we assayed crossover formation with two experimental approaches. Similar to our irradiation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>), we assayed crossover formation by analyzing the number of GFP::COSA-1 foci in late pachytene 24, 22, 20, and 18 hours after acutely depleting SPO-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition to this approach, we analyzed the presence of bivalents in diakinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which indicates the successful formation of chiasmata between homologous chromosomes. Since meiotic nuclei travel from late pachytene to diakinesis in approximately 12 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>), the 36, 34, 32, and 30 hour timepoints to assay bivalent formation correspond to the 24, 22, 20, and 18 hour timepoints, respectively, in which GFP::COSA-1 were analyzed. We also performed a control experiment, treating worms with ethanol for 24 and 36 hour timepoints to ensure that this tagged version of SPO-11 was fully functional for crossover formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>).</p><p>At the 24 hour timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>), when meiotic nuclei in the transition zone do not receive SPO-11-induced DSBs, we observe a range of GFP::COSA-1 foci in late pachytene in both control animals and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants with a majority of nuclei having 0 or 1 focus (control and <italic>pch-2</italic> averages: 1.8 GFP::COSA-1 foci), indicating a loss of crossover formation, albeit with some heterogeneity.

However, our quantification of GFP::MSH-5 indicates that PCH-2 is required to limit the number of crossover-eligible intermediates, in direct contrast to our proposed hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, we decided to revisit what role PCH-2 localization to the SC might play in regulating crossover formation.

We observed a unique and striking localization pattern in <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutants that we had not observed before. When stained for PCH-2 and GFP::COSA-1, nuclei retain PCH-2 onto chromosomes far into late pachytene, past the normal region when PCH-2 typically is removed from chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).

However, this antagonism has different consequences depending on when during meiotic prophase it occurs, underscoring the importance of temporal regulation of these events. During leptotene/zygotene, when CHK-2 activity is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) and PCH-2 is present as foci on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>), PCH-2 prevents crossover formation at some sites of initial DSB formation and early homolog interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In this way, PCH-2 promotes a wider distribution of crossovers across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In pachytene, when CHK-2 activity has decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) and PCH-2 is localized to the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>), PCH-2 winnows crossover-eligible intermediates marked by GFP-MSH-5, ensuring their designation, colocalization with COSA-1 and crossover assurance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). When there are defects in recombination, such as partial synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>), changes in karyotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Patel et al., 2023</xref>), or too few DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), PCH-2 persists on the SC to prevent designation, guarantee crossover assurance and some degree of homeostasis, independent of an additional feedback mechanism that increases DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Patel et al., 2023</xref>). That persistence of PCH-2 also disrupts crossover interference in two of these situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Patel et al., 2023</xref>) strongly suggests that crossover interference is mechanistically linked to assurance and homeostasis. For example, PCH-2’s persistence on the SC may maintain an extended period of competency for interhomolog repair, as has been observed in mutants defective in crossover recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rosu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>PCH-2 remodels HIM-3 to disassemble crossover-eligible intermediates, controlling crossover distribution and number.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model for how <italic>pch-2</italic> and <italic>him-3<sup>R93Y</sup></italic> mutations genetically interact to affect the progression of meiotic recombination.

We have shown that HIM-3<sup>R93Y</sup> mutant protein can adopt the closed conformation and loads on meiotic chromosomes similar to wildtype HIM-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Russo et al., 2023</xref>). In vitro analysis shows that HIM-3<sup>R93Y</sup> binds its closure motif with reduced affinity, likely affecting its ability to adopt the closed conformation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Russo et al., 2023</xref>). The proposed role of PCH-2 in meiosis is to remodel meiotic HORMADs from the closed conformation to the extended one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), regulating their association with chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhalla, 2023</xref>). However, since meiotic HORMADs are not visibly depleted from chromosomes during meiotic progression in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Couteau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Couteau and Zetka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martinez-Perez and Villeneuve, 2005</xref>), this genetic interaction supports a role for PCH-2 in temporarily reducing the occupancy of meiotic HORMADs on meiotic chromosomes, destabilizing interactions with partner proteins that modulate the progression and fidelity of meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Russo et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, PCH-2’s remodeling of HIM-3 would disrupt protein–protein interactions that underlie crossover-eligible intermediates, destabilizing them and reducing their number on chromosomes, contributing to crossover control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Since meiotic HORMADs are essential for meiotic chromosome axis structure and function, our data therefore support a role for the meiotic axis in crossover control, as suggested by previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Girard et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lambing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nabeshima et al., 2004</xref>). However, the disassembly of crossover-eligible intermediates would also release pro-crossover factors present at these sites, such as MSH-5, to concentrate at other, more stable sites on the SC, facilitating designation during synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Girard et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>). In this way, PCH-2’s mechanism of action may reconcile current competing models of crossover control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Girard et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, these results raise the possibility that this behavior of PCH-2 and/or meiotic HORMADs might be regulated by post-translational modifications associated with crossover control, such as ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray and Cohen, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Given that mutation of PCH-2 produces changes in the number and distribution of crossovers across multiple model systems, we argue that controlling crossover distribution and number is the conserved role of PCH-2 in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhalla, 2023</xref>). We have previously proposed that the conserved role of PCH-2 is to coordinate meiotic recombination with synapsis, explaining its role in the pachytene checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhalla, 2023</xref>). With these results, we further refine this model. Early in meiotic prophase, PCH-2 remodels meiotic HORMADs to prevent some DSBs from becoming crossover-eligible intermediates, widening the recombination landscape beyond early homolog interactions and/or sites that tend to be more favorable for DSB formation, also known as ‘hot spots’. For example, this may explain the localization of TRIP13, the PCH-2 ortholog in mice, to telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chotiner et al., 2024</xref>), sites that experience early homolog interactions due to the organization of meiotic chromosomes in the bouquet formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scherthan et al., 1996</xref>). This antagonism may also expand the regions of the genome that initiate synapsis in organisms that use DSBs to accomplish this event. This possibility is supported by the observation that loss of TRIP13 in mammals produce meiotic chromosomes that exhibit partial asynapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roig et al., 2010</xref>), particularly near regions that may act as barriers to SC polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roig et al., 2010</xref>). Limiting which DSBs become crossover-eligible intermediates in early meiotic prophase also ensures that meiotic recombination overlaps with synapsis, either completely, as in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>) or partially, as in budding yeast, plants and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Capilla-Pérez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cole et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Morgan et al., 2021</xref>). Once synapsis is complete, PCH-2 continues to remodel meiotic HORMADs on chromosomes to control the gradual implementation of crossover number and distribution, reinforcing the important role that synapsis plays in mediating crossover control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Durand et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Libuda et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, the inability to reduce the number of crossover-eligible intermediates in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants, as visualized by GFP::MSH-5 foci, does not produce extra crossovers but a loss of crossover assurance in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), a somewhat counterintuitive result. One interpretation of these data is that crossover-eligible intermediates may be more numerous but absent from some chromosomes in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants, explaining the loss of crossover assurance. Since the absence of crossover intermediates in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is accompanied by premature desynapsis of individual chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Machovina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pattabiraman et al., 2017</xref>) and chromosomes in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants delay desynapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>), we do not favor this interpretation. Instead, we propose that having too many crossover-eligible intermediates can be as deleterious to crossover assurance as having too few (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This possibility is further supported by the loss of crossover assurance we detect in irradiated wildtype worms, which is exacerbated in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>This phenomenon, where crossover-eligible intermediates need to be winnowed to some threshold number to ensure crossover assurance, may explain the loss of crossover assurance also observed in <italic>Trip13</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roig et al., 2010</xref>) and on small chromosomes in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chakraborty et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, the counterintuitive relationship between the number of crossover-eligible precursors and crossover assurance in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants we observe might reflect an additional layer of regulation during crossover formation specific to <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Since <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosomes are holocentric, crossovers play an additional role organizing chromosomes for the ordered release of sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martinez-Perez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nabeshima et al., 2005</xref>) and extra crossovers can be deleterious to accurate chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hollis et al., 2020</xref>). By contrast, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a system that appears to be able to tolerate an extraordinarily high number of crossovers with little to no effect on chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Durand et al., 2022</xref>), PCH2’s inability to localize to the SC produces an increase in crossover formation, as visualized by both MLH1 foci and the formation of chiasmata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Once again, an overarching theme that becomes apparent in our model is that PCH-2 may play a common role in different systems, with dramatic variations in phenotypic consequences given species-specific requirements and constraints.</p><p>We were not surprised to see high numbers of double crossovers on almost every chromosome in our genetic analysis of recombination in wildtype worms, given our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>). However, we were surprised to see that the majority of them were found near PCs and sites of synapsis initiation, suggesting a relationship between early homolog interactions and the formation of double crossovers. When we revisited our previous data, we observed similar patterns. In addition, we do not detect these double crossovers cytologically in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, even when using the OLLAS::COSA-1 reporter, which has been reported to identify double crossovers in spermatogenesis not visualized by GFP::COSA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cahoon et al., 2023</xref>). Crossovers that are cytologically marked by COSA-1 are known as class I crossovers, which depend on pro-crossover factors such as MSH-5 and ZHP-3, rely on synapsis, and exhibit crossover control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray and Cohen, 2016</xref>). These data raise the intriguing possibility that these double crossovers are the product of the alternate, class II, pathway of crossover formation, which relies on a different suite of proteins, does not respond to crossover control, does not depend on synapsis, and contributes to varying degrees in different model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray and Cohen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Youds et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, based on the close, functional relationship that exists between class I crossovers and synapsis and the apparent antagonistic relationship that exists between class II crossovers and synapsis, important corollaries of our model may be that PCH-2 specifically coordinates recombination with synapsis to promote class I crossovers, limit class II crossovers and that class II crossovers are more likely to form early in meiosis, prior to synapsis. Therefore, variations in the contribution of the class II crossover pathways to crossover recombination and the degree of cross-talk between class I and II pathways among model systems might reflect the degree to which crossover formation overlaps with synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhalla, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray and Cohen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, these corollaries are entirely consistent with PCH-2’s absence from the genome of fission yeast and Tetrahymena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kops et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu and Burgess, 2006</xref>), both systems in which chromosomes do not undergo meiotic synapsis, crossovers do not exhibit interference and all crossovers are dependent on the class II pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hollingsworth and Brill, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lukaszewicz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wolfe et al., 1976</xref>). However, this aspect of the model needs to be formally tested.</p><p>Our results also have some additional important implications about the regulation of DSB formation across the genome in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. It is formally possible that PCH-2 controls DSB distribution. However, the complexity of recombination defects in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants argues against this possibility. Instead, we explain the shift in the recombination landscape away from the central regions of chromosomes and toward PC ends in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) as a result of early DSBs becoming crossovers at the expense of later DSBs. This explanation is better supported by the panel of defects observed in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants: DSBs introduced early in meiosis become crossover eligible intermediates and crossovers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) and while the number of DSBs is constant, DNA repair is accelerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, this explanation suggests that when DSBs happen in meiotic prophase affects where they happen in the genome. Specifically, we propose that chromosome arms, which are gene poor, receive DSBs early during (or even throughout) DSB formation and the center of chromosomes, which are gene rich, receive DSBs later. The shift in recombination to the center of chromosomes when defects in meiosis prolong DSB formation provides further support to this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>). A similar regulation of the timing of DSB formation has been demonstrated in budding yeast, where the DSB landscape across the whole genome expands when time in prophase is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">López Ruiz et al., 2024</xref>) and small, highly recombinogenic, chromosomes, get more DSBs later in meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murakami et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Subramanian et al., 2019</xref>). However, this temporal regulation has not been reported previously in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and suggests that this phenomenon is more widely conserved. This expansion of the DSB landscape in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to include the center regions of chromosomes later in meiosis may be a deliberate attempt for recombination to create new haplotypes for evolution to act on, despite the relative paucity of DSBs and the observation that they can result in chromosome missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altendorfer et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our work raises some important questions about the functional role(s) of DSBs in meiosis, aside from their contributions to crossover formation. Hicks and colleagues were the first to report that early DSBs do not contribute to crossover formation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hicks et al., 2022</xref>). Here we show that these early DSBs are prevented from becoming crossovers by both PCH-2 activity and cell cycle stage, specifically in leptotene/zygotene, when homologs are initiating pairing and synapsis. In budding yeast, similar, early-occurring DSBs have been characterized as ‘scout DSBs’ because of their preference for repair from sister chromatids, versus homologous chromosomes, and their proposed role in contributing to homolog pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borde and de Massy, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>). The homolog bias that these ‘scout DSBs’ do display seems dependent on budding yeast <italic>PCH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>) but interpreting this experiment is complicated by the fact that Pch2 is also required to make the budding yeast meiotic HORMAD, Hop1, available for its loading onto meiotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herruzo et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to budding yeast, <italic>C. elegans</italic> does not rely on DSBs to promote homolog pairing and initiate synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>); in worms, <italic>cis</italic>-acting sites called PCs are essential for homolog pairing and synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">MacQueen et al., 2005</xref>). There is certainly some support in the literature for DSBs playing a role in supporting pairing and synapsis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mlynarczyk-Evans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roelens et al., 2015</xref>). However, if these early DSBs were contributing to pairing and synapsis, we would expect to see a genetic interaction between <italic>htp-3<sup>H96Y</sup></italic> and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutations in the installation of GFP::MSH-5 in the transition zone; we previously reported that <italic>htp-3<sup>H96Y</sup></italic> suppresses the acceleration of pairing and synapsis of <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants, particularly when PC function is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Russo et al., 2023</xref>). Instead, we favor the possibility that these early DSBs are generated to amplify the signaling of DNA damage kinases to prime them for their role in recombination, a role that has also been proposed for ‘scout’ DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>). That ATM-1, a conserved DNA damage kinase that is downstream of CHK-2 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, relies on DSBs for full activity, supports this proposed, conserved role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yu et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Our work provides an important framework to finally understand the role of PCH-2 in controlling the number and distribution of crossovers, a role that we argue is its conserved role. While specific details may vary across systems, we propose that PCH-2 remodels meiotic HORMADs throughout meiotic prophase to destabilize crossover-eligible precursors, coordinating meiotic recombination with synapsis, contributing to the progressive implementation of meiotic recombination, guaranteeing crossover assurance, interference and homeostasis, and explaining its function as a pachytene checkpoint component.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> genetics and genome engineering</title><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> Bristol N2 was used as the wildtype strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

In some organisms the impact of PCH-2 mutations is subtle but becomes more apparent when other aspects of recombination are perturbed. Patel et al. performed a set of elegant experiments in <italic>C. elegans</italic> aimed at identifying conserved functions of PCH-2. Their work provides such an opportunity because in <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiotically expressed HORMADs localize to meiotic chromosomes independently of PCH-2. Work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also allows the authors to focus on nuclear PCH-2 functions as opposed to cytoplasmic functions also seen for PCH-2 in other organisms.</p><p>The authors performed the following experiments:</p><p>(1) They constructed <italic>C. elegans</italic> animals with SNPs that enabled them to measure crossing over in intervals that cover most of four of the six chromosomes. They then showed that double-crossovers, which were common on most of the four chromosomes in wild-type, were absent in pch-2. They also noted shifts in crossover distribution in the four chromosomes.</p><p>(2) Based on the crossover analysis and previous studies they hypothesized that PCH-2 plays a role at an early stage in meiotic prophase to regulate how SPO-11 induced double-strand breaks are utilized to form crossovers. They tested their hypothesis by performing ionizing irradiation and depleting SPO-11 at different stages in meiotic prophase in wild-type and pch-2 mutant animals. The authors observed that irradiation of meiotic nuclei in zygotene resulted in pch-2 nuclei having a larger number of nuclei with 6 or greater crossovers (as measured by COSA-1 foci) compared to wildtype. Consistent with this observation, SPO11 depletion, starting roughly in zygotene, also resulted in pch-2 nuclei having an increase in 6 or more COSA-1 foci compared to wildtype. The increased number at this time point appeared beneficial because a significant decrease in univalents was observed.</p><p>(3) They then asked if the above phenotypes correlated with the localization of MSH-5, a factor that stabilizes crossover-specific DNA recombination intermediates. They observed that pch-2 mutants displayed an increase in MSH-5 foci at early times in meiotic prophase and an unexpectedly higher number at later times. They conclude based on the differences in early MSH-5 localization and the SPO-11 and irradiation studies that PCH-2 prevents early DSBs from becoming crossovers and early loading of MSH-5. By analyzing different HORMAD proteins that are defective in forming the closed conformation acted upon by PCH-2, they present evidence that MSH-5 loading was regulated by the HIM-3 HORMAD.</p><p>(4) They performed a crossover homeostasis experiment in which DSB levels were reduced. The goal of this experiment was to test if PCH-2 acts in crossover assurance. Interestingly, in this background PCH-2 negative nuclei displayed higher levels of COSA-1 foci compared to PCH-2 positive nuclei. This observation and a further test of the model suggested that &quot;PCH-2's presence on the SC prevents crossover designation.&quot;</p><p>(5) Based on their observations indicating that early DSBS are prevented from becoming crossovers by PCH-2, the authors hypothesized that the DNA damage kinase CHK-2 and PCH-2 act to control how DSBs enter the crossover pathway. This hypothesis was developed based on their finding that PCH-2 prevents early DSBs from becoming crossovers and previous work showing that CHK-2 activity is modulated during meiotic recombination progression. They tested their hypothesis using a mutant synaptonemal complex component that maintains high CHK-2 activity that cannot be turned off to enable crossover designation. Their finding that the pch-2 mutation suppressed the crossover defect (as measured by COSA-1 foci) supports their hypothesis.</p><p>Based on these studies the authors provide convincing evidence that PCH-2 prevents early DSBs from becoming crossovers and controls the number and distribution of crossovers to promote a regulated mechanism that ensures the formation of obligate crossovers and crossover homeostasis. As the authors note, such a mechanism is consistent with earlier studies suggesting that early DSBs could serve as &quot;scouts&quot; to facilitate homolog pairing or to coordinate the DNA damage response with repair events that lead to crossing over. The detailed mechanistic insights provided in this work will certainly be used to better understand functions for PCH-2 in meiosis in other organisms.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors responded very carefully to all of my concerns expressed in the first review, which were primarily aimed at improving the clarity of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102409.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper has some intriguing data regarding the different potential roles of Pch-2 in ensuring crossing over.

It is not clear to this reviewer how the SNPs were introduced into the animals. Was crossing over measured in a single animal line? Were the wild-type and pch-2 mutations made in backgrounds that were isogenic with respect to each other? This is a concern because it is not clear, at least to this reviewer, how much of an impact crossing different ecotypes will have on the frequency and distribution of recombination events (and possibly the recombination intermediates that were studied).</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified these issues in the Materials and Methods of our updated preprint. The control and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants were isogenic in either the Bristol or Hawaiian backgrounds. Control lines were the original Bristol and Hawaiian lines and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants were originally made in the Bristol line and backcrossed at least 3 times before analysis. Hawaiian <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants were made by backcrossing <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants at least 8 times to the Hawaiian background and verifying the presence of Hawaiian SNPs on all chromosomes tested in the recombination assay. To perform the recombination assays, these lines were crossed to generate the relevant F1s.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors state that in pch-2 mutants there was a striking shift of crossovers (line 135) to the PC end for all of the four chromosomes that were tested. I looked at Figure 1 for some time and felt that the results were more ambiguous. Map distances seemed similar at the PC end for wildtype and pch-2 on Chrom. I. While the decrease in crossing over in pch-2 appeared significant for Chrom. I and III, the results for Chrom. IV, and Chrom. X. seemed less clear. Were map distances compared statistically? At least for this reviewer the effects on specific intervals appear less clear and without a bit more detail on how the animals were constructed it's hard for me to follow these conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the added details above makes the results of these assays more clear. Map distances were compared and did not satisfy statistical significance, except where indicated. While we agree that the comparisons between control animals and <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants may seem less clear with individual chromosomes, we argue that more general, consistent patterns become clear when analyzing multiple chromosomes. Indeed, this is why we expanded our recombination analysis beyond Chromosome III and the X Chromosome, as reported in Deshong, 2014. We have edited this sentence to: “Moreover, there was a striking and consistent shift of crossovers to the PC end of all four chromosomes tested.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 2. I'm curious why non-irradiated controls were not tested side-by-side for COSA-1 staining.

It took me a while to follow the connection between the COSA-1 staining and DAPI staining panels (12 hrs later). Perhaps an arrow that connects each set of time points between the panels or just a single title on the X-axis that links the two would make things clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>To make this figure more clear, we have generated two different cartoons for the assay that scores GFP::COSA-1 foci and the assay that scores bivalents.

Please provide references.</p></disp-quote><p>We have referenced Woglar and Villeneuve 2018 and Joshi et. al. 2015 to support this statement in the updated preprint.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Do double crossovers show strong interference in worms? Given that the PC is at the ends of chromosomes don't you expect double crossovers to be near the chromosome ends and thus the PC?</p></disp-quote><p>Despite their rarity, double crossovers do show interference in worms. However, the PC is limited to one end of the chromosome. Therefore, even if interference ensures the spacing of these double crossovers, the preponderance of one of these crossovers toward one end (and not both ends) suggest something functionally unique about the PC end.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 155 - if the previous data in Deshong et al is helpful it would be useful to briefly describe it and how the experimental caveats led to misinterpretation (or state that further investigation suggests a different model etc.). Many readers are unlikely to look up the paper to find out what this means.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this to the updated preprint: “We had previously observed that meiotic nuclei in early prophase were more likely to produce crossovers when DSBs were induced by the <italic>Mos</italic> transposon in <italic>pch-2</italic> mutants than in control animals but experimental caveats limited our ability to properly interpret this experiment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 248: I am confused by the meaning of crossover assurance here - you see no difference in the average number of COSA-1 foci in Pch-2 vs. wt at any time point. Is it the increase in cells with &gt;6 COSA-1 foci that shows a loss of crossover assurance? That is the only thing that shows a significant difference (at the one time point) in COSA-1 foci. The number of dapi bodies shows the loss of Pch-2 increases crossover assurance (fewer cells with unattached homologs). So this part is confusing to me. How does reliably detecting foci vs. DAPI bodies explain this?</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this section to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Line 384: I am confused. I understand that in the dsb-2/pch2 mutant there are fewer COSA-1 foci. So fewer crossovers are designated when DSBs are reduced in the absence of PCH-2.</p><p>How then does this suggest that PCH-2's presence on the SC prevents crossover designation? Its absence is preventing crossover designation at least in the dsb-2 mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to make this more clear in the updated preprint. In this experiment, we had identified three possible explanations for why PCH-2 persists on some nuclei that do not have GFP::COSA-1 foci: (1) PCH-2 removal is coincident with crossover designation; (2) PCH-2 removal depends on crossover designation; and (3) PCH-2 removal facilitates crossover designation. The decrease in the number of GFP::COSA-1 foci in <italic>dsb2::AID;pch-2</italic> mutants argues against the first two possibilities, suggesting that the third might be correct. We have edited the sentence to read: “These data argue against the possibility that PCH-2’s removal from the SC is simply in response to or coincident with crossover designation and instead, suggest that PCH-2’s removal from the SC somehow facilitates crossover designation and assurance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Discussion Line 535: How do you know that the crossovers that form near the PCs are Class II and not the other way around? Perhaps early forming Class I crossovers give time for a second Class II crossover to form. In budding yeast, it is thought that synapsis initiation sites are likely sites of crossover designation and class I crossing over. Also, the precursors that form class I and II crossovers may be the same or highly similar to each other, such that Pch-2's actions could equally affect both pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not know that the crossovers that form near the PC are Class II but hypothesize that they are based on the close, functional relationship that exists between Class I crossovers and synapsis and the apparent antagonistic relationship that exists between Class II crossovers and synapsis. We agree that Class I and Class II crossover precursors are likely to be the same or highly similar, exhibit extensive crosstalk that may complicate straightforward analysis and PCH-2 is likely to affect both, as strongly suggested by our GFP::MSH-5 analysis. We present this hypothesis based on the apparent relationship between PCH-2 and synapsis in several systems but agree that it needs to be formally tested. We have tried to make this argument more clear in the updated preprint.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes an in-depth analysis of the effect of the AAA+ ATPase PCH-2 on meiotic crossover formation in C. elegant.
