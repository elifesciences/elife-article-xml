The splicing reaction requires definition of splice sites, which are initially recognized in either intron-spanning (‘intron definition’) or exon-spanning (‘exon definition’) pairs. To understand how exon and intron length and splice site recognition mode impact splicing, we measured splicing rates genome-wide in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, using metabolic labeling/RNA sequencing and new mathematical models to estimate rates. We found that the modal intron length range of 60–70 nt represents a local maximum of splicing rates, but that much longer exon-defined introns are spliced even faster and more accurately. We observed unexpectedly low variation in splicing rates across introns in the same gene, suggesting the presence of gene-level influences, and we identified multiple gene level variables associated with splicing rate. Together our data suggest that developmental and stress response genes may have preferentially evolved exon definition in order to enhance the rate or accuracy of splicing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mRNA splicing</kwd><kwd>kinetic investigations</kwd><kwd>mathematical modeling</kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01-ES101987</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henriques</surname><given-names>Telmo</given-names></name><name><surname>Burkholder</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name><name><surname>Adelman</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM085319</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pai</surname><given-names>Athma A</given-names></name><name><surname>Burge</surname><given-names>Christopher B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pai</surname><given-names>Athma A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FG02-97ER25308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCue</surname><given-names>Kayla</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Surprising connections between gene architecture and splicing kinetics are illuminated using short, progressive metabolic labeling/RNA sequencing and novel computational modeling approaches in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic genes are generally composed of multiple exons with intervening introns that are spliced out to form mature RNA molecules. Despite the general conservation of this gene architecture, the number of introns per gene and relative sizes of exons and introns vary greatly across organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deutsch and Long, 1999</xref>). For example, average intron lengths exceed 1 or 2 kilobases in most vertebrates compared to 50–500 nt in simpler eukaryotes, with somewhat less variability in exon lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deutsch and Long, 1999</xref>). The presence and density of introns can influence gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mascarenhas et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shaul, 2017</xref>), while longer flanking intron lengths are associated with alternatively spliced exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fox-Walsh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gelfman et al., 2012</xref>). It is not known whether pronounced differences in intron size across eukaryotic lineages has consequences for the efficiency of mRNA splicing.</p><p>The splicing of metazoan introns requires three primary sequence elements – the 5' splice site (at the exon/intron boundary), the 3' splice site and polypyrimidine tract (at and upstream of the intron/exon boundary), and the branch point sequence (BPS) – and the numerous (ribonucleo)proteins that make up the spliceosome. The earliest steps in splicing are the base pairing of the U1 and U2 small ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) to the 5' splice site and BPS, respectively. Progression toward splicing is thought to occur in one of two modes – either by ‘intron definition,’ in which the U1 and U2 snRNPs first interact across the intron; or ‘exon definition,’ in which U1 snRNP initially pairs with the upstream U2 snRNP across the exon, followed by rearrangement to form interactions with the downstream U2 snRNP across the intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berget, 1995</xref>). The pairing of U1 and U2 snRNPs requires bringing these complexes into close proximity, through either passive diffusion-based contact or co-localization regulated by other splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Conti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hollander et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequent steps of splicing are thought to proceed in a standard fashion regardless of the splice-site recognition mode, with the formation of an intronic lariat and cleavage at the 3’ splice site to complete intron excision and joining together of the flanking exons.</p><p>Although intron splicing is likely the rate-limiting step in the production of many processed mRNAs, the precise mechanisms and consequences of differing splice-site recognition modes remains unclear. Previous observations suggest that the architecture of a gene – specifically the absolute or relative lengths of introns and exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Robberson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sterner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berget, 1995</xref>) – is important for the selection of a splice-site recognition mode, with the shorter sized unit being favored for initial pairing of snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Talerico and Berget, 1994</xref>). In vertebrate genomes, where exon definition is thought to be the predominant recognition mode, the experimental expansion of exon lengths can prevent proper spliceosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sterner et al., 1996</xref>) except when the flanking introns are very short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Chasin, 1994</xref>). In yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the expansion of small introns can lead to intron retention and other splicing defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Talerico and Berget, 1994</xref>). Some studies have suggested that recognition of introns and exons larger than 300–500 nt can be inefficient, unless the flanking units are much smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fox-Walsh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sterner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Chasin, 1994</xref>). There is also a minimum 5' splice site to branch point distance in each organism, which imposes a minimal intronic length, and splicing of very small exons is generally inefficient due to steric interference between bound factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dominski and Kole, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sterner et al., 1996</xref>). For shorter intron-defined introns, intron length might limit the rate of diffusion-based contact between the U1 and U2 snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hollander et al., 2016</xref>). However, for longer exon-defined introns which must undergo two recognition steps, this passive diffusion-based model would predict prohibitively slow splicing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hollander et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We sought to understand the roles of exon and intron length in the kinetics of splicing to provide insight into the advantages and disadvantages of the longer introns present in more complex eukaryotes. <italic>Drosophila</italic> is an ideal organism to address this question, since it represents an invertebrate lineage known to have a mix of both intron-defined and exon-defined introns. Furthermore, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has a broad distribution of intron lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lim and Burge, 2001</xref>), with over a third of introns between 60 and 70 nt, and a tail of longer introns with lengths up to tens of kilobases (kb). Splicing kinetics has been studied for a limited number of introns using PCR-based or single-molecule imaging approaches. Splicing is thought to predominantly occur co-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Singh and Padgett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Khodor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brugiolo et al., 2013</xref>), with measured rates for a handful of mammalian introns of 0.5–10 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Singh and Padgett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rabani et al., 2014</xref>) while yeast introns are often spliced within seconds after synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oesterreich et al., 2016</xref>). The kinetics of splicing can impact downstream gene expression pathways and overall gene expression levels. For instance, the splicing of U12-type introns (spliced by the minor spliceosome) can be rate-limiting, such that splicing – and the ultimate production of mature mRNAs – can be made more efficient by mutating U12-type splice sites to sites recognized by the major U2-type spliceosome in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Singh and Padgett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patel et al., 2002</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that alternatively spliced introns are spliced at different rates than constitutive introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jonkers et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To globally assess the kinetics of RNA processing in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and to address questions about the impacts of exon versus intron definition, we developed a new modeling approach and applied it to short time period metabolic labeling data. Together, these data enabled analysis of splicing rates from the introns of over 5000 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes, revealing unexpected differences in the kinetics of intron versus exon definition, and identifying gene-specific features associated with differences in the speed of splicing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>mRNA splicing is a dynamic mechanism that can initiate immediately after an intron's transcription is completed. To measure the kinetics of mRNA splicing, it is necessary to capture nascent transcripts at short intervals after transcription, before introns have been completely spliced out. One effective experimental approach involves incorporating a metabolic label such as 4-thiouridine (4sU) to isolate RNA at short time points (within a few minutes) after transcription. The sequencing of nascent RNA over a time course of labeling periods is conceptually different from strategies used to estimate the extent of co-transcriptional splicing (e.g., Nascent-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Khodor et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2012</xref>]) or to track the progression of PolII across genes (e.g., NET-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mayer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nojima et al., 2015</xref>]), focusing on time rather than location. This strategy has been used previously to assess relative splicing dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Windhager et al., 2012</xref>), although previous studies lacked the power to quantitatively measure half-lives of intron excision across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Windhager et al., 2012</xref>). To recover sufficient labeled RNA, it is generally necessary to incorporate 4sU for a period of minutes. This progressive labeling design results in the isolation of transcripts initiated prior to labeling but elongated during this period, as well as transcripts that initiated during the labeling period, yielding a range of times since completion of synthesis for any given intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We set out to develop an approach to derive the rate of intron splicing accounting for the distribution of times since synthesis in different transcripts resulting from progressive labeling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32537.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Estimating intron-specific splicing half-lives.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Progressive labeling with 4sU results in sampling of nascent RNA molecules from polymerase molecules distributed across a gene (<italic>bottom</italic>).

(2012</xref>); (2) modeling the rate of decrease in ‘percent spliced in’ (PSI or Ψ for short, which estimates the proportion of unspliced introns) as a function of mean time since intron synthesis (‘Ψ decrease’); and (3) modeling the dynamics of splice junction appearance/unspliced junction disappearance, accounting for the effects of variable transcriptional completeness on splicing probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The intron ratio approach measures the ratio of intronic read density at a long labeling period (e.g. 60 min) to that at a short labeling period (e.g. 5 min); however, the use of only two time points may limit precision. Therefore, we developed the Ψ decrease approach, which models splicing changes over a series of (three or more) time points, with Ψ values calculated using the MISO software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Katz et al., 2010</xref>) as a measure of the proportion of transcripts that contain an intron at a given labeling period. Finally, to eliminate bias from reads deriving from incompletely synthesized introns (see Materials and methods), we developed a third approach that models the dynamics of the ratio of spliced exon-exon junction reads to unspliced intron-exon junction reads, accounting for the distribution of polymerase locations at the end of the labeling period.</p><p>To assess the performance of each approach and understand any systematic biases, we simulated reads from 4sU-labeled nascent sequencing data generated from a range of gene structures, gene expression levels and intron half-lives, at different simulated labeling durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, the junction dynamics approach was best able to accurately order introns by rate, and also accurately assign absolute rates to each intron in our simulations. Considering relative orderings, the Ψ decrease and junction dynamics approaches both yielded rankings of half-lives very similar to those used in the simulation (r<sub>Spearman</sub> = 0.99 and 0.95, respectively), while the intron ratio approach correlated more weakly (r<sub>Spearman</sub> = 0.57; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating much poorer agreement. This was also true when considering the relative fold differences in half-lives between pairs of introns (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Assessing absolute estimation of half-lives, we found that half-lives estimated by the junction dynamics approach differed by just 21% on average from the simulated values, while the Ψ decrease approach tended to overestimate half-lives substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The junction dynamics method accurately recovered half-lives across the full range of simulated values (r<sub>Pearson</sub> = 0.95), with no detectible bias, while the Ψ decrease method consistently overestimates absolute half-lives, with greater absolute deviation from true values at longer half-lives (r<sub>Pearson</sub> = 0.35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, the relative accuracy of the junction dynamics method does not significantly vary across the distribution of intron lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>) or transcript length downstream of the 3’ splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). The advantages presented by the junction dynamics approach come at the expense of somewhat reduced power to measure splicing rates in lower-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), where numbers of captured splice junction reads may be too low for analysis. Taken together, the results of our simulations clearly indicate that the junction dynamics method provides the best overall combination of absolute and relative accuracy in inference of splicing half-lives from progressive labeling 4sU-seq data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Measuring rates of splicing for 25,000 <italic>Drosophila</italic> introns</title><p>We applied the junction dynamics method to a time course of 4sU-seq data generated from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> S2 cells.

We hypothesized that the weaker 3' splice sites and slower splicing of ultra-short <italic>Drosophila</italic> introns might result from constraints on branch point sequence (BPS) position, since minimum 5'ss-BPS and BPS-3'ss distances are required for splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mount et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wieringa et al., 1984</xref>). In flies, these minima appear to be ~35 nt and ~15 nt, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mount et al., 1992</xref>). Thus, the BPS location in a 45 nt intron is constrained to fall between positions –15 and –10 relative to the 3'ss, a position that leaves little room for a PPT, likely explaining the weaker 3'ss scores in this class. To explore this possibility, we scanned for a BPS motif in introns from the different length classes (as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lim and Burge, 2001</xref>]). In each length class, we identified a plausible BPS motif with consensus CTAAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mount et al., 1992</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, the mean location of this motif was much closer to the 3'ss in ultra-short introns (–14) than in the longer intron classes, where the mean location was between –23 and –26. This observation suggests that ultra-short introns are constrained in their ability to splice efficiently by their suboptimal BPS locations, which may simply prevent a sufficiently long PPT for efficient splicing, or may result in steric interference between dU2AF<sup>50</sup> bound at the PPT and U2 snRNP bound at the BPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Conti et al., 2013</xref>).

In contrast, low RIME introns had many significant 6mers in intronic regions, and relatively few in the flanking exons. The overall asymmetry in 6mer enrichment supports a role for region-specific sequence features in splice-site recognition modes.</p><p>Many of the 6mers enriched in specific regions match binding motifs for known splicing regulatory factors. For example, AACAAC, CAACAA, and ACAACA, among the top enriched 6mers in both upstream and downstream exons flanking exon-defined introns, were among the five most enriched 6mers in exons flanking alternative exons regulated in S2 cells by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> splicing factor Pasilla (PS), a homolog of mammalian Nova family splicing factors which bind a distinct but related motif, YCAY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks et al., 2011</xref>). The most enriched 6mer in downstream exons, GCAGCA, is a known mammalian exonic splicing enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fairbrother et al., 2002</xref>) and a binding motif for the SR proteins SRSF8 and SRSF10 (Dominguez <italic>et al.)</italic>. The shorter splicing half-lives of high RIME (‘exon-defined’) introns might reflect more efficient recognition of their flanking exons. Indeed, longer exon-defined introns – which are spliced more quickly – are preceded by upstream exons with a higher density of significant 6mers (in aggregate) than shorter exon-defined introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Different modes of initial splice site pairing might also induce different rates of splicing errors. As a simple measure of potential splicing errors, we computed the fraction of reads that spanned ‘non-canonical’ splice junctions, (i.e. pairs of intron terminal dinucleotides other than the three canonical pairs ‘GT-AG,’ ‘GC-AG,’ and ‘AT-AC’ that account for ~99.9% of all known fly introns). Despite being longer, exon-defined introns (high RIME) had the lowest mean frequency of non-canonical junction reads, while intron-defined introns (low RIME) had highest frequency of non-canonical splice site usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). This observation suggests that the initial recognition of splice sites across exon units involved in exon definition may improve the accuracy of splice site choice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Consistent splicing rates across introns in a gene</title><p>To explore what other variables might influence the efficiency of splicing of introns, we used a multiple linear regression model to estimate the contribution of various candidate features to splicing half-lives (Materials and methods). We separately fit this model to RIME-inferred intron-defined introns (<italic>n</italic> = 12,990) and exon-defined introns (<italic>n</italic> = 1,873), and restricted our analysis within each group to non-first introns for reasons discussed below (Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Overall, these variables accounted for 19.9% and 16% of variance in splicing half-lives for intron- and exon-defined introns, respectively. Intron length was one of the strongest contributors for both sets of introns, contributing positively to splicing rate for the exon-defined class and negatively for the intron-defined class, consistent with results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. Exon lengths accounted for less variation in half-lives than intron lengths, although the direction was opposite to that of intron lengths for each splicing mode. As expected, increased strength of both the 5' and 3' splice sites was associated with shorter intron half-lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hicks et al., 2010</xref>). However, 5’ splice site strength appeared more important for intron-defined introns, while 3’ splice site strength had a greater impact for exon-defined introns, consistent with models of splice site recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Conti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hollander et al., 2016</xref>). A + U content of the intron was also associated with shorter intron half-lives, especially in the 3' region of the intron (excluding the 3' splice site). Introns are U-rich in many metazoans and plants, and many proteins of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) class bind A + U rich motifs in introns and participate in splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goodall and Filipowicz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lorković et al., 2000</xref>). As the BPS motif consensus is also A + U rich, increased BPS strength might also contribute to this observation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32537.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Splicing efficiency across introns within a gene.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative importance of variables influencing variance in splicing half-lives in intron-defined (<italic>left</italic>) and exon-defined (<italic>right</italic>) introns, using a multiple linear-regression to account for variance in half-lives for non-first introns.

This relationship is consistent with our observation that more rapidly spliced introns, particularly exon-defined introns, tend to occur in higher expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Greater first intron length was also associated with faster splicing of other introns for the intron definition class. The importance assigned to gene expression and first intron length, both gene-specific rather than intron-specific properties, raised the question of the relationship between splicing rates of different introns in the same gene. We observed that splicing half-lives of introns drawn from the same gene tend to be more similar to each other (than those of randomly sampled introns, for example, comparing standard deviations (Mann-Whitney comparison of SDs, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Randomly varying the rate of elongation across introns within a gene yielded the same result, suggesting that this result is not dependent on our assumption of a uniform transcription rate across the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This relationship remained when considering the coefficient of variation rather than the standard deviation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Such a relationship might result indirectly from differing levels of selection for efficient splicing experienced by different genes or classes of genes, or directly from gene-level features that impact the splicing efficiency of all introns in a gene.</p><p>Introns from the same gene are also more likely to have similar lengths than randomly sampled introns (Mann-Whitney comparison of SDs, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that there might be an advantage to maintaining a consistent splice site recognition mode across introns within a gene. We classified exon/intron definition preferences at the gene level by dividing genes into three classes: (1) all or mostly intron-defined, with ≥2/3 intron-defined (n = 4,463); (2) all or mostly exon-defined (≥2/3 exon-defined) (n = 308); and (3) the remaining ‘mixed genes’ with substantial proportions of introns from both recognition modes (n = 837; Materials and methods). We observed that splicing half-lives of introns drawn from genes with consistent splice site pairing preferences (classes 1 and 2) tend to be more similar to each other than introns from mixed definition genes. Notably, splicing half-lives across introns from genes with mostly exon-defined introns were less than half as variable than half-lives across introns from intron-defined genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>First introns are slowly spliced and may influence rates of downstream introns</title><p>It was intriguing that the presence of a long first intron was associated with faster splicing of subsequent non-first introns within a gene, particularly for genes with predominantly shorter intron-defined genes. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, first introns are more than twice as long on average as other introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and take at least 50% longer to splice than second, third, fourth, or other intron positions. In metazoans, transcriptional enhancers are often located in the first introns of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kharchenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>), and we confirmed this trend in genes expressed in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, the frequent presence of transcriptional enhancers may contribute to increased lengths of first introns, and could possibly impact the kinetics of splicing of first or non-first introns. Presence of a transcriptional enhancer in any intron (first and non-first) was associated with slower splicing of intron-defined introns and faster splicing of exon-defined introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>), but this association was not significant for introns from either splice site recognition mode in the regression model of splicing rates including other variables described above, so was not further explored here. Splicing half-lives or lengths of the last (3’ most) intron in the gene were not significantly different than those of internal introns.</p><p>We observed a weak but significant negative correlation between the length of the first intron in a gene and the median half-lives across downstream introns (r<sub>spearman</sub> = −0.06; p=0.00034; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This relationship remained when controlling for variability in the lengths of non-first introns by restricting the analysis to genes whose non-first introns were all intron-defined with lengths between 60 and 70 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). These observations suggest that the architecture of the 5' end of the gene, notably the length of the 5'-most intron, impacts the splicing efficiency of the remaining introns. These observations, together with our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, suggest that various properties of the gene – including its overall exon-intron architecture – impact the splicing rate of all introns, rather than each intron’s splicing rate being independently determined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The rates of particular steps in gene expression can provide clues to mechanism, and in some cases selection may act on these rates. Since all the introns in a transcript must be removed to produce a mature mRNA that can be exported and translated, natural selection (if present) may act primarily on the total elapsed time to splice all introns rather than on the splicing rates of individual introns. We observed above that longer first introns were associated with faster splicing of downstream introns. Longer first introns might allow additional time for the recruitment of factors that promote downstream splicing efficiency, consistent with the observation that transcription elongation is slow before reaching the second exon, at least in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>). Under this model, longer first introns should be favored in genes with larger numbers of introns, where the splicing time of the first intron is less likely to be rate-limiting, because of the longer time required for the polymerase to reach the 3' end of the transcript and the greater likelihood that another intron’s splicing is rate-limiting for production of mature mRNA. Consistent with this expectation, we observed a pronounced trend where genes with larger numbers of introns have longer first introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>).</p><p>There is a well-established mutational bias toward short deletions (over short insertions) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Petrov et al., 2000</xref>). This bias may explain the predominance of short introns in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Comeron and Kreitman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parsch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lim and Burge, 2001</xref>). Our observation that the 60–70 nt length range – where there is a sharp peak in the genome-wide intron length distribution – represents a local maximum in intron splicing rates, suggests that this peak may have been shaped by selection for efficient splicing. At a length of 60–70 nt (or shorter), the 5' and 3' splice sites and BPS occupy a large fraction of the intron. Thus, length-changing mutations may often disrupt recognition of core motifs in this class, contributing to maintenance of intron length. Absent data comparing splicing dynamics across species, it is difficult to estimate selective pressures on splicing half-lives and intron lengths. Our observation that gene architectures characteristic of exon definition are associated with not only faster but also more accurate splicing prompts us to speculate that selection for splicing speed and/or accuracy may play a role in maintenance of long introns in genes with particular biological functions (discussed below), despite the expected mutational pressure toward shortening. It is also possible that variable mutational biases across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome explain the presence of long introns in a subset of genes.</p><p>It is less clear why exon definition should be associated with increased speed and accuracy. Perhaps, the increased time required to transcribe the longer introns characteristic of exon-defined transcripts affords more time for recognition (and perhaps proofreading) of exon definition complexes on upstream exons. It has also been proposed that efficient juxtaposition of exons is favored by tethering of the upstream exon definition complex to the elongating polymerase during transcription of the subsequent exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hollander et al., 2016</xref>). Splicing factors of the SR protein family or other families may also play a role in accelerating exon definition, given our observations that particular sequence motifs are enriched in exons associated with exon definition, and previous observations that SR proteins can enhance splicing rates in mammalian systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Long and Caceres, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We also observed that genes with mixed modes of initial splice site recognition had less consistent splicing rates of their introns than genes with predominantly intron or exon definition. If initial pairing of U1 and U2 snRNPs occurs across an intron, the U2 complex bound at the 3' end of the intron might have reduced availability to pair with a U1 snRNP bound to the downstream 5' splice site, inhibiting exon definition downstream, and conversely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berget, 1995</xref>). Thus, one might expect a tendency for different introns in the same transcript to use the same mode of initial splice site pairing. Indeed, we observe that there are 5% fewer genes with mixed modes of splicing site recognition than expected by chance (permutation test p&lt;0.001).</p><p>Gene architecture may be related to expression dynamics and function. We observed that genes with architectures favoring intron definition were enriched for Gene Ontology categories involved in RNA processing and metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), while genes with predominant exon definition were enriched for developmental processes and stress responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Furthermore, the enrichment within many of the most significant categories of developmental processes and response to oxidative stress increased for genes with increased proportions of exon-defined introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Timing of gene expression may be of particular importance during early development, when cell cycles are very short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artieri and Fraser, 2014</xref>), and in stress response when protein production must be turned on quickly. Thus, genes in developmental and stress response pathways might have evolved structures that favor exon definition to take advantage of the increased splicing speed and accuracy associated with this mode of recognition, although rates of other steps (e.g. transcription, 3' end formation) will also contribute to expression dynamics and may be rate limiting in some cases. Interestingly, the half-life of the last intron is longer than the expected time to transcribe the last exon in 92% of genes expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, making splicing likely to be rate limiting for expression of a large portion of these genes.</p><p>We also observed that introns in genes with higher expression levels tended to have faster rates of splicing. This trend could reflect various factors, including differences in the chromatin or nuclear environment of the nascent transcript, or perhaps selection to increase the efficiency of spliceosome recycling. There is evidence that genes with higher expression levels have evolved biased codon usage to enhance translation elongation rates and promote efficient ribosome recycling in order to boost the pool of available ribosomes and optimize overall translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quax et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, highly expressed genes may have evolved exon definition to boost their speed of splicing and recycling of the splicing machinery in order to boost the pool of free snRNPs and optimize the overall splicing efficiency in the cell. Here, we measured splicing rates in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, a highly proliferative cell type that likely has high concentrations of the core gene expression machinery involved in transcription, translation and splicing. Thus, it may be interesting to study splicing rates in other cell types where competition for the splicing machinery might be more pronounced, including cells undergoing developmental transitions or cellular responses that involve rapidly ramping up transcriptional production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Munding et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"> Cell line (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">S2</td><td valign="top">Drosophila Genome Resource Center</td><td valign="top">Stock #6</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Chemical compound</td><td valign="top">4-thiouridine (4sU)</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">T4509</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Software</td><td valign="top">Tophat 2.0.4</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trapnell et al.

All of these approaches rest on two main assumptions: (1) that all transcripts synthesized during the labeling period incorporate the 4sU label; and (2) that all transcripts containing label are equally likely to be captured. The first of these assumptions seem very plausible, while the second is undoubtedly an oversimplification. Additionally, our approaches neglect any contribution from mRNA decay since mRNA half-lives are typically &gt;2 hr in flies, much longer than typical splicing half-lives estimated here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herold et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, 4sU uptake and incorporation in mammalian cells has been observed to occur in less than a minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rädle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Windhager et al., 2012</xref>), with uptake and incorporation rates depending on the concentration of 4sU in the media and the growth conditions of the cell line. <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells are suspension cells, which have increased 4sU uptake efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Windhager et al., 2012</xref>), and our data were collected after incubation with a high concentration of 4sU (500 μM). Thus, it is reasonable to expect that 4sU uptake and incorporation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells also occurs rapidly.

To do so, we consider the percent of newly created transcripts that still had intron reads in each labeling period by calculating an intron-specific percent spliced in (PSI or Ψ) value, using reads within the intron body and junction reads spanning the 5’ and 3’ splice sites bordering the intron as calculated by the software MISO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Katz et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>A standard progressive metabolic labeling design will result in the isolation of transcripts that initiated transcription at any time during the labeling period, of duration <italic>L</italic>, as well as transcripts that were elongated during this period but initiated prior to the labeling period.

Although this approach yields more quantitative half-life measurements than the intron ratio approach, the inclusion of reads deriving from incompletely synthesized introns may inflate Ψ values and therefore lead to over-estimation of intron half-lives, especially for long introns at short labeling periods, and use of a mean time since synthesis is an approximation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Estimating the rate of mRNA splicing by mathematical modeling of junction ratios</title><p>One limitation of our modeling of PSI decay is the inability to distinguish reads deriving from incompletely transcribed introns from those deriving from completed but unspliced introns, both of which are captured by sequencing of 4sU-labeled nascent RNA. Our progressive labeling experimental design yields three populations of transcripts: partial-intron transcripts which do not contain a completely transcribed intron, unspliced transcripts that have complete introns that have not been spliced, and spliced transcripts. This spectrum can be conceptualized as a range of endpoints of a polymerase that could potentially contribute reads to the intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) – specifically, if a polymerase is in the body of the intron at the end of the labeling period, it would produce a labeled transcript that includes only a portion of the intron. If the polymerase is further along the gene body but has not completed transcription of the full gene, it would produce a labeled transcript that will either include the intron or not, depending on splicing status. If the transcript is completely transcribed within the labeling period, it would also have a probability of either including the intron or not depending on splicing status. While, in reality, the associated polymerase for these completed transcripts would disengage from the DNA shortly following cleavage of the mRNA, conceptually it can be associated with the point where it would be at the end of the labeling period had it continued transcribing without dropoff past the end of the gene, so that all considered polymerases can be associated to positions on a line.</p><p>Considering the end of the intron to be coordinate 0, the range of endpoints relevant to the intron is [<italic>-i, e + d + Lr</italic>], where <italic>i</italic> is the length of the intron, <italic>e</italic> is the length of the downstream exon, <italic>d</italic> is the distance from the end of the downstream exon to the polyA site at the end of the gene, <italic>L</italic> is the labeling period, and <italic>r</italic> is the rate of transcription (again assumed to be constant across the genome). Before position <italic>-i</italic>, the resulting transcript will have no overlap with the intron, and after position <italic>e + d +  Lr</italic>, the resulting transcript cannot have incorporated the metabolic label. Transcripts associated with these polymerase end points can be divided into the three populations they come from: pre-spliced transcripts, unspliced transcripts, and spliced transcripts (as described above). Short-read sequencing makes it difficult to determine which reads come from which transcript population. The only reads that can be definitively assigned are junction reads, where intron-exon junction reads come from the unspliced category and exon-exon junction reads come from the spliced category.</p><p>We can consider the expected contribution to the unspliced category by a polymerase at the transcript level by letting the probability of any endpoint <italic>x</italic> be some value <italic>p</italic>, a constant across the region [<italic>-i, e + d + Lr</italic>].

id="s4-4"><title>Estimating splicing rates from 4sU-RNA-seq data</title><p>To measure the efficiency at which each intron was spliced out in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, we considered a subset of introns for which we had sufficient power to measure splicing rates using our junction ratio modeling. For all following analyses, we only considered the 25,576 introns that met the following conditions: (1) in a gene with TPM &gt;5 in the total RNA libraries, (2) was completely or predominantly spliced out in the total RNA libraries (Ψ &lt;0.2, as estimated by MISO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Katz et al., 2010</xref>]), (3) had at least 1 intron-exon junction read in the 5-min labeling period, since introns without any intron-exon junction reads at the earliest labeling period are likely spliced too fast to be detected in our data, (4) had at least 1 exon-exon junction read in all of the labeling periods (to avoid non-zero ratios), and (5) did not contain an annotated alternative splicing event such as a skipped exon. Introns flanking annotated cassette exons (with Ψ &gt;0.95 in S2 cells) were retained for further analysis.</p><p>The majority of mRNA introns are spliced out using the major spliceosome (including the U2 snRNP), but a small proportion of introns are spliced out using the minor splicesome, which uses recognition of the 3’ splice site by the U12 snRNP. Previous studies have found that U12-type introns might be spliced slower than U2-type introns, suggesting that U12-dependent mechanisms have different kinetic considerations. In our dataset, there were just 7 U12-type introns in genes expressed in S2 cells with sufficient read depth for us to calculate splicing half-lives: ‘<italic>chrX:9231925–9232086:-</italic>', ‘<italic>chr3R:22789242–22789840:-</italic>', ‘<italic>chr2R:14708343–14708546:+</italic>', ‘<italic>chr3R:20895772–20895925:+</italic>', ‘<italic>chr2L:16743570–16743760:+</italic>', ‘<italic>chr3R:4838027–4838559:-</italic>', ‘<italic>chrX:17518238–17519563:-</italic>'. Consistent with previous observations, these seven introns are, on average, spliced more slowly than U2-type introns (median half-life for U12 introns = 4.9 min; median half-life for U2-type introns = 1.9 min), but this difference is not statistically significant because of the small numbers involved. These U12-type introns were somewhat longer than U2-type introns expressed in S2 cells (median length for U12-type introns = 203 nt; median length for U2-type introns = 69 nt, not significant). Given the low numbers and lack of statistical power or significance, we do not discuss these U12-type introns in further detail.</p><p>For each of the introns retained for further analyses, junction reads (intron-exon and exon-exon) were extracted using pysam, conditional on at least (1) a 10nt overlap with both the intron and downstream exon regions for intron-exon junction reads and (2) a 10nt overlap with both upstream and downstream exon regions for exon-exon junction reads. Junction reads were combined across the three replicates from each labeling period to increase power to model half-lives.

Genes were classified into splice site recognition mode categories if at least two thirds of their introns had consistent RIME values, where RIME &lt;1 was classified as intron-definition and RIME &gt;= 1 was classified as exon-definition for this analysis. The remaining genes were classified as mixed-definition. To calculate an expected number of intron- or exon-defined genes, we performed a weighted sampling introns from each gene (matching the distribution of number of introns per gene) and classifying them as either intron-defined or exon-defined, with the weights determined by the overall proportion of introns with RIME less than or greater than one, respectively. Each sampled gene was then defined as having intron- or exon-, or mixed-definition as described above. This procedure was done 1000 times to arrive at a distribution of expected classifications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Gene ontology analyses</title><p>All Gene Ontology analyses were performed using the clusterProfiler package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) in the R statistical software environment and biological processes gene ontology categories. Gene ontology analyses for fast and slow genes were also performed. Regardless of the predominant mode of splice site definition, we observed that genes had different intrinsic average splicing rates. To discriminate between genes that have overall fast or overall slow splicing, we used the average of all intron half-lives within a gene and selected the genes in the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for short and long average half-lives. Genes with the fastest splicing were enriched for cytoplasmic translation and biosynthetic processes and are highly expressed (median TPM = 84). Genes with the slowest splicing were enriched for metabolic processes, catabolic processes, and RNA processing functions and are less highly expressed (median TPM = 31). Since these enrichments and expression patterns are similar to the distinction between mostly intron- or mostly exon-defined genes, we looked to see if the fastest genes are more likely to be mostly exon-defined. Indeed, 8% of the fastest spliced genes are mostly exon-defined (compared to 3% of the slowest genes) and an average of 28% of the introns in the fastest genes are likely exon-defined (compared to an average of 9% of introns in the slowest genes).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sequencing data have been deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The kinetics of pre-mRNA splicing in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome: influence of gene architecture&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Nilsen as the Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew G Clark (Reviewer #2); Manuel Irimia (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All of the reviewers were quite positive about the work; all agreed that it provided substantive new insight into splicing kinetics in vivo. All also agreed that the paper was in principle suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Nevertheless, each referee raised a few, largely overlapping, concerns that must be addressed via revision. In this regard, it was agreed that these points could be dealt with by revisions to the text both acknowledging some potential caveats to interpretation of the data and explanation of some items that were not clear. In lieu of providing a list of essential revision, we are providing you with the complete reviews with the understanding that all points raised will be thoroughly addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Overall, this is an excellent paper. The careful use and description of the simulations is to be commended. The authors make several interesting observations about rates and accuracy of exon defined and intron defined splicing events. Their results are certainly the most complete treatment of gene structure and splicing in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. There are, however, a few issues that should be addressed.</p><p>1) The analysis makes the explicit assumption that transcription rates are uniform across genes. This is probably close to true for <italic>Drosophila</italic> but I would think that this could be tested using the data from these experiments and earlier ones from, for example, the Lis lab. I would be most concerned about how non-homogeneous transcription rates might affect some of the conclusions made regarding effects at the ends of genes.</p><p>2) A related issue is the unstated but important assumption that 4s-U labeling is instantaneous and uniform. There must be a lag, and perhaps a significant lag, in labeling, particularly in the 5-minute time point, during which the uridine pool is reaching a new equilibrium. There is significant literature on this issue in cultured cells (although perhaps not in S2 cells) from which to make reasonable approximations. From what I can tell, this effect was not modeled in the simulation and it is not clear to what extent this might affect the rates of splicing observed. While most of the analyses in the paper are comparative rather than absolute, the authors do make claims about real-time rates. They should address this point and perhaps show that their measured rates are valid when this issue is included.</p><p>3) The discussion of developmental and stress response genes being enriched for exon definition does not seem complete. Exon definition genes are longer and so take longer to transcribe. Splicing appears to be faster for such genes but what is the actual rate limiting step in their synthesis? It could even be 3' end formation rather than elongation or splicing.</p><p>4) The authors note that the first introns are often more slowly spliced than subsequent introns. What about last introns and, in particular, exon defined last introns that may rely on different mechanisms?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper was a delight to review! By labeling nascent RNA transcripts with 4-tiouridine, the authors were able to infer which transcripts retained introns and which had already spliced out the introns. They allowed for modeling of the full dynamics of the splicing process to estimate rates of splicing of every intron in the transcriptome. The goal was to learn how intron and exon lengths impact splicing dynamics. The find that exon-spanning introns are more efficiently spliced than intron-spanning splice sites, and suggest that genes that require rapid activation (such as stress response) have evolved the exon-spanning definition. Also genes that are very highly expressed tend to use the exon definition mode, consistent with the need for faster transcript processing.</p><p>The paper is well written and very well motivated. Intron-defined and exon-defined splice sites are clearly spelled out, and the unknowns regarding relative use of these splicing kinetic pathways drive the need for studies like this. The use of 4-thiouracil (4sU) incorporation provided a means to estimate the half-life for the splicing time of essentially every intron in the 5600 most highly expressed genes.</p><p>The authors do a good job showing how the method will work in silico, through simulations of the 4sU labeling processes and the inferred splicing half-lives of introns obtained from labeled transcripts with and without introns spliced out.</p><p>By doing 5, 10, and 20 min labeling with 4sU, followed by RNA sequencing and supplementing this with RNA-seq data of mature transcripts. The relative ratio of intron-exon junction reads to exon-exon junction reads was highest at the 5 min labeling period and decreased rapidly to low levels at longer times The method would appear at first to rely heavily on the assumption that all transcription proceeds at 1.5 kb/min, a figure that has good empirical support for the average, but which likely varies considerably. Simulations do an adequate job showing that the splicing half-lives are nevertheless well estimated over a reasonably broad range of transcription rates (although presumably if transcription rate were related to splicing progress in some aberrant way, the method could falter).</p><p>The data presented here clearly supports the notion that short introns that have relatively long flanking introns will tend to employ the intron definition splicing mode, whereas those with longer introns than the average of the flanking exons will tend to employ the exon definition splicing mode.</p><p>One technical detail could be made a bit more clear. The Materials and methods section succeeds very well in describing the way that splicing kinetics are learned from the relative abundances of spliced and unspliced introns in transcripts of different lengths. The contrast of several methods for quantitative analysis is good, and makes the logic clear. But the way that the data provide inference of the distinction between the exon-defined and intron-defined splicing could be more clearly spelled out. It appears to be based solely on RIME value, and while this is a sensible starting point, one would like to know if there is any other confirmation of these calls. In other words, one would like to know error rates for this inference.</p><p>An overall assessment of goodness-of-fit of the decay model to data would be good to see.</p><p>Given the unusually slow kinetics of splicing of the first intron (which often hold enhancer elements), it does appear to be sensible to drop the first intron in the analysis of the factors that determine splice mode.</p><p>Arguments that the splicing modes are a product of natural selection are speculative and are not based on either comparative (interspecific) analysis or on population genetic analysis.

Probably the relatively low frequency of polymorphism in splice sites would erode the power of any population genetic approach. So the suggestion is to make clear in the wording about the claims of selection that these are speculative inferences not based on specific evidence of past action of selection.

Elongation rates are very difficult to assess with our own data. The progressive labeling strategy used here does not incorporate a treatment to synchronize RNA polymerase initiation nor does it directly measure the distribution of RNA polymerases across a gene (our approach integrates across all possible locations), making it hard to calculate region-specific elongation rates across a gene. To the extent that different elongation rates occur within or between genes, we do not expect this to have a very large impact on magnitudes of estimate splicing rates, as long as elongation rates fall within the range of 0.5 kb/min to 4 kb/min (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). We now explicitly acknowledge that different transcriptional elongation rates, or non-uniform rates across a gene, might have an effect on absolute and/or relative measurements of splicing rates in subsection “Measuring rates of splicing for 25,000 <italic>Drosophila</italic> introns”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A related issue is the unstated but important assumption that 4s-U labeling is instantaneous and uniform.

However, as the reviewer notes, most previous literature is in yeast (where 4sU uptake is slow, (Miller et al., 2011)) and mammalian cells (where 4sU uptake is faster). Mammalian cells likely incorporate 4sU in less than a minute (Rädle et al., 2013; Windhager et al., 2012), though the uptake and incorporation rates are thought to be dependent on the concentration of 4sU in the media and the growth conditions of the cell line. <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells are suspension cells, which have increased 4sU uptake efficiency (Windhager et al., 2012), and our data was collected after incubation with a high concentration of 4sU (500 μM). Thus, it is reasonable to expect that 4sU uptake and incorporation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells occurs in less than a minute. Therefore, our assumption that 4sU incorporation is effectively instantaneous may lead to a moderate overestimation of absolute splicing half-lives but is unlikely to have large effects on absolute estimated rates or to impact relative splicing rates between introns. These considerations are now discussed in subsection “Approaches to estimate the rate of mRNA splicing from 4sU-seq data”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The discussion of developmental and stress response genes being enriched for exon definition does not seem complete.

However, we note that in 92% of fly genes, the estimated half-life of the last intron is longer than the expected time to transcribe the last exon (assuming a typical elongation rate of 1.5 kb per minute). Thus, splicing is likely to impact total time for mRNA production in most genes and is likely to be rate limiting for many genes. For some genes 3’ end formation may be rate limiting. We now explicitly acknowledge and discuss these possibilities in paragraph five of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors note that the first introns are often more slowly spliced than subsequent introns.

A main reason for the lighter analysis of this topic is that measuring the splicing rates of alternative introns presents additional modeling challenges with regards assigning intron-exon junction reads. Our modeling of splicing half-lives assumes that intronic reads decay to zero over time, an assumption which is violated for introns alternatively included in S2 cells (our analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> included introns that are alternatively included in other fly tissues but completely spliced in S2 cells). Instead of continuous labeling with 4sU, a pulse-labeling design would better allow one to both calculate the proportion of intron retention or skipped exon inclusion at each time point and to model the assignment of reads to alternative isoforms, an effort which is beyond the scope of the current study. The reviewer is correct that all of the ultra-short introns expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells are intron-defined. However, they are quite slowly spliced as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, likely because the branch points are located suboptimally relative to the 3’ splice sites (too close), leaving little or no space for the polypyrimidine track, as discussed in subsection “Introns 60-70 nt in length are spliced rapidly”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Pai and co-workers investigated genome-wide splicing rates in Drosophila S2 cells and how these rates relate to different modes of splicing (i.e. intron and exon definition).

However, we now explicitly acknowledge that different transcriptional elongation rates, and especially non-uniform rates across a gene, might have an effect on absolute and relative measurements of splicing rates in subsection “Introns 60-70 nt in length are spliced rapidly” of the manuscript. As the reviewer points out, our assumption of a single elongation rate for all genes and across introns in the same gene could create biases that lead to more consistent splicing rates across introns within a gene. To estimate the extent to which our observations of gene-specific splicing rate differences might be affected by this assumption, we randomly sampled a transcription rate between 0.5 kb/min and 4 kb/min independently for each intron and re-analyzed consistency in splicing rates between introns from the same gene. We find that the variance across splicing half-lives of introns from the same gene is still significantly lower than randomly sampled introns, even when varying the transcription rates across introns in the same gene.
