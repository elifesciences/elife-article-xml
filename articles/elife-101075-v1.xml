Its dysregulation is a well-established oncogenic driver in numerous human cancers. The cancer-related function of cyclin D1 has been primarily studied by focusing on the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (RB) gene product. Here, using an integrative approach combining bioinformatic analyses and biochemical experiments, we show that GTSE1 (G-Two and S phases expressed protein 1), a protein positively regulating cell cycle progression, is a previously unrecognized substrate of cyclin D1–CDK4/6 in tumor cells overexpressing cyclin D1 during G1 and subsequent phases. The phosphorylation of GTSE1 mediated by cyclin D1–CDK4/6 inhibits GTSE1 degradation, leading to high levels of GTSE1 across all cell cycle phases. Functionally, the phosphorylation of GTSE1 promotes cellular proliferation and is associated with poor prognosis within a pan-cancer cohort. Our findings provide insights into cyclin D1’s role in cell cycle control and oncogenesis beyond RB phosphorylation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cyclin D1</kwd><kwd>CDK4</kwd><kwd>CDK6</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd><kwd>cullin-RING ligases</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM136250</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pagano</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pagano</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009559</institution-id><institution>Life Sciences Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaisari</surname><given-names>Sharon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GT15758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>González-Robles</surname><given-names>Tania J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM136542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>García-Vázquez</surname><given-names>Nelson</given-names></name><name><surname>González-Robles</surname><given-names>Tania J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaisari</surname><given-names>Sharon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cyclin D1–CDK4/6 phosphorylates GTSE1 in cancer cells, preventing its degradation and sustaining high levels across the cell cycle, which enhances proliferation and correlates with poor prognosis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>D-type cyclins (cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cyclin D3) are activators of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 and represent major oncogenic drivers among members of the cyclin superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Musgrove et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fassl et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Álvarez-Fernández and Malumbres, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behan et al., 2019</xref>).

Moreover, mutations in <italic>CCND1</italic>, which prevent the degradation of cyclin D1 by AMBRA1, a substrate receptor (SR) of a CUL4-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) complex that targets all three D-type cyclins for proteasome-mediated degradation, have been reported in a variety of tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Simoneschi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaikovsky et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martínez-Jiménez et al., 2020</xref>). Deregulation of cellular proliferation, often mediated by uncontrolled CDKs’ activation lies at the heart of cancer as a pathological process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kastan and Bartek, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The biological roles of D-type cyclins have been examined almost exclusively through the lens of E2F transcription regulation upon phosphorylation of the three pocket proteins, RB, p107, and p130. D-type cyclin-mediated phosphorylation of RB results in the inactivation of its tumor suppressive effect by releasing E2F from the RB’s inhibitory effect on gene transcription. Although the regulation of RB by phosphorylation is well understood in both physiology and human tumorigenesis, the cancer-related role of phosphorylation of other substrates is a subject that has remained understudied. In this study, we characterize GTSE1 (G-Two and S phase expressed protein 1) as a previously unidentified substrate of cyclin D1–CDK4/6 in cells overexpressing cyclin D1 in G1 and beyond. GTSE1 is a cell cycle-related protein expressed specifically during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). It interacts with the tumor suppressor p53, and it induces its MDM2-mediated degradation in G2 and during the recovery from DNA damage, promoting cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bublik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Monte et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monte et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collavin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Utrera et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, GTSE1 associates with growing microtubules, promoting cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bendre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scolz et al., 2012</xref>). In prometaphase, GTSE1 becomes highly phosphorylated by CDK1–cyclin B1, resulting in its recruitment to the inner spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Singh et al., 2021</xref>). After anaphase, its dephosphorylation is followed by marked reduction in its abundance in G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collavin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Monte et al., 2000</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that the cyclin D1–CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation of GTSE1 leads to its increased stability in G1 phase, an event that significantly impacts cell proliferation and cancer prognosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>AMBRA1 is an SR of a CUL4-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) complex that targets all three D-type cyclins for proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Simoneschi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaikovsky et al., 2021</xref>). To unveil new substrates of the cyclin D1–CDK4 complex, we performed a comprehensive multi-analysis of published data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). First, we incorporated recent mass spectrometry data that compared the whole proteome of AMBRA1 knockout (KO) clones to parental U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaikovsky et al., 2021</xref>), aiming to pinpoint the top 30 proteins whose levels were elevated in the absence of AMBRA1, the SR of the ubiquitin ligase targeting D-type cyclins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Subsequently, we asked which of these 30 proteins contain a canonical CDK phosphorylation consensus motif [S/T*]PX[K/R], relying on the PhosphoSitePlus database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hornbeck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Finally, this dataset was integrated with findings from a proteomic screen assessing protein abundance fluctuations in the presence or absence of the CDK4/6 inhibitor, Palbociclib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaikovsky et al., 2021</xref>). In summary, our analysis aimed at identifying proteins whose upregulation in AMBRA1 KO cells was counteracted by Palbociclib treatment, thereby filtering for proteins whose augmented abundance is attributed to CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation events when cyclin D1 is stabilized. GTSE1, a cell cycle-regulated protein expressed mainly during the G2 and S phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), emerged as the top hit in these orthogonal analyses. In mitosis GTSE1 is phosphorylated by CDK1–cyclin B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Singh et al., 2021</xref>), but its dephosphorylation at the end of mitosis is followed by marked reduction in its abundance, which remains low during the next G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collavin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Monte et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of GTSE1 as a cyclin D1–CDK4 substrate with prognostic significance in cancer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Differential proteomic profiling of AMBRA1 knockout (KO) U2OS cells compared to parental U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaikovsky et al., 2021</xref>).

This is noteworthy, since, except for acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), GTSE1 expression was higher than that in normal tissue counterparts in all tumor types analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We also assessed the impact of GTSE1 on survival across various cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For context, we compared the survival patterns associated with cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6. Similar to the overexpression of other cell cycle-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Whitfield et al., 2006</xref>), high levels of GTSE1 were found to be prognostically unfavorable across multiple cancer types, presenting a survival pattern similar to that of the cyclin D1–CDK4/6 gene cluster. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, those cancers in which differences in survival are statistically significant were denoted by contour squares.</p><p>Next, we sought to experimentally validate GTSE1 as a putative phosphorylation target of cyclin D1–CDK4. As a first step, we employed transient transfection to introduce in HEK293T various Flag-tagged constructs in the presence or absence of cyclin D1 and CDK4. GTSE1 showed an upper shift in a phos-tag gel when co-expressed with cyclin D1–CDK4, similar to the known substrates p107 and p130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In fact, a slight delay in GTSE1 migration is appreciable even in a regular SDS–PAGE (see first two lanes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The upper shift was not observed in ZC3HAV1, a protein used as negative control. Next, we performed an in vitro phosphorylation assay to directly assess the specificity of GTSE1 phosphorylation by cyclin D1–CDK4. Using purified, recombinant proteins, we subjected GTSE1 to a phosphorylation reaction with cyclin D1–CDK4 and analyzed the products using phos-tag gels. The results confirmed that GTSE1 underwent phosphorylation by cyclin D1–CDK4, but not by ERK1, another Pro-directed kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, the phosphorylation was abolished in the presence of Palbociclib, similar to the pattern observed with RB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C, H</xref>). Then, we asked whether GTSE1 physically interacts with the kinase complex. Overexpression of Flag-tagged cyclin D1 and CDK4 in HEK293T followed by a Flag pull-down demonstrated binding to endogenous GTSE1, similar to the canonical substrate RB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cyclin D1–CDK4 promotes GTSE1 phosphorylation on four serine residues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis following transient transfection of the indicated proteins in HEK293T cells detailing their phosphorylation status via differential mobility in phos-tag gels in the presence or absence of cyclin D1–CDK4 co-expression.

First, we generated a GTSE1 mutant in which Ser262 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was mutated to Ala. Since GTSE1 has additional, conserved serine residues followed by prolines, which could be potential CDK phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), we also generated another sixteen Ser-to-Ala GTSE1 mutants and expressed them in HEK293T cell in the presence or absence of cyclin D1–CDK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). When compared to wild-type GTSE1, two mutants displayed changes in their migrations on phos-tag gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that Ser residues at positions 91 and 724 are sites potentially phosphorylated by cyclin D1–CDK4. PhosphoSitePlus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hornbeck et al., 2015</xref>) reports several high-throughput studies that, in addition to Ser262, identified phosphorylation also at Ser91 and Ser724, supporting our results. To corroborate the loss of cyclin D1–CDK4-dependent phosphorylation at these sites, we constructed a triple mutant (S91A/S262A/S724A). This triple mutant displayed loss of slower-migrating bands relative to wild-type GTSE1, suggesting diminished phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Nevertheless, a residual slow-migrating band persisted, prompting further mutations of the triple GTSE1 mutant in two additional GTSE1 sites (individually), which do not have a CDK-phosphorylation consensus, but were identified in several proteomics studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hornbeck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaulich et al., 2021</xref>). From these two mutants, only the S454A mutation demonstrated a complete abrogation of any shift in phos-tag gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In contrast, a single S454A mutation showed only a minor effect on GTSE1 shift (data not shown). These studies suggest that four major sites (S91, S262, S454, and S724) are phosphorylated (either directly and/or indirectly) in a cyclin D1–CDK4-dependent manner.</p><p>To gain an insight into the cell cycle pattern of GTSE1 abundance and phosphorylation status, we synchronized T98G cells (both parental and AMBRA1 KO pooled clones) by serum starvation followed by serum re-addition. Parental cells displayed a fluctuation in GTSE1 abundance, with low levels in G1 that subsequently increased in S and G2 phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), in agreement with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collavin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Monte et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, in AMBRA1 KO cells, GTSE1 levels were consistently elevated throughout the cell cycle, suggesting that elevated cyclin D1 levels are associated with an increased abundance of GTSE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Additionally, while phosphorylation of GTSE1 in the parental cell line peaked during the G2/M transition (28–32 hr after serum re-addition), AMBRA1 KO cells exhibited sustained phosphorylation of GTSE1 across all cell cycle phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also generated a phospho-specific antibody that recognized GTSE1 only when phosphorylated on Ser262 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Using this antibody, we confirmed the data obtained with phos-tag gel indicating that in cells overexpressing cyclin D1–CDK4 and in AMBRA1 KO cells, GTSE1 is hyper-phosphorylated on Ser262 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we leveraged data from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) to examine the relevance of the identified phosphorylation events in a clinical context. We observed an enrichment of GTSE1 phospho-peptides within a pan-cancer cohort as opposed to adjacent, corresponding normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), underscoring the potential role of GTSE1 phosphorylation in tumorigenesis. Upon analyzing single phosphorylated sites, we found that nine were statistically enriched in cancers. Of these, three sites (S262, S454, and S724) were identified as dependent on cyclin D1–CDK4 in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). (Data on Ser91 are not present in CPTAC.) These results underscore the potential pathophysiological significance of GTSE1 phosphorylation by cyclin D1–CDK4 in cancer.</p><p>Considering GTSE1 being an established target of cyclin B1–CDK1 during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Singh et al., 2021</xref>), we aimed to elucidate the phosphorylation patterns of GTSE1 by various cyclin–CDK complexes operating at distinct cell cycle phases. Wild-type GTSE1 was found to be phosphorylated in HEK293T cells upon overexpression of all cyclin–CDK pairs, with its shifts in phos-tag gels being abolished upon treatment with the corresponding specific CDK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, left panel). However, when the quadruple (S91A/S262A/S454A/S724A) GTSE1 mutant, referred to as ‘Tetra SA’, was expressed in HEK293T cells, cyclin D1–CDK4 was unable to induce any shift, whereas the other three cyclin–CDK pairs still sustained phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, right panel). This suggests a unique phosphorylation profile conferred by cyclin D1–CDK4 in GTSE1, distinct from that induced by other cyclin–CDK complexes.</p><p>We noticed an elevation in endogenous GTSE1 levels in AMBRA1 KO cells compared to the parental line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) in agreement with the findings of the proteomic screen performed in AMBRA1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaikovsky et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A similar increase was observed when overexpressing wild-type cyclin D1 and, even more, an AMBRA1-insensitive, stable mutant of cyclin D1 (T286A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Simoneschi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>), suggesting that the elevated GTSE1 levels are due to high D-type cyclins present in AMBRA1 KO cells. We also used HCT-116 cells harboring an endogenous fusion of AMBRA1 to a minimally constructed Auxin Inducible Degron (mAID) at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yesbolatova et al., 2020</xref>). This system allows for rapid and inducible degradation of AMBRA1 upon addition of auxin, thereby minimizing compensatory cellular rewiring. Again, we observed an increase in GTSE1 levels upon acute ablation of AMBRA1 (i.e., in 8 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In all cases, the upregulation in GTSE1 abundance was rescued upon Palbociclib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>), suggesting that this event was a consequence of increased levels of D-type cyclins. We also conducted cycloheximide (CHX) chase assays in HCT-116 mAID-AMBRA1 cells to assess GTSE1 protein stability and degradation kinetics. The assays revealed that in the context of AMBRA1 depletion, GTSE1 exhibited a prolonged half-life and reduced degradation rate when compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A parallel half-life assessment in parental U2OS cells and two AMBRA1 KO U2OS clones corroborated the finding that GTSE1 is stabilized in the absence of AMBRA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>GTSE1 protein is stabilized upon its phosphorylation by cyclin D1–CDK4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of whole-cell extracts from parental HCT-116 cells, AMBRA1 knockout (KO) HCT-116 cells, and HCT-116 cells expressing either wild-type cyclin D1 or an AMBRA1-insensitive mutant of cyclin D1 (T286A), in the presence or absence of the CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib.

To circumvent the variability of transient transfection, U2OS cells were stably transduced with retroviruses encoding GFP-tagged wild-type GTSE1, Tetra SA (phospho-deficient), or Tetra SD (phospho-mimic). Subsequent CHX chase experiments showed a slower degradation kinetics of the Tetra SD mutant compared to the Tetra SA mutant and wild-type GTSE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>). These stable cell lines, expressing fluorescent GTSE1 variants, were further analyzed via time-lapse microscopy during a CHX chase to quantify protein degradation through the diminishing fluorescence intensity at different times. The Tetra SD mutant exhibited a statistically significant slower fluorescence decrease rate than both Tetra SA and WT, indicating reduced degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we treated U2OS cells with CHX together with inhibitors targeting different degradation systems: MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor), MLN4924 (a CRL inhibitor), or Bafilomycin A (an autophagy inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). The stabilization of GTSE1 in the presence of MG132 and MLN4924, but not Bafilomycin A, indicates that GTSE1 degradation mainly occurs via the ubiquitin–proteasome system, specifically implicating the involvement of a CRL. However, GTSE1 does not appear to be a substrate of CRL4<sup>AMBRA1</sup>, as indicated by the lack of a physical interaction between AMBRA1 and GTSE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), as well as the fact that the stabilization of GTSE1 in AMBRA1 KO cells is secondary to the CDK4/6 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we delved into the potential implications of GTSE1 phosphorylation by the cyclin D1–CDK4 complex.

Amplifications and overexpression of the <italic>CCND1</italic> gene are seen in a diverse array of cancers, with amplifications in up to 15–20% of breast cancers and overexpression in over 50% of mantle cell lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Musgrove et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2012</xref>). The pervasiveness of cyclin D1 dysregulation in cancer highlights the critical need to understand its downstream effects. Despite this, the full spectrum of substrates and their impact on cellular function and oncogenesis has yet to be thoroughly investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaulich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sherr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knudsen and Knudsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Topacio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tchakarska and Sola, 2020</xref>). In the present study, we identified GTSE1, a pro-proliferative protein, as a novel substrate of the cyclin D1–CDK4 complex in tumor cells overexpressing cyclin D1 during G1 and subsequent phases. Our data indicate that cyclin D1–CDK4 is responsible for the phosphorylation of GTSE1 on four residues (S91, S262, S454, and S724). In contrast, cyclin A2–CDK2, cyclin E1–CDK2, and cyclin B1–CDK1 target additional and/or different sites as shown by the fact that they still induced mobility shift of the ‘Tetra SA’ mutant in cultured cells. GTSE1 has been established as a substrate of mitotic cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Singh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Monte et al., 2000</xref>), but we observed that in human cells, when D-type cyclins are stabilized in the absence of AMBRA1, GTSE1 becomes phosphorylated across the various cell cycle phases. Accordingly, overexpression of cyclin D1–CDK4 induce GTSE1 phosphorylation. Thus, we propose that GTSE1 is phosphorylated by CDK4 and CDK6 particularly in pathological states, such as cancers displaying overexpression of D-type cyclins. In turn, GTSE1 phosphorylation induces its stabilization, leading to increased levels that contribute to enhanced cell proliferation. It is also possible that GTSE1 is also recognized in specific cell types and in particular stage/s of embryogenesis, when cyclin D1 levels are elevated, and high cell proliferation is crucial for proper tissue formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ter Huurne and Stunnenberg, 2021</xref>). The prolonged half-life of GTSE1 consequent to cyclin D1–CDK4-mediated phosphorylation suggests a mechanism through which cells could modulate the abundance of a key regulatory protein without necessitating new protein synthesis. This post-translational regulation could be a critical determinant in the rapid response to mitogenic signals or environmental cues.</p><p>Our study further established a correlation between phosphorylation of GTSE1 and markers of cell proliferation, as well as poor prognosis in human cancers, providing a partial explanatory basis for the proliferative phenotype associated with elevated D-type cyclins observed in human tumors. Future studies are warranted to further dissect the molecular mechanisms underpinning GTSE1’s contribution to the cancerous phenotype, potentially paving the way for novel cancer therapeutics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell culture and transduction</title><p>HEK293T, HCT-116, T98G, and U2OS cell lines were cultured under specific conditions suited to each cell type.

CycD-CDK4/6 is a key regulator of the G1/S cell cycle restriction point, which commits cells to enter a new cell cycle. This kinase is also an important therapeutic cancer target by approved drugs including Palbocyclib. Identification of substrates of CycD-CDK4/6 can therefore provide insights into cell cycle regulation and the mechanism of action of cancer therapeutics. A previous study identified GTSE1 as a target of CycB-Cdk1 but this appears to be the first study to address the phosphorylation of the protein by Cdk4/6.</p><p>The authors identified GTSE1 by mining an existing proteomic dataset that are elevated in AMBRA1 knockout cells. The AMBRA1 complex normally targets D cyclins for degradation. From this list they then identified proteins that contain a CDK4/6 consensus phosphorylation site and were responsive to treatment with Palbocyclib.</p><p>The authors show CycD-CDK4/6 overexpression induces a shift in GTSE1 on phostag gels that can be reversed by Palbocyclib. In vitro kinase assays also showed phosphorylation by CDK4. The phosphorylation sites were then identified by mutagenizing the predicted sites and phostag gets to see which eliminated the shift.</p><p>The authors go on to show that phosphorylation of GTSE1 affects the steady state level of the protein. Moreover, they show that expression and phosphorylation of GTSE1 confer growth advantage on tumor cells and correlate with poor prognosis in patients.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The biochemical and mutagenesis evidence presented convincingly show that the GTSE1 protein is indeed a target of the CycD-CDK4 kinase. The follow-up experiments begin to show that the phosphorylation state of the protein affect function and have an impact on patient outcome.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It is not clear at which stage in the cell cycle GTSE1 is being phosphorylated and how this is affecting the cell cycle. Considering that the protein is also phosphorylated during mitosis by CycB-Cdk1, it is unclear which phosphorylation events may be regulating the protein.</p><p>Additional comments for the revised manuscript</p><p>The authors have made many modifications to the manuscript in response to the reviewer comments, including the addition of new data that have clarified some of the conclusions. Some of the questions regarding the phase of the cell cycle affected have been addressed with flow cytometry.</p><p>There is one issue raised in the first review that can be better addressed. As the authors mentioned in their rebuttal letter, all the reviewers and editor concluded from the original manuscript that GTSE1 was being proposed as a physiological target of CycD-Cdk4 even in non-transformed cells. The authors believe that GTSE1 is likely only a target in cancerous cells that overexpress CycD and have made alterations in the abstract and main text making this point more clear.</p><p>Some additional evidence that GTSE1 phosphorylation is occurring in CycD overexpressing tumor cells would strengthen this argument beyond the overexpression experiments presented in the manuscript. For example, in Supplemental Fig 4A of the revised manuscript, bubble plots from CPTAC data is used to show that total protein levels of GTSE1 correlate with proteins associated with proliferation and metastasis. Do levels of GTSE1 correlate with CycD in this data set?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101075.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper identifies GTSE1 as a substrate of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 complexes when cyclin D1 is significantly over-expressed (as is common in cancers) rather than its endogenous level.

is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p><p>In this valuable study, García-Vázquez et al. provide solid evidence suggesting that G2 and S phases expressed protein 1 (GTSE1), is a previously unappreciated non-pocket substrate of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 kinases. To this end, this study holds a promise to significantly contribute to an improved understanding of the mechanisms underpinning cell cycle progression. Notwithstanding these clear strengths of the article, it was thought that the study may benefit from establishing the precise role of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 kinase-dependent GTSE1 phosphorylation in the context of cell cycle progression, …</p></disp-quote><p>We do not claim, as editors and reviewers appear to have interpreted, that GTSE1 is phosphorylated by cyclin D1-CDK4 in the G1 phase of the cell cycle under normal physiologic conditions. Indeed, we agree with the existing literature indicating that in cells that do not express high levels of cyclin D1, GTSE1 is expressed predominantly during S and G2 phase (hence the name GTSE1, which stands for G-Two and S phases expressed protein 1) and is phosphorylated by mitotic cyclins in early mitosis. Even during G1, when the levels of cyclin D1 peak, GTSE1 is not phosphorylated in normal cells. This could be due to either a higher affinity between GTSE1 and mitotic cyclins as compared to D-type cyclins or to a higher concentration of mitotic cyclins compared to D-type cyclins. In the current manuscript, we show that higher levels of cyclin D1 can drive the sustained phosphorylation of GTSE1 across all cell cycle points. To reach this conclusion, we do not rely only on the overexpression of exogenous cyclin D1. In fact, we observe similar effect when we deplete endogenous AMBRA1, resulting in the stabilization of endogenous cyclin D1 in all cell cycle phases (see Figure 2G and Figure supplement 3B). As we had already mentioned in the Discussion section, we propose that GTSE1 is phosphorylated by CDK4 and CDK6 particularly in pathological states, such as cancers displaying overexpression of D-type cyclins (i.e., it is possible that the overexpression overcomes the lower affinity of the cyclin D-GTSE1 complex). In turn, phosphorylation of GTSE1 induces its stabilization, leading to increased levels that, as expected based on the existing literature, contribute to enhanced cell proliferation. So, the role of the cyclin D1-CDK4/6 kinase-dependent GTSE1 phosphorylation is to stabilize GTSE1 independently of the cell cycle. In sum, our study suggests that overexpression of cyclin D1, which is often observed in cancers cells beyond the G1 phase, induces phosphorylation of GTSE1 at all points in the cell cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>… obtaining more direct evidence that cyclin D1-CDK4/6 kinase phosphorylate indicated sites on GTSE1 (e.g., S454) …</p></disp-quote><p>We show that treatment of cells with palbociclib completely abolished the effect of cyclin D1-CDK4 on the GTSE1 shift observed using Phos-tag gels (Figure 2H). Moreover, mutagenesis analysis shows that S91, S262, and S724 are phosphorylated in a cyclin D1-CDK4-dependent manner (Figure 2F and Figure supplement 3A). Compared to wild-type GTSE1, a triple mutant (S91A/S262A/S724A) displayed loss of slower-migrating bands upon co-expression of cyclin D1-CDK4, suggesting diminished phosphorylation. Nevertheless, a residual slow-migrating band persisted, prompting further mutations of the triple GTSE1 mutant in S331 and S454 (individually), which do not have a CDK-phosphorylation consensus, but were identified in several published phospho-proteomics studies. From these two quadruple mutants, only the that containing the S454A mutation demonstrated a complete abrogation of any shift in phos-tagTM gels (Figure 2F). These studies suggest that four major sites (S91, S262, S454, and S724) are phosphorylated (either directly and/or indirectly) in a cyclin D1-CDK4-dependent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>… and mapping a degron in GTSE1 whose function may be blocked by cyclin D1-CDK4/6 kinase-dependent phosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We show that stabilization or overexpression of cyclin D1, which is often observed in human cancers, promotes GTSE1 phosphorylation on S91, S262, S454, and S724, resulting in GTSE1 stabilization. Similarly, a phospho-mimicking mutant with the 4 serine residues replaced with an aspartate at positions 91, 261, 454, and 724 display increased half-life. While we appreciate the editor’s suggestion and agree on these being interesting questions, we would like to respectfully point out that mapping the GTSE1 degron and understanding how it is affected by cyclin D1-CDK4/6-dependent phosphorylation is outside the scope of the current project and will require an extensive set of experiments and tools. Accordingly, the three reviewers did not ask to map the GTSE1 degron. We plan on addressing these interesting questions as part of a follow-up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>García-Vázquez et al. identify GTSE1 as a novel target of the cyclin D1-CDK4/6 kinases. The authors show that GTSE1 is phosphorylated at four distinct serine residues and that this phosphorylation stabilizes GTSE1 protein levels to promote proliferation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors support their findings with several previously published results, including databases. In addition, the authors perform a wide range of experiments to support their findings.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I feel that important controls and considerations in the context of the cell cycle are missing. Cyclin D1 overexpression, Palbociclib treatment and apparently also AMBRA1 depletion can lead to major changes in cell cycle distribution, which could strongly influence many of the observed effects on the cell cycle protein GTSE1. It is therefore important that the authors assess such changes and normalize their results accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have approached the question of GTSE1 phosphorylation to account for potential cell cycle effects from multiple angles:</p><p>(i) We conducted in vitro experiments with purified, recombinant proteins and shown that GTSE1 is phosphorylated by cyclin D1-CDK4 in a cell-free system (Figure 2A-C). These experiments provide direct evidence of GTSE1 phosphorylation by cyclin D1-CDK4 without the influence of any other cell cycle effectors.</p><p>(ii) We present data using synchronized AMBRA1 KO cells (new Figure 2G and Figure supplement 3B). In agreement with what we had shown previously (Simoneschi et al., Nature 2021, PMC8875297), AMBRA1 KO cells progress faster in the cell cycle but they are still synchronized as shown, for example, by the mitotic phosphorylation of Histone H3, peaking at 32 hours after serum readdition like in parental cells. Under these conditions we observed that while phosphorylation of GTSE1 in parental cells is evident in the last two time points, AMBRA1 KO cells exhibited sustained phosphorylation of GTSE1 across all cell cycle phases. This was evident enough when using Phos-tag gels as in the top panel of the old Figure 2G. We now re-run one the biological triplicates of the synchronized cells using higher concentration of Zn<sup>+2</sup>-Phos-tag reagent and lower voltage to allow better separation of the phosphorylated bands. Under these conditions, GTSE1 phosphorylation is better appreciable (top panel of the new Figure 2G). This experiment provides evidence that high levels of cyclin D1 in AMBRA1 KO cells affect GTSE1 phosphorylation independently of the specific points in the cell cycle.</p><p>(iii) The relative short half-life of GTSE1 (&lt;4 hours) makes its levels sensitive to acute treatments such as Palbociclib or acute AMBRA1 depletion. The effects of these treatments on GTSE1 levels are measurable within a time frame too short to significantly affect cell cycle progression. For example, we used cells with fusion of endogenous AMBRA1 to a mini-Auxin Inducible Degron (mAID) at the N-terminus. This system allows for rapid and inducible degradation of AMBRA1 upon addition of auxin, thereby minimizing compensatory cellular rewiring. Again, we observed an increase in GTSE1 levels upon acute ablation of AMBRA1 (i.e., in 8 hours) (Figure 3B), when no significant effects on cell cycle distribution are observed (please see Simoneschi et al., Nature 2021, PMC8875297 and Rona et al., Mol. Cell 2024, PMC10997477).</p><p>Altogether, the above lines of evidence support our conclusion that GTSE1 is a target of cyclin D1-CDK4, independent of cell cycle effects.</p><p>In conclusion, we do not claim that GTSE1 is phosphorylated by cyclin D1-CDK4 in the G1 phase of the cell cycle under normal physiologic conditions. Indeed, we agree with the existing literature indicating that in cells that do not express high levels of cyclin D1, GTSE1 is expressed predominantly during S and G2 phase (hence the name GTSE1, which stands for G-Two and S phases expressed protein 1) and is phosphorylated by mitotic cyclins in early mitosis. Even during G1, when the levels of cyclin D1 peak, GTSE1 is not phosphorylated in normal cells. This could be due to either a higher affinity between GTSE1 and mitotic cyclins as compared to D-type cyclins or to a higher concentration of mitotic cyclins compared to D-type cyclins. In the current manuscript, we show that higher levels of cyclin D1 can drive the sustained phosphorylation of GTSE1 across all cell cycle points. To reach this conclusion, we do not rely only on the overexpression of exogenous cyclin D1. In fact, we observe similar effect when we deplete endogenous AMBRA1, resulting in the stabilization of endogenous cyclin D1 in all cell cycle phases (see Figure 2G and Figure supplement 3B). As we had already mentioned in the Discussion section of the original submission, we propose that GTSE1 is phosphorylated by CDK4 and CDK6 particularly in pathological states, such as cancers displaying overexpression of D-type cyclins (i.e., it is possible that the overexpression overcomes the lower affinity of the cyclin D1-GTSE1 complex). In turn, phosphorylation of GTSE1 induces its stabilization, leading to increased levels that, as expected based on the existing literature, contribute to enhanced cell proliferation. In sum, our study suggests that overexpression of cyclin D1, which is often observed in cancers cells beyond the G1 phase, induces phosphorylation of GTSE1 at all points in the cell cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by García-Vázquez et al identifies the G2 and S phases expressed protein 1(GTSE1) as a substrate of the CycD-CDK4/6 complex. CycD-CDK4/6 is a key regulator of the G1/S cell cycle restriction point, which commits cells to enter a new cell cycle. This kinase is also an important therapeutic cancer target by approved drugs including Palbocyclib. Identification of substrates of CycD-CDK4/6 can therefore provide insights into cell cycle regulation and the mechanism of action of cancer therapeutics. A previous study identified GTSE1 as a target of CycB-Cdk1 but this appears to be the first study to address the phosphorylation of the protein by Cdk4/6.</p><p>The authors identified GTSE1 by mining an existing proteomic dataset that is elevated in AMBRA1 knockout cells. The AMBRA1 complex normally targets D cyclins for degradation. From this list, they then identified proteins that contain a CDK4/6 consensus phosphorylation site and were responsive to treatment with Palbocyclib.</p><p>The authors show CycD-CDK4/6 overexpression induces a shift in GTSE1 on phostag gels that can be reversed by Palbocyclib. In vitro kinase assays also showed phosphorylation by CDK4. The phosphorylation sites were then identified by mutagenizing the predicted sites and phostag got to see which eliminated the shift.</p><p>The authors go on to show that phosphorylation of GTSE1 affects the steady state level of the protein. Moreover, they show that expression and phosphorylation of GTSE1 confer a growth advantage on tumor cells and correlate with poor prognosis in patients.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The biochemical and mutagenesis evidence presented convincingly show that the GTSE1 protein is indeed a target of the CycD-CDK4 kinase. The follow-up experiments begin to show that the phosphorylation state of the protein affects function and has an impact on patient outcomes.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It is not clear at which stage in the cell cycle GTSE1 is being phosphorylated and how this is affecting the cell cycle. Considering that the protein is also phosphorylated during mitosis by CycB-Cdk1, it is unclear which phosphorylation events may be regulating the protein.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see point (ii) and the last paragraph in the response to Reviewer #1. Moreover, we show that, compared to the amino acids phosphorylated by cyclin D1-CDK4, cyclin B1-CDK1 phosphorylates GTSE1 on either additional residues or different sites (Figure 2H). We also show that expression of a phospho-mimicking GTSE1 mutant leads to accelerated growth and an increase in the cell proliferative index (Figure 4B,C and new Figure supplement 4D-E). Finally, we have evaluated also the cell cycle distributions by flow cytometry (new Figure supplement 4F). These analyses show that the expression of a phospho-mimicking GTSE1 mutant induces a decrease in the percentage of cells in G1 and an increase in the percentage of cells in S, similarly to what observed in AMBRA1 KO cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (public review)</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper identifies GTSE1 as a potential substrate of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 and shows that GTSE1 correlates with cancer prognosis, probably through an effect on cell proliferation. The main problem is that the phosphorylation analysis relies on the over-expression of cyclin D1. It is unclear if the endogenous cyclin D1 is responsible for any phosphorylation of GTSE1 in vivo, and what, if anything, this moderate amount of GTSE1 phosphorylation does to drive proliferation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>There are few bonafide cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 substrates identified to be important in vivo so GTSE1 represents a potentially important finding for the field. Currently, the only cyclin D1 substrates involved in proliferation are the Rb family proteins.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main weakness is that it is unclear if the endogenous cyclin D1 is responsible for phosphorylating GTSE1 in the G1 phase. For example, in Figure 2G there doesn't seem to be a higher band in the phos-tag gel in the early time points for the parental cells. This experiment could be redone with the addition of palbociclib to the parental to see if there is a reduction in GTSE1 phosphorylation and an increase in the amount in the G1 phase as predicted by the authors' model. The experiments involving palbociclib do not disentangle cell cycle effects. Adding Cdk4 inhibitors will progressively arrest more and more cells in the G1 phase and so there will be a reduction not just in Cdk4 activity but also in Cdk2 and Cdk1 activity. More experiments, like the serum starvation/release in Figure 2G, with synchronized populations of cells would be needed to disentangle the cell cycle effects of palbociclib treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see last paragraph in the response to Reviewer #1. Concerning the experiments involving palbociclib, we limited confounding effects on the cell cycle by treating cells with palbociclib for only 4-6 hours. Under these conditions, there is simply not enough time for S and G2 cells to arrest in G1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear if GTSE1 drives the G1/S transition. Presumably, this is part of the authors' model and should be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not claiming that GTSE1 drives the G1/S transition (please see last paragraph in the response to Reviewer #1). GTSE1 is known to promote cell proliferation, but how it performs this task is not well understood. Our experiments indicate that, when overexpressed, cyclin D1 promotes GTSE1 phosphorylation and its consequent stabilization. In agreement with the literature, we show that higher levels of GTSE1 promote cell proliferation. To measure cell cycle distribution upon expressing various forms of GTSE1, we have now performed FACS analyses (new Figure supplement 4F). These analyses show that the expression of a phospho-mimicking GTSE1 mutant induces a decrease in the percentage of cells in G1 and an increase in the percentage of cells in S, similarly to what observed in AMBRA1 KO cells shown in the same panel and in Simoneschi et al. (Nature 2021, PMC8875297).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The proliferation assays need to be more quantitative. Figure 4B should be plotted on a log scale so that the slope can be used to infer the proliferation rate of an exponentially increasing population of cells. Figure 4c should be done with more replicates and error analysis since the effects shown in the lower right-hand panel are modest.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4B, we plotted data in a linear scale as done in the past (Donato et al. Nature Cell Biol. 2017, PMC5376241) to better underline the changes in total cell number overtime. The experiments in Figure 4B were performed in triplicate, statistical significance was determined using unpaired T-tests with p-values&lt;0.05, and error bars represent the mean +/- SEM. In Figure 4C, error analysis was not included for simplicity, given the complexity of the data. We have now included the other two sets of experiments (new Figure supplement 4D,E). While the effects shown in the lower right-hand panel of Figure 4C are modest, they demonstrate the same trend as those observed in the AMBRA KO cells (Figure 4C and Simoneschi et al., Nature 2021, PMC8875297). It's important to note that this effect is achieved through the stable expression of a single phospho-mimicking protein, whereas AMBRA KO cells exhibit changes in numerous cell cycle regulators. Moreover, these effects are obtained by growing cells in culture for only 5 days. A similar impact on cell growth in vivo over an extended period could pose significant risks in the long term.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Figure 1E is referenced before 1D.
