Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) by phosphorylating the mTOR-regulating protein Raptor at Ser<sup>791</sup> following β-adrenergic stimulation. The objective of these studies is to test whether GLP-1R agonists similarly stimulate mTORC1 via PKA phosphorylation of Raptor at Ser<sup>791</sup> and whether this contributes to the weight loss effect of the therapeutic GLP-1R agonist liraglutide. We measured phosphorylation of the mTORC1 signaling target ribosomal protein S6 in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells expressing GLP-1R (CHO-Glp1r) treated with liraglutide in combination with PKA inhibitors. We also assessed liraglutide-mediated phosphorylation of the PKA substrate RRXS*/T* motif in CHO-Glp1r cells expressing Myc-tagged wild-type (WT) Raptor or a PKA-resistant (Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala) Raptor mutant. Finally, we measured the body weight response to liraglutide in WT mice and mice with a targeted knock-in of PKA-resistant Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor. Liraglutide increased phosphorylation of S6 and the PKA motif in WT Raptor in a PKA-dependent manner but failed to stimulate phosphorylation of the PKA motif in Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor in CHO-Glp1r cells. Lean Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor knock-in mice were resistant to liraglutide-induced weight loss but not setmelanotide-induced (melanocortin-4 receptor-dependent) weight loss. Diet-induced obese Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor knock-in mice were not resistant to liraglutide-induced weight loss; however, there was weight-dependent variation such that there was a tendency for obese Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor knock-in mice of lower relative body weight to be resistant to liraglutide-induced weight loss compared to weight-matched controls. Together, these findings suggest that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Raptor at Ser<sup>791</sup> contributes to liraglutide-induced weight loss.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glucagon-like peptide-1</kwd><kwd>mechanistic target of rapamycin</kwd><kwd>raptor</kwd><kwd>protein kinase A</kwd><kwd>body weight</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK097361</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ayala</surname><given-names>Julio E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK116625</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Sheila</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD028455</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ayala</surname><given-names>Julio E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK132852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ayala</surname><given-names>Julio E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ability of the therapeutic glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide to promote weight loss is partly dependent on signaling via PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the mTORC1 regulator protein Raptor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP-1R) agonists reduce food intake and body weight and are approved for weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drucker, 2022</xref>). Elucidating the mechanisms through which GLP-1R agonists regulate body weight could enhance the therapeutic potential of these compounds or identify novel targets for anti-obesity drug development. We have shown that the GLP-1R agonist Exendin-4 (Ex4) stimulates mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Complex-1 (mTORC1) signaling and that inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) with rapamycin blocks the anorectic effect induced by Ex4 in this nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burmeister et al., 2017</xref>). The present studies aim to define the mechanism(s) by which GLP-1R agonism stimulates mTORC1 signaling and reduces body weight.</p><p>mTOR is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that forms two complexes: mTORC1 and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). The rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1 has unique accessory proteins including Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR). mTORC1 activity is stimulated by growth factors, nutrients, and hormones by promoting PI3K/Akt-mediated phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). Activation of mTORC1 by GLP-1R agonists seemed unlikely since the GLP-1R is a G<sub>α</sub>s-coupled receptor that signals via protein kinase A (PKA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thorens, 1992</xref>). However, activation of the G<sub>α</sub>s-coupled β-adrenergic receptor stimulates mTORC1 via Raptor phosphorylation by PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that GLP-1R activation can similarly stimulate mTORC1 via PKA phosphorylation of Raptor.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that GLP-1R activation induces mTORC1 signaling and Raptor phosphorylation in a PKA-dependent manner and show that this contributes to weight loss by the therapeutic GLP-1R agonist liraglutide. This reveals a novel weight-lowering GLP-1R-PKA-mTORC1 axis and broadly suggests that other G<sub>α</sub>s-coupled receptors may use this PKA-mTORC1 pathway for certain biological responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GLP-1R agonists activate mTORC1 in a PKA-dependent manner</title><p>Similar to Ex4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burmeister et al., 2017</xref>), liraglutide increases phosphorylation of the mTORC1 signaling target ribosomal protein S6 in CHO-GLP-1R cells, and this is blocked by the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, H89 has some off-target effects including inhibiting the S6 kinase p70S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 2000</xref>), likely explaining why H89 inhibits S6 phosphorylation by insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). KT5720, a PKA inhibitor with minimal off-target effects on p70S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 2000</xref>), also reduces liraglutide- and forskolin-induced phosphorylation of S6 and the PKA target CREB in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Neither dose of KT5720 affected S6 phosphorylation by insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Two doses of the pan-Akt inhibitor MK-2206 that block insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation did not affect stimulation of mTORC1 activity by liraglutide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Given the complexity of signaling mechanisms downstream of the GLP-1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fletcher et al., 2016</xref>), assigning specific pathways to a desirable phenotype could be leveraged towards more effective weight loss therapeutics.</p><p>To our knowledge, our study is the first to describe a PKA-mTORC1 interaction and its physiological relevance in the context of GLP-1R signaling. PKA is reported to either stimulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) or inhibit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jewell et al., 2019</xref>) mTORC1 activity. Similar to our study, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) show PKA-mediated stimulation of mTORC1 in cells incubated in serum-free media. This contrasts with inhibition of mTORC1 in cells cultured in serum-supplemented media reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jewell et al., 2019</xref>. Since mTORC1 is a cellular energy sensor, PKA exerts differential actions on mTORC1 depending on nutrient availability or cellular signaling and energy status, as originally shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scott and Lawrence, 1998</xref> demonstrating that forskolin inhibits insulin-stimulated S6 phosphorylation and also subsequently shown by Liu and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In vivo results using novel PKA-resistant Raptor knockin mice suggest that PKA phosphorylation of Raptor contributes to the weight loss effect of liraglutide in lean but not in obese mice. One limitation of these in vivo studies is that PKA-resistant Raptor is expressed in all tissues. Loss of PKA phosphorylation of Raptor in one or multiple tissues may contribute to our observation that CMV-Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala mice gained significantly more weight on the HFD compared to control mice. This difference in starting body weight could explain why liraglutide-induced weight loss was not attenuated in obese CMV-Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala mice, as in lean mice, since heavier mice tend to be more responsive to liraglutide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This could offset any reduction in liraglutide responsiveness resulting from expression of PKA-resistant Raptor. We support this by showing that CMV-Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala mice with lower initial body weights display a tendency towards reduced responsiveness to liraglutide. Future studies will circumvent the limitations of the CMV-Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala model by introducing the Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala mutation to specific tissues/cell types that specifically mediate liraglutide-induced weight loss. The brain is a key target for the weight-lowering effects of GLP-1R agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sisley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Varin et al., 2019</xref>). Regulation of energy balance by mTORC1 appears to be most critical in hypothalamic regions such as the arcuate (ARC), paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH), VMH, and suprachiasmatic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cota et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inhoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Proulx et al., 2008</xref>), where the GLP-1R is highly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jensen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cork et al., 2015</xref>). The ARC mediates weight loss effects of liraglutide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Secher et al., 2014</xref>) and is engaged by systemic liraglutide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Salinas et al., 2018</xref>). Hindbrain regions are also engaged by systemic liraglutide and mediate its weight-lowering effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Salinas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fortin et al., 2020</xref>). Inhibition of PKA attenuates the anorectic effect of hindbrain-targeted Ex4 in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayes et al., 2011</xref>). Future studies expressing Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor in a brain region/cell-type specific manner will enable identification of neuronal population(s) where a PKA-mTORC1 interaction mediates the anorectic effect of GLP-1R agonists.</p><p>The observation that CMV-Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor knock-in mice were not resistant to the weight loss effect of the MC4R agonist setmelanotide suggests that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Raptor at Ser<sup>791</sup> is not a general mechanism for all G<sub>α</sub>s-coupled receptor-targeting weight loss drugs. However, as with our results using liraglutide in HFD-fed mice, a caveat to interpreting our findings with setmelanotide is the use of the whole-body CMV-Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala mouse model. Since the weight loss effect of setmelanotide is primarily mediated via activation of the MC4R in the PVH, future studies will test the hypothesis that the weight loss effect of setmelanotide will be blunted in PVH MC4R-specific Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor knock-in mice. This could establish a role for PKA-mediated regulation of mTORC1 as a key mechanism for weight loss along an ARC (target of GLP-1R agonists)-PVH (target of MC4R agonists) axis.</p><p>Our results suggest that liraglutide does not regulate mTORC1 via Akt, as was observed for βAR signaling in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Inhibition of Akt activity in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rupprecht et al., 2013</xref>) or hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yang et al., 2017</xref>) attenuates the anorectic effect of Ex4, so identifying targets of Akt mediating the effects of GLP-1R agonists requires further study. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is also implicated in the metabolic actions of GLP-1R agonists. Studies from our lab and others show that GLP-1R agonists reduce food intake by inhibiting AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burmeister et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burmeister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sandoval et al., 2012</xref>). Since AMPK suppresses mTORC1 by phosphorylating TSC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inoki et al., 2003</xref>) or Raptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gwinn et al., 2008</xref>), GLP-1R activation could stimulate mTORC1 by reducing AMPK activity. AMPK can also be inhibited by mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dagon et al., 2012</xref>), so GLP-1R-mediated inhibition of AMPK may be downstream of mTORC1.</p><p>In summary, we have uncovered a novel signaling mechanism downstream of the GLP-1R characterized by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Raptor and increased mTORC1 signaling that contributes to the weight-lowering effect of liraglutide. Given the variability in response and adverse effects (e.g. nausea) of current GLP-1-based drugs, the identification of therapeutically relevant signaling profiles downstream of the GLP-1R holds promise for improving efficacy and reducing side effects of these drugs. Furthermore, our findings provide a new framework for future investigations into the significance of the PKA-mTORC1 interaction to other beneficial metabolic effects of GLP-1R agonists. GLP-1R agonists continue to be used as glucose-lowering agents for type 2 diabetes based on their insulinotropic effect via pancreatic β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drucker, 2022</xref>). The PKA-mTORC1 interaction could contribute to this or another β-cell phenotype associated with GLP-1R agonists (e.g. proliferation/cytoprotection). Furthermore, GLP-1R agonists also display cardioprotective effects that could be mediated directly via effects on the heart and vasculature and/or be secondary to the ability of these drugs to improve glycemia, body weight, lipid profiles, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ussher and Drucker, 2023</xref>). This provides an opportunity to investigate whether the PKA-mTORC1 interaction contributes to the cardioprotective effects of GLP-1R agonists via direct or indirect mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Chinese Hamster Ovary cells expressing human GLP-1R (CHO-GLP-1R; DiscoveRx, Fremont, CA) were maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2, humidified) in Ham’s F12 media containing 10 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, and 1 mM glutamine (Cat#11765054, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Cat#16140071, Gibco), 10 ml/l penicillin-streptomycin (Cat#91, Hyclone), and 0.8 mg/ml Geneticin G418 Sulfate (Cat#10131027, Gibco). β-TC3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Efrat et al., 1988</xref>) were gifted by Dr. Richard O’Brien and cultured in DMEM media containing 25 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, and 1 mM glutamine (Cat#11995065, Gibco) supplemented with 15% FBS, 2% horse serum (Cat#26050088, Gibco) and 10 ml/l penicillin-streptomycin.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Daniela Cota (Reviewer #2); Hongxia Ren (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the paper has potential, but the authors will need to provide substantial new data to answer the reviewers' concerns.</p><p>1) Specifically, provide a comprehensive characterization of the mouse model in addition to the studies provided.</p><p>2) Demonstrate specificity of the weight-loss effects to GPCR-PKA signaling.</p><p>3) Provide a more comprehensive analysis of the changes in energy expenditure and provide a more comprehensive metabolic phenotyping (insulin levels etc).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. While I understand that the authors intend to publish a full characterization of the model elsewhere, it is impossible to evaluate the results of this manuscript without some information on the genetics of the model, and some data showing the expression of the mutant, however. The authors could add some more detail about the mouse model to this manuscript and send the manuscript describing the model in more detail for the reviewers to examine.</p><p>2. The authors should examine the normal regulation of feeding/body weight by non-GPCR-dependent agents (e.g., leptin, GDF15, or many others). They would want to examine the effects of these on PKA/pS6 in cultured cells, as well.</p><p>3. The authors should provide direct comparisons of the various conditions, rather than normalizing to individual baseline measurements.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors claim that the difference in efficacy in weight loss in WT vs raptor mutants treated with Liraglutide is due to a very minor difference in food intake during the second day of treatment. By looking at the data, the sustained weight difference cannot be due to a very transitory difference in food intake, which by the end of the treatment has become comparable to the food intake of vehicle-treated mice. Authors should investigate changes in energy expenditure.</p><p>2. Related to the above, previously published evidence suggests that central GLP1R agonism stimulates thermogenesis by recruiting the sympathetic nervous system (see Kooijman et al., Diabetologia 2015). It would be relevant to assess whether recruitment of the SNS is impaired in the Raptor mutant mice under liraglutide treatment. Authors could assess molecular changes for SNS markers and markers of increased thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue and in the white adipose tissue. Authors could also assess possible differences in cold-induced SNS activity in their model.</p><p>3. It is unclear why the authors did not test the relevance of their observations by inducing diet-induced obesity in their mouse model. Does the raptor mutant have a specific phenotype under diet-induced obesity?</p><p>4. Liraglutide importantly impacts glucose metabolism. Here the authors show that 2-weeks Liraglutide treatment decreases fasting glucose levels independent of genotype. The authors however do not provide any information neither on insulin levels or on insulin sensitivity in their animal model. The mTOR pathway (including raptor) is an important funneling site of the molecular action of insulin. The fact that fasting glucose is decreased similarly in WT and mutant mice, does not preclude possible changes in fasting insulin or during dynamic tests (insulin tolerance tests).</p><p>5. Statistical analyses carried out in figure 3 do not consider as independent factors the treatment and the genotype. Authors need to carry out 2-way anovas. Only if there is an interaction, the authors can conclude that for instance the total body mass (Figure 3C) or fat mass (Figure 3E) is different between liraglutide-treated WT and mutant mice.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Activation Stimulates PKA-Mediated Phosphorylation of Raptor and this Contributes to the Weight Loss Effect of Liraglutide&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

As now shown in Figure 3K-N, along with a more rapid rebound in food intake in the Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor mutant mice during liraglutide treatment, these mutants also display reduced energy expenditure relative to vehicle-treated mice that lasts for a longer duration during the liraglutide treatment period than in wild-type mice. We hypothesize that both of these phenotypes contribute to the relative resistance to liraglutide-induced weight loss in the Raptor mutant mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

As shown by our results in Figure 3 and studies conducted by other groups (Baggio LL et al. <italic>Gastroenterology</italic> 2004; Knauf C et al. <italic>Endocrionology</italic> 2008) GLP-1R agonist administration actually lowers energy expenditure even in wild-type mice. However, our data do suggest that the duration of liraglutide-mediated reduction of energy expenditure is greater in the Raptor mutant knock-in mice compared to control mice, even though there is no significant difference in absolute energy expenditure between genotypes. One potential interpretation of this is that mechanisms that could contribute to restoring energy expenditure (e.g. thermogenesis) are activated in control mice, but this is impaired in the Raptor mutant knock-in mice. This is a hypothesis that would be better tested in tissue-specific Raptor mutant knock-in mice since this would avoid confounding effects of impaired PKA-mediated regulation of Raptor in multiple tissues (e.g., impaired PKA-Raptor signaling in adipose tissue).</p><p>The reviewer does raise an interesting point about whether Raptor signaling downstream of the GLP-1R my play a role in the response to cold exposure. However, testing this is beyond the scope of the present studies that focus on body weight control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is unclear why the authors did not test the relevance of their observations by inducing diet-induced obesity in their mouse model. Does the raptor mutant have a specific phenotype under diet-induced obesity?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point raised by the reviewer, and it is something that we will be testing with tissue/cell-type specific Raptor mutant mice. The concern with using high fat diet-induced obesity with the whole-body Raptor mutant line is that high fat diet may provoke secondary phenotypes in this global mouse line even prior to liraglutide treatment that would complicate interpretation of results from liraglutide treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Like the Glp1r, the MC4R is a G<sub>α</sub>s-coupled receptor, so this provides a valuable comparison to the Glp1r. As we now show in the new Figure 5, unlike what we observed with liraglutide, CMV-Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor knockin mice are not resistant to the weight loss effect of setmelanotide. This suggests that the phosphorylation of Raptor by PKA at Ser-791 does not contribute to the weight loss effect of all G<sub>α</sub>s -coupled receptor agonists equally. These results are also described in the Results section (lines 141-152) and in the Discussion (lines 193-202).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have only partly addressed the concerns of this reviewer.</p><p>In particular, although already pointed out by this reviewer, the authors have decided to not carry out studies under diet-induced obesity.

As shown in the new Figure 4, unlike the results obtained in lean mice, obese CMV-Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor knockin mice were not resistant to the weight loss effect of liraglutide. However, it must be noted that the CMVSer<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor knockin mice had significantly higher body weight and adiposity following the HFD exposure prior to any treatment (Figure 4C and 4E). It has been our experience that mice with higher starting body weight and adiposity tend to lose more weight in response to liraglutide. We support this with additional data in new Figure 4—figure supplement 1 showing a positive correlation between initial body weight and liraglutide-induced weight loss. This could offset any attenuation of the liraglutide effect in the CMV-Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor knockin mice. Therefore, we determined the average baseline body weight of all mice prior to liraglutide treatments (43.4g) and divided results into those from mice with baseline body weights above 43.4g and those with baseline body weights below 43.4g. We show that there is no difference in the weight loss effect of liraglutide between wild-type and CMV-Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor knockin mice that have and average baseline body weight above 43.4 g (Figure 4I, 4J); however, there is a tendency for the CMV-Ser<sup>791</sup>Ala Raptor knockin mice to be resistant to the weight loss effect of liraglutide when looking at mice whose baseline body weights are below 43.4g. These findings suggest that PKA phosphorylation of Raptor at Ser-791 may contribute to the weight loss effect of liraglutide in obese mice below a specific weight threshold. Results are described in the Results section (lines 121-140) and in the Discussion (lines 171-183).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have made an effort to address the reviewers' comments.
