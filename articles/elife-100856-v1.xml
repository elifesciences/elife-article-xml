neurons represent the key output cells of the neural network controlling mammalian fertility. We used GCaMP fiber photometry to record the population activity of the GnRH neuron distal projections in the ventral arcuate nucleus where they merge before entering the median eminence to release GnRH into the portal vasculature. Recordings in freely behaving intact male and female mice revealed abrupt ~8 min duration increases in activity that correlated perfectly with the appearance of a subsequent pulse of luteinizing hormone (LH). The GnRH neuron dendrons also exhibited a low level of unchanging clustered, rapidly fluctuating baseline activity in males and throughout the estrous cycle in females. In female mice, a gradual increase in basal activity that exhibited ~80 min oscillations began in the afternoon of proestrus and lasted for 12 hr. This was associated with the onset of the LH surge that ended several hours before the fall in the GCaMP signal. Abrupt 8 min duration episodes of GCaMP activity continued to occur on top of the rising surge baseline before ceasing in estrus. These observations provide the first description of GnRH neuron activity in freely behaving animals. They demonstrate that three distinct patterns of oscillatory activity occur in GnRH neurons. These are comprised of low-level rapid baseline activity, abrupt 8 min duration oscillations that drive pulsatile gonadotropin secretion, and, in females, a gradual and very prolonged oscillating increase in activity responsible for the preovulatory LH surge.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GnRH</kwd><kwd>pulse</kwd><kwd>surge</kwd><kwd>in vivo</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/212242</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herbison</surname><given-names>Allan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P1ZHP1_184166</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jae-Chang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

This was soon followed by an appreciation that GnRH neurons had a very unusual topography in which cell bodies scattered throughout the basal forebrain sent projections that converged on the median eminence to release GnRH into the portal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barry, 1979</xref>). The quest to understand the patterns of GnRH released into the portal system was largely solved by the portal bleeding approach in sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clarke and Cummins, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caraty and Locatelli, 1988</xref>). Notably, this revealed that abrupt increments of GnRH secretion evoked pulsatile gonadotropin secretion whereas, in females, prolonged increases in constant or episodic GnRH secretion were responsible for the preovulatory LH surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karsch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clarke, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Establishing the activity patterns of GnRH neurons in vivo has been hampered considerably by their widely dispersed topography and, five decades on, remains an elusive goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herbison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Constantin, 2017</xref>). The development of transgenic GnRH-GFP mouse lines greatly facilitated efforts to record the electrical properties of individual GnRH neurons in the acute brain slice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Constantin et al., 2021a</xref>). However, the patterns of firing exhibited by GnRH neurons under these conditions did not align well with predicted pulse or surge patterns of GnRH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herbison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Constantin et al., 2021b</xref>). In particular, the only report of GnRH neuron firing in vivo to date described a range of irregular firing patterns inconsistent with known hormone secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Constantin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The episodic pattern of GnRH secretion driving pulsatile LH release is generated by the intermittent synchronised activity of the arcuate kisspeptin neuron population that projects to and controls the distal processes of GnRH neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herbison, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goodman et al., 2022</xref>). These processes, termed dendrons in rodents, converge in the ventrolateral aspects of the arcuate nucleus (ARN) before turning into short axons that run into the median eminence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herbison, 2021</xref>). The GnRH neuron dendron appears to operate as an autonomous site for GnRH pulse secretion whilst also carrying action potentials driving the GnRH surge that are initiated upstream at the level of the GnRH neuron cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herbison, 2020</xref>).</p><p>We have previously documented that the expression of GCaMP in GnRH neuron cell bodies and dendrons can be used to faithfully record GnRH neuron electrical activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iremonger et al., 2017</xref>). As the ventrolateral ARN provides a unique location of concentrated GnRH neuron dendrons, we reasoned that it may be possible to record their activity in freely behaving mice at this location using GCaMP fiber photometry. We demonstrate that this is indeed possible and describe here the patterns of GnRH neuron activity underlying episodic and surge patterns of hormone secretion in male and female mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of Gnrh1-GCaMP mouse</title><p>The <italic>Gnrh1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mouse line (JAX stock #021207) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoon et al., 2005</xref>) was crossed with the Ai162 (TIT2L-GC6s-ICL-tTA2)-D Cre-dependent GCaMP6s line (JAX stock #031562) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>) to generate Gnrh1-GCaMP6 mice.

Therefore, we assessed the relationship of GnRH neuron dSEs to LH pulses by taking 5- to 10 min tail-tip blood samples for up to 240 min periods while monitoring GCaMP fluorescence. This showed a perfect association between dSE occurrence and LH pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Analysis of the temporal relationship between dSEs and LH pulses revealed that the peak of dSE consistently preceded LH pulses by 5.0 ± 0.9 min (N=6 episodes in 5 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>GnRH neuron activity in female mice</title><p>To examine patterns of GnRH neuron activity across the estrous cycle, female Gnrh1-GCaMP6 mice were recorded for 6 hr periods between 10 am-4 pm on each day of the cycle determined by vaginal cytology on the morning of the recording. Similar to males, freely behaving female mice exhibited a variable baseline pattern of high-frequency activity upon which intermittent, abrupt increases in GCaMP signal occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Each dSE had a total duration of ~8 min (463 ± 22 s) with a rapid increase (FWHM 31 ± 3 s) and a slower decline (FWHM 81 ± 6 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The frequency of dSEs varied across the cycle in the same manner as kisspeptin neuron SEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>) with a dramatic slowing during estrus (dSE interval of 151.0 ± 35.3 min; p=0.01 vs diestrus and 0.001 vs proestrus, Dunn’s posthoc; n=5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The inter-dSE intervals for metestrus, diestrus, and proestrus were not significantly different with mean ± SEM of 70.2 ± 6.7 min (n=8), 46.2 ± 4.2 min (n=8), and 38.8 ± 3.4 min (n=6), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The pattern of the inter-peak interval distribution of dSEs interval was determined in each estrous cycle. In all cycles, the distribution pattern failed the normality test (metestrus [W=0.92, p=0.0007], diestrus [W=0.88, p&lt;0.0001], proestrus [W=0.92, p=0.0007], estrus [W=0.94, p=0.03]). In metestrus, diestrus, and proestrus, the distribution was right-skewed (skewness = 0.83, 1.37, and 1.13, respectively) with diestrus showing the most pronounced skew (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.Aii). In metestrus, most dSEs occurred within an interval range of 46–55 min (17.5%), while in diestrus and proestrus, the most frequent range was 16–25 min (26.0% and 25.0%, respectively)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The kurtosis values were –0.22, 2.01, 1.84, and –0.41 in metestrus, diestrus, proestrus and estrus, respectively. A kurtosis of 3.0 indicates normally distributed data, suggesting that the inter-peak intervals in diestrus and proestrus have a moderate peak, while the negative kurtosis values of estrus in particular indicate a flatter and broader distribution.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron dendron activity in female mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative example of 6 hr GCaMP6 photometry recordings from a female mice in (<bold>i</bold>) metestrus, (ii) diestrus, (iii) proestrus, and (iv) estrus.

A gradual increase in baseline activity was observed to begin 4.0 ± 0.5 hr (range 2–6.5 hr) before ‘lights-off’ (19:00 hr, 12:12 lighting) that peaked 5.9 ± 0.5 hr later and declined to baseline by 12.6 ± 0.8 hr (range: 10.3–15.0 hr)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The FWHM period of incline and decline of this slow activity was 3.1 ± 0.4 and 4.7 ± 0.5 hr, respectively. The slow increment in calcium signal was not smooth but consisted of multiple slow oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The mean duration of these slow oscillations was 78 ± 4 min (range 32–150 min). In addition, dSEs were observed to occur superimposed upon the slow oscillating signal until around the time of the peak at which time they stopped for several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similar duration 24 hr recordings from metestrus-diestrous female mice recorded the presence of dSEs without any baseline shifts.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Slow oscillating increases in calcium activity on the afternoon of proestrus in female mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Examples of 21 h GCaMP recordings from four proestrous female mice.

This showed that the LH surge began at the time of baseline GCaMP change and peaked at 9.3 ± 2.8 ng/ml close to when baseline GCaMP level was at its highest (ΔF/F of 20–40%) (n=4). Notably, GCaMP activity greatly outlasted the duration of the LH surge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>To clarify the different components of GCaMP activity occurring on proestrus, we used a customized Matlab code to separate out the three signals occurring at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). First, a 30 min rolling average was used to extract the slow oscillatory rise and decline in GCaMP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6ii</xref>). The subtraction of this ‘surge signal’ from the original signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) shows the stereotypical dSEs and baseline fluctuations more clearly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6iii</xref>). Next, the peaks of individual dSEs were selected, and the signals from 60 s before and 360 s after each peak of dSE were extracted.

This includes a baseline of high-frequency cluster-like activity upon which abrupt ~8 min episodes occur in both males and females, and a prolonged, slowly oscillating rise in activity on the evening of proestrus in females. These patterns of GnRH neuron activity are sufficient to explain the pulse and surge patterns of LH secretion in females and pulses in males.</p><p>We demonstrate that the GCaMP fiber photometry approach used previously for assessing cell body population activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>) can be adapted to assess activity in neuronal processes. This has been greatly facilitated by the unusual topography of the GnRH neurons that results in the GnRH neuron projections becoming highly concentrated in the ventrolateral ARN before passing into the ME. The dendrons in this area display substantial rises in intracellular calcium in response to propagating action potentials as well as to the local application of kisspeptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iremonger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). The locations of successful optic fibers immediately above and sometimes lateral to the ARN make it very unlikely that recordings were made of GnRH neuron activity at the level of their terminals within the ME.</p><p>The GnRH neuron dendrons exhibited clustered high-frequency (approximately 0.01 Hz) baseline activity that did not change in profile across 24 hr in males or throughout the estrous cycle. This would be predicted to give rise to fluctuating, low-level inter-pulse GnRH secretion perhaps compatible with observations made using high-frequency portal sampling in the ewe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 1995</xref>). High-frequency dopamine release also occurs within the ME between events determining prolactin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Romanò et al., 2017</xref>). The physiological significance of inter-pulse GnRH release at the gonadotroph is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le Tissier et al., 2017</xref>). While the self-priming action of GnRH at the gonadotroph is well characterized for the surge, it remains unclear if this exists in relation to pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fink, 1995</xref>). Indeed, optogenetic experiments driving GnRH neuron firing at high-frequency burst-like intervals in ovariectomized mice were not found to generate any appreciable change in LH secretion in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campos and Herbison, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The origin of fluctuating baseline activity in male and female GnRH neuron dendrons is unknown but it is tempting to speculate that it may arise from synchronised episodic activity of the GnRH neurons themselves. Brain slice electrophysiological studies have consistently documented repetitive burst firing in GnRH neuron cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herbison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Constantin et al., 2021a</xref>), and similar patterns of activity were observed in GnRH neurons in anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Constantin et al., 2013</xref>). However, the clear clustered patterns of this activity recorded at the dendron would require at least some GnRH neurons to synchronize their activity. To date, there has been no evidence in support of this with dual or multiple recordings of GnRH neuron cell bodies in brain slices failing to show any coordinated activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Constantin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Moenter, 2023</xref>). Hence, it is possible that the rapid high-frequency baseline activity is driven by inputs to GnRH neurons and, in this respect, it is interesting to note that the ARN kisspeptin neuron pulse generator also exhibits variable high-frequency activity between their synchronizations that drive GnRH pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>We find abrupt increases in GnRH neuron activity preceding each LH pulse that rise to a peak in ~30 s and then dissipate over the following 8–10 min. This dynamic is very similar to the reported profile of GnRH secretion into the portal circulation of ovariectomised sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moenter et al., 1992b</xref>). The abrupt nature of GnRH neuron activation is also paralleled by ARN kisspeptin neuron activity during each synchronization event that similarly rises to a peak within 25–50 s but then only lasts for a further ~1 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>). Kisspeptin released from terminals in the ventrolateral ARN operates through volume transmission to rapidly activate and synchronize GnRH neuron dendrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iremonger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Alongside evidence that pulsatile LH secretion is abolished in the absence of kisspeptin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), it is almost certain that the abrupt episodic GnRH neuron activation recorded here arises from up-stream synchronized firing of ARN kisspeptin neurons. What remains curious, however, is that the effects of exogenous kisspeptin on the dendron in vitro are typically prolonged lasting for over 30 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iremonger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). This does not appear to be the case in vivo where GnRH neuron activity subsides within 10 min. It is possible that the termination of GnRH neuron dendron firing to provide a relatively constrained secretory signal involves other local mechanisms such as nitric oxide signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Constantin et al., 2021a</xref>).</p><p>Investigators using a variety of pituitary portal GnRH assays in rodent, sheep and primate models have suggested that GnRH neurons generate the LH surge through either a constant increase in activity or by increasing their normal pulsatile pattern of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sarkar et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caraty et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moenter et al., 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarke, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pau et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sisk et al., 2001</xref>). We demonstrate here that, both predictions were correct with GnRH neuron activity changing in a multi-faceted manner comprised of a slowly oscillating baseline increase with superimposed episodic activity. Retrospectively, this is now readily discernable in many of those portal bleeding data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sarkar et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caraty et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moenter et al., 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarke, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pau et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sisk et al., 2001</xref>). The slow oscillating increase in baseline activity observed here is most probably the key event driving the LH surge. It initiates at the time the LH surge begins and has a duration of approximately 12 hr which is very similar to that of GnRH release in the portal system of rats, sheep, and monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sarkar et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pau et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karsch et al., 1997</xref>). The reason for the extremely prolonged period of GnRH neuron activity and secretion long outlasting the LH surge remains unknown but could be related to sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pfaff, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Skinner and Caraty, 2002</xref>).</p><p>It has been surprising to find that the gradual surge increase in activity has a slow hourly oscillatory rhythm. While a circadian contribution to the onset of the surge is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tonsfeldt et al., 2022</xref>), it had not been appreciated that an ultradian rhythm might also exist. It is very likely that the slow increase in GnRH activity recorded here is driven by the preoptic surge generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), and it will be interesting in future studies to establish whether ultradian rhythms exist within this circuitry and what function they may play in surge generation.</p><p>The ‘two-compartment model’ of GnRH neuron function involves independent pulse and surge generators that operate on different parts of the GnRH neuron to bring about pulsatile and surge patterns of gonadotropin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herbison, 2020</xref>). We have recently shown that selective suppression of preoptic area kisspeptin expression abolishes the surge generator but has no impact on pulsatile LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clarkson et al., 2023</xref>). This model predicts that, on the afternoon of proestrus, the surge generator would operate coincidently with the pulse generator until such time as post-ovulatory progesterone secretion suppresses the pulse generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herbison, 2020</xref>). This is in perfect agreement with our present in vivo recordings where we find abrupt episodic pulse activity to continue on top of the rising phase of the baseline increase until the early hours of estrus when it stops. This highly stereotypical pattern of abrupt episodic activity that reduces in frequency across surge onset is clearly observable after deconvolution of the GCaMP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and is identical to that of the ARN kisspeptin pulse generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>An important question is whether pulse generator activity at the time of the surge may contribute to ovulation. While pulse generator events are short in duration, they nevertheless increase the amplitude of total GnRH neuron activity during the rising phase of the surge and presumably also GnRH secretion within the portal system. Mice and sheep with a knockdown of ARN kisspeptin neurons have recently been reported to have reduced LH surge amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerts et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Velasco et al., 2023</xref>) consistent with the concept proposed here that the pulse generator contributes to the LH surge directly through activation of the GnRH neuron dendron. Intriguingly however, toxin-induced knockdown of ARN kisspeptin neurons in rats has been reported to have the opposite effect of increasing LH surge amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helena et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mittelman-Smith et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we provide here the first direct recordings of GnRH neuron activity in vivo. These observations demonstrate that alongside a baseline pattern of activity of unknown function, abrupt episodic activity underlies pulse generation whereas a slow and prolonged ultradian oscillation on proestrus is responsible for the preovulatory gonadotropin surge. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this unexpected pattern of surge activity remain to be discovered.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male and female 129S6Sv/Ev C57BL/6 <italic>Gnrh1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoon et al., 2005</xref>) crossed on to the Ai162 (TIT2L-GC6s-ICL-tTA2)-D Cre-dependent GCaMP6s line (JAX stock #031562) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>) were group-housed in conventional cages with environmental enrichment under conditions of controlled temperature (22 ± 2°C) and lighting (12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle; lights on at 07:00) with ad libitum access to food (RM1-P, SDS, UK) and water.

A single 400 μm diameter optic fiber (0.48 NA, Doric lenses, QC, Canada) was implanted into the brain with the tip placed immediately above the dorsomedial part of ARN (A-P to bregma, –2.0 mm; D-V 5.9 mm, M-L ± 0.2 mm to sagittal sinus).

This included a custom-built photometry system using Doric components (Doric Lenses, QC, Canada) and a National Instrument data acquisition board (TX, USA) based on a previous design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>). Blue (465–490 nm) and violet (405 nm) LED lights were sinusoidally modulated at frequencies of 531 and 211 Hz, respectively and were focused onto a single fiber optic connected to the mouse. The light intensity at the tip of the fiber was 30–80 microwatts. Emitted fluorescence signal from the brain was collected via the same fiber, passed through a 500–550 nm emission filter, and focused onto a fluorescence detector (Doric, QC, Canada). The emissions were collected at 10 Hz and the two GCaMP6 emissions were recovered by demodulating the 465–490 nm signals (calcium-dependent) and 405 nm (calcium-independent) signals. Signals were either recorded in a continuous mode or a scheduled 5 s on/10 s off mode.</p><p>Analysis was performed in MATLAB with the subtraction of the 405 signal from the 465 -490 signal to extract the calcium-dependent signal followed by an exponential fit algorithm used to correct for baseline shift. The signal was converted to ΔF/F (%) values using the equation ΔF/F=((F<sub>recorded</sub>-F<sub>baseline</sub>)/ F<sub>baseline</sub>) × 100. The Findpeaks algorithm was used to detect dSEs, and the duration and the time of SE to the half-width full maximum were determined. For the deconvolution of signals from 24 hr proestrus recordings, the movmean algorithm was used to extract a 30 min rolling average.</p><p>With this approach, slow oscillatory shifts in baseline during the proestrous surge were detected. The onset and offset of the surge signals were determined by the points at which there was a&gt;5% increment in ΔF relative to all previous timepoints, and when the calcium signal returned to 90% of the baseline value, respectively. The highest value observed during the slow oscillatory phase of the surge was determined to be the peak, and FWHM values were determined from the onset, peak, and offset values. The time taken between one trough to another in individual oscillations was calculated as the duration of each oscillation. The second phase of the deconvolution detected all dSE signals using the ‘findpeaks’ algorithm and signals between –60–360 s around each peak were separated to visualize the remaining low amplitude ‘residual’ signal. A threshold of 5% above baseline was used to extract the residual signal.

The results support the conclusion that GnRH neurons exhibit complex oscillatory behaviours, which are critical for understanding their role in reproductive physiology.

The recordings are taken from intact, male and female, freely behaving mice. The report three patterns of neuronal activity:</p><p>(1) Abrupt increases in the Ca2+ signals that are perfectly correlated with LH pulses.</p><p>(2) A gradual, yet fluctuating (with a slow ultradian frequency), increase in activity, which is associated with the onset of the LH surge in female animals.</p><p>(3) Clustered (high frequency) baseline activity in both female and male animals.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The GCaMP fiber-photometry recordings reported here are the first direct recordings from GnRH neurones in vivo. These recordings have uncovered a rich repertoire of activity suggesting the integration of distinct &quot;surge&quot; and &quot;pulse&quot; generation signals, and an ultradian rhythm during the onset of the surge.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The data analysis method used for the characterisation of the ultradian rhythm observed during the onset of the surge is not detailed enough. Hence, I'm left wondering whether this rhythm is in any way correlated with the clusters of activity observed during the rest of the cycle and which have similar duration.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided further information on the characterisation of the ultradian rhythm observed at the time of the surge. Whether this is related to the clustered basal activity is an interesting point but very difficult to resolve. We note that the “basal” and “surge” ultradian oscillations have very different durations of ~30 and ~80 min suggesting that they may be independent phenomenon. However, the only way to really exclude a similar genesis will be to establish the origin of each type of oscillatory activity. Preliminary data in the lab show that the RP3V kisspeptin neurons exhibit an identical pattern of ultradian oscillation at the time of the surge leading us to suspect that the surge oscillation is driven by this input. As noted in the Discussion it is presently difficult to determine where the high basal activity originates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Evidence of Multi-Dimensional Oscillatory Patterns: The manuscript presents data showing the oscillatory activity of GnRH neurones with distinct frequency and amplitude characteristics. The analysis includes statistical tests that illustrate the variability in neuronal firing patterns. However, the multi-dimensional nature of this activity has not been demonstrated. It is not clear what is meant by &quot;dimension&quot; with regard to the calcium recordings (oscillatory activity). If the authors refer to the frequency content of the calcium signal then a proper Fourier or Wavelet analysis should be carried out to characterise the multiple frequencies present in the calcium dynamics in male mice and during various stages of the cycle in female mice</p></disp-quote><p>The study shows three types of GnRH neuron activity; two of which would be classified as oscillatory in nature. One occurs for ~10 min every hour or so and the other occurs for ~ 12 hours once every 4-5 days. This does not require any analysis to distinguish between the two or claim that they are different i.e. multidimensional.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Data Interpretation: Expand the discussion on the physiological relevance of the identified oscillatory patterns. Specifically, explore how these patterns might influence GnRH pulsatility, hormone secretion dynamics, and reproductive cycles.</p></disp-quote><p>The functional roles of pulsatile and surge patterns of GnRH release are extremely well established.

This could include investigating the role of neurotransmitters, hormonal feedback mechanisms, and other factors that might influence GnRH neuron activity.</p><p>By addressing these recommendations, the authors can further strengthen their manuscript and enhance its impact on the field.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Suggestions:</p><p>(1) The authors might want to analyse their inter-peak interval data by fitting them to a simple parametric statistical model (the gamma distribution would be a good choice to capture the skewness of these data). This way they would be able to describe the observed variability, and if the fits are not good back up to their claims &quot;The dSEs occurred on average ... and showed no clear modal distribution pattern (Fig. 2D)&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have carried out Shapiro-Wilk tests for male inter-peak interval distribution and found a W value of 0.87 and P value &lt;0.0001****, providing strong evidence that the data is not normally distributed. Skewness and Kurtosis values are 1.39 and 1.81 respectively, indicating that the distribution is right-skewed with a platykurtic distribution, indicating that the data is less peaked and more spread out than the normal distribution (with a kurtosis of 3). This has now been added to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) If I understand correctly, in Figure 3D, inter-peak intervals from all 4 stages of the estrus cycle are pooled together. It would also be interesting if the authors gave the interval histograms for the different stages of the cycle separately.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now plotted the inter-peak interval distribution histograms for each individual cycle next to the example traces in Figure 3. The descriptions of the distribution pattern are also updated in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 3C, one can see the mean interval for different animals (as open circles), is that right? Is the statistical test run on these animals mean, or is the entire dSEs dataset used? In any case, it's not clear to the reader how variable intervals are in individual recordings from each animal. Could the authors add this information (could be easily added in the figure caption)?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, that each open circle is the mean interval for each animal. The statistical test was run on the animals mean. Now this information is added to the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors should explain how they identify the regions (clusters) of high-frequency baseline activity, which they present in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>The relevant information is now added to the methods section under the heading ‘GCaMP6 fiber photometry and blood sampling’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors should detail how to identify and characterise the ultradian rhythm they observe at the onset of the surge.</p></disp-quote><p>The relevant information is now added to the methods section under the heading ‘GCaMP6 fiber photometry and blood sampling’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The author could perform some kind of wavelet-type analysis to quantify and analyse how the frequency content of the observed Ca2+ signal changes over the cycle. From their current analysis, I am not sure whether the ultradian oscillations they observe during the surge are related to the low-activity cluster events they observe during the other stages of the cycle.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point but very difficult to resolve.
