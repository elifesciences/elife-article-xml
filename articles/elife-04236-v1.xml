commitment and maintenance of cell identity by transcription factors (TFs). However, the 3D spatial organization of cis-elements and how such sub-nuclear structures influence TF activity remain poorly understood. Here, we combine lattice light-sheet imaging, single-molecule tracking, numerical simulations, and ChIP-exo mapping to localize and functionally probe Sox2 enhancer-organization in living embryonic stem cells. Sox2 enhancers form 3D-clusters that are segregated from heterochromatin but overlap with a subset of Pol II enriched regions. Sox2 searches for specific binding targets via a 3D-diffusion dominant mode when shuttling long-distances between clusters while chromatin-bound states predominate within individual clusters. Thus, enhancer clustering may reduce global search efficiency but enables rapid local fine-tuning of TF search parameters. Our results suggest an integrated model linking cis-element 3D spatial distribution to local-versus-global target search modalities essential for regulating eukaryotic gene transcription.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04236.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04236.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04236.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stem cells in an embryo have the potential to become any type of cell in the body. When a cell begins to specialize, it loses this ability and can only become a limited number of cell types. These transitions are caused by changes in gene expression. Proteins called transcription factors bind to DNA to switch different genes on or off as cells become specialized.</p><p>One such transcription factor, called Sox2, binds to particular DNA sequences in the cell's nucleus to encourage nearby genes to be expressed at the right levels and keep a stem cell unspecialized. However, how these binding sites are positioned throughout the three-dimensional space inside the nucleus was unknown, as was the likelihood of Sox2 finding and binding to these sites.</p><p>Now Liu et al. have taken advantage of advanced microscopes to observe the interaction between Sox2 and its binding site in the nucleus of living embryonic cells. This three-dimensional imaging technology is powerful enough to capture images of individual molecules; and Liu et al. attached fluorescent tags to Sox2 to make it easier to watch them in action. By making a series of time-lapse movies, it was revealed that instead of being evenly scattered in the nucleus, Sox2's binding sites are grouped together to form individual clusters; these clusters preferably occupy spaces in the nucleus that are likely enriched for active genes.</p><p>Liu et al. suggest that the clustering of Sox2 binding sites makes it more difficult for a Sox2 protein to find these sites at first, but much easier to find when the Sox2 protein is near to the cluster. Thus, the uneven positioning of the binding sites for transcription factors may provide an additional layer of control over gene expression. In the future, it would be important to map Sox2's binding sites while visualizing the activities of single genes in living cells. This would improve our understanding of how the structural organization of the contents of the nucleus can influence the correct timing of specific patterns of gene expression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04236.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04236.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>single-molecule imaging</kwd><kwd>enhancer organization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Junior Fellow Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Janelia Research Campus</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Legant</surname><given-names>Wesley R</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Bi-Chang</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name><name><surname>Grimm</surname><given-names>Jonathan B</given-names></name><name><surname>Lavis</surname><given-names>Luke D</given-names></name><name><surname>Betzig</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name><name><surname>Tjian</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lattice light-sheet single-molecule imaging shows 3D Sox2 enhancer clusters in live embryonic stem cells and reveals a model linking 3D spatial distribution of cis-elements, differential target search features and localized gene regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The existence and importance of long-range interactions between distal cis-control elements and cognate core promoter factors in regulating gene expression programs that govern cell-fate in animals have been extensively studied in traditional biochemistry, genetics, and genomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levine and Tjian, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levine et al., 2014</xref>). However, these earlier classical studies were unable to capture the three dimensional (3D) spatial organization or the temporal dynamics of the functional interactions between sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) and distal enhancers. The more recent development of Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) and high throughput sequencing based techniques have provided additional insights into long-distance chromatin looping, genome folding, and topological domains in the context of whole animal genomes but without providing direct spatial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dostie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van de Werken et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that proximity ligation frequency based distances measured by 3C assays may be limited in its capacity to accurately capture 3D molecular proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gavrilov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Sullivan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belmont, 2014</xref>). The inherent constraints of using fixed cells or population based assays to dissect the nature of 3D enhancer organization and transcription factor search dynamics can, however, be partly overcome by single live-cell imaging. Recent advances in fluorescence super resolution microscopy and protein labeling chemistry make possible the visualization and tracking of individual transcription factors as they diffuse and bind to specific targets in the nucleus of living mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mazza et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gavrilov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izeddin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). If specific and stable TF:DNA binding events can be localized and visually reconstructed at single-molecule resolution within an intact nucleus, we would have an opportunity to map and decipher critical spatial features linked to the 3D organization of the functional genome and simultaneously measure differences in the dynamic nature of the TF target search process in distinct compartments within living cells.</p><p>In our recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>), we described a single-cell, single-molecule imaging strategy to study the in vivo Sox2 and Oct4 target search process and dissect the kinetics of enhanceosome formation at endogenous single-copy gene loci in live embryonic stem (ES) cells. We found that Sox2 and Oct4 search for their cognate targets via a trial-and-error mechanism in which these two TFs undergo multiple rounds of diffusion and non-specific chromatin collisions before stably engaging with a specific target via an ordered assembly mechanism. Single-molecule in vitro measurements indicate that Sox2 can also slide along short stretches of naked DNA to search for its target. Although our findings revealed significant mechanistic insights of the in vivo TF target search process, these initial single molecule tracking (SMT) studies were constrained to investigate the average behavior of TF dynamics in single cells. We were not able to address whether TFs behave differently within distinct sub-nuclear territories such as active gene enriched euchromatic regions vs the more tightly compacted regions of heterochromatin nor whether the 3D spatial distribution of enhancer sites might affect target search dynamics.</p><p>To develop new approaches to probe 3D genome organization and address some of these important unresolved questions regarding the dynamic TF target search process, here we took advantage of further developments in super resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>) and fluorescent dye chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>). We applied lattice light-sheet single-molecule imaging to selectively localize, track, and map endogenous Sox2 binding sites in single, living ES cells. Two-color imaging enabled us to quantify the spatial distribution of Sox2 binding sites (enhancers) with respect to euchromatic vs heterochromatic regions. We also measured potential differential rates of Sox2 diffusion and binding modes within enhancer clusters compared to heterochromatic regions. SMT and Monte Carlo simulations of the Sox2 target search process revealed two distinct behaviors—a 3D diffusion dominant long-range mode when traveling between clusters and a local binding dominant search mode within individual binding clusters. These studies suggest that enhancer clustering may reduce global target search efficiency but enable rapid local fine-tuning of search parameters that govern spatially controlled gene regulation in the nucleus. We also probed potential links between enhancer clustering and epigenetic regulation. Together, these results reveal principles that integrate 3D enhancer organization with dynamic in vivo TF-DNA interactions that may play a key role in regulating stem cell pluripotency. The combination of methods described here also open new avenues for studying single live-cell genome spatial organization and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>3D localization of stable Sox2 binding sites in live ES cells</title><p>Although numerous studies have been conducted to investigate Sox2:enhancer interactions by biochemical and genomic approaches, no direct sub-nuclear global spatial information of Sox2 enhancer sites has been attained. This aspect of dissecting TF function presents a particular challenge, because the majority of Sox2 molecules (&gt;74%) in the nucleus are in a dynamically diffusing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). Our recent single-molecule tracking (SMT) experiments found that Sox2 interactions with DNA consist of two distinct populations: non-specific collisions of short duration (residence time ∼0.7 s) and specific ‘stable’ interactions of much longer duration (residence time ∼12 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). Since only ∼3% of the Sox2 molecules in the nucleus are bound to specific DNA sites at a given window of time, it is impossible to infer the spatial distribution of Sox2 enhancer sites simply from fluorescence fluctuations captured by wide-field imaging or from conventional super resolution images of live or fixed cells.</p><p>Currently, the only information we have that can distinguish site-specific binding from non-specific binding events or rapidly diffusing molecules is the relatively long specific residence times of Sox2 at putative cognate recognition sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). Therefore, we set out to devise a time-resolved, live-cell imaging strategy to selectively localize, track, and map these longer lived ‘stable’ Sox2 binding events that likely represent site specific Sox2 binding events to generate a super resolution 3D Sox2/enhancer site map for the whole nucleus. To achieve this, we implemented a lattice light-sheet based single-molecule imaging strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref> for details of optical layout). We first used an improved labeling method in which a HaloTag ligand based on a newly developed fluorophore, Janelia Fluor 549 (JF549) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>), at ultralow concentrations (∼0.1 fM) was gradually diffused into HaloTag-Sox2 expressing ES cells to fluorescently tag individual Sox2 molecules. During the labeling, we performed iterative cycles of z tiling by light-sheet microscopy of ES cell nuclei that allowed us to image Sox2 at single molecule resolution in 3D in a series of time-lapse movies. Background fluorescence contributed by rapidly diffusing free JF549-HaloTag ligand was negligible under these imaging conditions as single molecules were only detectable inside cell nuclei but not in the cytoplasm or other regions lacking Sox2 binding sites (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Light-sheet imaging turned out to be critical for the success of this strategy because the selective plane illumination not only preserved the photon budget by preventing out-of-focus molecules from photo-bleaching but also significantly increased the signal-to-noise ratio. With 3D localization at high precision (xy: 14 nm, z: 34 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) coupled to single molecule tracking, we were able to selectively preserve the global positions where single Sox2 molecules dwell (&lt;50 nm) for at least 3 s. The average residence time of selected molecules was ∼6.92 ± 0.51 s (n = 9 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with the notion that most of these events likely reflect the longer residence times representing specific Sox2-enhancer interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). We next calculated the number of local neighbors for each Sox2 enhancer site to generate a color-coded heat map for visualizing this data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, many local density hot spots were observed within a single nucleus, suggesting that instead of being uniformly distributed throughout the nucleus, Sox2 bound enhancers form locally enriched distinct higher density clusters (EnCs).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04236.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Localization of Sox2 stable binding sites in 3D by lattice light-sheet, single-molecule imaging.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole-nucleus single molecule imaging was performed by lattice light-sheet microscopy with 300 nm z steps and 50 ms per frame. HaloTag-Sox2 molecules were labeled by membrane permeable JF549 dye. The imaging scheme was cycled every 3 s for ∼500 times.

A collimated circular laser beam is passed through two pairs of cylindrical lenses to illuminate a thin stripe across the width of a ferroelectric spatial light modulator (SLM, Forth Dimension Displays, SXGA-3DM). The remainder of the excitation optical path serves to create a demagnified image of the SLM (81.6 nm pixels) at the focal plane of the excitation objective. First, a lens is used in a 2F configuration to create a diffraction pattern at its front focal plane that is the Fourier transform of the electric field reflected from the SLM. A custom opaque mask with transmissive annuli (Photo-Sciences Inc.) is placed at this plane, and a specific annulus is chosen to remove the unwanted diffraction orders and enforce a limit on the minimum field of view. The electric field transmitted through the mask is then imaged in series onto each of a pair of galvanometers (Cambridge Technology, 6215H) and the rear pupil plane of the excitation objective. The galvanometers serve to translate the light sheet through the specimen in x and z. Finally, the field is reverse transformed by the excitation objective to create the desired lattice light sheet at its front focal plane. The fluorescence generated within the specimen is collected by a detection objective (Nikon, CFI Apo LWD 25XW, 1.1 NA, 2 mm WD) whose focal plane is co-incident with the light sheet. Its high NA is essential to maximize the xy resolution and to optimize the light collection for single molecule detection. The excitation objective (Special Optics, 0.65 NA, 3.74 mm WD) was custom designed to fill the remaining available solid angle above the cover slip. A tube lens images the fluorescence from the illuminated slice within the specimen onto a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4.0 v2) capable of frame rates down to 1 ms. A 3D image is produced from a stack of such 2D slices, either by moving the light sheet and detection objective together through the specimen (the former with the z galvo, the latter with a piezoelectric stage [Physik Instrumente, P-621.1CD]) or, far more commonly, by translating the specimen with a second piezo stage through the stationary light sheet along an axis s in the plane of the specimen cover slip. The specimen holder and specimen piezo are mounted on a trio of closed loop micropositioning stages (Physik Instrumente M-663 for horizontal motion in the cover slip plane, M-122.2DD for vertical travel).

In contrast to Sox2, we observed dramatically decreased clustering behavior of HaloTag-H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). In order to establish a more quantitative description of the Sox2-enhancer clustering behavior, we adapted a pair-correlation function used by cosmologists to describe the clustering behavior of stars in galaxies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peebles, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peebles and Hauser, 1974</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, see details in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3 equ4 equ5 equ6 equ7">Equations 3–7</xref>). Briefly, the pair correlation function, <italic>g(r)</italic>, describes the density of spots in a volume element at a separation r from single spots relative to the average density in the whole volume. If enhancer sites were uniformly distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>) the pair correlation function would equal 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, gray diamonds) because the local densities around each position would be invariant and equal to the average density in the entire volume. However, when spots are highly clustered, the <italic>g(r)</italic> will start with values much greater than 1 and gradually decrease as <italic>r</italic> increases, indicating that the local molecular densities around individual spots would be much higher than the average density in the volume. As expected, the <italic>g(r)</italic> function of Sox2 stable binding sites agreed well with a highly clustered behavior while by contrast, the <italic>g(r)</italic> function of H2B suggests a much more random and uniform distribution in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We next extended the previously established fluctuation model for describing two dimensional heterogeneous protein distribution in membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sengupta et al., 2011</xref>) to fit the <italic>g(r)</italic> function calculated from our 3D dataset (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ10 equ11 equ12 equ13">Equations 10–13</xref>). This model extracted two key parameters related to molecular clustering: the fluctuation range (<italic>ε</italic>) and the fluctuation amplitude (<italic>A</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Specifically, <italic>ε</italic> is proportional to the average size of clusters while <italic>A</italic> is proportional to the relative molecular density within clusters. We observed, on average, a 14 fold higher fluctuation amplitude of Sox2-enhancers compared with those of H2B. However, we did observe a certain degree of H2B density fluctuations at much larger scales (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), probably reflecting chromatin density variations in the nucleus as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Young et al., 1986</xref>). Because we use the 7000 most stable H2B spots to calculate the pair-correlation functions, according to Nyquist sampling theorem, our results are more sensitive to large-scale H2B density fluctuations in the nucleus and may overlook smaller-scale local H2B clustering. The mathematic tools established here should also serve as the basis for future comparisons when we carry out perturbation experiments that will be instructive for dissecting the function and molecular mechanisms underlying enhancer clustering. To determine whether the blinking of stably bound fluorescently tagged Sox2 molecules might influence or distort the observed ‘stable’ binding of Sox2 in the clusters, we plotted the number of detected events as a function of frame number. These plots show an initial decay that eventually reaches a plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Such a temporal decay profile is more consistent with a bleaching dominant mechanism in which an equilibrium has been achieved between photo-bleaching and the ongoing fluorescent labeling of HaloTag-Sox2 molecules. Perhaps the strongest argument that the Sox2 clustering pattern we observe is not likely an artifact of the imaging modality can be derived from the fact that chromatin bound HaloTag-H2B molecules using precisely the same imaging strategy failed to show such a prominent clustering pattern.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04236.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Clustering of Sox2 bound enhancers in the nucleus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 3D density map of H2B distribution (n = 7000) in single ES cell nucleus.

If the recorded Sox2 stable binding events mainly reflect random non-specific interactions, the clustering behavior of shorter lived binding sites should be similar to that observed for the long lived putative ‘specific’ binding sites. Instead, we found the shorter-lived Sox2 binding sites showed greatly reduced fluctuation amplitudes of the pair correlation function curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). We also note that in many cases, we observed little or no clustering of short-lived Sox2 binding sites within the same territories where longer-lived stable Sox2 binding site clusters can clearly be observed (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video3 video6">Videos 3 and 6</xref>). These results suggest that the long-residence time filtering strategy that we deployed here likely enriches for specific binding site signals above the background of non-specific interactions consistent with what we observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video6" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-04236-media6-v1.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04236.014</object-id><label>Video 6.</label><caption><title>Transient Sox2 binding sites in the live ES cell nucleus.</title><p>HaloTag-Sox2 transient binding sites (7000, &lt;3 s) were displayed with a color map same as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.

Interestingly, we did not observe significant bursting behaviors as described for Pol II clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). These results are consistent with a model wherein Sox2 EnCs are relatively stable during the period (∼20 min) of image acquisition. Because Sox2 bound enhancers are chromatin based structures, we note that previous FRAP (Fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching) experiments on core histone components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimura and Cook, 2001</xref>) found that large-scale chromatin structures in live cells appeared stable with a half-life of &gt;2–4 hr which is much longer than the duration of our imaging experiments. These findings suggest that the enhancer clustering we observed here likely reflects the average 3D genome organization within reasonably short temporal length scales.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sox2-enhancer clusters are largely segregated from heterochromatin</title><p>It has long been proposed that the 3D space inside a cell nucleus is sub-divided into highly active gene enriched regions (so-called ‘euchromatin’) and largely inactive gene regions (i.e., ‘heterochromatin’). To probe the spatial relationship between Sox2 EnCs and heterochromatic regions (HCs), we generated dual labeled ES cell lines that stably express HaloTag-Sox2 and GFP-HP1. HP1 protein is enriched in peri-centromeric and peripheral HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grewal and Elgin, 2002</xref>) that form non-diffraction limited structures in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video7 video8 video9">Videos 7,8,9</xref>). To map the EnCs and HCs in the same cell, we first deployed a wide-field, two-color imaging scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) in which we used a low-excitation, long-acquisition time imaging condition (2 Hz) to map Sox2 stable binding sites in the nucleus while we recorded the images of GFP-HP1 before and after the SMT experiment (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). After localization and tracking of stable binding sites, we used a 2D kernel density estimator to generate an intensity map of EnCs in the nucleus (See ‘Materials and methods’ for details of image acquisition and registration; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and then superimposed the EnC intensity map with the HC map as two different color channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We observed that EnCs and HCs are generally not co-localized spatially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To gain a more quantitative measurement of these two distinct sub-nuclear regions, we tested the pixel-to-pixel correlation between EnC and HC intensity maps from individual cells. Pixels with high levels of EnC intensities generally showed low levels of HC intensities and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The Pearson correlation test gave an averaged coefficient (Rho) of 0.11 ± 0.028 (n = 8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that the location of EnCs and HCs is indeed very weakly correlated in the nuclear volume of ES cells. We also used pair cross-correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>) to characterize the spatial relationship between EnC and HC regions (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8 equ9">Equations 8–9</xref> for details of calculation). Unlike autocorrelation which measures the degree of self-clustering, pair cross-correlation examines the degree of co-clustering and co-localization between two types of molecules. As expected, the EnC and HC were shown to be clustered as their self-cross (auto) correlation curves start with values significantly above 1 and gradually converge to 1 with increased correlation radii (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). By contrast, the pair cross-correlation function between EnC and HC intensity maps showed no apparent spatial correlation other than weak exclusion in the range of radii smaller than 600 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To minimize the possibility that some bias may have been introduced by our 2D wide-field imaging and analysis pipeline, we also analyzed the spatial distributions of HCs and EnCs in single cells by lattice light-sheet imaging. Indeed, single molecule tracking confirmed and further strengthened the segregated relationship between HCs and EnCs in the 3D nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>). Importantly, these results, taken together, suggest that Sox2 specific binding sites appear less frequently in HCs as most of the stable/specific binding sites were found to be outside of HCs. Consistent with this notion, we observed that levels of Sox2 in HCs are generally significantly lower than Sox2 levels in surrounding sub-nuclear regions, consistent with a reduced association of Sox2 to HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04236.015</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Sox2 enhancer clusters and heterochromatin regions are not co-localized.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two color imaging to probe the spatial relationship between enhancer clusters and heterochromatin regions.

These dual labeled ES cells were able to proliferate in the presence of α-amanitin, indicating that the tagged Rbp1 replaced the endogenous subunit in the RNA Pol II complex without interfering with its normal transcription function. To acquire super-resolution images of Pol II and Sox2 EnCs in the same cell, we first mapped Sox2 EnC clusters by deploying low-excitation and long-acquisition times (2 Hz) for detecting stable DNA bound JF646–HaloTag-Sox2 molecules. Next, we performed live-cell PALM experiments by photo-activating Dendra2 tagged Pol II molecules (See ‘Materials and methods’ for details of image acquisition and registration). The final reconstructed images are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. We also performed pair auto- and cross-correlation analysis with Pol II and EnC intensity maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, results from autocorrelation analysis suggested that Pol II molecules are somewhat more evenly distributed in the nucleus than the highly clustered Sox2-enhancers. Specifically, Sox2 EnC autocorrelation curves generally start with higher values (higher packing densities) and more quickly converge to 1 with increased correlation radii (tighter packing) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) compared with Pol II autocorrelation curves. However, it is worth noting that we did detect significant and distinct local Pol II density fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>) consistent with previous reports using other imaging modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cisse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). To better quantify the spatial relationship between the distribution patterns of Pol II and Sox2 EnCs, we next determined the pixel-to-pixel correlation between EnC and Pol II intensity maps generated from individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The Pearson correlation test gave an average coefficient (Rho) of 0.44 ± 0.046 (Pol II high mask) (n = 8, average p-value from each test &lt;4.36E-45), suggesting that unlike the relationship between EnCs and HCs, EnC regions are generally correlated with Pol II occupancy in ES cells. Pair cross-correlation function also suggested a significant degree of co-localization/clustering between Sox2 EnCs and Pol II–enriched regions as the cross-correlation curves start with values significantly greater than 1 and gradually converge to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, we note that, due to the tighter clustering of Sox2 enhancers, most Sox2 EnC regions contained significant levels of Pol II whereas only a subset of Pol II enriched regions overlap with Sox2 EnCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). The partial overlap between Sox2 EnCs and Pol II enriched regions is entirely consistent with previous genome-wide analysis showing that Sox2 only targets a subset of transcribed genes involved in maintaining ES cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Many actively transcribed genes (including house-keeping genes) are likely subject to regulation by TFs other than Sox2 or Oct4. These results also suggest that Sox2 enhancer driven gene regulation is largely confined locally within distinct EnCs. Although not detectable in our assays, we assume that sub-nuclear regions outside Sox2 EnCs contain different actively transcribed cis-element clusters that also overlap with other Pol II enriched regions.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04236.021</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Sox2 targets a subset of Pol II-enriched regions in the nucleus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Upper left: a live-cell 2D PALM super-resolution image of Dendra 2 Pol II.

However, we were not able to determine whether Sox2 might actually behave differently in distinct sub-nuclear compartments and how enhancer clustering might influence the TF search process. In light of our new finding that the 3D space within the ES cell nucleus can be divided into distinct EnC and HC regions, it became possible to probe the behavior of Sox2 target search dynamics in different chromatin compartments. To address this important and functionally relevant question, we took advantage of recently developed HaloTag dyes (JF549 and JF646) for multiplexing SMT experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>). We dual labeled HaloTag-Sox2 molecules in the same cells with JF549 and JF646 HaloTag-ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, we mapped Sox2 EnC clusters by deploying low-excitation and long-acquisition times (2 Hz) for detecting stable bound JF646–HaloTag-Sox2 molecules. At the same time, we tracked the fast diffusing/binding dynamics of JF549-HaloTag-Sox2 molecules by using high-excitation and short-acquisition times (100 Hz) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video10">Video 10</xref>). We also generated a binary mask for enhancer cluster regions and divided the Sox2 single-molecule tracks into in-mask fragments and out-mask fragments (See ‘Materials and methods’ for details). We note that tracking was performed without knowledge of the mask thus ensuring an unbiased track division. We calculated diffusion coefficients from in-mask track segments (n = 6 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and found that most of the molecules inside EnCs are in the bound state (64 ± 7.8%) and only ∼36% are rapidly diffusing. These results suggest that Sox2 molecules in EnCs generally spend less time in diffusion before engaging with chromatin and thus have a shorter τ<sub>3D</sub>. Similarly, we investigated the fast diffusing/binding population of Sox2 within HCs using an analogous strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>). Consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), stable DNA binding events/sites are distinctly low (16 ± 4.5%) in HCs, compared with their frequency in EnCs (64 ± 7.8%) and in whole nuclei (38 ± 4.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). However, interestingly, we observed a significant population of Sox2 molecules (26 ± 8.4%) within HCs that diffuse with much slower rates (0.61 ± 0.13 μm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) than the average Sox2 diffusion rates (∼2.7 ± 0.63 μm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) in whole nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). This finding suggests that, in certain regions inside HCs, Sox2 diffuses slower. In good agreement with this observation, a previous report demonstrated via Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) measurements that even GFP molecules diffuse much slower in heterochromatic regions possibly due to molecular crowding effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bancaud et al., 2009</xref>). We pooled and analyzed all the SMT tracks obtained from single cells together and found that the majority of Sox2 molecules are in a diffusing mode (62 ± 4.3%, n = 12 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with a 3D diffusion dominant search mechanism.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04236.023</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Two-color imaging reveals differential Sox2 behavior within enhancer clusters vs heterochromatin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two color single-molecule imaging to probe Sox2 binding and diffusion dynamics in enhancer clusters.

Specifically, inside individual EnCs, Sox2 molecules appear to spend significantly more time binding to either naked DNA or chromatin with relatively short 3D diffusion periods.

The manipulations required to modulate enhancer clustering posed significant experimental challenges. Moreover, because of its probabilistic nature, the target search process cannot be adequately described by ordinary differential equations nor traditional binding kinetic equations, because they typically rely on mass reaction rates and assume that substrate concentrations are invariant across a large field of view. As discussed extensively in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robert and Casella, 2005</xref>), one of the most effective ways to dissect a random process based behavior is through computer-generated Monte Carlo algorithms that simulate the Brownian motion of TFs in a confined 3D sphere (cell nucleus) with multiple target traps (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ14 equ15">Equations 14–15</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video12">Video 12</xref>, See ‘Materials and methods’ for parameter selection criteria.

In support of this result, other groups observed similar effects of receptor clustering on ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldstein and Wiegel, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Care and Soula, 2011</xref>). Specifically, the ‘apparent’ macroscopic ligand binding association rates decrease with increased densities of receptors within clusters while the microscopic rates remained the same. To further minimize the possibility that merged targets might create larger binding sites, we reduced the radius of targets to 30 nm while maintaining the minimal distance between the centers of two targets at 80 nm. In this case, there was no possibility of contact or merging between targets. Under these conditions, very similar simulation results were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus, it seems unlikely that the effects of target site clustering on τ<sub>3D</sub> would be due to target site fusion. It is also important to note that, in our simulation experiments, the TF binding probability to target is 1. Since we defined the ‘Fold of Delay’ as τ<sub>3D</sub> in the ‘clustered’ case normalized by τ<sub>3D</sub> in the ‘uniform’ case, the binding probability (1 or not) should be identical under both uniform and cluster conditions. Consequently, the trends that we observe for ‘Fold of Delay’ should not alter significantly when the TF binding probabilities vary.</p><p>As expected, when we increased the number of clusters in the nucleus while holding the total number of sites constant, it took progressively shorter τ<sub>3D</sub> for TFs to reach their target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Under these conditions, we essentially increased the degree of randomness of enhancer distribution by dispersing the same amount of targets into more randomly localized clusters. We next probed the TF rebinding time in an individual cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Specifically, we injected TFs at different radii of release relative to the center of an enhancer cluster. We found that τ<sub>3D</sub> becomes reduced as the injection site approaches the center of the EnC (or when the local concentrations of enhancer sites increase). This result suggests that the TF target search dynamics is spatially modulated by enhancer density fluctuations in the nucleus such as we find in EnCs vs HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Specifically, the higher the local concentration of target sites, the shorter the time (τ<sub>3D</sub>) it will take for a TF to reach a target site within an EnC. This relationship can also be verified mathematically by the Smoluchowski equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ19 equ20 equ21">Equations 19–21</xref>).</p><p>We next tried fitting the τ<sub>3D</sub> histograms derived from different degrees of clustering to single or two-component decay models (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ17 equ18">Equations 17–18</xref>). Interestingly, a single component model failed to fit the data when the enhancer sites become more and more densely clustered while a two-component model fits the entire range of cluster density data well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results suggest that the enhancer clustering behavior itself may be sufficient to bifurcate the target search process into at least two components: a local search mode inside enhancer clusters and a long-range mode for searching outside of clusters. Together, these simulation results help clarify the effect of enhancer clustering on global TF target search efficiency in a non-equilibrium state and also reinforce the notion that the Sox2 target search process can follow two distinct modes: a local search process dominated by a binding dominant mechanism and a long-range mode for TFs to search between EnCs that is dominated by a 3D exploration mechanism as suggested previously by our independent SMT experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Epigenetic perturbations can disrupt Sox2-enhancer clustering and alter genome-wide binding profiles</title><p>As a first step towards deciphering the mechanisms that underlie enhancer clustering, we next asked whether modulation of the epigenome would change the Sox2 enhancer clustering behavior in single live cells. Specifically, we applied our single-molecule, light sheet imaging strategy to map Sox2-enhancer 3D organization in TSA treated ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video13">Video 13</xref>). Interestingly, the pair correlation function of Sox2 EnCs in TSA treated cells showed profiles of significantly decreased clustering, more similar to those of H2B, indicated by the decreased fluctuation amplitudes and increased fluctuation ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Thus, it seems that TSA treatment, thought to decondense chromatin, makes specific and stable Sox2 binding sites become more randomly distributed in the nucleus. One possibility is that dysregulation of histone deacetylation activities after TSA treatment significantly alters the Sox2 binding profile in the genome to a more random state; the other possibility is that TSA treatment redistributes the 3D localization of existing Sox2 binding sites in the nucleus. To distinguish between these two possible mechanisms, we performed Sox2 ChIP-exo experiments in TSA treated ES cells and compared the resulting Sox2 genome-wide binding profile to Sox2 chromosomal localizations in wild type (WT) ES cells. Upon TSA treatment, we observed a much more random distribution of Sox2 ChIP-exo peaks across different chromosomes and with regard to transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), favoring the scenario that TSA treatment significantly increased the chances for Sox2 to bind more randomly throughout the genome. These results suggest that a finely balanced epigenetic regulation can influence the maintenance of normal enhancer clustering in the nucleus.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04236.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Epigenetic perturbation of enhancer clustering and genome-wide binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The fluctuation range (x) and amplitude (y) were obtained by fitting the pair-correlation function of the indicated dataset with the fluctuation model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ10 equ11 equ12 equ13">Equations 10–13</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Despite more than 30 years of intense investigation, the dynamic TF target seeking process in live mammalian cells has remained poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Halford, 2009</xref>). Part of the problem is that, currently, there are few options available to directly investigate spatial enhancer organization in living cells. Here, we report a single-molecule, light-sheet imaging based strategy to reconstruct, in 3D, the Sox2-enhancer organization within live ES cells. We found that Sox2 enhancer sites form locally enriched clusters providing us an opportunity to tackle several fundamental questions. In particular, could the target search process be differentially regulated in distinct sub-nuclear regions such as enhancer clusters (EnCs) vs heterochromatic regions (HCs)? Using a suite of assays, we probed the transcription factor (TF) target search process and how the formation of enhancer clusters (EnCs) might modulate TF search parameters. We also determined the influence of spatially segregated and functionally distinct chromatin territories on transcription factor search modes within the mammalian nucleus. These findings support a model wherein gene regulation in eukaryotic cells operates in a manner dependent on the 3D spatial distribution of cis-elements that in turn influences differential target search features associated with local sub-nuclear environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04236.032</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Spatially modulated target search and gene regulation in ES cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sox2 stable binding sites form enhancer clusters that are segregated from heterochromatin regions. Sox2 searches for targets via a 3D diffusion dominant mode traveling between clusters and tunneling through heterochromatin regions. Inside individual enhancer clusters, Sox2 3D diffusion times were dramatically shortened due to the high concentrations of specific target sites, nonspecific open DNA or protein binding partners as indicated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Thus, Sox2 target search is dominated by binding processes on chromatin. (<bold>B</bold>) Enhancer clustering modulates TF target search parameters and makes spatially controlled gene regulation possible by creating variation of local enhancer concentrations. Upper, uniform distribution of target sites generates invariant enhancer site density in the nucleus and TF would have the same average 3D times across the nucleus. Lower, target site clustering causes variations of local enhancer density which would affect local target search parameters (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ19 equ20 equ21">Equations 19–21</xref>).

In particular, we find that inside enhancer clusters, Sox2 displays significantly faster forward association rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref>), thereby increasing local TF concentrations, allowing rapid rebinding to stretches of open chromatin and probably also facilitating the local target acquisition process. The shortened τ<sub>3D</sub> provides a greater opportunity for re-cycling pre-assembled TF complexes and taking advantage of cooperative interactions between TFs on chromatin. Interestingly, our simulation studies suggest that even subtle changes in the position of target genes within individual clusters can lead to alterations in local target search features. For example, gene targets at the center of EnCs can capitalize on different target search features relative to genes in the periphery of enhancer clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). These results suggest that the local TF target search mode may be exquisitely modulated within distinct sub-nuclear environments and serve as an important mechanism for fine-tuning the rates of TF complex assembly at specific cis-regulatory elements.</p><p>Two-color imaging revealed that enhancer clusters are spatially segregated from heterochromatic regions but overlap with a subset of Pol II enriched clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Single molecule tracking of Sox2 binding and diffusion dynamics in EnCs vs HCs indicates that in contrast to the previously estimated fraction (∼74%) of Sox2 molecules engaged, on average, in 3D diffusion, the majority (∼64%) of Sox2 molecules within EnCs were found to be in a chromatin bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This new finding suggests that local higher concentrations of ‘open’ chromatin in EnCs likely give rise to a dramatically reduced τ<sub>3D</sub> leading the target search process to switch from a 3D diffusion dominant mode to a binding dominant search mechanism perhaps more similar to the action of LacI in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elf et al., 2007</xref>). By contrast, we found a relatively low Sox2 bound fraction in heterochromatic regions. Intriguingly, in certain HC regions, Sox2 diffuses with slower rates compared to the average rate in the nucleus. This result is consistent with a previous report that even GFP molecules diffuse much slower in HCs possibly due to molecular crowding effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bancaud et al., 2009</xref>). Our findings suggest that the Sox2 target search process can be divided into at least two distinct modes in the ES cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), (1) a chromatin binding dominant, local mode within individual EnCs possibly involving Sox2 sliding along short stretches of naked DNA as demonstrated by our in vitro TIRF single-molecule experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>) and (2) a 3D diffusion dominant long-range mode in which Sox2 molecules must tunnel through HCs and travel between EnCs. Our simulations also suggest that enhancer clustering itself is sufficient to generate these two modes of target search. Together, these findings reveal previously unappreciated principles governing Sox2 target search patterns within distinct sub-nuclear regions of ES cells and provide insights into how enhancer clustering can modulate local target search dynamics that could ultimately influence local transcription rates.</p><p>From the earliest cloning and characterization of classical sequence specific transcription factors, a striking yet puzzling feature was the discovery of simple repetitive largely unstructured amino acid motifs (i.e., Gln-rich, Pro-rich, acidic repeats) that serve as ‘activation domains’ (ADs) coupled to DNA binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Courey and Tjian, 1988</xref>). More recent evidence suggests that such simple repetitive amino acid motifs, now referred to as low-complexity (LC) sequences, are found in a variety of regulatory proteins (such as FUS, TAF15, and EWS) and can be induced to form fibrous polymers in vitro to mediate interactions with the CTD of RNA polymerase in a phosphorylation-state dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>). However, in vitro polymer formation required protein concentrations (0.7–2 mM), ∼1000× greater than typical concentrations of TFs (low micro-molar) found in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). One mechanism proposed to enhance polymer formation involves RNA molecules seeding higher-order assemblies via the intrinsic RNA binding capacity of select regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the activation domains of Sox2 are predicted to be unstructured LC domains enriched for G/S/P residues. Importantly, the C-terminal Sox2 AD contains five repeats of degenerate (G/S/D/H) Y (G/S/D/H) sequences that have been reported to form fibrous polymers in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>). We speculate that the in vivo Sox2-enhancer clustering observed in our live cell studies opens the possibility that local higher concentrations of both TFs and specific DNA binding sites within EnCs may promote the formation of Sox2 LC AD containing polymers at least transiently. We envision that these Sox2-enhancer clusters could serve as multivalent docking sites for dynamic TF recruitment via weak protein:protein interactions potentially directed by LC containing proteins. Such ‘clouds’ of weak multivalent protein:protein interactions would be assisted by stronger sequence specific protein:DNA transactions that together build an activated enhanceosome. These transiently formed EnC clusters may, in turn, regulate local TF concentrations and dictate local target search dynamics of key transcriptional pre-initiation components including Pol II, GTFs, and chromatin remodeling complexes. It is tempting to speculate that the Sox2 enhancer cluster and its associated co-factors could thus form the local hub for coordinated and synergistic gene regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Whether the EnCs we observe represent actively transcribed regions remains unclear but the significant co-localization between EnCs and Pol II would be consistent with such an interpretation. Since interactions between classical LC activation domains such as those reported in the original studies of Sp1-Sp1 and Sp1-TAF4 interactions have also been suggested to be important for DNA loop formation and transcription activation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mastrangelo et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Su et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freiman and Tjian, 2002</xref>), it will be instructive in the future to probe whether these prevalent LC mediated transactions also contribute to the maintenance and structural integrity of enhancer clusters.</p><p>Another intriguing feature of this revised model of gene regulation is that physical proximity but not direct or stable interactions between distal enhancer elements and gene proximal promoters is necessary for delivering transcription activation by cis-elements at a distance. We envision that enhancer clustering with its higher local TF/cofactor concentrations accompanied by altered target search features may be sufficient to serve as an alternative mechanism for achieving distal enhancer directed transcription activation long recognized as a hallmark of mammalian gene control. Our results also suggest that gene and promoter positioning in relationship to EnC and HC territories is critical for optimal fine-tuning of transcriptional activities. Important questions left unresolved by our present study include: how many genes/promoters are present within a cluster; what is the relationship between our 3D clusters and TADs (topologically associated domains); and are the enhancer binding sites within a cluster all from a given chromosome or is there evidence of transvection occurring as well?</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Linking 3D spatial distribution to linear genomic TF-binding profile</title><p>The enhancer clustering behavior that we observed fits generally with the concepts deduced from studies of linearly arrayed enhancers in the genome identified by ChIP-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>) and topological domains identified by Hi-C experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). These studies, taken in aggregate, suggest that gene transcription is compartmentalized within topological or spatial territories in the nucleus segregated from other silent regions. However, given the orthogonal nature of these diverse methods of probing genome organization, it is difficult at this stage to firmly establish either direct structural or functional links between the genome-wide ensemble studies and our observation of enhancer clustering by single molecule imaging. We note, for example, that enhancer clustering does not appear simply to result from differential chromatin packaging. Specifically, the fluctuations of Sox2 enhancer densities in the nucleus are smaller in sizes (<italic>ε</italic>) but much larger in amplitudes (A) than chromatin (H2B) densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Two distinct mechanisms could account for this observation, (1) Sox2 binding sites are already clustered in the linear genome and chromosome folding based on the polymer model (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tark-Dame et al., 2011</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fudenberg and Mirny, 2012</xref>), automatically leads to 3D cluster formation even without TF directed chromatin looping interactions; (2) extensive active and TF directed long distance chromatin looping brings distal Sox2-enhancer sites along the linear chromosome to form local 3D clusters. To distinguish between these two potential scenarios, we analyzed the linear arrangement of Sox2 binding sites genome wide using ChIP-exo. Indeed as suspected, many Sox2 binding sites already form clustered arrays along the linear chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, disrupting the epigenome alters the accessibility of linearly arranged Sox2 binding sites as well as the extent of 3D enhancer clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This finding suggests that linearly arrayed Sox2 binding sites likely contribute substantially to the formation of enhancer clusters in 3D but do not exclude the possibility that TF directed chromatin looping also contributes to such an organization of actively transcribed loci. Future modeling and simulation experiments will be required to functionally link the linear genomic localization of different TF binding sites with their 3D spatial distributions in the nucleus to gain further insights into genome organization and chromatin folding. It also remains unclear what forces or exogenous structures are in play to maintain the star-burst arrangement of enhancers in the nuclear volume.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>Our studies provide a basis for understanding how the 3D organization of enhancers into localized clusters could affect TF target search dynamics and influence local transcription rates. Our imaging analysis of live ES cells suggests that the nucleus is partitioned into multiple levels of spatially segregated functional domains. For example, many Pol II enriched regions do not overlap with Sox2 EnCs although, as might be expected, most Sox2 EnCs do overlap with Pol II clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We also observed extensive residual ‘dark’ spaces that are not significantly occupied by either heterochromatin or Sox2 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>). It seems likely that other uncharacterized enhancer bearing sub-nuclear domains occupy these ‘dark’ territories and influence local gene activity not detected by our current assays. We speculate that galaxies of such 3D clusters of cis-regulatory domains are formed by specific binding of different combinations of TFs we have long suspected but could not discern from classical bulk biochemistry. It will be interesting in the future to complete this 3D mapping of the nucleome to discern which other cadre of factors might reside in these ‘dark’ regions. Another aspect to address will be the degree of spatial overlap between different functional regions created by the stable binding and local concentrations of different classes of TFs. Ultimately we would like to have a more complete understanding of how the 3D organization of these cis-elements specifically influences gene activity and what gene products and mechanisms underlie the formation of these clusters. Addressing these questions will be essential for a deeper understanding of how enhancer-mediated gene regulation works. The ongoing development of simultaneous multi-color super-resolution imaging systems, enhanced dye chemistry, and single gene locus labeling strategies will be essential to address these fundamental questions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>ES cell culture</title><p>Mouse D3 (ATCC, USA) ES cells were cultured on 0.1% gelatin coated plates in the absence of feeder cells.

The modification consists of a massively parallel array of coherently interfering beams comprising a non-diffracting 2D optical lattice, rather than a set of seven noninterfering Bessel beams. This creates a coherent structured light sheet that can be dithered to create uniform excitation in a 400 nm thick plane across the entire field of view. The experimental hardware is the same as before, except that a binary spatial light modulator (SXGA-3DM, Forth Dimension Displays, Valencia, CA) is placed conjugate to the sample plane, and a binarized version of the desired structured pattern at the sample is projected on the display.

The D<sub>max</sub> works as a limit constraining the maximum distance (r<sub>max</sub>) between two frames for a particle random diffusing during reconnection. Therefore, for events lasted more than one frames, only molecules localized within r<sub>max</sub> for at least two consecutive frames will be considered as bound molecules. Since we used relatively long acquisition time (500 ms) to blur the image of fast diffusing molecules, events that appeared in single frames were also taken into consideration as bound molecules to have a track length of 0.5 s. The duration of individual tracks (dwell time) was directly calculated based on the track length.

For experiment investigating co-localization of Pol II-enriched regions and Sox2 EnCs, image registration was performed by calculating and aligning nucleus outlines from both datasets. After background subtraction, the intensity map for heterochromatin regions in single cells was directly calculated by normalizing pixel intensity in the GFP-HP1 channel with the highest pixel intensity in the image. The intensity map for Dendra2 Pol II or stable Sox2 binding sites was calculated by 2D Gaussian kernel density function implemented by Matlab. Specifically, the density probability of X, Y localizations of stable binding events was evaluated in a 100 × 100 matrix with arbitrary units. The bandwidth for density estimation is 2 units. The resulting probability map was rescaled to the original image size. Composite images were constructed by superimposing the two intensity maps as two independent color channels. Binary mask for heterochromatin regions or enhancer clusters was calculated by applying a threshold cutoff of 0.2 to the intensity map. 2D single-molecule tracks were divided to track segments resided in the mask and outside of the mask. Track segments from each catalog were pooled.

The target search problem was reduced to random walk trapping problem with boundary and multiple traps. Specifically, we limited the 3D diffusion of the TF in a nucleus with a radius of 5 µm. Considering the average length of nucleosome depleted regions as 100–200 base pairs and the persistent length (<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>) of naked DNA as about 45 nm (135 bps) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williams and Maher, 2011</xref>), target site radius was set as 40 nm. Overlaps between targets were not allowed in our simulation experiment. Specifically, the minimal distance (80 nm) allowed between the center of two targets is two times of the target radius (40 nm). In our simulation experiment, the TF binding probability to target is 1 when the TF reaches individual targets. The number of target sites was 7000 as estimated in our previous work. The mean diffusion coefficient (D) of the TF is 10 μm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>; the sampling interval (<italic>δt</italic>) is 10 ms.

Then, cells were cross-linked by formaldehyde and harvested. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyer et al. (2006)</xref> with minor modifications. Briefly, cross-linked ESC chromatin was sheared using Covaris S2 system to a size range of 100 bp–400 bp. Immunoprecipitation was conducted with either specific antibody conjugated Protein A Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). ChIP-exo library was prepared by following the published protocol with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rhee and Pugh, 2011</xref>). Specifically, we adapted the SoLid sequencer adaptors/primers to make the final library compatible with the illumina Tru-seq seq small-RNA system. Anti-Sox2 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN Cat. # AF2018, Lot # KOY0112011) antibody was used for the ChIP experiment. The detailed primer information is in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>ChIP-exo peak calling and bound-region definition</title><p>We sequenced exo libraries in 60 bp (Sox2 TSA) single-end format by using the illumina HiSeq platform. After removal of the 3′ most 24 bp (Sox2 TSA) or 14 bp (Sox2 Wild type: 50 bp reads) which tend to have higher error rates, we mapped our sequencing data back to the mouse reference genome (mm10) by Bowtie 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). After mapping, we normalized the total mapped reads for each factor to 40 million. We further reduced the mapped read regions to single 5′-end point, which reflects the cross-linking point between protein and DNA. The resulting cross-linking point distribution was used to identify peaks on the forward (Left) and reverse (Right) strand separately using the peak calling algorithm in GeneTrack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2008</xref>). For bound-region calculation, we first identified any pairs of left and right peaks that were located within 20 bps to each other. Then, we defined the window between the middle point of the left peak and that of the right peak as the bound-region. Peak-pairing and bound-region calculation were performed with Python programming (the script is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Jameszheliu/PeakPairingProgram">https://github.com/Jameszheliu/PeakPairingProgram</ext-link>). Sox2 ChIP-exo sequencing data using wild type ES cells were obtained from GEO with the accession number of GSM1308179 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). Sox2 ChIP-exo data using TSA treated ES cells were deposited to NCBI GEO with the accession number of GSE62972.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is excellent work focusing on the 3D organization of enhancers into spatial clusters and its consequences on Sox2 TF target search dynamics. Sox2 is one of the most important pluripotent TFs that has been studied widely. However, due to its high copy number and numerous targeting sites, it has not been possible to visualize its dynamic organization, which is crucial for understanding how Sox2 differentiates its targeting genes. The authors developed novel in-nucleus single molecule imaging approaches and corresponding analyzing tool sets that are of general value for live cell single molecule studies. In combination with numerical simulations and ChIP-exo mapping, the authors came up with two important conclusions that are new for eukaryotic regulation of gene expression.</p><p>The imaging is of high quality and the datasets are therefore robust. While the clustering is obvious and its analysis relatively straightforward, the rational to describe a switch in exploration modes within Sox2 clusters is questionable. The authors show that binding is different within these two domains and it is not clear how this is an indication of different diffusion modes. Different modes of exploration for transcription factors have been recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izeddin et al 2014</xref>), and it would have been interesting to compare the Sox2 data to this study, especially explaining in more depth how the different modes of exploration described here relate to each other and how the experimental methods leading to these conclusions relate. So, while there is no doubt regarding the novelty and general interest of this work, some of the conclusions are not well-supported by the data presented, and the kinetics interpretation is not self-consistent. The four major issues that need to be addressed are:</p><p>First, a major conclusion of this work is the clustering of Sox2 enhancers. However, the authors provide little evidence to support the conclusion that the sites with &gt;3 sec residence time are indeed enhancer elements. There are a large number of possible explanations for this observation. For example, the long-lived sites could be regions with a high density of nonspecific interaction partners. Alternatively, each site may be an individual enhancer instead of a cluster of enhancers. In a related issue, the authors state that &quot;...enhancer clustering does not appear simply to result from differential chromatin packaging...&quot; and later they entertain two distinct models: a polymer model and TF-directed chromatin looping. Given that Sox2 has thousands of cognate sites, what fraction of Sox2 cognate sequences form clusters? If one can define only two categories, clustered and scattered, what is the proportion of each type and what are the functional implications for the sites that are scattered? To address these inter-related issues, the author should determine whether Sox2 mutants that do not bind to DNA specifically still form clusters. The authors should already have the mutant cell lines as described in their Cell paper published this year. The identification of the in vivo entities that they are imaging and tracking is key to their interpretations. So, a mutant that can't bind specifically is an ideal control, and a reasonable control to expect.</p><p>Second, there is no compelling evidence supporting the conclusion that &quot;a 1D-search mode predominates within individual clusters&quot;. The closest evidence for 1D-search comes from a previously reported in vitro assay that is consistent with, but not directly demonstrating, 1D diffusion (Chen et al 2014). The data presented in this work do not address whether 1D-search occurs in vivo, let alone within individual clusters. Furthermore, the search model and simulation presented in this work do not even include 1D diffusion. The simulation is thus inconsistent with the major claims. This inconsistency may arise from the fact that the simulations that explain the trapping behavior are not sufficiently described. The authors describe the binding sites as being spheres with a 40 nm radius, and one could rationalize that in a clustering scenario these spheres would create a continuous larger binding site. If this is the case, then the effect observed can simply be explained using the Smoluchowski equation as stated by authors. If the authors envision another effect involving a reduction in the search dimensionality, then it is worth describing this effect and showing evidence for it. Among questions important to discuss: why chose 40nm radius; once the binding sites are found, is the binding probability 1 (if yes, why?)? The authors come back to the 3D versus 1D scenarios and this comes in apparent contradiction to the previous simulations, unless the 40 nm binding cross section already accounts sliding, in which case the argument is circular. This part of the manuscript requires a much clearer description of the model and the assumptions, as well as, a much better explanation of the experimental evidence.</p><p>Third, the conclusion that Sox2 enhancers overlap with a subset of PolII enriched regions is poorly justified. The strongest evidence is the small pairwise cross correlation presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. However, as both PolII and Sox2 are diminished in heterochromatins and nucleoli, the spatial distribution is by default correlated, and so is the pixel-to-pixel correlation in the supplement. The authors used permutated distribution to show that the correlation between PolII and Sox2 is above background. But the permutation is only meaningful if it also excludes heterochromatins and nucleoli. Clarification of this issue is also needed.</p><p>Finally, fourth, what are the dynamic properties of EnCs? the authors state: &quot;These transiently formed EnC clusters ...&quot;, but there are no results that clearly describe the dynamic behavior of EnCs in terms of their formation and disassembly, such as the measurements of RPB1 dynamic clustering by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cisse et al. 2013</xref>. Related to this question, the visualization of EnCs is achieved by imaging enhancer-bound Sox2. The work beautifully measured the on-rate of Sox2 in the clusters. How is the off-rate and how is it related to the cluster dynamics? In addition to analyzing dynamics within and out of EnCs, it would be necessary to check if there is anything special around the EnCs, as the chromatin structure may be different around the EnCs compared with the bulk.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04236.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>First, a major conclusion of this work is the clustering of Sox2 enhancers.

However, the issue of specific versus non-specific binding to chromatin/DNA was extensively addressed in our previous Cell paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al, 2014b</xref>) and the relevant results that provide strong evidence for the long-lived binding events to represent site specific interactions are listed below:</p><p>1) We deleted the Sox2 DNA binding domain and tracked its movement. Removal of the DNA binding domain resulted in the disappearance of the long-lived population from the dwell time histograms of the truncated protein, suggesting that long-lived immobile particles most likely correspond to Sox2 occupying specific cognate DNA target sequences.</p><p>2) Mutation of amino acids on the Sox2-DNA binding surface reduced the fraction and lifetime of the long-lived population.</p><p>3) We reconstituted an in vitro purified TF system to study Sox2-DNA interaction kinetics with surface-attached specific and non-specific DNA at single-molecule resolution by TIRF. The analysis of the single-molecule data confirmed that the average residence time of Sox2 on a DNA probe containing a canonical Sox2 binding site is 16.9 s while the average residence time on a non-specific probe is 0.9 s. These numbers are consistent with our “in vivo” residence time measurements - specific (∼12s) and nonspecific (0.8s), thus providing an independent measure consistent with the notion that our in vivo imaging analysis likely successfully resolved specific from non-specific TF-DNA dissociation kinetics (residence time) in live cells.</p><p>4) We also tracked Sox2 binding behavior in 3T3 cells containing or lacking Oct4. With Oct4 over-expression, we observed a significant increase in Sox2 specific residence time. This result strongly suggested that we are indeed measuring the specific residence times of Sox2 at cognate Sox2/Oct4 sites where Oct4 interacts with Sox2 and stabilizes its binding to chromatin.</p><p>Taken together, these previous findings provide compelling support for the conclusion that long-lived residence times we observe can be used to discriminate Sox2 specific from non-specific TF binding at endogenous single copy genes. We believe that a more rigorous test of site specific binding will be possible once we develop imaging methods that can unambiguously detect, identify and track individual gene/promoter loci using strategies such as CRISPR/Cas9 tagging of targeted genes/alleles in the genome in live cells. Our groups at Berkeley and Janelia are actively pursuing this important goal but technology for single gene tracking is proving to be challenging.</p><p>To further test whether the clustering behavior of Sox2 long-lived stable binding sites might arise from non-specific Sox2 interactions in the cell, we specifically investigated the clustering behavior of shorter-lived (&lt; 3 s) Sox2 binding sites that were originally filtered out in our stable binding site mapping experiments. If the Sox2 stable binding sites only reflected random non-specific interactions, the clustering behavior of short lived binding sites would be the same as that of the long lived binding sites. However, in contrast to this prediction, shorter-lived Sox2 binding sites showed dramatically decreased clustering as reflected in the greatly reduced fluctuation amplitudes of the pair correlation function plots. Instead, we found the shorter-lived Sox2 binding sites showed very little clustering and greatly reduced fluctuation amplitudes of the pair correlation function curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We also note that in many cases, we observed little or no clustering of short-lived Sox2 binding sites within the same territories where longer-lived stable Sox2 binding site clusters can clearly be observed (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video3 video6">Videos 3 and 6</xref>). These results suggest that the long-residence time filtering strategy that we deployed here likely enriches for specific binding site signals above the background of non-specific interactions consistent with what we observed previously (Chen et al., 2014).</p><p>There are 2 reasons that it is not possible for us to use Halo-Sox2-TAD protein to perform the control experiments as the reviewers suggested: the majority of the Sox2-TAD binding are very short-lived (less than 0.8 s) so that we cannot apply the 3 second cutoff required for a reasonable comparison. In addition, the halo-Sox2-TAD protein is highly unstable in ES cells and thus its expression levels are too low to be compatible with the imaging strategy required to comprehensively map global binding sites. We have now included these findings in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the blinking of stably bound fluorescently tagged Sox2 molecules significantly influences the observed “stable” binding of Sox2 in the clusters, we plotted the number of detected spots as a function of frame number. These plots show an initial decay that eventually reaches a plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>. Such a temporal decay profile is more consistent with a bleaching dominant mechanism in which an equilibrium state has been achieved between photo-bleaching and diffusive labeling. Moreover, Sox2 specific residence times (∼12s) are relative short compared to the total imaging time (∼20 mins). Perhaps an even stronger argument that the Sox2 clustering pattern we observe is not likely an artifact of the imaging modality can be derived from the fact that imaging chromatin bound halo-H2B molecules failed to show such a prominent clustering pattern. We have modified the revised MS accordingly to include this important point.</p><p>In this paper, we implemented an imaging strategy by taking advantage of the previously characterized dynamic in vivo Sox2-DNA binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>) coupled with the recently developed lattice light-sheet microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>) and improved fluorescent dyes (Grimm et al., Submitted) to systematically map globally where the stable Sox2:DNA binding events occurs inside the 3D space of individual living ES cells. The resulting 3D map is aimed at resolving where stable Sox2 bound enhancers are located in the live cell nucleus rather than to precisely map all Sox2 cognate binding sites and link these sites to specific sequences in the genome defined by ChIP-exo. Clearly, that is a goal that we are working towards but have not yet achieved. Currently, we can make a qualitative conclusion that a reduced Sox2 binding site clustering in the linear genome after TSA treatment correlates with reduced Sox2 stable binding site clustering in 3D. It would be premature for us to make quantitative statements of exactly how many Sox2 binding sites are within each cluster and how many binding sites are scattered outside of clusters. We expect that depending on different cut-offs, analysis methods and sampling depths, the fraction of clustered sites versus scattered sites could vary considerably. Much more theoretical work needs to be conducted with the 3D stable binding site maps from different TFs to determine the optimal cut-offs and methods that should allow us to better define “clustered” versus “scattered” categories.</p><p><italic>Second, there is no compelling evidence supporting the conclusion that &quot;a 1D-search mode predominates within individual clusters&quot;. The closest evidence for 1D-search comes from a previously reported in vitro assay that is consistent with, but not directly demonstrating, 1D diffusion (Chen et al 2014). The data presented in this work do not address whether 1D-search occurs in vivo, let alone within individual clusters. Furthermore, the search model and simulation presented in this work do not even include 1D diffusion. The simulation is thus inconsistent with the major claims. This inconsistency may arise from the fact that the simulations that explain the trapping behavior are not sufficiently described. The authors describe the binding sites as being spheres with a 40 nm radius, and one could rationalize that in a clustering scenario these spheres would create a continuous larger binding site. If this is the case, then the effect observed can simply be explained using the Smoluchowski equation as stated by authors. If the authors envision another effect involving a reduction in the search dimensionality, then it is worth describing this effect and showing evidence for it. Among questions important to discuss: why chose 40nm radius; once the binding sites are found, is the binding probability 1 (if yes, why?)? The authors come back to the 3D versus 1D scenarios and this comes in apparent contradiction to the previous simulations, unless the 40 nm binding cross section already accounts sliding, in which case the argument is circular. This part of the manuscript requires a much clearer description of the model and the assumptions, as well as, a much better explanation of the experimental evidence</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this assessment and have modified our discussion of this point accordingly. To put this in context, we present some of our thoughts on this point. Previous results from our in vitro single molecule experiments strongly suggest that when colliding with DNA nonspecifically, Sox2 undergoes some degree of 1D sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). However, it is important to note that currently no direct assays are available to study in vivo TF-1D sliding on DNA. Thus, we completely agree that we have not been able to prove 1D search in vivo yet. To be conservative, in the revised manuscript, we have moved all the 1D searching related speculation to the discussion and only suggest 1D searching as a possible contributing mechanism.</p><p>Secondly, we need to clarify that in our numerical simulation experiments, we only intend to test how target site clustering might affect the 3D diffusion first passage times (τ<sub>3D</sub>). For this purpose, we define the “Fold of Delay” as the average first passage time in the “clustered” case divided by the averaged first passage time obtained in the “uniform” case. Thus, because the binding probability (1 or not) when the TF reaches individual targets is identical in both the uniform and the clustered cases, the trend that we observed for “Fold of Delay” would be the same due to the normalization step. We have emphasized this point in the revised manuscript and the reason for us to choose 40nm as the target radius is based on DNA polymer model is now described in the text.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that in our simulation experiments, one constraint for generating targets is that there is no overlap between target sites. Specifically, the minimal distance (80nm) allowed between the center of two targets is two times of the target radius (40nm). However, we note that in this case two targets might still in contact with each other on surface. To further eliminate the possibility that targets might create a continuous larger binding site, we reduced to radius of targets to 30nm while maintaining the minimal distance between the centers of two targets as 80nm. In this case, there are no possible contacts between targets. Under this condition, we essentially got very similar simulation results. Thus, it’s highly unlikely that the effects of target site clustering on τ<sub>3D</sub> that we observed was due to target site fusion. The new simulation results have been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>. As the reviewer suggested, we have more explicitly described the parameters for simulation experiments in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Third, the conclusion that Sox2 enhancers overlap with a subset of PolII enriched regions is poorly justified. The strongest evidence is the small pairwise cross correlation presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref><italic>. However, as both PolII and Sox2 are diminished in heterochromatins and nucleoli, the spatial distribution is by default correlated, and so is the pixel-to-pixel correlation in the supplement. The authors used permutated distribution to show that the correlation between PolII and Sox2 is above background. But the permutation is only meaningful if it also excludes heterochromatins and nucleoli. Clarification of this issue is also needed</italic>.</p><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We have conducted pixel-to-pixel correlation in masks defined by Pol II high regions. Regions such as nucleoli and heterochromatin with low Pol II levels were omitted in these masks. Significant positive correlations between Sox2 EnC and Pol II persisted under this condition. The observed positive correlations were diminished when we performed in-mask permutation experiments. These results are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Finally, fourth, what are the dynamic properties of EnCs? the authors state: &quot;These transiently formed EnC clusters ...&quot;, but there are no results that clearly describe the dynamic behavior of EnCs in terms of their formation and disassembly, such as the measurements of RPB1 dynamic clustering by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"><italic>Cisse et al. 2013</italic></xref><italic>. Related to this question, the visualization of EnCs is achieved by imaging enhancer-bound Sox2. The work beautifully measured the on-rate of Sox2 in the clusters. How is the off-rate and how is it related to the cluster dynamics? In addition to analyzing dynamics within and out of EnCs, it would be necessary to check if there is anything special around the EnCs, as the chromatin structure may be different around the EnCs compared with the bulk</italic>.</p><p>To study the dynamic properties of EnCs, we used the time-counting analysis method developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cisse et al. 2013</xref> to probe the temporal profiles of arrival times of stable binding detections within individual clusters. Interestingly, we didn’t observe significant bursting behaviors as described for Pol II clusters. These results are consistent with a model that Sox2 EnCs are relatively stable during the period (∼20mins) of the imaging acquisition. Because Sox2 bound enhancers are chromatin based structures, it’s worth noting that previous FRAP (Fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching) experiments on core histone components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimura and Cook, 2001</xref>) found that large-scale chromatin structures in live cells appeared stable with a half-life of &gt; 2∼4 hours which is much longer than the duration of our imaging experiments. These findings together suggest that the enhancer clustering we observed here likely accurately reflect the average 3D genome organization within reasonably short spatiotemporal length scales.
