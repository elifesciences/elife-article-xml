Two general ideas have emerged. The first proposes that information is held by ongoing activity in neuron ensembles. This, indeed, underlies short-term working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">D’Esposito and Postle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Inagaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang, 2001</xref>). However, it is clear that such a mechanism cannot account for long lasting, enduring memories. For instance, it is well established that patients who recover from prolonged periods of isoelectric EEG and brain stem silence following barbiturate overdose have no detectable cognitive deficits, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bird and Plum, 1968</xref>. The second and generally accepted view, first enunciated by Cajal over a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cajal, 1911</xref>), is the modification of neuronal connections. How these changes might be stored has remained a mystery.</p><p>Over the past few decades, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) has emerged as a very attractive molecular candidate for information storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bayer and Schulman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhattacharyya et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kennedy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lisman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lisman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lisman and Goldring, 1988</xref>). This dodecameric kinase is activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM resulting in autophosphorylation and the activity of the kinase remains after the removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miller and Kennedy, 1986</xref>), a state referred to as autonomy. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the enzyme can undergo activation-triggered subunit exchange such that subunits that did not experience the original Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient are phosphorylated, a mechanism postulated to allow for continued phosphorylation in the face of protein turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhattacharyya et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stratton et al., 2014</xref>) Thus, CaMKII has many attractive biochemical features expected for a memory molecule. What is the physiological evidence for such a role?</p><p>Long-term potentiation (LTP), in which brief high-frequency synaptic stimulation results in a lasting increase in synaptic strength, is an attractive cellular model for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choquet, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Collingridge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huganir and Nicoll, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Malinow and Malenka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nicoll, 2017</xref>). A role for CaMKII in LTP is compelling. Pharmacologically blocking CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Malenka et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Malinow et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Otmakhov et al., 1997</xref>) or genetically deleting CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giese et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Incontro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Silva et al., 1992</xref>) blocks LTP and constitutively active CaMKII both mimics and occludes LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lledo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pettit et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Poncer et al., 2002</xref>). However, despite the attractive biochemical properties of CaMKII, whether CaMKII is involved in the <italic>maintenance</italic> of LTP and, by extension, memory storage remains problematic.</p><p>There are two predictions if CaMKII is responsible for LTP maintenance and synaptic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lisman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sanhueza and Lisman, 2013</xref>). First, transiently blocking CaMKII <italic>after</italic> the induction of LTP should cause a long-lasting erasure. Attempts at reversing LTP have failed on numerous occasions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Malinow et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murakoshi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Otmakhov et al., 1997</xref>), but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng, 1995</xref>. Second, if CaMKII is involved in synaptic memory, one would expect it to leave a lasting trace at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lisman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sanhueza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sanhueza and Lisman, 2013</xref>). Thus, silencing CaMKII should reduce synaptic transmission. Interestingly, the CaMKII/NMDAR complex does exist under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leonard et al., 1999</xref>). However, the genetic deletion of CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achterberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giese et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Silva et al., 1992</xref>), but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hinds et al., 1998</xref>, or pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII does not affect baseline synaptic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Malinow et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murakoshi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Otmakhov et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang and Kelly, 1996</xref>). Finally, using a FRET-based CaMKII sensor, CaMKII activation in spines after LTP induction persists for only ~1 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, physiological support for a role of CaMKII in maintaining LTP or synaptic transmission is lacking.</p><p>Recent findings have prompted us to reevaluate CaMKII’s role in the maintenance of LTP. Deleting CaMKII with CRISPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Incontro et al., 2018</xref>) or expressing a peptide inhibitor of CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goold and Nicoll, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sanhueza et al., 2011</xref>) cause a substantial reduction in synaptic transmission. Furthermore, studies using a membrane permeable peptide inhibitor of CaMKII (tatCN21 or antCN27) have reported a lasting depression in synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barcomb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gouet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sanhueza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sanhueza et al., 2007</xref>) and evidence for a reduction in LTP maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sanhueza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sanhueza et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To reevaluate the role of CaMKII in synaptic memory we have used two different rapidly acting and reversible CaMKII inhibitors. As would be expected if LTP contributes to synaptic memory, inhibition of CaMKII depresses synaptic transmission and the properties of this persistent action of CaMKII are remarkably similar to those of LTP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applying these inhibitors <italic>after</italic> inducing LTP fully reverses LTP, indicating that CaMKII is required for the persistence of LTP. Thus, our findings strongly support CaMKII as a molecular storage device. Reasons for why the present results differ from most previous studies are discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Blocking CaMKII inhibits synaptic transmission</title><p>Previous studies established, both with the expression of inhibitory peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goold and Nicoll, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sanhueza et al., 2011</xref>) or CRISPR deletion of CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Incontro et al., 2018</xref>) that CaMKII contributes ~50% to AMPAR responses. In order to study the basis for this activity as well as the role of CaMKII in LTP maintenance, rapid and reversible block of CaMKII is essential. Since peptide inhibitors have proved most effective, this requires making these peptides membrane permeable either by cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) (e.g., tat) or by protein lipidation (e.g., myristoylation). Delivery of peptides into cells has profound therapeutic potential and therefore has received a great deal of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LeCher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Patel et al., 2019</xref>). The effectiveness of CPPs is hotly debated, because, although these peptides clearly enter the cell by endocytosis, it is not certain to what degree these peptides actually have access to the cytoplasm. This appears not to be an issue with lipid modification.</p><p>As an initial assay we bathed acute slices in a peptide inhibitor and measured the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio. We would expect the ratio to be reduced by ~50%, since expressing these peptides had no effect on NMDAR currents. We first tested the effectiveness of tatCN21 (5 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barcomb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sanhueza et al., 2011</xref>) in reducing the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In agreement with previous reports, we failed to see an effect on AMPAR responses. Since higher concentrations of tatCN21 have significant nonspecific effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barcomb et al., 2016</xref>), we turned to other peptides. Previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goold and Nicoll, 2010</xref>) showed that prolonged (1–2 days) incubation with myr-CN27 (10 µM) caused a ~50% reduction in the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio. We, therefore, repeated this experiment with shorter incubations (1–2 hr) and a lower concentration (1 µM) and found that myr-CN27 reduced the ratio by ~50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). What might account for the lack of effect of tatCN21? To address this, we repeated the experiment using myr-CN21 (5 μM) and found that it reduced the ratio by ~50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that lipidation is a more effective mode of delivery than CPPs. We, therefore, selected myr-CN27 for our studies.</p><p>Application of myr-CN27 to acute slices (1 μM) caused a highly reproducible slowly developing depression of synaptic AMPAR mediated EPSCs, which stabilized after approximately 40 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). A number of experiments were carried out to ensure that the effect we observe with myr-CN27 is due to the specific inhibition of CaMKII. First, in many experiments we measured the size of the NMDAR EPSC, by depolarizing the cell to +40 mV before and after the application of the peptide. We found that myr-CN27 had no effect on the NMDAR EPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, red circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Second, it is important to note that the magnitude of the decrease in transmission seen with myr-CN27 is similar to that reported with the genetic deletion of CaMKIIα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Incontro et al., 2018</xref>) suggesting that myr-CN27 fully silences CaMKII. Finally, we examined the effects of myr-CN27 in cells lacking CaMKIIα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). CaMKIIα was deleted using CRISPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Incontro et al., 2018</xref>). We simultaneously recorded from control cells and cells lacking CaMKIIα in slice culture. In the absence of CaMKIIα (green circle) synaptic responses were ~50% of control (black circles), as expected. Application of myr-CN27 depressed controls cells to the level recorded in cells lacking CaMKIIα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>, black circles), but it had no additional effect on cells lacking CaMKIIα (green circles) (<italic>n</italic> = 6). These results demonstrate that the effect of CN27 is fully explained by its selective and complete silencing of CaMKIIα.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor myr-CN27 inhibits AMPAR synaptic transmission through CaMKIIα.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course of myr-CN27 (1 µM) inhibition on AMPAR EPSCs and NMDAR EPSCs in acute slices.

We still recorded a depression, but in this case the depression took tens of minutes to develop (black symbols). We interleaved these experiments with whole cell recording and confirmed that the depression is considerably faster (blue symbols). We interpret the difference in time course to the fact that whole cell recordings are made from superficial cells, while field potential responses are generated by populations of neurons throughout the depth of the slice. Penetration of peptides into the slice is expected to be slow.</p><p>We next examined the effects of AIP, a peptide inhibitor designed from the autoinhibitory domain. We first expressed AIP in neurons in slice culture and compared AMPAR and NMDAR responses to those in simultaneously recorded neighboring control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similar to the effect of expressing CN27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goold and Nicoll, 2010</xref>) or applying myr-CN27 (see above), there was a selective ~50% reduction in the AMPAR EPSC, but no change in the NMDAR response. Given these positive results, we bathed acute slices in myr-AIP (20 μM) and measured the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<italic>n</italic> = 12). The ratio was significantly reduced. Acute application of myr-AIP in slice culture caused a slowly developing depression in synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, black circles) (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and this effect is due to the selective inhibition of CaMKII, because interleaved recording from cells in which CaMKIIα had been deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, green circles), myr-AIP no longer had any effect (<italic>n</italic> = 5). These findings show that myr-CN27 and myr-AIP selectively and completely inhibit CaMKII, both in acute slices and in slice culture. It is interesting that, while CaMKII is expressed presynaptically and reported to effect transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benfenati et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hinds et al., 2003</xref>), there was no presynaptic effect of the peptide inhibitors.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor AIP inhibits AMPAR synaptic transmission through CaMKIIα.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In culture slices, transfection of AIP reduced AMPAR EPSCs (left, <italic>n</italic> = 10, p &lt; 0.01, two-tailed Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test) but not NMDAR EPSCs (right, <italic>n</italic> = 10, p &gt; 0.05, two-tailed Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test).

Is this due to the slow access of these peptides to the cell interior, or is it due to the slow reversal of the action of CaMKII? To address this, we turned to a novel light inducible inhibitor of CaMKII, in which the inhibitory peptide AIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ishida et al., 1998</xref>) is linked to the LOV-Jα helix domain of Phototropin (referred to as paAIP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murakoshi et al., 2017</xref>). Blue light rapidly exposes the AIP2 peptide, which then returns to its closed inactive conformation in approximately 40 s following light exposure. We expressed paAIP2 in individual neurons with biolistics, which, unlike the myristoylated peptides, has the advantage of limiting the manipulation to individual postsynaptic cells. The synaptic properties of neurons expressing paAIP2 were not different from the properties of neighboring control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>) (<italic>n</italic> = 16). Exposure of these cells to blue light resulted in a slowly developing inhibition of AMPAR responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<italic>n</italic> = 12), similar to the kinetics of myr-CN27 and myr-AIP.

First, it could represent ongoing constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of CaMKII from various sources. It seems unlikely that resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maravall et al., 2000</xref>) stimulate CaMKII, since the sensitivity of CaMKII to Ca<sup>2+</sup> requires considerably higher levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schulman, 1984</xref>). To directly test whether constitutive CaMKII activity is Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent, we loaded cells with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA (15 mM). However, myr-CN27 retained its depressive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This finding also rules out spontaneous background NMDAR activity as a source for the constitutive CaMKII activity. In addition, acute application of the NMDAR antagonist APV has little effect on AMPAR EPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Incontro et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The constitutive activity might reflect an LTP process induced by slice preparation, which is known to depolarize cells and release glutamate. To address this possibility, we pretreated animals with a high dose of MK-801, which is known to block in vivo NMDAR responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davies et al., 1988</xref>). To verify that NMDARs were blocked by this procedure, we recorded NMDAR EPSCs from slices from these animals and found that the NMDAR EPSC was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Having confirmed the absence of NMDAR responses the slices were perfused with MK-801. Under such conditions myr-CN27 still exerted its inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Second, if CaMKII is involved in synaptic memory, one would expect that LTP acquired when the animal was alive, would contribute to synaptic transmission, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lisman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sanhueza and Lisman, 2013</xref>). If this is the case, there are a number of predictions. One would expect that the transient inhibition of CaMKII should result in long-lasting inhibition, akin to the resetting of a molecular switch. In a number of cells, we monitored the depression over time following the removal of myr-CN27 and found no recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). One might argue that myr-CN27 fails to washout of the cells. To circumvent this possibility, we repeated these experiments with paAIP2 whose action rapidly reverses upon terminating the blue light (~40 s). Again, we failed to observe any recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We confirmed that this was not due to the continued action of the inhibitor, by demonstrating that LTP could be induced following light termination (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The depression caused by transient inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is long lasting and is absent in cells lacking NMDARs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In acute slices, time course showing that following myr-CN27 application AMPAR synaptic transmission remains depressed (the difference between before and after myr-CN27: <italic>n</italic> = 4, p &lt; 0.01, two-tailed Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test).

We carried out in utero electroporation to express cre recombinase in neurons in GluN1 floxed mice. Transfected cells were recorded at P16–20 in acute slices. We first carried out paired recordings in the AMPAR inhibitor CNQX to ensure that cre expressing neurons lacked NMDAR EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left panel). We then compared the action of myr-AIP in transfected cells with that in interleaved control cells and normalized the baseline to 100%. Myr-CN27 had no effect in these cells. Application of myr-AIP had no effect in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, middle and right panels, green circles and traces), whereas it had its normal inhibitory effect in interleaved control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, black circles and traces), further supporting the conclusion that the persistent CaMKII activity represents prior LTP. A caveat to these experiments is that the synaptic action of CaMKII requires its binding to the GluN2B C-terminus of the NMDAR. Thus, the loss of GluN2B in the GluN1 lacking neurons could equally explain the loss of effect of myr-CN27. To address this concern we repeated these experiments, replacing GluN1 with a pore dead GluN1 mutant (N812W) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2017</xref>). While this mutant assembles normally with GluN2 subunits and traffics normally to the membrane, it generates little current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2017</xref>). We carried out in utero electroporation in GluN1 floxed mice to transfect Cre and GluN1(N812W). Thus, this genetic experiment is the equivalent of having APV present in utero and until acute slices were made at P14–18. The NMDAR EPSC in transfected neurons was severely reduced, when compared to neighboring control cells recorded in CNQX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, left panel). The depressant effect of myr-CN27 recorded in these transfected cells was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, middle and right panels). These results suggest that in behaving animals, cells that lack NMDAR function, but with GluN2B intact, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling independent of the NMDAR appears incapable of activating CaMKII, at least in regard to its action on synaptic function.</p><p>Since LTP is saturable, one might expect that when constitutive activity is <italic>transiently</italic> silenced, the magnitude of LTP should be larger than that in control conditions. To test this prediction, we transfected paAIP2 in utero and prepared acute slices at days P15–25. The slices were exposed to blue light for 40 min and then simultaneous recordings were made from a transfected cell and a control cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In a typical experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), as well as in the summary of all experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), the size of baseline EPSCs in paAIP2 expressing cells following blue light exposure was, as expected, approximately half of that of the control neighboring cells. LTP was then induced in both cells. To compare the magnitude of LTP in the two cells we normalized the baseline EPSCs to 100%. As is clear, both in the single experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and in the summary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), the magnitude of LTP in cells expressing paAIP2 is approximately twice that of control cells. This interaction between the constitutive potentiation and LTP is consistent with their sharing the same underlying mechanism. Taken together these results strongly support the conclusion that while the animal is alive, LTP is acquired and leaves a synaptic memory trace.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Blocking CaMKII erases LTP</title><p>The experiments presented thus far are all consistent with the notion that synapses acquire LTP that contributes to synaptic transmission. If this is correct, then inhibiting CaMKII <italic>after</italic> LTP induction must reverse the potentiation. Yet, as discussed in the introduction, this experiment has failed on numerous occasions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Malinow et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murakoshi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Otmakhov et al., 1997</xref>), but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng, 1995</xref>. Thus, it was mandatory that we revisit this crucial experiment. We therefore carried out a ‘two pathway experiment’, in which the responses from two independent pathways were recorded from a single cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Following the recording of baseline responses, LTP was induced in one of the pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, red circles) by pairing depolarization of the cell to 0 mV with continued synaptic stimulation, while in the other control pathway, stimulation was stopped during the depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, black circles). Once LTP had been established, myr-CN27 was applied and the effect on both pathways recorded. Myr-CN27 caused a complete reversal of established LTP and as expected, a ~50% reduction in the control pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). A summary of all the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 11) demonstrates that in the presence of myr-CN27 the LTP pathway and control pathway converge to approximately 50% of the control. This experiment establishes the essential role of CaMKII in maintaining LTP. A previous field potential study using tatCN21 (5 μM) failed to observe a reversal of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buard et al., 2010</xref>). We, therefore, repeated our two pathway experiment using field potential recording. Again, we observed that myr-CN27 (1 μM) caused a slow reduction the EPSPs in the control pathway and a reversal of LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

On the one hand, the biochemical properties of CaMKII have for decades made this molecule an extremely attractive candidate for molecular storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhattacharyya et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coultrap and Bayer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lisman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lisman et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, numerous physiological experiments over the years have failed to support the role of CaMKII in the <italic>maintenance</italic> of LTP and by extension memory. To reevaluate the physiological role of CaMKII in synaptic memory, we have used two classes of CaMKII inhibitory peptides. With these inhibitors we find that CaMKII is required for the maintenance of LTP and provide evidence that LTP acquired while the animal was alive leaves a lasting synaptic memory trace.</p><p>The first class of inhibitory peptide we used is derived from an endogenous CaMKII inhibitory protein referred to as CaMKIINtide (CN27) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goold and Nicoll, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pellicena and Schulman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vest et al., 2007</xref>). The second class of inhibitory peptide is derived from the autoinhibitory domain of CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leonard et al., 1999</xref>). Although these inhibitory peptides were thought to bind to separate sites (S and T sites), recent structural studies of the binding of GluN2B and other interacting peptides to CaMKII indicate that these peptides use similar interactions to bind across the substrate binding pocket of the CaMKII active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Özden et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, at present it is not possible to use these two classes of inhibitors to distinguish between the disruption of GluN2B binding and the blockade of kinase activity. These peptides included a myristoylated version of CN27 (myr-CN27), AIP (myr-AIP) and a recently developed photoactivatable peptide inhibitor (paAIP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murakoshi et al., 2017</xref>). Both classes of peptides block kinase activity with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ishida et al., 1998</xref>), but also interfere with the binding of CaMKII to GluN2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sanhueza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vest et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments clearly establish that inhibitory peptides fully reverse LTP. How long is CaMKII responsible for maintaining LTP? Experiments addressing the role of constitutive CaMKII in the maintenance of LTP are constrained by the length of recording; approximately 1 hr for whole cell and a few hours for field potentials. However, if LTP is the substrate for memory, it should leave a lasting memory trace at synapses, acquired while the animal is alive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lisman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sanhueza and Lisman, 2013</xref>). A number of studies have reported a lasting depression following transient inhibition of CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barcomb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gouet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sanhueza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sanhueza et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, even under basal conditions, CaMKII is found in isolated PSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Petersen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Strack et al., 1997</xref>) and synaptic puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayer et al., 2006</xref>) and this is in the autophosphorylated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Strack et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trinidad et al., 2005</xref>). As discussed above all three inhibitory peptides (myr-CN27, myr-AIP, and paAIP2) depress synaptic transmission and this depression requires the presence of CaMKII. A number of trivial explanations, such as ongoing constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of the enzyme, were excluded.</p><p>We then focused on the possibility that this constitutive action of CaMKII reflects prior LTP. First, the finding that the inhibition does not affect NMDAR responses is consistent with an LTP mechanism, since LTP preferentially enhances AMPAR responses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nicoll, 2017</xref>). Second, there should be no recovery from the transient inhibition of CaMKII, analogous to the resetting of a molecular switch. This is, indeed, the case. Third, cells in which the NMDAR has been deleted embryonically should be devoid of the constitutive activity. Again, this is the case. This is unlikely to be due to the loss of GluN2B subunit, because cells expressing a pore dead NMDAR mutant, in which assembles with GluN2B, had little CaMKII constitutive activity. This finding suggests that non-NMDAR sources of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the behaving animal are incapable of triggering CaMKII-dependent enhancement in synaptic transmission. This tight linking of NMDAR sources of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to CaMKII is critical, because it prevents the degrading of the Hebbian nature of plasticity. Finally, it is well established that LTP is saturable. Thus, if constitutively action CaMKII represents LTP, removing this component should allow for larger LTP. We find that in cells in which CaMKII is transiently blocked LTP is approximately twice as large as in neighboring control cells. Taken together these results suggest that constitutive CaMKII represents LTP acquired at synapses while the animal was alive, thus supporting a role for CaMKII in synaptic memory.</p><p>Based on the present results the term ‘basal synaptic transmission’ needs to be reevaluated. It has generally been assumed that the synapses studied in a hippocampal slice, in which much of the afferent drive from multiple inputs have been removed in the slicing, are at a ground ‘basal’ state. The present results indicate that the synaptic currents we measure are actually maintained by a persistent enhancement acquired prior to slicing.</p><p>It should be pointed out that the contribution of CaMKII to synaptic transmission is unlikely to be a simple addition to the overall preexisting excitatory drive onto the cell. It has long been argued that such a scenario would be unstable and quickly saturate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bienenstock et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cooper and Bear, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fusi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morrison et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Toyoizumi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Turrigiano, 2008</xref>). A number of well-established mechanisms exist to maintain stability, including heterosynaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Scanziani et al., 1996</xref>), NMDAR-dependent long-term depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Malenka and Bear, 2004</xref>) and on a longer time scale cell wide homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Turrigiano, 2008</xref>). Thus, it is envisaged that the CaMKII memory trace is embedded in a network of synapses with no overall net change in the excitatory drive onto the cell or network.</p><p>It is striking to compare the action of paAIP2 on LTP induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murakoshi et al., 2017</xref>) and on synaptic transmission (present study). A brief light exposure (~1 min), delivered immediately prior to inducing LTP, is sufficient to prevent LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murakoshi et al., 2017</xref>). This finding indicates that the blocking of CaMKII activation by paAIP2 is very rapid. In contrast, the effect on synaptic transmission and the reversal of LTP required 10’s of minutes. What might explain the dramatic difference in the kinetics of inhibition of LTP induction compared to LTP maintenance and constitutive CaMKII? There is a well-accepted sequence of events for the role of CaMKII in the induction of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coultrap and Bayer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lisman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nicoll, 2017</xref>). Following NMDAR activation Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds to CaM, which then binds to CaMKII activating the enzyme. This causes the autophosphorylation of T286 and the translocation of cytosolic CaMKII to the PSD where it binds to the C-tail of GluN2B. It seems reasonable to expect that under baseline conditions much of CaMKII and paAIP2 are freely diffusible in the spine cytoplasm, as are phosphatases. The activation of paAIP2 would quickly inhibit CaMKII autophosphorylation and its recruitment to the PSD and phosphatases would quickly reverse its effect. During baseline transmission and during the maintenance of LTP a fraction of CaMKII is bound to GluN2B. Evidence suggests that the CaMKII/GluN2B complex is protected from phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheriyan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lisman and Raghavachari, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mullasseril et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, reversing action of this sequestered CaMKII would be more difficult than preventing phosphorylation of cytosolic CaMKII.</p><p>The present results could shed light on the underlying mechanism of long-term depression (LTD). Although this topic remains contentious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Collingridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goodell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lisman and Zhabotinsky, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Malenka and Bear, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wong and Gray, 2018</xref>), the long-held view is that LTD is mediated by the activation of phosphatases, in particular protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mulkey et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mulkey et al., 1993</xref>). One of the limitations to this model is the lack of evidence that synaptic transmission is maintained by kinase activity. Our demonstration that CaMKII maintains synaptic transmission provides a very simple model for LTD, that is, a depotentiation or reversal of this prior LTP. One of the features of LTD is that it takes many minutes for its induction. Our finding that it takes many minutes for CaMKII inhibitors to depress synaptic transmission provides an explanation for this property. A formal model for the interplay between CaMKII and PP1 was proposed some time ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lisman and Zhabotinsky, 2001</xref>). The absence of LTD in CaMKII knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Coultrap et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stevens et al., 1994</xref>) supports such a model, but does not rule out other models.</p><p>What might account for the failure of previous studies to detect a component of synaptic transmission driven by constitutive CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achterberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giese et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Malinow et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murakoshi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Otmakhov et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Silva et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang and Kelly, 1996</xref>), but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hinds et al., 1998</xref>, or to detect a role of constitutive CaMKII in maintaining LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Malinow et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murakoshi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Otmakhov et al., 1997</xref>), but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng, 1995</xref>? We suggest three factors. The first concerns the duration of peptide application, which in our hands takes 10’s of minutes to act, especially with field potential recording. The second concerns the concentration and time. As discussed above it is more difficult to reverse the constitutive action of CaMKII, than it is to block its activation. Finally, the membrane permeabilizing agent is important. In our hands myristoylation was more effective and specific than the CPP, tat.</p><p>In summary our results overcome many of the obstacles that have prevented embracing CaMKII as a molecular storage device. Specifically, our results show that transient inhibition of CaMKII results in a lasting depression of synaptic transmission with properties consistent with the erasure of prior LTP acquired while the animal was alive. Furthermore, the finding that CaMKII inhibition <italic>after</italic> the induction of LTP reverses LTP establishes its role in LTP maintenance. Thus, these physiological results compliment the rich biochemical literature on CaMKII, making CaMKII a particularly attractive molecular storage device. It is important to note, that our results have focused on LTP and it remains open as to whether CaMKII actually stores memories. Recent experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rossetti et al., 2017</xref>) using the viral expression of the catalytically dead CaMKII K42M mutant, presumed to act in a dominant negative manner, support its role in memory.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All the experimental procedures on animals were approved by the UCSF Animal Care and Use Committee, BUA # BU002466-04C.

By using various means to perturb CaMKII activity and activation, the authors provide evidence for the notion that CaMKII remains activated for extended periods of time after LTP induction and might thus be part of a synaptic memory mechanism.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>Revisions Requiring Additional Data/Experiments</p><p>1. The new data of the present study are in disagreement with a host of previously published studies, which indicated that CaMKII activation is generally rather short-lived and transient. Instead, the authors propose that a subfraction of CaMKII remains activated to store memory. The authors' main explanation for the data discrepancy (i.e. prolonged inhibition &gt;30 min) is not fully convincing as some effects documented in the present study are seen earlier and within a time frame that others have also looked at. The reviewers are missing experimental approaches to resolve the striking data discrepancy, e.g. by comparing their assay conditions with those used by others.</p><p>2. No data to identify the persistently active CaMKII subfraction or its target proteins are presented, leaving the entire notion of memory-CaMKII still speculative. The manuscript would be strengthened substantially with direct evidence on the 'memory-CaMKII', e.g. biochemical proof of activated CaMKII. For instance, the authors could test their model of GluN2B/CaMKII interaction biochemically with CoIPs to identify the constitutively active CaMKII (e.g. through T286 phosphorylation, which should be absent with no LTP/memory). This experiment could be controlled with a GluN2B mutant that lacks the interaction.</p><p>3. The control experiment for no LTP is problematic. Knocking out NMDA receptors increases synaptic strength, as the authors showed previously. Furthermore, NR2B, which the authors propose in their model to be the scaffolding protein for active CaMKII, is not present. Thus, multiple changes occur in this experiment, of which the authors pick one as support for their claim that LTP is missing. The authors need to show how this control prevents the formation of the 'memory-CaMKII'. It seems that this is not possible with the documented experiment as synaptic GluN2B is removed, which is proposed to be the candidate interactor/scaffold of the 'memory-CaMKII'.</p><p>4. Figure 4 and S4: The run-up of the baseline has a similar slope as the increase after LTP induction, which is problematic. Peptide experiments should be performed with fEPSP recordings with 'solid' baseline rather than 3-point 'baseline'. In essence, it would be helpful to have different LTP protocols to show the same effect. Using cell-permeable peptides does not require whole cell recordings. With fEPSP, the issue of LTP wash-out as a rationale for the short baseline can be circumvented.</p><p>5. Figure 6: Compared to Figure 4, the LTP in control is rather reduced and not enhanced in paAIP2. It is not uncommon that effect sizes vary, but here it is used as the single line of evidence to indicate that the peptides create more 'room' for later LTP. The experiment needs to be better controlled, e.g. with interleaved experiments.</p><p>Revisions Requiring Text Redaction</p><p>6. The peptides used to perturb CaMKII function are probably among the best tools currently available. However, their specificity remains an issue. They have never been tested systematically but only on a handful of targets. CaMKIINtides have other 'structural' effects than the one on NR2B binding, i.e. interactions with other proteins, and AIP peptides are known to have effects on processes that are not CaMKII-related (Pellicena and Schulman – Front Pharmacol 2014). This issue should be included in the discussion as a general caveat.</p><p>7. There are no data to show that LTP accumulates during life. Such evidence would be important to support the model propose. Age and LTP 'experience' are not generally applicable criteria when switching back and forth between cultured and acute slices. In essence, one would not expect 'memories' in slice culture, but the effects of the peptides appear to be the same in the two culture systems. With regard to the NMDAR KO experiment, it is then argued that it prevents the formation of in vivo memories and so that no effect of the peptide inhibitors is seen. Thus, whether in vivo or in vitro, synapses appear to 'learn' the same amount. The line of logic in the discussion of these data is not entirely convincing. Given that showing that the corresponding synapses have been LTPed in vivo is highly non-trivial, it is suggested that alternative models and explanations are discussed.</p><p>8. Generally, and in the context of the point above, the reviewers suggest to substantially tone down the claim that a mechanism of memory is identified. CaMKII has both basic and potentiation-related synaptic function, which all might well overlap.</p><p>9. LTP is synapse specific. Erasing LTP by blocking the memory molecule would thus be expected to be synapse specific as well. However, both control and LTP pathway are affected by CaMKII perturbation. The authors argue that this is due to LTP accumulation during life. The support for this claim is limited. As the authors show, basal synaptic transmission is reduced by the CaMKII inhibitors. Whether this is LTPed synaptic strength is not clear. An alternative explanation would be that during early LTP expression, before consolidation, LTP can be reversed by inhibiting CaMKII. This should be discussed.</p><p>10. In CaMKII-α KO mice, LTP is impaired but not absent (Silva et al. – Science 1992). Furthermore, CaMKII autophosphorylation was proposed to facilitate LTP induction, but is not essential (Chang et al. – Neuron 2017). These results are consistent with an important role of CaMKII in LTP, but indicate that the magnitude of LTP blockade depends on the induction protocol and is more in agreement with induction and consolidation of LTP rather than long-term memory. This should be discussed.</p><p>11. Halt et al. (EMBO J 2012) proposed that memory consolidation requires the CaMKII/NR2B interaction. The effects of the inhibiting peptides after 10s of minutes, as seen in the present study, are consistent with this notion; whether long-term memory is affected, as proposed in the present study, is not shown. The major novelty of the present study would be that a fraction of CaMKII remains constitutively active to store memory. Reversal of LTP in 30-60 min is not necessarily related to long-term memory, and the notion that reduction of basal transmission reflects the same mechanism is not straight forward. This should be discussed. If more evidence in support of the memory-CaMKII idea can be provided (see above), additional experiments in the context of this item are not expected.</p><p>12. Figure 2: The effect of AIP expression appears less than 50%. A summary point of two different cell populations is incorrect (see e.g. Levy et al. – Neuron 2015; Kim et al. – Neuron 2015). The data need to be plotted differently and an explanation as to why the effect is smaller needs to be attempted.</p><p>13. Figure S5: The effect of myr-CN27 with MK-801 appears smaller than in other conditions. Does activity in slices before recording have an effect?</p><p>14. Line 36: It is unclear what data would support the notion that LTP accumulates during life. The corresponding passage should be referenced or rephrased.</p><p>15. Lines 76-78: This claim is incorrect. Halt et al. proposed a function for CaMKII in memory consolidation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Synaptic memory is maintained by persistent CaMKII activity&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved very substantially, but there are several remaining issues that we regard to be important:</p><p>Data Interpretation and Discussion</p><p>1. CaMKII Enzymatic Activity vs. Protein Interactions. The firm conclusion that it is continued CaMKII activity rather than CaMKII binding to relevant postsynaptic binding partners (e.g. the C-terminus of GluN2B) is still not justified by the data. Notably, CaMKII binding to GluN2B was shown to be important for LTP (Barria and Malinow, 2005; Halt et al., 2012). Earlier evidence indicates that the CN27-related CN21 peptide reverses LTP by displacing CaMKII from GluN2B and not by inhibiting CaMKII but (Sanchueza et al., 2011). The authors argue that the AIP peptide only inhibits CaMKII activity without displacing it from GluN2B because earlier work showed that addition of untagged AIP during immunoprecipitation of CaMKII does not disrupt co-precipitation of the NMDAR at 20 μm (Leonard et al., 1999). However, although AIP does not disrupt the preformed CaMKII-NMDAR complex (Leonard et al., 1999), expression of it in HeLa cells prevents binding of CaMKII to GluN2B (see Suppl Figure 2 in Murakoshi et al., 2017). In other words, when expressed in intact cells, AIP does inhibit CaMKII binding to GluN2B. This could also be the case when myrAIP is applied to intact cells,. Perhaps in intact cells CaMKII has a tendency to unbind from GluN2B (potentially due to dephosphorylation of T286) and AIP augments this unbinding or prevents re-binding (potentially by inhibiting re-phosphorylation), while in vitro in immunoprecipitates there is no unbinding and AIP cannot displace CaMKII from GluN2B. The issue of AIP acting by inhibiting CaMKII activity vs. CaMKII binding to GluN2B is exacerbated by recently published data indicating that S and T site binding of substrates vs. docking proteins for CaMKII might not be separable (Özden et al., 2020: CaMKII binds both substrates 1 and effectors at the active site. bioRxivhttps://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.25.354241). This work indicates that T and S sites form a continuum and that most – if not all – binding peptides will affect both, kinase activity and binding to anchoring proteins. Furthermore, the authors argue that their myrCN27 acts via CaMKII inhibition and not CaMKII displacement from GluN2B. Their reasoning is that they had a full effect at 1 μm of myrCN27 whereas Sanchueza et al. (2011) reported that 20 but not 5 μm of the related tat-CN21 displaced CaMKII from GluN2B (and that this correlated with a decrease in transmission and reversal of LTP during maintenance phase), when 5 μm tat-CN21 was sufficient to block CaMKII activity and LTP induction presumably because 5 μm is sufficient to block kinase activity. However, myrCN27 is longer than CN21 and the myr tag could promote binding of this peptide to CaMKII, so it could be much more potent than tat-CN21 in displacing CaMKII from GluN2B and already accomplish displacement at 1 uM.</p><p>Because of the considerations above, it is mandatory that the authors modify the respective discussion and do not dismiss the notion that 1 μm myrCN27 and AIP in general could have acted by displacing CaMKII.</p><p>2. In-Vivo-LTP. The authors argue that GluN1 KO prevents LTP expression in vivo and that this experimental approach could therefore test whether previous LTP in vivo is required for the dependence of synaptic strength on CaMKII. Indeed, the results are consistent with this line of argumentation. However, GluN1 KO has multiple additional effects: It increases synaptic strength and eliminates synaptic NR2B expression, which is thought to be the anchor for active CaMKII. Furthermore, multiple forms of synaptic plasticity (e.g. LTP, LTD, scaling, a.o.) occur during the lifetime of an animal, and notably, NMDARs, CaMKIIα, and CaMKIIαβ were reported to be involved in these forms of plasticity. Thus, the interpretation that in GluN1 KO neurons LTP is absent in vivo is reasonable, but given the other consequences of the KO, it is not conclusive. To further link the requirement of constitutively active CaMKII to in vivo LTP, the authors use a type of occlusion experiment. They express the photoactivatable AIP in neurons in utero. Then activate AIP for 40 min in slices after which they start recording. Like inhibition while stimulating, the inhibition without stimulation reduced AMPAR EPSC by 50% compared to neighboring control neurons. LTP in the previously inhibited neurons was about 2-times bigger than that in control neurons. The authors argue that the inhibition of CaMKII liberated &quot;space&quot; for more LTP. Given that LTP is saturable, the origin of this increased &quot;space&quot; is not clear. It could be due to a shift of the baseline further away from the ceiling or, as argued, to the reversal of in vivo LTP that is then newly triggered. Again, a suggestive interpretation, but not conclusive. In a final experiment, the authors report that 1 µM myr-CN27 reverts LTP during the expression phase. The experiment is performed in a two-pathway experiment, in which both the control non-induced pathway, as well as the induced pathway are reduced. Notably, the strength of the LTPed pathway settles at the same strength as the control pathway, indicating that both basal and the new LTPed synaptic strength is reduced. Myr-AIP is reported to have a similar effect at 20 µM, but not 1 µM. While the 1 µM serves as an important peptide control, the effect of the 20 µM is not as efficient as the 1 µM myr-CN27 as after around 60 min, some potentiation is left and EPSCs are not reduced to 50% of baseline. In a single experiment with field EPSP, myr-CN27 also reduces the fEPSPs of both the LTPed and control pathway, but in the time window observed, the responses do not converge. While these results indicate that CaMKII activity during expression is required, they do not necessarily translate into a mechanism selective for LTP, e.g. that the reduction in control pathway is based on in-vivo-acquired LTP. The different outcomes of the myr-CN27 peptide, the myr-AIP peptide in whole-cell recordings, and the myr-CN27 peptide in fEPSP are fully consistent with different mechanisms, e.g. with CaMKII activity being required for the expression of LTP, while structural assembly being required to stabilize basal synaptic transmission, as reported previously. To distinguish between these possibilities, information about on which CaMKII populations the different peptides operate would be important, e.g. whether myr-CN27 dissociates CaMKII from NR2B, or whether myr-AIP or myr-CN27 change the autoactivation of CaMKII.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study identifies an essential role of CaMKII activity for basal synaptic transmission and LTP expression. It is convincingly shown that this relates to differential effects of cell-penetrating peptides. However, the title and abstract appear too far-fetched as the results do not conclusively show that basal synaptic transmission is the product of acquired in vivo LTP. The reviewers urge the authors to address this issue by more conservative wording of title, abstract, and relevant text passages.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60360.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>Revisions Requiring Additional Data/Experiments</p><p>1.

We have rewritten the beginning of the Results section by discussing the background involved in our focusing on myr-CN27. We discuss the pros and cons of using cell permeabilizing peptides (CPPs) and protein lipidation, which we believe has an impact on our results. We also touch base with previous results with tatCN21. In addition, given that almost all of the previous data used field potential recordings, we repeated some of our key experiments with field potential recording. First, we tested myr-CN27 on baseline transmission. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> (black symbols) the effect of myr-CN27 is considerably slower that seen with interleaved whole cell recording (blue symbols) and takes on average about 2 hours to stabilize. The most likely explanation for this is that with whole cell recording, cells near the surface are recorded, whereas with field potentials the peptide must diffuse throughout the slice.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60360-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Second, we repeated the myr-CN27 “eraser” experiment with field potential recording (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In the classic paper of Seth Grant {Husi, 2000 #1497} he showed the CoIP of CaMKII with NMDARs. Furthermore {Leonard, 1999 #2681} showed that CaMKII/NMDAR complex exists under basal conditions. Finally, Halt et al. {Halt, 2012 #2216} showed that this interaction is reduced in their knockin mouse, in which the C-tail of GluN2B no longer binds to CaMKII. Since CaMKII must be in its active form to bind to GluN2B and that this interaction “locks” CaMKII in an active conformation {Bayer, 2001 #955}, we feel that this set of results does address the reviewer’s request. If the reviewer insists that we perform further biochemical experiments, we will be forced to withdraw the manuscript, since my lab is not currently capable of such experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We had planned to address this issue by comparing the effect of deleting GluN1 to that of replacing GluN1 with a pore dead mutant form of GluN1 from Lonnie Wollmuth. If the pore dead mutant recues the defect our hypothesis would have to be discarded. Alternatively, the failure to rescue would argue for the need for a functional NMDA receptor. This negative result would be couple to immunocytochemistry to ensure that the GluN1 pore dead mutant colocalizes with PSD-95. Unfortunately, we have worked on this experiment for over six months. It has involved generating GluN1 forebrain KO mice and because of the pandemic and numerous technical problems we have been unsuccessful. We suggest two possible alternatives. First, we include the data and explain explicitly that an alternative explanation for the results is the loss of the GluN2B C-tail (current version). Or, if the reviewer insists, we can remove this data from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We have studied LTP with whole cell recording for many years and there is definitely a trade off in terms of how much baseline one can get and the rate at which LTP washes out. In most of our experiments we carry out interleaved control experiments to assess the stability of the recordings. (Typically, there is a run up of ~30-50%) In other cases we use a control pathway to monitor stability. In the experiments in Figure 4 we have a control pathway. Both pathways show the same run up prior to LTP, but the control pathway remains stable during the recording until the peptide is applied. This, to me, is a tightly controlled experiment. In Figure S4 the experiments with the 20 μm Myr-AIP were obtained immediately after those with the lower dose, so they are obtained under the same conditions. As discussed above we have repeated some of our key experiments with field potential recording in which longer baselines are recorded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Traditionally this variability is controlled for by carrying out interleaved experiments. In the present series of experiments, we have actually used simultaneous recordings from control and transfected cells in the same slice. I have studied LTP for 40 years and it is my belief that this is the most controlled experiment possible. I am not aware of other labs using simultaneous recordings to study LTP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions Requiring Text Redaction</p><p>6.

We now mention that caution should be used in interpreting our results with these peptides (end of the first paragraph of the discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. There are no data to show that LTP accumulates during life. Such evidence would be important to support the model propose. Age and LTP 'experience' are not generally applicable criteria when switching back and forth between cultured and acute slices. In essence, one would not expect 'memories' in slice culture, but the effects of the peptides appear to be the same in the two culture systems. With regard to the NMDAR KO experiment, it is then argued that it prevents the formation of in vivo memories and so that no effect of the peptide inhibitors is seen. Thus, whether in vivo or in vitro, synapses appear to 'learn' the same amount. The line of logic in the discussion of these data is not entirely convincing. Given that showing that the corresponding synapses have been LTPed in vivo is highly non-trivial, it is suggested that alternative models and explanations are discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important issue and we agree with the reviewer that further discussion is warranted. I should point out that Lisman {Sanhueza, 2013 #2828;Lisman, 2017 #2794} has asserted that one of the predictions for LTP to be a memory molecular is that there is constitutive CaMKII activity due to prior LTP while the animal was alive. We agree with the reviewer and suggest that “acquired” is a better word than “accumulates”. What we would propose is that NMDAR-dependent Hebbian processes occur early on as neuronal networks are being established. We suggest that this process is occurring by the time that slice cultures are made and are maintained during the time in culture. The issue of whether the basal CaMKII represents prior LTP has been raised throughout. We have done the best that we can to try to link the basal activity to prior LTP. We would welcome any further suggestions to strengthen (or disprove) this link. However, since the link isn’t perfect, we have decided to reorganize the paper so that we first present all of our data characterizing the role of CaMKII in maintaining basal synaptic transmission and then present the data on LTP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Generally, and in the context of the point above, the reviewers suggest to substantially tone down the claim that a mechanism of memory is identified. CaMKII has both basic and potentiation-related synaptic function, which all might well overlap.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very careful to refer to our results as “synaptic memory”, with the implication that it could underlie behavior memory. We now make this point more explicit in the discussion. In addition, we have reordered the paper, so that the linkage of the basal action of CaMKII to LTP is played down.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. LTP is synapse specific. Erasing LTP by blocking the memory molecule would thus be expected to be synapse specific as well. However, both control and LTP pathway are affected by CaMKII perturbation. The authors argue that this is due to LTP accumulation during life. The support for this claim is limited. As the authors show, basal synaptic transmission is reduced by the CaMKII inhibitors. Whether this is LTPed synaptic strength is not clear. An alternative explanation would be that during early LTP expression, before consolidation, LTP can be reversed by inhibiting CaMKII. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that we have addressed this concern in our previous comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. In CaMKII-α KO mice, LTP is impaired but not absent (Silva et al. – Science 1992). Furthermore, CaMKII autophosphorylation was proposed to facilitate LTP induction, but is not essential (Chang et al. – Neuron 2017). These results are consistent with an important role of CaMKII in LTP, but indicate that the magnitude of LTP blockade depends on the induction protocol and is more in agreement with induction and consolidation of LTP rather than long-term memory. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>I am not entirely clear as to how to address this. There is much variability in the field as to how complete the block of LTP is in the absence of CaMKII or its activity. Certainly no one would disagree that CaMKII is essential for most of NMDAR-dependent LTP. However, it is not entirely clear how this issue relates to constitutively active CaMKII.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Halt et al. (EMBO J 2012) proposed that memory consolidation requires the CaMKII/NR2B interaction. The effects of the inhibiting peptides after 10s of minutes, as seen in the present study, are consistent with this notion; whether long-term memory is affected, as proposed in the present study, is not shown. The major novelty of the present study would be that a fraction of CaMKII remains constitutively active to store memory. Reversal of LTP in 30-60 min is not necessarily related to long-term memory, and the notion that reduction of basal transmission reflects the same mechanism is not straight forward. This should be discussed. If more evidence in support of the memory-CaMKII idea can be provided (see above), additional experiments in the context of this item are not expected.</p></disp-quote><p>I am hesitant to focus on behavioral memory and terms like “memory consolidation” when discussing synaptic physiology. How the field defines “long-term” is open to discussion. In most studies of LTP, measurements are taken out to 45 min. – 1hour.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Figure 2: The effect of AIP expression appears less than 50%. A summary point of two different cell populations is incorrect (see e.g. Levy et al. – Neuron 2015; Kim et al. – Neuron 2015). The data need to be plotted differently and an explanation as to why the effect is smaller needs to be attempted.</p></disp-quote><p>Point well taken.

We do not think that it is due to activity in the slice prior to the recording, because incubating slices from the outset in APV does not result in a smaller depression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14.

CaMKII Enzymatic Activity vs. Protein Interactions. The firm conclusion that it is continued CaMKII activity rather than CaMKII binding to relevant postsynaptic binding partners (e.g. the C-terminus of GluN2B) is still not justified by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept that the crux of the issue is CaMKII Enzymatic Activity vs. Protein Interactions and we also accept that it is impossible to definitively distinguish between these two alternatives, using CN27 and AIP. Therefore, we remove that part of the discussion that argues for “activity” over “protein interactions”. We also removed the paragraph in the Discussion critiquing the Lee et al. results. Instead, we cite the recent Ozden et al. paper (pg. 12, paragraph 2,line 8 and immediately after this citation we state “Thus, at present it is not possible to distinguish between the disruption of GluN2B binding and the blockade of kinase activity.” We reiterate this on pg 14, paragraph 2, last 3 lines. We have removed “activity” from the title and throughout by replacing “CaMKII activity” with “CaMKII” or the “action of CaMKII”). We also abandon the T site/S site model that has featured prominently in the CaMKII literature, but now appears to have lost its value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Notably, CaMKII binding to GluN2B was shown to be important for LTP (Barria and Malinow, 2005; Halt et al., 2012). Earlier evidence indicates that the CN27-related CN21 peptide reverses LTP by displacing CaMKII from GluN2B and not by inhibiting CaMKII but (Sanchueza et al., 2011). The authors argue that the AIP peptide only inhibits CaMKII activity without displacing it from GluN2B because earlier work showed that addition of untagged AIP during immunoprecipitation of CaMKII does not disrupt co-precipitation of the NMDAR at 20 μm (Leonard et al., 1999). However, although AIP does not disrupt the preformed CaMKII-NMDAR complex (Leonard et al., 1999), expression of it in HeLa cells prevents binding of CaMKII to GluN2B (see Suppl Figure 2 in Murakoshi et al., 2017). In other words, when expressed in intact cells, AIP does inhibit CaMKII binding to GluN2B. This could also be the case when myrAIP is applied to intact cells,. Perhaps in intact cells CaMKII has a tendency to unbind from GluN2B (potentially due to dephosphorylation of T286) and AIP augments this unbinding or prevents re-binding (potentially by inhibiting re-phosphorylation), while in vitro in immunoprecipitates there is no unbinding and AIP cannot displace CaMKII from GluN2B.</p></disp-quote><p>Since we are no longer making any special claims that AIP is acting differently from CN27, we don’t think that the issues raised by the reviewer are any longer relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The issue of AIP acting by inhibiting CaMKII activity vs. CaMKII binding to GluN2B is exacerbated by recently published data indicating that S and T site binding of substrates vs. docking proteins for CaMKII might not be separable (Özden et al., 2020: CaMKII binds both substrates 1 and effectors at the active site. bioRxivhttps://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.25.354241). This work indicates that T and S sites form a continuum and that most – if not all – binding peptides will affect both, kinase activity and binding to anchoring proteins. Furthermore, the authors argue that their myrCN27 acts via CaMKII inhibition and not CaMKII displacement from GluN2B. Their reasoning is that they had a full effect at 1 μm of myrCN27 whereas Sanchueza et al. (2011) reported that 20 but not 5 μm of the related tat-CN21 displaced CaMKII from GluN2B (and that this correlated with a decrease in transmission and reversal of LTP during maintenance phase), when 5 μm tat-CN21 was sufficient to block CaMKII activity and LTP induction presumably because 5 μm is sufficient to block kinase activity. However, myrCN27 is longer than CN21 and the myr tag could promote binding of this peptide to CaMKII, so it could be much more potent than tat-CN21 in displacing CaMKII from GluN2B and already accomplish displacement at 1 uM.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that with myr-CN27 it is not possible to dissociate protein interactions from enzymatic activity, although it is worth pointing out that this is the argument Sanhueza et al. (2011) used to explain why 5 μm CN21 blocked LTP induction (activity), but did not reverse LTP (protein interaction).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because of the considerations above, it is mandatory that the authors modify the respective discussion and do not dismiss the notion that 1 μm myrCN27 and AIP in general could have acted by displacing CaMKII.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this from the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In-Vivo-LTP. The authors argue that GluN1 KO prevents LTP expression in vivo and that this experimental approach could therefore test whether previous LTP in vivo is required for the dependence of synaptic strength on CaMKII. Indeed, the results are consistent with this line of argumentation. However, GluN1 KO has multiple additional effects: It increases synaptic strength and eliminates synaptic NR2B expression, which is thought to be the anchor for active CaMKII. Furthermore, multiple forms of synaptic plasticity (e.g. LTP, LTD, scaling, a.o.) occur during the lifetime of an animal, and notably, NMDARs, CaMKIIα, and CaMKIIαβ were reported to be involved in these forms of plasticity. Thus, the interpretation that in GluN1 KO neurons LTP is absent in vivo is reasonable, but given the other consequences of the KO, it is not conclusive.</p></disp-quote><p>While the loss of constitutive CaMKII activity following GluN1 deletion is consistent with prior in vivo LTP, the reviewer pointed out an equally valid conclusion. Since CaMKII binding to the NMDAR is essential for its synaptic action, this disruption could explain our result. To distinguish between these alternatives we have replaced GluN1 with a pore dead mutant. This subunit associates normally with GluN2 subunits and traffics normally to the membrane (Amin, et al., 2017). Thus, the only difference between wt synaptic GluN1/GluN2B synaptic receptors and the mutant is that it is pore dead. Thus, if any non-NMDAR sources of Ca<sup>2+</sup> can activate CaMKII, it would bind the GluN2B and exert its synaptic action. The fact that the pore dead mutant failed to rescue constitutive CaMKII, suggests that in the freely moving animal non-NMDAR sources of Ca<sup>2+</sup> are incapable of activating CaMKII, at least in terms of synaptic function. If there were to occur, it would degrade the Hebbian mechanism of plasticity. Aside from the NMDA KO experiment, the reviewer continues to express resistance to the proposal that the constitutive basal CaMKII action represents prior LTP when the animal was alive. I believe there is little doubt that CaMKII contributes to synaptic transmission (Sanhueza, 2007;Sanhueza, 2011;Barcomb, 2016;Gouet, 2012:Goold, 2010;Barcomb,2014;Incontro, 2018). We have done everything we can to test whether this constitutive activity is related to prior LTP. If this is incorrect, what do the reviewers propose is the basis for this activity? We welcome any suggestions the reviewer might have to either strengthen the connection or come up with an experiment that will permanently put this idea to rest. We love doing these kinds of Popper experiments. However, we emphasize that throughout the manuscript we use terms such as “suggests” and “is consistent with this proposal”. We make no claims that it is “conclusive”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To further link the requirement of constitutively active CaMKII to in vivo LTP, the authors use a type of occlusion experiment. They express the photoactivatable AIP in neurons in utero. Then activate AIP for 40 min in slices after which they start recording. Like inhibition while stimulating, the inhibition without stimulation reduced AMPAR EPSC by 50% compared to neighboring control neurons. LTP in the previously inhibited neurons was about 2-times bigger than that in control neurons. The authors argue that the inhibition of CaMKII liberated &quot;space&quot; for more LTP. Given that LTP is saturable, the origin of this increased &quot;space&quot; is not clear. It could be due to a shift of the baseline further away from the ceiling or, as argued, to the reversal of in vivo LTP that is then newly triggered. Again, a suggestive interpretation, but not conclusive.</p></disp-quote><p>We are perplexed by the reviewers’ reticence to accept the conclusion of these experiments. The use of occlusion is not a new idea. It has been used by many investigators, and is generally accepted, in a variety of experiments studying LTP. Just one example is the linkage of the enhancement of CaMKII to LTP (e.g., Lledo et al., 1995), which is part of a figure in one of Lisman’s reviews (Lisman et al., Nat. Rev. Neurosci., 2002). It is also the same logic that Sanhueza et al. (2011) provids to conclude that tat21 reverses saturated LTP (end of the Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In a final experiment, the authors report that 1 µM myr-CN27 reverts LTP during the expression phase. The experiment is performed in a two-pathway experiment, in which both the control non-induced pathway, as well as the induced pathway are reduced. Notably, the strength of the LTPed pathway settles at the same strength as the control pathway, indicating that both basal and the new LTPed synaptic strength is reduced. Myr-AIP is reported to have a similar effect at 20 µM, but not 1 µM. While the 1 µM serves as an important peptide control, the effect of the 20 µM is not as efficient as the 1 µM myr-CN27 as after around 60 min, some potentiation is left and EPSCs are not reduced to 50% of baseline. In a single experiment with field EPSP, myr-CN27 also reduces the fEPSPs of both the LTPed and control pathway, but in the time window observed, the responses do not converge. While these results indicate that CaMKII activity during expression is required, they do not necessarily translate into a mechanism selective for LTP, e.g. that the reduction in control pathway is based on in-vivo-acquired LTP. The different outcomes of the myr-CN27 peptide, the myr-AIP peptide in whole-cell recordings, and the myr-CN27 peptide in fEPSP are fully consistent with different mechanisms, e.g. with CaMKII activity being required for the expression of LTP, while structural assembly being required to stabilize basal synaptic transmission, as reported previously. To distinguish between these possibilities, information about on which CaMKII populations the different peptides operate would be important, e.g. whether myr-CN27 dissociates CaMKII from NR2B, or whether myr-AIP or myr-CN27 change the autoactivation of CaMKII.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ summary of the data and this is exactly the way we present it in the paper. However, we feel that the reviewer is over interpreting the results. First, we do not agree that this data can be interpreted as distinguishing the mechanism underlying CaMKII’s effects on basal synaptic transmission and LTP. We would argue that any difference in effects on baseline transmission and LTP reflect the effectiveness of the peptide, which varies with the depth of the recorded cell as well as other variables. We also explain that the use of peptides with field potential recording is limited because of the poor access of the peptides to the center of the slice. Thus, the fact that the LTPed pathway does not fall below baseline after one hour of peptide application in Figure S5, although it is still declining, cannot, in our opinion, be used to argue for different mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In conclusion, the present study identifies an essential role of CaMKII activity for basal synaptic transmission and LTP expression. It is convincingly shown that this relates to differential effects of cell-penetrating peptides. However, the title and abstract appear too far-fetched as the results do not conclusively show that basal synaptic transmission is the product of acquired in vivo LTP. The reviewers urge the authors to address this issue by more conservative wording of title, abstract, and relevant text passages.</p></disp-quote><p>The conclusion that “the present study identifies an essential role of CaMKII activity for basal synaptic transmission and LTP expression” is most surprising. Most of the criticism of our manuscript is that it is impossible to distinguish between “activity” and “protein binding”. We agree and have removed “CaMKII activity” throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
