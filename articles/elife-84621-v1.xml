Such pathogens are under selection to improve vector competence for their transmission by employing various tissue or cellular responses of vectors. However, whether pathogens can actively cause hypoxia in vectors and exploit hypoxia responses to promote their vector competence is still unknown. Fast dispersal of pinewood nematode (PWN), the causal agent for the destructive pine wilt disease and subsequent infection of pine trees, is characterized by the high vector competence of pine sawyer beetles (<italic>Monochamus</italic> spp.), and a single beetle can harbor over 200,000 PWNs in its tracheal system. Here, we demonstrate that PWN loading activates hypoxia in tracheal system of the vector beetles. Both PWN loading and hypoxia enhanced tracheal elasticity and thickened the apical extracellular matrix (aECM) of the tracheal tubes while a notable upregulated expression of a resilin-like mucin protein Muc91C was observed at the aECM layer of PWN-loaded and hypoxic tracheal tubes. RNAi knockdown of <italic>Muc91C</italic> reduced tracheal elasticity and aECM thickness under hypoxia conditions and thus decreasing PWN loading. Our study suggests a crucial role of hypoxia-induced developmental responses in shaping vector tolerance to the pathogen and provides clues for potential molecular targets to control pathogen dissemination.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Various parasites, bacteria and other disease-causing pathogens are transmitted by insects. A tiny worm called the pine wood nematode, for example, is spread by pine sawyer beetles which can carry up to 280,000 worms in their trachea, the network of tubes they use to breathe. This has resulted in millions of hectares of pine forests in Asia and Europe becoming infected with the deadly disease caused by the nematodes.</p><p>Pine wood nematodes, as well as other pathogens, can exploit the biological processes of the insects carrying them to make the insects transmit them more effectively. Precisely how nematodes and other disease-causing agents do this is unclear. One possibility is that they reduce the amount of oxygen being supplied to the trachea – a phenomenon known as hypoxia – which occurs naturally at specific stages in the life of an insect, and during infections.</p><p>To test this theory, Tang, Zhou, Koski et al. used genetics and imaging approaches to study how pine wood nematodes affect the trachea of pine sawyer beetles. The experiments found that when the nematodes infected the beetles, their trachea did indeed develop hypoxia. This, in turn, made the beetles’ airways more elastic and made the layer of structure lining the trachea, known as the apical extracellular matrix, thicker. These changes increased the amount of pinewood nematodes the trachea could hold, allowing the beetle to spread more worms from tree to tree.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that hypoxia in the trachea increased the levels of a protein called Muc91C in the apical extracellular matrix. When the levels of Muc91C were artificially decreased in the beetles, this made their airways less elastic and the apical extracellular matrix thinner.</p><p>This work suggests that pine wood nematodes exploit the beetles’ normal responses to loss of oxygen supply to make the beetles more effective at transmitting the nematodes between pine trees. Other pathogens carried by insects may also use this strategy to help increase their transmission. Further studies on the Muc91C protein may provide clues for potential drug targets to control pine wood nematodes and protect pine trees from disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Monochamus alternatus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</italic></kwd><kwd>pinewood nematode</kwd><kwd>pine sawyer beetle</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>Muc91C</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32088102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jianghua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32061123002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jianghua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFC2600100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jianghua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32230066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Lilin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jiao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An insect-transmissible plant pathogen, <italic>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</italic>, uniquely excavates hypoxia to increase vector capacity via Muc91C-enhanced elasticity of tracheal tubes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insect vectors are obligatory for the dispersal of many pathogens, including several viruses and parasites deleterious to plant and animal health. Vector competence is pivotal for the successful pathogen arrival and infection of the target host, and is determined by a sophisticated set of direct interactions as pathogens enter, spread, replicate, and retain within vector cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartholomay and Michel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lataillade et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, pathogens have evolved to modulate various defensive responses of vectors, such as autophagy or apoptosis, as has been shown in some leafhoppers, whitefly, and mosquitoes, to influence vector competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O’Neill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Although understanding the responses that pathogens induce to manipulate vector competence is important for developing efficient management strategies, the underlying mechanism remains largely elusive.</p><p>A pathogen of pine trees, <italic>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</italic>, commonly known as pine wood nematode (PWN), is transmitted by cerambycid beetles of the genus <italic>Monochamus</italic> and causes pine wilt disease in millions of hectares of pine forests across Asia and Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akbulut and Stamps, 2012</xref>). PWN’s life cycle has two distinct developmental phases, namely the propagative stage (L<sub>1</sub>-L<sub>4</sub>) juveniles and reproductive adult that propagates inside pine trees and the dispersal stage (L<sub>III</sub> and L<sub>IV</sub> juveniles) characterized by its close relationship with the vector beetle that transports the nematode to new host trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). The dispersal L<sub>IV</sub> enters the tracheal system of the adult beetle through the spiracles and inhabits the trachea for several days until the vector beetle has reached a new healthy host tree. The number of dispersal L<sub>IV</sub> carried by an adult beetle is a critical factor influencing the damage level of the pine wilt disease in the pine host tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Togashi, 1985</xref>). Extraordinarily, each primary vector beetle, such as <italic>Monochamus alternatus</italic> in Asia, can harbor on average 15,000 and up to 280,000 nematodes in its tracheal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fielding and Evans, 1996</xref>). In contrast to circulative pathogens that move from gut lumen to salivary glands or ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eigenbrode et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wei et al., 2017</xref>), and to other non-circulative pathogens that typically remain in the mouthparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Uzest et al., 2007</xref>) and foregut of their vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), PWNs merely reside and do not multiply in the tracheal systems. However, the effects of PWN on its unique resident niche (i.e., the vector tracheal system), and the mechanism behind the vector’s competence for loading of such large numbers of PWN are still poorly understood.</p><p>Hypoxia, which occurs when oxygen supply is inadequate, is common in mammal host tissues faced with infection by pathogens and induces several adaptive responses that improve host defense by maintaining the integrity of epithelial barriers and hindering the internalization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zeitouni et al., 2016</xref>). Recent studies suggest a modulator role of hypoxia in various biotic interactions. For example, the parasite <italic>Trypanasoma brucei</italic> has evolved a way to inhibit hypoxic responses to evade the host immune response in the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGettrick et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, a mosquito gut bacterium benefits their hosts by activating hypoxic responses improving host gut growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Valzania et al., 2018</xref>). As the trachea of the adult vector beetle is packed with nematodes, reduced gas transfer ability and its consequent hypoxia are conceivable.</p><p>The insect trachea, an interconnected network of air-filled epithelial tubes characterized with optimal diameter and length, exhibits intense cycles of compression and expansion for respiration, which resembles the deflation and inflation of vertebrate lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Westneat et al., 2003</xref>). The tracheal volumes changed by this behavior increase the internal pressure for improvement of air convection, thus facilitating gas exchange and diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayashi and Kondo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Westneat et al., 2003</xref>). To increase oxygen supply, the tracheal system adapts to hypoxia by compensatory morphological and physiological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison et al., 2018</xref>), such as extensively tracheal terminal branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Centanin et al., 2010</xref>) and increased compression frequency of tracheal tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenlee et al., 2013</xref>). Mechanical properties of the tracheal tubes are therefore prerequisites for regulating the tracheal geometry and compression capacity and mainly depend on a viscoelastic material surrounding tracheal lumen, called apical extracellular matrix (aECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayashi and Kondo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zuo et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, aECMs’ components, including serpentine, verm, and dumpy, affect aECM elasticity and have been reported to mediate the tubular diameter or length, possibly by restricting apical membrane growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luschnig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilkin et al., 2000</xref>). A study with the American cockroach (<italic>Periplaneta americana</italic>) suggested that chitin structures in aECM layer are responsible for the mechanical features that enable tracheal compression and volume change during respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Webster et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, high inflation of lungs is related to the mechanical forces provided by aECM components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wirtz and Dobbs, 2000</xref>). In addition, hypoxia has been shown to correlate with overall aECM composition and organization of blood vessels and respiratory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kusuma et al., 2012</xref>), implying a possible link between hypoxia and the molecular components contributing to mechanical properties of the tracheal tubes. Taken together, we hypothesize that hypoxia may be involved in the retention of PWN in vector beetle’s tracheal system through the PWN exploiting mechanical properties of the vector beetle’s trachea to maintain a high vector capacity in a hypoxia-regulated manner.</p><p>Here, we revealed that the number of the nematodes in the trachea is negatively correlated with the oxygen level in the tracheal system of its vector beetle, leading to hypoxia. Both PWN loading and hypoxia enhanced the elasticity of tracheal tubes and increased the thickness of aECMs in tracheal epithelia. Based on transcriptome analysis of trachea with and without PWN, we identified aECM-related genes in the beetles and found a candidate aECM component, a resilin-like mucin protein Muc91C, the expression of which was substantially upregulated at the aECM layer after PWN loading and hypoxic treatment. <italic>Muc91C</italic> knockdown reduced elasticity of the tracheal tubes and aECMs thickness under hypoxic condition, indicating that <italic>Muc91C</italic> help regulate the aECM-related mechanical traits of the tracheal tubes. Importantly, RNAi of <italic>Muc91C</italic> in adult beetles significantly reduced PWN loading in trachea. These results demonstrate crucial roles of tracheal hypoxia and aECM-related tubular elasticity in improving vector competence for PWN transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PWN loading decreased oxygen levels in the tracheal system of vector beetle</title><p>To determine whether PWN loading reduces oxygen levels and caused hypoxia in trachea of vector beetles, we first measured the concentration of oxygen inside major thoracic tracheal tubes using an oxygen microsensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Radial oxygen profiles revealed a slight drop of oxygen pressure from 21 kPa to 18.9 kPa, respectively, when comparing pressure outside (i.e., in the ambient air) and inside the tracheal tubes of beetles without PWN. In contrast, there was a dramatic drop of oxygen pressure from 21 kPa outside of tubes to 3.8 kPa inside tubes when trachea was loaded with PWN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, our results showed that PWN loading induce oxygen shortage in trachea.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Negative correlation between oxygen level and pine wood nematode (PWN) loading in tracheal system of <italic>M. alternatus</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of experimental setup used for microelectrode (top right) measurements inside a major trachea tube of the thorax (bottom left) and the atrium cavity of the largest spiracle (bottom right).

The partial pressure of oxygen was negatively correlated with the total number of nematodes in tracheal tissue per 0.3 g beetle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The curve fit to this data revealed that when the total number of nematodes reached 10,000, partial pressure of oxygen in the cavity of tracheal spiracle dropped to 10 kPa (half of the corresponding value in the surrounding air usually 21 kPa), creating a mild hypoxia at approximately PO<sub>2</sub> of 5–15 kPa. In addition, when the number of nematodes increased to 44,828, the oxygen pressure dropped dramatically to 4 kPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which is the threshold between mild and severe functional hypoxia in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison et al., 2018</xref>). Oxygen levels in the cavity of the atrium were further compared among three levels of PWN loading, differing in total number of nematodes in the trachea. The tracheal systems of beetles without PWN (null) or with light PWN loading (&lt;10,000) had an oxygen pressure equal to that of the environment. By contrast, substantial decline to approximately 4 kPa of oxygen were detected in the tracheal spiracle with heavy PWN loading (&gt;10,000). These results indicated PWN loading caused oxygen loss and light or heavy PWN loading induced hypoxia or anoxia in the trachea of vector beetles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Nematode-induced hypoxia enhanced tracheal elasticity and thickened its apical extracellular matrix</title><p>Compared to those free of PWN, the trachea of vector beetles bearing PWN tended to be rubberlike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The total number of the nematodes in the trachea correlated positively with the tracheal rubberization degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Trachea with the highest rubberization degree released five times more nematodes (reaching approximately 16,000 nematodes on average) compared to trachea with moderate or low rubberization. Preliminary observations further showed that the trachea tubes harboring PWN tended to be longer and narrower before breakage under external force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). This relationship indicated that PWN loading influenced the mechanical properties of the vector’s trachea.</p><p>The elasticity of trachea tubes was further quantified by comparing Young’s modulus values of tracheal tubes among the three levels of PWN loading (null, light, and heavy) mentioned above. Corresponding to their higher oxygen level, Young’s modulus values of trachea tubes without PWN and with light PWN loading were almost two times higher than the values in hypoxic trachea tubes with heavy PWN loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Given the negative correlation between elasticity and Young’s modulus values, this result suggested that heavy PWN loading enhanced tracheal elasticity. To confirm the influence of hypoxia on tracheal elasticity, we subjected beetles free of PWN to 1% O<sub>2</sub> for 6 hr, 12 hr, and 24 hr. Compared with that of tracheal tubes exposed to normoxia and hypoxia conditions for 6 hr, the Young’s modulus values under hypoxic treatments for 12 hr and 24 hr decreased by nearly a half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Micrographs revealed that the secreted protein layer of tracheal aECM was significantly thickened by heavy PWN loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). However, the heavy PWN loading had no effect on the morphology of the chitin layer of aECM. To examine the effect of hypoxia on tracheal aECM, we treated beetles free of PWN with 1% O<sub>2</sub> for 6 hr, 12 hr, and 24 hr. Electron micrographs showed that the secreted protein layer of tracheal aECM under hypoxia for 12 hr and 24 hr was thicker than those under normoxia and hypoxia for 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, our results indicated that PWN-induced hypoxia promoted the secretion of protein layers in aECM in trachea. Taken together, these results suggest that the increased secretion of protein layer of aECM was involved in enhanced tracheal elasticity by PWN-induced hypoxia.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PWN loading caused significant upregulation of Muc91C responsible for the thickened aECM layer in trachea</title><p>To confirm the role of proteins to the enhanced tracheal elasticity, we compared the tracheal transcriptomes between PWN-free and heavily PWN-loaded beetles and discovered 916 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Out of these, 251 DEGs were identified as aECM-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Overall, the altered transcript profiles suggested dramatic epithelium reorganization in tracheal tubes of vector beetles after PWN loading. We then chose 45 genes related to mechanical properties to further scrutinize for their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We examined chitinases, chitin synthases, and chitin deacetylases, which are involved in chitin catabolic processes, biosynthetic processes, and arrangement, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong and Hayashi, 2015</xref>). The up- or downregulated pattern in the expression of these transcripts suggested a chitin metabolic equilibrium, which was consistent with the unchanged chitin layer among beetles with heavy PWN loading shown in TEMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Our gene list also included those genes functioning as aECM regulators. For example, metalloproteinases are proteinases that cleave proteins in the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glasheen et al., 2010</xref>). Cadherins, integrins, lachesin, and dumpy are transmembrane proteins participating in signal transduction between aECM and tracheal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Llimargas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Öztürk-Çolak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilkin et al., 2000</xref>). The changed expression of these transcripts after heavy PWN loading indicated altered regulatory cascades of aECM. We finally investigated the expression of the non-chitin structural components, including mucins, collagens, and laminin. Negatively regulated transcripts of collagens in heavy loading PWN samples and the location of laminin in basal lamina of tracheal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai et al., 2018</xref>) suggest they were not responsible for thickening the aECM layer in our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, the genes encoding for the mucin family, a group of large glycosylated macromolecules, are possible candidate genes contributing to the elasticity of trachea in our study because their location and upregulation directly corresponded to the observed thickened non-chitin layer in aECMs visible in electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To investigate possible correlation between tracheal development at metamorphosis and after PWN loading, we further scrutinized the expression of the 45 aECM genes in tracheal tubes after 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, and 7 days post eclosion using RNA-seq data in a published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tang et al., 2022</xref>). All genes were downregulated between day 5 and day 7 post adult eclosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, tracheal system of vector beetles responded to loading nematodes despite the completion of tracheal development. For <italic>Muc91C</italic> specifically, its expression was twofold upregulated 3 days after eclosion but was downregulated during the later stages post eclosion.

Next, we independently validated our RNA-seq results by repeating the experiment using new individuals and quantifying expression using reverse-transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) for the genes that belong to the mucin family. In contrast to the other two mucin genes, the abundance of <italic>Muc91C</italic> transcripts positively correlated with the level of PWN loading in trachea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Seventeen A repeats, with the consensus sequence PSSSYGAPA(S), were located in the N-terminal region. Additionally, 11 B repeats, with the consensus sequence GGYSSGGN, were located in the C-terminal region. As the only identified MaMuc91C homolog in insects, DmMuc91C was classified as a resilin-like protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen, 2010</xref>). In addition, a BLASTX search of MaMuc91C against Flybase revealed its similarity not only to DmMuc91C (CG7709-PB) but also to functional DmPro-resilin (CG15920-PA). Using DmPro-resilin and resilin-like DmMuc91C as query sequences in turn, we further characterized 17 resilin-related genes in the tracheal transcriptome of the PWN vector beetle and in the genomes of other insects. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that MaMuc91C and six proteins from other insects were assigned to clade I, which share repeat A motif with a consensus sequence of PS(Q)SSYGAP(A)S. Importantly, repeat A motifs in clade I shared two similar features with pro-resilin proteins. First, the glycine and proline residues included in the repeat A motifs in this clade potentially exhibit long-range elasticity by forming a stretchable beta-spiral structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ardell and Andersen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tatham and Shewry, 2002</xref>). Secondly, tyrosine residues also included in repeat A motifs in clade I presumably facilitates the formation of dityrosine crosslinks with other repeats after secretion from the epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qin et al., 2009</xref>). However, clade I lacked the chitin binding R&amp;R Consensus sequence, a defining feature of true pro-resilin. Thus, these proteins were classified as resilin-like proteins. Based on the PTS domain and O-glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>), we found that all the proteins in clade I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) belonged to the mucin family and may be homologues of Muc91C, given their similarity with DmMuc91C. The other six resilin-related proteins were true pro-resilins and clustered into clade II, in which repeat A motifs were highly variable and all sequences contained the chitin binding R&amp;R Consensus. No pro-resilin homologue was identified in tracheal transcriptome of <italic>M. alterantus</italic>. Regardless of the existence of R&amp;R Consensus sequence, repeat A consensus in both pro-reslins and Muc91C likely confer long-range elasticity because previous studies have shown that synthetic peptide chains consisting of either 17 copies of A repeats (GGRPSDSYGAPGGGN) from DmPro-resilin or 16 copies of A repeats (AQTPSSQYGAP) from the AgaMuc91C (AGAP002367-PA), were able to form rubberlike elastic materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elvin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lyons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nairn et al., 2008</xref>).

Here, we demonstrate one of the strategies that PWN utilizes to maintain itself in its vector by modulating the vector beetle’s hypoxia responses. This strategy helps the nematode to reach high numbers even in a single vector beetle and may consequently promote the successful spread, establishment, and outbreak of pine wilt disease. Mechanically, we propose that PWN’s loading process in vector beetles follows a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). First, continuous entering of nematodes into trachea decreases oxygen levels, resulting in hypoxia, which in turn increases the elasticity of tracheal tubes by upregulating <italic>Muc91C</italic>. The more elastic tube structure, in turn, allows more nematodes to reside in the lumen until maximum elasticity is reached, resulting in decreased gas transfer due to physical blocking caused by nematodes. Finally, the resulting high level of CO<sub>2</sub> drives nematodes away from the trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the nematodes strategically manage their loading and departure from the vector by manipulating oxygen supply in the vectors’ trachea.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of the feedback regulation of pine wood nematode (PWN) loading through O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> level in the tracheal system of <italic>M. alternatus</italic>.</title><p>When L<sub>IV</sub> dispersal nematodes continuously enter the vector beetle through spiracles, the consequent hypoxia enhances the elasticity of tracheal tubes by upregulating <italic>Muc91C</italic>.

For instance, a protozoan parasite <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> induces inflammatory hypoxia to limit the capacity of the host’s myeloid cells to kill the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammami et al., 2017</xref>). Some commensal gut microbiota maintains epithelial hypoxia to limit the growth of enteric pathogens in the gut lumen of neonatal chicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Litvak et al., 2019</xref>). However, hypoxia in pathogen–vector relationships has long been a neglected research topic. Our study shows that retention of nematodes caused hypoxia in tracheal tubes of vector beetles, providing empirical evidence for a previous hypothesis that the heavy PWN loading hinders the gas exchange of the beetle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Togashi and Sekizuka, 1982</xref>). Such hypoxia induced by PWN loading improved the vector’s tracheal capacity to harbor PWN. The correlation between hypoxia and vector competence can be extrapolated to the interaction between circulative pathogens and their vectors because their migration, replication, or propagation processes inside vectors may also increase oxygen demands and result in hypoxia.</p><p>Mechanical properties of tracheal tube are critical to luminal volume by regulating tubular size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2014</xref>) and the dynamic volume changes during tracheal compression and expansion to increase the internal pressure for air convection and gases exchange, thus facilitating oxygen diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Westneat et al., 2003</xref>). Our results show that after heavy PWN loading or hypoxic treatment, the thickness of ECM in the tracheal tubes of the vector beetle is remarkably enhanced. Regardless of an intricate relationship between ECM thickness and tubular diameter, the thickened ECM layer results in more elastic tubes that qualify a robust compression. Such improvement in compression capacity via tubular elasticity might be response to acute hypoxia or PWN loading, different from the chronic adaption that involve tracheal diametric expansion in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae incubated under constant hypoxic condition for generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henry and Harrison, 2004</xref>). In the PWN-beetle system, heavy PWN loading occupies luminal volume needed by tracheal ventilation for the beetle’s regular respiration or intensive respiration during dispersal flight in the search of suitable host pine trees. The enhanced tracheal elasticity adapts vector insects to hypoxic stress allowing more oxygen inhalation and provides adequate lumen volume to carry large numbers of nematodes. Therefore, altered mechanical properties of the beetles’ trachea after PWN loading likely maintain a balance between a limited fitness cost to beetles and high vector competence for effective transmission of PWN.</p><p>Along with enhanced tracheal elasticity in the vector beetle, our study also found remarkable global expression changes of aECM genes after PWN loading regardless of the termination of tracheal differentiation and maturation within the first 5 days after eclosion. For example, metalloproteinases degrading old cuticle and promoting apical membrane expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glasheen et al., 2010</xref>), cadherins and integrins participating in signal transduction between aECM and tracheal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayashi and Kondo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Öztürk-Çolak et al., 2016</xref>) are significantly upregulated after heavy PWN loading. This result suggests that PWN loading causes dramatic epithelium reorganization in tracheal tubes of vector beetles. Therefore, our study provides an example that the tracheal system is able to immediately respond to the environment by epithelium reorganization through changed aECM components. Although aECM is crucial to determine mechanical properties of tubular organs including trachea, the role of its molecular components remains largely unknown. Using gene manipulation, we further identified <italic>Muc91C,</italic> which encodes a resilin-like protein in aECM, as the key component responsible for the thickening of non-chitin aECM layer and the improved tracheal elasticity. However, due to incomplete reduced elasticity under hypoxic condition in ds<italic>Muc91C</italic>-injected beetles, other tracheal cellular components such as proteins embedded in the membrane may also regulate tracheal elasticity. Structurally, Muc91C in <italic>M. alternatus</italic> contains two types of repeat motifs but lacks chitin-binding RR2, a consensus sequence in resilin monomers (pro-resilins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Michels et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that its elasticity trait resides in the repeat motifs. Consistent with the absence of pro-resilin in the tracheal tubes of vector beetles, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval foregut is devoid of pro-resilin, but contains resilin-like Cpr56F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lerch et al., 2020</xref>). Collectively, these examples suggest that resilin-like proteins are employed instead of resilin monomers in deformation of various cuticle-free organs. In addition to the repeated motifs, water retention caused by the glycosylation of mucin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>) may also promote elasticity, given that water coating may plasticize Mucin91C and provide additional elasticity from the surface tension of the liquid, as proved in spider silk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vollrath and Edmonds, 1989</xref>). Interestingly, remarkably upregulated <italic>Muc91C</italic> expression was also detected in flight muscles and midgut of beetles with heavy PWN loading. Because highly glycosylated macromolecular mucins are known to protect cells against microbial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martens et al., 2018</xref>), higher systematic <italic>Muc91C</italic> level in various tissues may contribute to maintaining the integrity of mucosal barriers to alleviate the detrimental effects of nematodes invasion, such as increased ROS reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>This study found that hypoxia promotes tracheal elasticity by upregulating the expression of <italic>Muc91C</italic>, suggesting that <italic>Muc91C</italic> is related to hypoxia adaptation. Similarly, significant upregulated expression of pro-resilin has been demonstrated in an intertidal crustacean, the copepod <italic>Tigriopus californicus</italic>, when exposed to extremely low oxygen levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graham and Barreto, 2019</xref>). Therefore, the sensitivity of gene expression of aECM components in epithelial tissues to hypoxia is likely a pervasive phenomenon in arthropods. Clustering into a separate lineage in the mucin phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), all insect Muc91C proteins investigated in this study had no human homologues and were only distantly related to other mucins, suggesting their independent evolutionary origin in insects. This result is consistent with a previous study reporting that Muc91C is the only mucin structurally similar to pro-resilins among 23 mucins and mucin-related proteins in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Syed et al., 2008</xref>). In Asian longhorned beetles (<italic>Anoplophora glabripennis</italic>), for instance, AgMuc91C has a 84% sequence similarity with <italic>MaMuc91C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, further examination of <italic>Muc91C</italic> expression patterns and its responses to hypoxia in other pine sawyer beetles closely related to our study species, such as <italic>Monochamus saltuarius,</italic> can help to assess the role of <italic>Muc91C</italic> in facilitating heavy PWN loading and thus to pine wood disease. Overall, our study provides evidence of exploitation of hypoxia-enhanced tracheal elasticity by a plant parasitic nematode to improve vector competence in this unique pathogen–vector system and offers new insights for the development of novel targets to control the pine wilt disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Collection and rearing of nematodes and beetles</title><p>Mature larvae of sawyer beetles (<italic>M. alternatus</italic>) were collected from dead pine trees in the Fuyang area, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, and reared in an incubator (26°C, humidity 35%) until they pupated or for 7 days after eclosion. <italic>B.xylophilus</italic> were originally acquired from infected trees in Shannxi Province and maintained with <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> in potato dextrose agar (BD, 213400) plates at 25°C for generations until used in the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Nematode loading, tracheal dissections, and nematode quantification</title><p>50 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing <italic>B. cinerea</italic> growing in autoclaved (121°C, 30 min) barley medium (10 g barley in 15 ml water) for 2 weeks at 25°C were inoculated with 1000 propagative nematodes.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Hypoxia-induced tracheal elasticity in vector beetle facilitates the loading of pinewood nematode&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Sofia J Araujo as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers find that although the work is novel and of relevance it lacks strong experimental backup. The work would gain from deeper genetic and cell biological analysis and we hope you will find the reviewers' comments useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Tang et al. investigated if pathogen loading can increase hypoxia in the insect vector's tracheal system. To do so, the authors use pine wood nematodes (PWN) and their infection of Monochamus beetles via their tracheal system. They find that the number of the nematodes in the trachea is negatively correlated with the oxygen level in the tracheal system of its vector beetle, leading to hypoxia. They also observe that PWN loading and hypoxia enhanced the elasticity of tracheal tubes and increased the thickness of tracheal aECM. Analysing the transcriptome they identify changes in aECM related genes in infected beetles. They find that, upon infection, Muc91C has the highest increase in expression and that its downregulation in beetles reduces PWN loading and tracheal elasticity.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The analysis of the pathogen's strategy to maintain itself in its vector by modulating the vector's hypoxic responses. The observation that nematode entry decreases oxygen levels, inducing hypoxia, which in turn increases tracheal tube elasticity by Muc91C upregulation.</p><p>The demonstration that heavy PWN loading, or hypoxic treatment, enhances the elasticity of the tracheal tubes of the vector beetle.</p><p>The molecular analysis of the tracheal response to infection and aECM gene expression changes.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The molecular analysis of Muc91C in the tracheal system of the beetles would gain with a more detailed cellular observations.</p><p>This work clearly demonstrates the effect of PWN loading on the elasticity of tracheal tubes. However, its major weakness lies on the lack of a detailed analysis of Muc91C expression and localization.</p><p>Enhanced tracheal elasticity induced by hypoxia upon infection relies on the expression of Muc91C. Where does Muc91C localize in relation to the chitinous aECM? Are the effects observed due to protein levels?</p><p>I understand that these experiments may be difficult to perform in Monochamus beetles, but the authors could try to find answers to these questions using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Xuan Tang and colleagues contains the experimental analyses of the relationship between the pine sawyer beetle and the pinewood pathogen nematode (pwn). The authors find that the load of pwn in the beetle correlates with a hypoxia response, in turn inducing the expression of the mucin Muc91C, a presumptive cuticular protein, in the tracheal system. They claim that the underlying mechanism involves hypoxia-induced Muc91C-dependent changes in tracheal cuticle elasticity. Other mucins do not seem to be implicated in this process. The circuitry nematode-load, hypoxia, Muc91C-expression and increased elasticity ends with the release of the nematodes on pines, where they act as a pest.</p><p>The addressed biological, ecological problem is really exciting. The model of the sequence of events is intriguing and, partly, backed up with solid data, also from previous works (Wu et al., 2019 cites in the manuscript).</p><p>Besides some minor points that I will mention below, there is a major one that puzzles me. It is about the relationship between tracheal development/differentiation, gene expression (among others of Muc91C) and the analyses of beetles in different experiments (hypoxia, transcriptome etc). For instance, nematodes loading on pupae is described on lines 450ff: when the &quot;colour of.. eyes turned dark, nematodes were added&quot;: which tracheal stage is this? Changes in Muc91C expression in hypoxia assays and transcriptomics were then performed on adult beetles, when tracheal development/differentiation is supposed to be largely terminated, at least in other insects. Hence, how can Muc91C alter tracheal physics after the overall architecture of the tracheae is established? One possibility is that I am wrong and the tracheal development/differentiation continues also in adult beetles even seven days post eclosion (as stated in the Materials and methods section). Another possibility is that newly forming tracheal branches/tips respond to hypoxia and nematode loads, but not portions of the tracheae established already during metamorphosis.</p><p>A related problem is the equation of elasticity of the tracheal cuticle and oxygen concentration: is there any logical argument that allows us to suppose that a more elastic extracellular matrix might facilitate oxygen diffusion? According to the authors, the tracheal cuticle becomes even thicker as a response to nematode loading and hypoxia. If I remember well, hypoxia-incubated <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae tend to produce tracheal tubes with a larger diameter (after moulting, not as an immediate response) for better aeration. A subtle problem arises also, when considering Muc91C incorporation into the cuticle and cuticle property changes after tracheal development/differentiation: the tracheal cuticle formed at metamorphosis would have a stiffer &quot;more normal&quot; consistency than the &quot;newly&quot; added cuticle: the old cuticle would restrict the elasticity of the new one like a concrete wall the elasticity of a balloon. Again, as mentioned above: we need a more detailed description of the course of tracheal development/differentiation in relation to gene expression (Muc91C).</p><p>Another point concerns the description of putative elastic proteins in insects: Muc91C contains repeats that may be responsible for elasticity. However, this has not been shown (while it has been shown for Resilin). The authors should be careful in this regard. Muc91C as a mucin is decorated by sugars that may bind water, this swelling may confer &quot;elasticity&quot; to the cuticle rather than its repeats. Increased water content in the cuticle may also be responsible for &quot;thicker&quot; cuticles in nematode loaded or hypoxic tracheae: increased thickness may be an artefact of preparation. NB: the two TEM images in Figure 5 C do not have comparable quality. Preparation, the thickness of the sections or contrasting differ too much.</p><p>A problem might also be the function of Muc91C: first, can the authors exclude that it is not expressed in tissues associated with the tracheal system when transcriptomics were carried out? In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Muc91C expression is detected in the nervous system and the fat body. Second: RNAi against Muc91C seems to produce viable beetles. I would expect a reduction in overall fitness, though. May this, if the case, affect the interaction with pwn?</p><p>The cloudy situation of the relationship tracheal development/differentiation, gene expression and organ response should be clarified: we need a thorough description of tracheal development/differentiation; the course of tracheal development/differentiation should be next correlated with gene expression (for instance Muc91C). This is a crucial experiment as this would be the first example that the main tracheal system may respond to the environment (here pwn and hypoxia) even after differentiation. Moreover, it would strengthen or serve to refute the argument of Muc91C being expressed and functional beyond terminal differentiation of the tracheal system. Overall, I consider this issue as very crucial as the current version reports only on a phenomenon rather than on a biological process.</p><p>The robustness of their conclusion on the relevance of Muc91C function would increase if additional genes (only mucs are not sufficient) expression were knocked-down (such as the chitin synthase coding gene on the list in Figure 3) and the resulting phenotypes analysed.</p><p>We need also clarification regarding the rubberization issue (lines 163ff): it is unclear how this was measured. The description in the material and methods section and in the figure legend are insufficient.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Tang and colleagues demonstrated the importance of hypoxia-mediated enhancement of tracheal elasticity in vector beetle M. alternatus to transport more nematodes to new host pine trees. Tracheal infection by PWN provoked hypoxia inside the trachea and this made the host tracheal aECM thicker than the non-infected host, increasing tracheal elasticity.

To do so, the authors use pine wood nematodes (PWN) and their infection of Monochamus beetles via their tracheal system. They find that the number of the nematodes in the trachea is negatively correlated with the oxygen level in the tracheal system of its vector beetle, leading to hypoxia. They also observe that PWN loading and hypoxia enhanced the elasticity of tracheal tubes and increased the thickness of tracheal aECM. Analysing the transcriptome they identify changes in aECM related genes in infected beetles.

In this revised version, we conducted immunostaining of Muc91C in the tracheal system of the beetles. We found heavy nematode loading resulting in substantial upregulation of Muc91C beneath the layer of taenidial folds and above the apical membrane of the tracheal cell, as shown in line 290-295 and Figure 4E &amp; F. This result is consistent with the nematode-thickened aECM layer showed in TEM, thus strongly demonstrating that Muc91C is the component of the PWN-thickened aECM layer showed in TEM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This work clearly demonstrates the effect of PWN loading on the elasticity of tracheal tubes. However, its major weakness lies on the lack of a detailed analysis of Muc91C expression and localization.</p><p>Enhanced tracheal elasticity induced by hypoxia upon infection relies on the expression of Muc91C.

By performing immunostaining using Muc91C antibody, we found Muc91C were expressed beneath the layer of chitinous taenidial folds and above the apical membrane of the tracheal cell, as shown in line 290-295 and Figure 4E &amp; 4F. This is consistent with the thickened aECM layer in TEM analysis. Therefore, we confirm that the observed effects are due to protein levels thus revealing a strong association between elasticity and the expression of Muc91C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript by Xuan Tang and colleagues contains the experimental analyses of the relationship between the pine sawyer beetle and the pinewood pathogen nematode (pwn). The authors find that the load of pwn in the beetle correlates with a hypoxia response, in turn inducing the expression of the mucin Muc91C, a presumptive cuticular protein, in the tracheal system. They claim that the underlying mechanism involves hypoxia-induced Muc91C-dependent changes in tracheal cuticle elasticity. Other mucins do not seem to be implicated in this process. The circuitry nematode-load, hypoxia, Muc91C-expression and increased elasticity ends with the release of the nematodes on pines, where they act as a pest.</p><p>The addressed biological, ecological problem is really exciting. The model of the sequence of events is intriguing and, partly, backed up with solid data, also from previous works (Wu et al., 2019 cites in the manuscript).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is about the relationship between tracheal development/differentiation, gene expression (among others of Muc91C) and the analyses of beetles in different experiments (hypoxia, transcriptome etc). For instance, nematodes loading on pupae is described on lines 450ff: when the &quot;colour of.. eyes turned dark, nematodes were added&quot;: which tracheal stage is this? Changes in Muc91C expression in hypoxia assays and transcriptomics were then performed on adult beetles, when tracheal development/differentiation is supposed to be largely terminated, at least in other insects. Hence, how can Muc91C alter tracheal physics after the overall architecture of the tracheae is established? One possibility is that I am wrong and the tracheal development/differentiation continues also in adult beetles even seven days post eclosion (as stated in the Materials and methods section). Another possibility is that newly forming tracheal branches/tips respond to hypoxia and nematode loads, but not portions of the tracheae established already during metamorphosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree with this comment that analysis of the relationship between gene expression and tracheal development would provide basic knowledge underlying this study. Actually, there is a fascinating developmental synchronization between PWN and the vector beetle in previous studies (Zhao et al., 2014) and the life cycles of the two species are shown in Figure 7. The formation of dispersal L<sub>IV</sub> exclusively induced by late pupa beetle with black eyes and newly molted adult beetle (Zhao et al., 2013). Thus, the PWN loading to tracheal system of the beetle occurs after beetle eclosion. In parallel with this study, we have actually investigated the morphological and transcriptomic changes of tracheal development during metamorphosis of the vector beetle morphological observation has shown that, the pattern of tracheal network has been already formed at the late pupal stage (the time when propagative PWNs were introduced in the present study). Tracheal development continues within the first five days post eclsion and is almost terminated after five days post eclosion, given the dramatic changes of tracheal gene expression occurring within five days after eclosion. These results have been submitted to BioRxiv (Tang et al., 2022). Therefore, developmental pattern observed in vector beetles support the second possibility in this comment that newly forming tracheal branches/ tips respond but not portions of the trachea established already during <italic>metamorphosis</italic>. In the current study, we added analysis of the temporal changes for the gene expression of the 45 aECM-related genes (including <italic>Muc91C</italic>) at different time points post eclosion, using the released RNA-seq data as shown in line 251-261 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We found that all genes were expressed at low levels after five days post-elcosion, suggesting a termination of tracheal development before the transcriptome and hypoxia treatment were carried out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related problem is the equation of elasticity of the tracheal cuticle and oxygen concentration: is there any logical argument that allows us to suppose that a more elastic extracellular matrix might facilitate oxygen diffusion? According to the authors, the tracheal cuticle becomes even thicker as a response to nematode loading and hypoxia. If I remember well, hypoxia-incubated <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae tend to produce tracheal tubes with a larger diameter (after moulting, not as an immediate response) for better aeration.</p></disp-quote><p>The facilitation of a more elastic ECM on oxygen diffusion is likely due to its role on tracheal ability to compress. In the revised text, we interpreted the association between aECM and oxgen diffusion in Introduction (line 75-96). In insects, including beetles, the tracheal system exhibits rapid cycles of compression and expansion, analogous to the inflation and deflation of vertebrate lungs. The tracheal volumes changed by this behavior increase the internal pressure for improvement of air convection and gases exchange, thus facilitating oxygen diffusion (Westneat et al., 2003). In addition, hypoxia increases the frequency of this behavior to promote gas exchange (Greenlee et al., 2013). There is evidence showing that the compression capacity is largely determined by tracheal mechanical properties. In the American cockroaches, the chitin structures in ECM layer are responsible for mechanical features that enable volume changes during respiration (Webster et al., 2011). Similarly, high inflation of lungs is related to the mechanical forces provided by ECM components (Berg et al., 1997; Wirtz and Dobbs, 2000).</p><p>In the revised text, we discussed the thickened tracheal cuticle in response to nematode loading and hypoxia by adding “Regardless of an intricate relationship between ECM thickness and tubular diameter, the thickened ECM layer results in more elastic tubes that qualify a robust compression. Such improvement of compression capacity via tubular elasticity might be response to acute hypoxia or PWN loading, different from the chronic adaption that involve tracheal diametric expansion in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae incubated under constant hypoxic condition for generations (Henry and Harrison, 2004).” in Discussion (line 449-455).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A subtle problem arises also, when considering Muc91C incorporation into the cuticle and cuticle property changes after tracheal development/differentiation: the tracheal cuticle formed at metamorphosis would have a stiffer &quot;more normal&quot; consistency than the &quot;newly&quot; added cuticle: the old cuticle would restrict the elasticity of the new one like a concrete wall the elasticity of a balloon. Again, as mentioned above: we need a more detailed description of the course of tracheal development/differentiation in relation to gene expression (Muc91C).</p></disp-quote><p>To address the concern about tracheal plasticity, we explained</p><p>PWN-induced epithelium reorganization in the Discussion (line 463-473). As mentioned above, tracheal development is terminated within the first five days after eclosion. However, PWN loading causes substantial expressional changes of 251 ECM related genes, suggesting dramatic epithelium reorganization in tracheal tubes of vector beetles. For example, in parallel with the increased expression of Muc91C, metalloproteinases degrading old cuticle and promoting apical membrane expansion (Glasheen et al., 2010), cadherins and integrins participating in signal transduction between aECM and tracheal cells (Hayashi and Kondo, 2018; Öztürk-Çolak et al., 2016) are significantly upregulated as well. Therefore, aECMs are already well-developed during metamorphosis and undergo reconstruction after PWN loading, resulting in a more elastic tracheal cuticle structure for supporting respiration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another point concerns the description of putative elastic proteins in insects: Muc91C contains repeats that may be responsible for elasticity. However, this has not been shown (while it has been shown for Resilin). The authors should be careful in this regard. Muc91C as a mucin is decorated by sugars that may bind water, this swelling may confer &quot;elasticity&quot; to the cuticle rather than its repeats. Increased water content in the cuticle may also be responsible for &quot;thicker&quot; cuticles in nematode loaded or hypoxic tracheae: increased thickness may be an artefact of preparation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the causal links between Muc91C and elasticity in line 350-356. Muc91C of the beetle contains two series of short repeated motifs located in the N-terminal (A repeats) and C-terminal (B repeats) region and the A repeats are shared by Muc91C homologues of other insects, as shown in Figure 5 of the current version of manuscript. The direct contribution of repeat A in elastic properties has been confirmed in several studies (Elvin et al., 2005; Lyons et al., 2007; Nairn et al., 2008), demonstrating that synthetic peptide chains containing either the A-repeat-containing region from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> pro-resilin or a series of the consensus sequence, AQTPSSQYGAP, from the <italic>A. gambiae</italic> Muc91C (AGAP002367-PA) form rubberlike elastic materials. Actually, in a seminal paper about resilin-like gene products in insects (Andersen, 2010), DmMuc91C and AgaMuc91C are both classified as a resilin-like protein due to their abundance in short repeats containing proline and glycine, a common feature of proteins with long-range elasticity. In the revised version, we also carried out immunostaining of Muc91C as shown in line 290-295 and Figure 4E &amp; 4F. We detected strong signals of Muc91C beneath the layer of taenidial folds and above the apical membrane of the tracheal cell, forming a continuous layer in PWN-loaded trachea. Thus, this result indicates that the enhanced expression of Muc91C instead of increased water content accounts for the thickened ECM observed by TEM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>NB: the two TEM images in Figure 5 C do not have comparable quality. Preparation, the thickness of the sections or contrasting differ too much.</p></disp-quote><p>The samples for were treated and prepared according to the same protocol. All the ultrathin sections share the same thickness (70nm), as shown in line 603. We have adjusted the contrasting of the TEM images in Figure 6A as suggested in this revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A problem might also be the function of Muc91C: first, can the authors exclude that it is not expressed in tissues associated with the tracheal system when transcriptomics were carried out? In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Muc91C expression is detected in the nervous system and the fat body.</p></disp-quote><p>This concern makes sense. To exclude the influence of related tissues, we carefully removed the surrounded muscle under microscope when sampling the trachea for transcriptomes. These details of operation have been added in the Materials and methods in line 531. To elucidate the tissue specificity of <italic>Muc91C</italic>, we conducted qPCR for <italic>Muc91C</italic> expression in tracheal tubes, flight muscle and midgut. Compared to the other two tested tissues, <italic>Muc91C</italic> expression was mostly highly expressed in the trachea of both infested or non-infested adult beetles. These results have been added in line 280-285 and Figure 4C. In addition, the immunostaining of Muc91C has shown its primary localization in tracheal tubes but not in other associated tissues, as demonstrated by Figure 4E &amp; 4F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second: RNAi against Muc91C seems to produce viable beetles. I would expect a reduction in overall fitness, though. May this, if the case, affect the interaction with pwn?</p></disp-quote><p>The viability of beetles was not affected by RNAi against <italic>Muc91C</italic> and we add this results in this revised vision. In RNAi efficiency assessment, TEM imaging and tensile testing, ds<italic>GFP</italic> or ds<italic>Muc91C</italic> were injected into beetle adults within two days after molting and treated with 1% O<sub>2</sub> for 12h after dsRNA injection. All treated beetles survived until tracheal dissection, as shown in line 377 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B. In the RNAi experiments for PWN loading, <italic>dsGFP</italic> and <italic>dsMuc91C</italic> resulted in similar proportions of death before dissection for counting, as shown in line 387-388 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1C.</p><p>Collectively, RNAi against <italic>Muc91C</italic> did not reduce the fitness of beetles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The cloudy situation of the relationship tracheal development/differentiation, gene expression and organ response should be clarified: we need a thorough description of tracheal development/differentiation; the course of tracheal development/differentiation should be next correlated with gene expression (for instance Muc91C). This is a crucial experiment as this would be the first example that the main tracheal system may respond to the environment (here pwn and hypoxia) even after differentiation. Moreover, it would strengthen or serve to refute the argument of Muc91C being expressed and functional beyond terminal differentiation of the tracheal system. Overall, I consider this issue as very crucial as the current version reports only on a phenomenon rather than on a biological process.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is very constructive and essentially the same with the comment #1. By thoroughly assessing the time course of metamorphosis, our work (Tang et al., 2022) has confirmed that the tracheal development/differentiation is almost terminated within the first five days after eclosion. As the comment suggested, we analyzed the temporal changes for the gene expression of the 45 ECM-related genes (including <italic>Muc91C</italic>) at different time points post eclosion, using the released RNA-seq data. In the revised text, we add this analysis in line 251-261 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We found that all genes were expressed at low levels after five days post-elcosion. For <italic>Muc91C</italic> specifically, its expression was 2-fold upregulated three days after eclosion but was downregulated during the later stages post eclosion. These results are consistent with the dynamics of other tracheal genes exhibiting upregulation mainly during the first five days post eclosion. Therefore, the current study provides an example that the tracheal system is able to respond to the environment. Moreover, PWN loading results in a 7-fold increase of <italic>Muc91C</italic> expression, a higher fold-change than that during tracheal development. This result thus supports the argument of Muc91C being expressed and functional beyond terminal differentiation of the tracheal system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The robustness of their conclusion on the relevance of Muc91C function would increase if additional genes (only mucs are not sufficient) expression were knocked-down (such as the chitin synthase coding gene on the list in Figure 3) and the resulting phenotypes analysed.</p></disp-quote><p>Further studies should be carried out to systematically assess the function of diverse ECM components in nematode-altered tracheal elasticity as suggested. In this study, we focused on Muc91C, the foremost component that directly linked with the hypoxia- or PWN enhanced thickness and elasticity of the non-chitinous ECM layer on the basis of TEM observation, immunostaining and gene structure analysis. The incomplete reduced elasticity under hypoxic condition in ds<italic>Muc91C</italic>injected beetles suggested complementary roles of other components. In the revised text, we discussed the coordination among Muc91C and other ECM in determining tracheal elasticity in the Discussion (line 463-473).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We need also clarification regarding the rubberization issue (lines 163ff): it is unclear how this was measured.

In this revised version, we added higher magnification images of Muc91C in tracheal system with null or heavy nematode loading, by scanning through 63x objective and setting confocal zoom factor to 4x, thus focusing on a small section of the membrane, as shown in line 319-327 and Figure 5A &amp;B, at the bottom right panels. The images provide robust evidence that heavy nematode loading caused substantial upregulation of Muc91C beneath the layer of chitinous taenidial folds and above the apical membrane of the tracheal cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Reference to the elastic property of repeat A: the way the authors state that Muc91 repeat A has been shown to &quot;regulate elasticity&quot; is, to my understanding, wrong. First, repeat A from pro-resiling has been shown to confer elasticity, not of Muc91. Second, elasticity does not come from the repeats, but from their ability to form di-tyrosine bridges, and this has not been shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Repeat A in elastic pro-resilins has been proved to confer elasticity. In the revised version, we described in details the correlation between repeat A of Muc91C and elasticity in line 344-350 by adding related literature, and made revision to the presentation of causality in line 359-364. Repeat A in Muc91C of <italic>M. alternatus</italic> (PSSSYGAPS) contains glycine and proline residues, which can form a stretchable β-spiral structure (Ardell and Andersen, 2001; Tatham and Shewry, 2002). Besides, the tyrosines residues in repeat A of Muc91C facilitate the formation of di-tyrosine crosslinks with other repeats (Andersen, 2010; Qin et al., 2009). Thus, repeat A of Muc91C is likely to confer long-range elasticity. This has been further evidenced by an empirical study showing that peptide chains synthesized from 16 copies of similarly repeat A (AQTPSSQYGAP) in Muc91C of <italic>A. gambiae</italic> can from rubber-like elastic materials (Lyons et al., 2007; Nairn et al., 2008).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– My argument that Muc91 may be involved in retaining water in the cuticle and thereby contributing to elasticity was refuted. Fine with me, if this was done with a valid argument. Muc91 as a mucin may bind water and thereby contribute to elasticity, and not (only) via its repeats.</p></disp-quote><p>We highly appreciate this comment that contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of our results, and agree with you that mucins may bind water because of the decoration by sugars (Wagner et al., 2018) and the Muc91C which may plasticized by water coating may provide additional elasticity from the surface tension of the liquid, as proved in spider silk (Vollrath and Edmonds, 1989), in addition to repeated sequences. This possible contribution of water in elasticity of Muc91C was added in <italic>Discussion</italic> line 496-500.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Young's modulus: did I understand correctly that the forces were measured along the main axis of the tracheal tubes? To me, they should be measured perpendicular to the main axis. Please describe the method more in detail. Forces may be different in different directions.</p></disp-quote><p>We added more details in the methods describing measurement of mechanical property of tracheal tubes in line 600-602 and provided more explanation of Young’s modulus in 603-604. The forces were measured along the main axis (the axial direction), according to the procedures of tensile testing on muscle fibres (Krysiak et al., 2018). We used Young’s module to characterize the elasticity of tracheal tubes, because this constant can specify the stiffness of a material irrespective of directionality of the pulling force used (Feynman et al., 1965).</p><p>References</p><p>Andersen SO.
