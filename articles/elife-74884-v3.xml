However, how host factors regulate LLPS of viral proteins during negative-sense RNA (NSR) virus infection is largely unknown. Here, we used <italic>barley yellow striate mosaic virus</italic> (BYSMV) as a model to demonstrate regulation of host casein kinase 1 (CK1) in phase separation and infection of NSR viruses. We first found that the BYSMV phosphoprotein (P) formed spherical granules with liquid properties and recruited viral nucleotide (N) and polymerase (L) proteins in vivo. Moreover, the P-formed granules were tethered to the ER/actin network for trafficking and fusion. BYSMV P alone formed droplets and incorporated the N protein and the 5′ trailer of genomic RNA in vitro. Interestingly, phase separation of BYSMV P was inhibited by host CK1-dependent phosphorylation of an intrinsically disordered P protein region. Genetic assays demonstrated that the unphosphorylated mutant of BYSMV P exhibited condensed phase, which promoted viroplasm formation and virus replication. Whereas, the phosphorylation-mimic mutant existed in diffuse phase state for virus transcription. Collectively, our results demonstrate that host CK1 modulates phase separation of the viral P protein and virus infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>negative-sense RNA viruses</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>liquid-liquid phase separation</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>viroplasm</kwd><kwd>casein kinase 1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31872920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xian-Bing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32102150</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021T140713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Liquid-liquid phase separation of a rhabovirus phosphoprotein initiates viral factory formation of barley yellow striate mosaic virus<italic>,</italic> a plant negative-sense RNA virus, and host casein kinase 1-mediated phosphorylation inhibits phase separation and virus infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the last few years, increasing studies have shown that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has critical roles in assembly of cellular membraneless organelles such as P bodies, stress granules, cajal bodies, and the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Handwerger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feric et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boeynaems et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darling et al., 2019</xref>). LLPS concentrates specific molecules like proteins and nucleic acids into liquid-like compartments for fulfillment of their biological functions. The underlying molecular mechanisms have been of increased interests due to the important roles of LLPS in various physiological and pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darling et al., 2019</xref>). LLPS is usually triggered by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins and/or multivalent macromolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, LLPS is modulated by protein posttranslational modifications, host factors, and cellular environment changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Owen and Shewmaker, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Many negative-sense RNA (NSR) viruses are known to form membraneless replication compartments, called viroplasms, viral inclusion bodies (IBs), or viral factories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lahaye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoenen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rincheval et al., 2017</xref>). Studies about animal NSR viruses have revealed that LLPS plays important roles in viroplasm formation through concentrating viral and host components. The viroplasms of the rabies virus known as Negri bodies (NBs) were first reported to have the features of liquid organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nikolic et al., 2017</xref>). Subsequent studies have shown that another two animal NSR viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus and measles virus, also exploit LLPS to form virus IBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). The P protein of borna disease virus and the N protein of ebola virus are also sufficient to elicit formation of liquid organelles alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charlier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miyake et al., 2020</xref>). However, most of these studies mainly focus on animal viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brocca et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Su et al., 2021</xref>), whereas it remains very limited in plant viruses. Recently, Li et al. revealed that turnip mosaic virus, a positive-stranded RNA virus, hijacks host RNA helicase proteins to form viral bodies through LLPS with viral proteins for viral proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, the long-distance movement protein p26 of pea enation mosaic virus 2 undergoes phase separation with cellular factors to modulate virus-host interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2021</xref>). Nonetheless, host factors regulating LLPS of plant NSR viroplasms are still largely unknown.</p><p><italic>Barley yellow striate mosaic virus</italic> (BYSMV) is a member of the <italic>Cytorhabdovirus</italic> genus, family Rhabdoviridae in the order Mononegavirales. BYSMV infects cereal plants and severely affects crop production worldwide through persistent transmission by the small brown planthopper (<italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic>). The BYSMV genome encodes five structural proteins, including the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), and polymerase (L), as well as another five accessory proteins, in the order 3′–N–P–P3–P4/P5–P6–M–G–P9–L–5′ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, we have developed minireplicon (BYSMV-antigenomic MR [agMR]) systems and full-length cDNA clones of recombinant BYSMV (rBYSMV) for infections of plants and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). Using the BYSMV reverse genetic systems, we have also shown that host factors, including casein kinase 1 (CK1) and the deadenylation factor CCR4, are involved in virus cross-kingdom infections of host plants and insect vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, CK1-mediated phosphorylation of a highly serine-rich (SR) motif at the C-terminal IDR of the P protein regulates virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying regulation of the BYSMV P phosphorylation in virus infection are not well understood.</p><p>Here, using live-cell fluorescence microscopy to observe the localization of the BYSMV N, P, and L core replication proteins, we noticed that ectopic expression of the BYSMV P protein alone resulted in spherical cytoplasmic granules. We also found that the BYSMV P-formed granules have properties of liquid organelles in vivo and in vitro. Host CK1-mediated phosphorylation of BYSMV P inhibits LLPS. The roles of the BYSMV P phosphorylation and the LLPS in virus replication and transcription were investigated and discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The BYSMV P protein forms liquid-like granules through LLPS in vivo</title><p>To observe BYSMV viroplasms in vivo, BYSMV-infected barley stems were cut into ultra-thin sections and the structures formed in the cytoplasm were monitored by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Therefore, the transcriptional activities of these mutants were compared through normalization of RFP mRNA levels relative to the gMR templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In contrast, the conserved CK1 protein kinases phosphorylate the SR region of BYSMV P to hyper-phosphorylated P forms and compromise LLPS, which results in soluble RNPs for virus transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

In addition, the granules move along the ER/actin network and fuse with each other. In the transcription sites, the serine-rich (SR) motif in the middle intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of BYSMV P is phosphorylated by casein kinase 1 (CK1), and the resulting hyper-phosphorylated P is unable to undergo phase separation, which facilitates virus transcription and viral mRNA release for viral protein translation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74884-fig7-v3.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Membraneless virus IBs or viroplasms are hallmarks of NSR virus infections. In recent studies, LLPS has emerged as a critical mechanism in formation of replication factories of animal NSR viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brocca et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Su et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, the mechanisms whereby plant NSR viruses form viroplasms as replication sites have not been characterized. Here, we provide the first evidence, to the best of our knowledge, that a plant NSR virus uses LLPS to form viral replication center. We have identified a novel <italic>Cytorhabdovirus</italic> P protein function that provides a scaffold protein for viroplasm formation. The BYSMV P protein can undergo phase separation alone in vivo and in vitro to concentrate membraneless compartments for virus replication. The NBs of rabies virus were formed through phase separation, which however requires co-expression of both the N and P proteins and residues 132–150 of an intrinsically disordered domain within the P protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nikolic et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Another intriguing finding in our study is that host CK1-dependent phosphorylation of the BYSMV P protein inhibits phase separation. Our previous study has shown that the conserved CK1 kinases of host plants and insect vectors are responsible for phosphorylation of a SR motif at the middle IDR of BYSMV P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study, we found that the BYSMV P granules were dispersed by phosphorylation-mimic mutations (P<sup>S5D</sup>) of the SR motif or overexpression of CK1 proteins in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). These results are in agreement with recent reports in mammalian cells in which CK2-mediated phosphorylation of zona occludens, a cytoplasmic scaffolding protein, inhibits homologous phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beutel et al., 2019</xref>). The partitioning defective 3/6 (Par3/Par6) condensates are also dispersed by PKC-mediated phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, precisely balanced phosphorylation states may represent additional regulators of protein phase separation and cellular functions.</p><p>Rhabdovirus transcription and replication complexes contain common virus replication derivatives, in which the N-RNA complex serves as a template for viral RdRp complexes comprising the P and L proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ivanov et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, how to uncouple rhabdovirus transcription and replication processes has remained elusive for many years because both complexes contain the N, P, and L proteins and the viral genomic RNA. Here, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation mutants (P<sup>S5A</sup>) in the SR motif of BYSMV P have high LLPS activity that is coupled with enhanced virus replication. On the other hand, the phosphorylation-mimic mutant (P<sup>S5D</sup>) is impaired in LLPS, which facilitates virus transcription but significantly inhibits virus replication. Therefore, these results suggest that condensed phase of RNPs as viroplasms are a positive regulator for virus replication, but inhibit virus transcription. During rhabdovirus replication, the newly synthesized genome or antigenome need to be encapsidated by the N protein, which requires a continuous supply of RNA-free N molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ivanov et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is not surprising to find that LLPS of BYSMV P facilitates concentration of the BYSMV N protein into virus replication sites. In contrast, viral mRNAs are released without N encapsidation, which results in dispersed protein rather than condensed N protein in virus transcription sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the phosphorylation of the BYSMV P SR region by host CK1s abrogates the liquid-like membraneless viroplasms and subsequently drives the switch from virus replication to transcription.</p><p>Emerging evidence shows that the biogenesis and dynamics of phase-separated membraneless condensates require membranes as assembly platforms for transportation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao and Zhang, 2020</xref>). For instance, ER contact sites regulate the biogenesis and fission of two important membraneless organelles, processing bodies (PBs) and liquid spherical stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). More interestingly, mRNA translation inhibition facilitates formation of PB condensates, whereas increasing the translational activity induces PB disassembly, indicating that the ER contact sites may shuttle mRNAs between the ER and PBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). In the current study, we observed that the ER/actin network acts as a platform to facilitate trafficking and fusion of the GFP-P granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Given that viroplasms need large amount of BYSMV N to encapsidate newly synthesized genomic/antigenomic RNAs, the BYSMV P-mediated condensates on the ER/actin network opens up the possibility that ER-viroplasm contact sites are conduits for viral protein and mRNA exchange between the two organelles. Taken together, we propose that the BYSMV P condensates tether on the ER tubules and are dispersed by CK1-mediated phosphorylation. Subsequently, virus transcription is stimulated and viral mRNAs are transported to the ER for efficient translation.</p><p>Although the roles of LLPS in viral infections are emerging, multilayered regulatory mechanisms controlling assembly and disassembly of protein condensates remain to be explored. Here, we provide evidence that a plant <italic>Cytorhabdovirus</italic> P protein-mediated LLPS triggers formation of localized viral protein condensates for optimized virus replication. Currently, we cannot assemble active viroplasms in vitro, because the larger L polymerase protein (234 kDa) is difficult to express and purify from <italic>E. coli</italic>. Therefore, we cannot directly measure the contribution of two P phosphorylation states (P<sup>S5A</sup> and P<sup>S5D</sup>) to virus replication and transcription in vitro. Furthermore, future studies are required to identify the spatiotemporal control mechanisms of host factors including CK1 in viral protein phase separations. Another interesting but unresolved question is how cellular membranes, such as the plasma membrane or ER, regulate the biogenesis and dynamics of viroplasm condensates during virus infection. Nonetheless, these results increase our understanding of the distinct roles of host CK1 and LLPS in rhabdovirus transcription and replication.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BL21</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#C600003</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EHA105</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Weidibiotechnology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#AC1012</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-GST (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#ab9085</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-FLAG (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#F1804</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-RFP (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB(1:3000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-BYSMV-P (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB(1:3000) IEM(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Mouse lgG (H + L)-HRP Conjugate (Goat polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bio-Rad</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#170–6516</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB(1:20,000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Rabbit lgG (H + L)-HRP Conjugate (Goat polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EASYBIO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#BE0101</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB(1:20,000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Rabbit IgG-gold Conjugate (Goat polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#G7402</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IEM(1:50)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RiboMAXTM Large Scale RNA Production System-T7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Promega</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#P1300</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Latrunculin B</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#ab144291</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GraphPad Prism 8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22434839/">22434839</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ImageJ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22930834/">22930834</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Based on the pBYSMV-agMR vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2019</xref>), the inverse PCR product containing an adenine insertion after the start codon of RsGFP was self-ligated to generate the pBY-agMR-RFP vector.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Host casein kinase 1-mediated phosphorylation modulates phase separation of a rhabdovirus phosphoprotein and virus infection&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Xiaoming Zhang (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Specificity of 1,6-hexanediol treatment on BYSMV infection should be demonstrated by including a control virus infection.</p><p>2) To claim that phase separation of P protein modulates replication vs transcription, NbCK1 should be knockdown/knockout and assess the effect on P protein phase separation and on viral transcription and replication.</p><p>3) Phase separation property of P protein should be demonstrated when delivered using full-length infectious clone or mini-replicon in its natural host barley.</p><p>4) Include statistical tests and quantification of FRAP and other microscopy data presented in the manuscript with appropriate controls and normalization.</p><p>5) Explain the mini-replicon vectors with GFP and RFP and the related experiments to clarify the difference between replication vs transcription so that non-virologists could understand why making a frameshift mutation only abolishes GFP fluorescence but not RFP. Unless additional experimental data is included in the revision regarding mini-replicon experiments, soften the claim that the phase separation of P modulates replication vs. transcription.</p><p>6) Either soften the claim that viral genomic RNA is recruited to the P-N droplets or include data showing that the full-length BYSMV RNA is indeed recruited to the droplets.</p><p>7) Remove hollow droplets data of P protein or move the data to supplement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In summary, this is an interesting paper. Authors should show that P protein produced during normal infection does indeed undergo phase separation. Authors have necessary tools to demonstrate this. Furthermore, they should by some genetic experiments that NbCK1 is the one that regulates this process.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors conclusively demonstrate that P protein phase separates and can be inhibited by CK1 kinase activity. These are the strengths of the study. The conclusions that P phase separation favors replication vs. transcription is not as strongly supported. The minireplicon system data is confusing and the use of 1,6-HD is not sufficient for concluding that phase separation of BYSMV P protein is essential for virus fitness.</p><p>Below are issues that should be addressed before publication:</p><p>1. The use of 1,6-hexanediol in Figure 6 is not a suitable approach for multiple reasons.</p><p>a. 1,6-HD is toxic to cells (see reference in public review).</p><p>b. 1,6-HD disrupts kinase and phosphatase activity (see ref above).</p><p>c. The authors do not demonstrate that 1,6-HD inhibited P phase separation in the insect vector or barley (i.e. how do you know the treatment worked?).</p><p>d. Reduced virus accumulation is likely a result of cell toxicity.</p><p>2. FRAP data is not properly normalized.</p><p>a. Figure 1D: The authors state that approximately 80% of the signal recovered following FRAP. However, this is misleading when the photobleaching only reduced the signal to 20%. The actual recovery was closer to 60%. See https://bio-protocol.org/e2525 for an example of FRAP normalization. Typically, the post bleach signal should be set at 0% to give a more discernable recovery. This issue is also present in Figure 2E. 60% of the signal did not recover based on the data present. The FRAP data must be properly normalized. The %recovery in Figure 2E is less than 50% but the images presented in Figure 2D show much higher recovery (this reviewer sees &gt;80% recovery, possibly higher).</p><p>3. Minireplicon data must be better described (including the experimental design).</p><p>a. Most readers will not be familiar with rhabdovirus replication and minireplicon systems. The system needs to be better described.</p><p>b. It is unclear how S5D can have the highest RFP transcription, but the lowest RFP translation. Is translational repression occurring? The data in panel D does not match the confocal or western blot data concerning RFP expression.</p><p>c. How was replication/transcription differentiated between 2x35S-driven transcription?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Thus, I recommend this paper to publish in your journal, <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In the following, I presented a few concerns in regarding to the conclusion of this paper that the authors may want to consider when revising the manuscript. Major concerns:</p><p>1) Although the authors claimed that &quot;BYSMV P protein forms liquid-like granules through LLPS in vivo&quot;, they did not show any phase separation results of BYSMV P protein in barley, the real host of BYSMV. Although they showed some granular structure in Figure S1A (the quality of Figure 1A is bad), they didn't provide evidence to prove these granules are generated by BYSMV. Instead of granules generated by viruses, these granules may be host P bodies or stress granules that react to viral infections. The author can perform immune-electron microscope or other experiments to prove that these granules are indeed formed by P protein.</p><p>2) In Figure 6, the author revealed that the phosphorylation of P protein modulates the proliferation of viruses. Although the reviewer believes that the phase separation of P protein facilitates the viral proliferations, the author does not provide direct evidence to prove that. They only showed the correlation of P protein phase separation and viral proliferations. As it is very hard to prove this hypothesis in vitro, the author can lower the tone of their statements.</p><p>3) By detecting the accumulations of full-length genome minigenome and the mRNA in Figure 6C and 6D, the author claimed that the phase separation of P protein enhances replication but suppress transcription. However, the accumulations of virus transcript may not only be caused by the increased biogenesis, but also may be the results of decreased degradation. Again, the author needs to tone down their conclusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74884.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Specificity of 1,6-hexanediol treatment on BYSMV infection should be demonstrated by including a control virus infection.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggestion of three Reviewers, 1, 6-hexanediol induced cellular toxicity and hereby affected infections of BYSMV and other viruses nonspecifically. In addition, 1, 6-hexanediol would inhibit LLPS of cellular membraneless organelles, such as P-bodies, stress granules, cajal bodies, and the nucleolus, which might also affect different virus infections directly or indirectly. In Figure 6A, GFP-P<sup>S5A</sup> underwent phase separation and supported efficient replication of BYSMV. In contrast, GFP-P<sup>S5D</sup> could not LLPS and supported very less replication of BYSMV, indicating important roles of BYSMV P LLPS in viral replication. Therefore, we removed these results of 6F-J, which does not affect the main conclusion of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To claim that phase separation of P protein modulates replication vs transcription, NbCK1 should be knockdown/knockout and assess the effect on P protein phase separation and on viral transcription and replication.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions. Indeed, there are some technical reasons in RNAi and overexpressed in barley plants for the following reasons. In our previous studies, BLAST searches showed that the <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> and barley genomes encode 14 CK1 orthologues, most of which can phosphorylated the SR region of BYSMV P. However, multiple CK1 proteins with low homology sequences could phosphorylate the BYSMV P protein, thus it is difficult to silence many CK1 genes at the same time. Secondly, overexpression of CK1 would induce cell death probably some other targets of CK1 proteins</p><p>Accordingly, we generated a point mutant (K38R and D128N) in HvCK1.2, in which the kinase activity was abolished. Overexpression of HvCK1.2<sup>DN</sup> inhibit endogenous CK1-mediated phosphorylation of BYSMV P, indicating that HvCK1.2<sup>DN</sup> is a dominant-negative mutant. Overexpression of HvCK1.2<sup>DN</sup> in BYSMV vector inhibit virus infection by impairing the balance of endogenous CK1-mediated phosphorylation in BYSMV P. These results have been described in our recent studies (Gao et al., 2020, Figure 8 and S14).</p><p>Here, overexpression of wild type NbCK1 can abolish LLPS of BYSMV P. In contrast, overexpression of NbCK1<sup>DN</sup> did not phosphorylate the P protein or inhibit LLPS of BYSMV P. Please see Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Gao Q, et al., 2020.

BYSMV is a negative-stranded RNA virus, and its inoculation is strictly dependent on transmission of the small brown planthopper. We have tried to fuse GFP to BYSMV P in the full-length infectious clones. Unfortunately, we could not rescue BYSMV-GFP-P into barley plants through insect transmission.</p><p>Nonetheless, we carried out immune-electron microscope using BYSMV-infected barley leaves to show the presence of BYSMV P protein in the viroplasms. Please see Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>In addition, we further showed that GFP-P underwent phase separation in protoplasts of barley and maize leaves, as well as rBYSMV-RFP-infected leaves. Please see Figure 1—figure supplement 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Include statistical tests and quantification of FRAP and other microscopy data presented in the manuscript with appropriate controls and normalization.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and appreciate the helpful suggestions. As the suggested method of Reviewer 2, we analyzed again the data of FRAP to include statistical tests and quantification. We also added mock or healthy controls and large views of confocal results. Please see Figure 1A, 2E, and Supplement Figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Explain the mini-replicon vectors with GFP and RFP and the related experiments to clarify the difference between replication vs transcription so that non-virologists could understand why making a frameshift mutation only abolishes GFP fluorescence but not RFP. Unless additional experimental data is included in the revision regarding mini-replicon experiments, soften the claim that the phase separation of P modulates replication vs. transcription.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your questions and we are sorry for the lack of clarity regarding to the mini-replicon vectors. In our previous studies (Fang et al., 2019), Co-expression of agMR, N, P, L, and VSRs is essential for GFP and RFP protein expression, indicating that co-expressed N, P, and L proteins were functionally active in replication of the agMR derivatives and in transcription of reporter mRNAs.</p><p>Here, we updated Figure 6—figure supplement 1 to show detail information of replication and transcription of BYSMV minireplicon. In addition, we insert an A after the start codon to abolish the translation of GFP mRNA, which allow us to observe localization of GFP-P<sup>WT</sup>, GFP-P<sup>S5A</sup>, and GFP-P<sup>S5D</sup>. Use this system, we wanted to show the localization and phase separation of GFP-P<sup>WT</sup>, GFP-P<sup>S5A</sup>, and GFP-P<sup>S5D</sup> during replication and transcription of BYS-agMR. As expected, GFP-P<sup>S5A</sup> underwent phase separation and supported high efficient replication of BYSMV. In contrast, GFP-P<sup>S5D</sup> could not LLPS and supported very less replication of BYSMV. Through RT-qPCR assays, we found that GFP-P<sup>S5A</sup> and GFP-P<sup>S5D</sup> support increased replication and transcription, respectively, which is consistent with our previous studies using P<sup>S5A</sup> and P<sup>S5D</sup> (Gao et al., 2020).
