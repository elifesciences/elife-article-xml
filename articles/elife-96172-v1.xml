functional processes, including virulence and metabolic pathways that control its ability to infect host plants. Although the molecular mechanisms of regulators have been studied for decades, a comprehensive understanding of genome-wide TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A remains limited. Here, we investigated the binding characteristics of 170 of 301 annotated TFs through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Fifty-four TFs, 62 TFs, and 147 TFs were identified in top-level, middle-level, and bottom-level, reflecting multiple higher-order network structures and direction of information flow. More than 40,000 TF pairs were classified into 13 three-node submodules which revealed the regulatory diversity of TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A regulatory network. We found that bottom-level TFs performed high co-associated scores to their target genes. Functional categories of TFs at three levels encompassed various regulatory pathways. Three and 25 master TFs were identified to involve in virulence and metabolic regulation, respectively. Evolutionary analysis and topological modularity network revealed functional variability and various conservation of TFs in <italic>P. syringae</italic> (<italic>Psph</italic> 1448A, <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000, <italic>Pss</italic> B728a, and <italic>Psa</italic> C48). Overall, our findings demonstrated a global transcriptional regulatory network of genome-wide TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A.

Transcription factors (TFs) play a crucial role in this process by acting as key regulators that coordinate various biological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee and Young, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Papavassiliou and Papavassiliou, 2016</xref>). TFs control the recruitment of RNA polymerase by identifying and binding to the promoters of downstream genes, thereby either activating or repressing the expression of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lambert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wade, 2015</xref>). Numerous studies have focused on regulatory events in eukaryotic species, such as humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>), mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badis et al., 2009</xref>), and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>), and prokaryotic species, such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shen-Orr et al., 2002</xref>). However, limited comprehensive TF-binding datasets for microbial pathogens are available.</p><p><italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>, an important Gram-negative phytopathogen and a model pathogenic bacterium, infects many plants, including economically valuable crops, resulting in substantial annual economic losses globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirano and Upper, 2000</xref>). Upon entering host cells, <italic>P. syringae</italic> employs several strategies, such as changing its motility type and secreting phytotoxins, to overcome the plant’s immune defences and establish colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bender et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ichinose et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taguchi and Ichinose, 2011</xref>). <italic>P. syringae</italic> causes severe diseases by secreting various effector proteins through the needle-like type III secretion system (T3SS); this process is regulated by a cluster of TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cunnac et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hendrickson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). The alternative sigma factor RpoN activates the transcription of another alternative sigma factor, HrpL, which, in turn, binds to the pathogenicity (<italic>hrp</italic>) box in the promoter region of T3SS genes, regulating most of these T3SS genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfano and Collmer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xiao and Hutcheson, 1994</xref>). HrpS is one of the most important TFs that regulate numerous biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Its heterodimeric complex, HrpRS, is modulated by at least 6 two-component systems (TCSs): RhpRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deng et al., 2014</xref>), CvsRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fishman et al., 2018</xref>), GacAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chatterjee et al., 2003</xref>), AauRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yan et al., 2020</xref>), CbrAB2, and EnvZ-OmpR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shao et al., 2021</xref>). In particular, RhpRS serves as a master regulator of T3SS in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A. RhpRS senses plant-derived signals, such as polyphenols, through the histidine kinase Pro40 within RhpS and controls the expression of T3SS genes in response to environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xie et al., 2021</xref>). Within the sensor region, the cognate response regulator RhpR undergoes modulation in its phosphorylation state by RhpS, thereby regulating a group of T3SS genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2010</xref>). Phosphorylated RhpR directly binds to the <italic>hrpRS</italic> promoter, suppressing the <italic>hrpRS</italic> operon and the subsequent <italic>hrpRS-hrpL-hrp</italic> cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Recently, through a combined analysis of RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we identified seven additional TCSs (ErcS, Dcsbis, PhoBR, CzcSR, AlgB/KinB, MerS, and CopRS) that regulate the virulence of <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xie et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, we developed an intricate PSTCSome (<italic>Psph</italic> 1448A TCS regulome) network containing numerous functional genes that respond to changing environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xie et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, we examined the overall crosstalk between 16 virulence-related regulators under different growth conditions, such as King’s B (KB) and minimal media. By analysing differentially expressed genes and binding peaks, we constructed a <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A regulatory network (PSRnet), revealing the involvement of hundreds of functional genes in virulence pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shao et al., 2021</xref>). We also elucidated the molecular mechanisms and functions of TFs binding within coding sequences (CDS) and found that CDS-binding TFs interact with cryptic promoters in coding regions, thereby regulating the expression of subgenus and antisense RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hua et al., 2022</xref>). We propose a luminescence reporter system designed to quantitatively measure the translational elongation rates (ERs) of T3SS-related proteins. Our findings demonstrate the key roles of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and elongation factors in modulating translational ERs and facilitating T3SS protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sun et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Although many key virulence regulators in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A have been studied, the global regulatory mechanism and interactions of all 301 annotated TFs across various biological processes remain unclear. To comprehensively explore the DNA-binding features and map the transcriptional regulatory network of all TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A, we constructed 170 TF-overexpressing strains and used ChIP-seq, a highly effective and important technology for analysing protein-DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mathelier et al., 2015</xref>). This analysis not only provided insights into the interactions between TFs and their target genes but also revealed the hierarchy (top, middle, and bottom) and co-association scores of all these TFs. We found that more than half of 270 TFs (100 TFs from HT-SELEX and 170 TFs in this study) in downstream position tended to be regulated by top TFs and bound to the target genes with high co-associated scores. Different TF pairs were classified into 13 basic three-node submodules, including ringent loops and locked loops. In addition, we mapped the hierarchical binding network of TFs and identified three virulence-related master TFs and 23 metabolic master TFs. Furthermore, we employed ChIP-seq to determine the binding sites of five TFs in four <italic>P</italic>. <italic>syringae</italic> lineages (<italic>Psph</italic> 1448A, <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000, <italic>Pss</italic> B728a, and <italic>Psa</italic> C48), revealing the diversity of TF-binding events and the varying functions of TFs among different <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains. Topological modularity classification of the network, including TFs and target genes, revealed the diverse biological functions of TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A. This study provides a global and convenient platform for understanding the transcriptional regulatory characteristics and biological functions of TFs in <italic>P. syringae</italic>. In addition, this study provides valuable insights that can inform the development of effective therapies for not only <italic>P. syringae</italic> but also other associated infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ChIP-seq analysis revealed the binding specificities of 170 previously uncharacterised TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A</title><p>Based on the current annotations available on ‘<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> Genome DB’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pseudomonas.com/">https://www.pseudomonas.com/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Winsor et al., 2016</xref>), we initially determined the locations of all 301 annotated TFs in the <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). To elucidate the binding preferences and functional characteristics of TFs of <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A, we performed ChIP-seq for the 170 TFs, including 3 (1.8%) predicted transcriptional regulators, 132 (77.6%) annotated transcriptional regulators, and 35 (20.6%) functional proteins with DNA-binding annotations. Based on the DNA-binding domains as annotated in the TF prediction database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>), we categorised the 170 analysed TFs into 25 families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). The majority of TFs belonged to the LysR, TetR, AsnC, GntR, and AraC families. Among these TFs, PSPPH4700, PSPPH3798, CysB, PSPPH1951, PSPPH4638, PSPPH3504, PSPPH3268, and Irp exhibited over 1000 binding peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The enriched loci of these binding peaks indicated that these TFs displayed a significant preference for binding to promoters, directly regulating the transcription of downstream targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The peak loci of 10 TFs (PSPPH0286, PSPPH0411, PSPPH0711, PSPPH1734, PSPPH2357, PSPPH2407, PSPPH2862, PSPPH3155, PSPPH3431, PSPPH3468, PSPPH4127, PSPPH4622, and PSPPH4768) were completely enriched in the promoter region, with the majority of them belonging to the LysR family. Taken together, the 170 tested TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A had over 26,000 DNA-binding peaks distributed across different regions of target genes, suggesting their direct regulatory functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Hierarchical TFs reflected multiple higher-order network structures</title><p>Transcriptional changes in bacteria are often manipulated by a complex network of TFs. However, bacterial TFs usually have been studied individually or in small clusters with related functions. To comprehensively investigate the associations of all TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A at a system level, we constructed a hierarchical network of 270 analysed TFs (100 TFs from HT-SELEX and 170 TFs in this study). The findings revealed 1757 TF interactions among these 26,000 binding events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Subsequently, we computed information flow parameters for each TF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>). In brief, we defined out-degree (O) and in-degree (I) as the number of interactions of a TF in the hierarchical network, representing the regulation of other factors by this TF and the regulation of this TF by other factors, respectively. The difference between O and I indicated the direction of information flow in the network. Hierarchy height (H) was defined as the normalised metric of information circulation, calculated as H=(O−I)/(O+I). When H was close to 1 (H ≈ 1), it indicated that these TFs tended to regulate other factors and occupy upstream positions in the network. Conversely, when H was close to −1 (H ≈ −1), it indicated that these TFs were more likely to be regulated than to regulate other TFs, occupying downstream positions in the network. Based on these criteria, we categorised the 270 analysed TFs (100 TFs from HT-SELEX and 170 TFs in this study) into three levels: 54 (20%) executive TFs (such as AlgQ, LexA2, and PSPPH0222) at the top level, 62 (23%) communicat ive TFs (such as MexT, PsrA, and PSPPH1100) at the middle level, and 147 (54%) foreman TFs (such as PobR, DksA2, and PSPPH0755) at the bottom level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). The presence of a larger number of TFs (147) at the bottom level indicated a high degree of information flow, suggesting the maximisation of the number of downward-pointing edges in the network.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hierarchical height and collaboration of transcription factors (TFs) reveal the multiple regulatory patterns in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Close-up representation of 262 TFs hierarchy in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A (8 TFs showed no hierarchical characteristic).

This tendency indicated a downward information flow of transcription regulation of <italic>P. syringae</italic>. Therefore, we defined the direct binding between two TFs as a direct interaction and investigated collaborations within and between hierarchy levels, specifically intra-level (top to top ‘TT’, middle to middle ‘MM’, and bottom to bottom ‘BB’) and inter-level (top to middle ‘TM’, top to bottom ‘TB’, and middle to bottom ‘MB’) interactions, indirect interaction if two TFs co-associated with one target DNA and cooperative TF pair was defined if their common target was from a TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). In terms of the top-level TFs, direct interactions became more enriched as the hierarchy level of their collaborators decreased. Direct interactions between TB pairs constituted the most substantial portion, accounting for nearly half of all interactions. A similar pattern was observed among the bottom-level TFs, where interactions diminished as the hierarchy level of their collaborators decreased. Compared with interactions among the top- and bottom-level TFs, middle-level TFs, serving as information transmission centres, exhibited lower levels of intra-level collaborations. In summary, transcriptional regulation within the TF hierarchy was predominantly manipulated by top-level TFs, which directed the flow of information to downstream TFs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Multiple three-node submodules revealed the regulatory diversity of TFs in the <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A regulatory network</title><p>Natural networks, including transcriptional regulation networks, usually show complex characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Newman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strogatz, 2001</xref>). Among complex networks, some small-scale networks demonstrate numerous connections between individual information nodes and information clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amaral et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeong et al., 2000</xref>). To investigate the basic structural features of our transcription network, we defined directed edges as direct interactions between two TF nodes and identified global submodules comprising different TF nodes. In this study, we specifically focused on three-node modules, which were considered as ‘network motifs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Milo et al., 2002</xref>). Using algorithms designed to detect recurring modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shen-Orr et al., 2002</xref>), we scanned our hierarchy network and identified 40,307 different pairs across 13 basic three-node submodules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>In the first six submodules, we observed that two TF nodes established a relationship only through another node. We denoted these submodules (M1–M6) as ‘ringent loops’. These seemingly simpler regulation modules appeared more in the <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A transcriptional regulatory network, especially the first module (M1, n=24,479), indicating that <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A favours the use of simple but efficient modes for modulating transcriptional regulation. For example, PhnF and FruR were directly regulated by CysB (M1), and CapA was coregulated by Anr and PSPPH4700 simultaneously (M3, n=6177). In addition, M6 (n=20) contained pairs of mutually regulating TFs (toggle switches), such as PSPPH3268, PSPPH2315, and PSPPH2733.</p><p>The remaining seven submodules, denoted as ‘locked loops’ (M7–M13), comprised subordinate three-node regulatory modules within our network. Notably, no instances of a ‘fully connected triad’ (M12) were observed in our network (n=0). We found 50 ‘self-loop’ submodules (M7) in our network, including CspD, PSPPH4694, and PSPPH3798, which engaged in mutual regulatory interactions. Among these submodules, M9 (n=10) was the least common and contained six pairs of toggle switches involving mutually regulating TFs (such as PSPPH1951, PSPPH4612, and CysB), which were similar to those found in the human transcriptional regulatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, the most enriched locked loop in our network was M13 (n=696), denoted as a ‘feedforward loop’, which has been extensively studied in other species such as humans and <italic>E. coli</italic>. In this submodule, upstream TFs regulated targeted TFs either by binding directly or manipulating other TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). For example, TF Irp directly controlled PSPPH4899 and also indirectly regulated it by binding to Lon.</p><p>Taken together, the simplest and most effective submodule M1 and the coregulatory submodule M13 played crucial roles in the transcriptional regulation of TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A. In addition, we found 92 auto-regulators in our hierarchy network. These auto-regulators are important and always act as repressors to maintain the cellular stability under different environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becskei and Serrano, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2002</xref>). For example, LexA and CysB as negative auto-regulators were indicated to reduce cell-to-cell fluctuations in the steady-state level of the TF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becskei and Serrano, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosenfeld et al., 2002</xref>). These regulators are regarded as bistable switches that further influence the expression of downstream genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burda et al., 2011</xref>). For example, our previous study demonstrated that Lon is a dual-function regulator involved in the regulation of virulence and metabolism in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hua et al., 2020</xref>). Lon was identified as an auto-regulator in this study. Furthermore, DksA2, which is widely regarded as a protective protein against oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fortuna et al., 2022</xref>), was identified as a new bistable switch in this study. In summary, the classification of the TF hierarchy and the identification of enriched network modules not only offer functional predictions for transcriptional regulators but also provide insights into the communication network that governs TF regulation in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>High co-association pairs occurred more in bottom-level TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A</title><p>In addition to direct interactions between TFs, we found a notable preference for co-binding peaks among different TF pairs. Briefly, we counted overlapping regions within the binding peaks of all TF pairs. The ratio of intersection regions to the union set of all peaks between two TFs was identified as the genome-wide co-association of specific TFs. We first analysed co-association scores between TF pairs and grouped the scores into three TF pairs (TT, MM, and BB). The majority of TFs tended to cooperate with other TFs and co-bind to specific genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>). The dark distribution in BB pair indicated that high co-association scores preferred to occur in bottom-level TFs. To identify the potential functions of TFs in each level, we used the target genes to perform functional annotations using hypergeometric tests (BH-adjusted p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.05) based on gene sets derived from the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a, c, and d</xref>). The functional categories of TFs at these three levels encompassed various regulatory pathways. For example, the top-level TF PSPPH4700 was involved in siderophore transportation and phosphorelay signal transmembrane transportation. The middle-level TF Lon regulated GTP binding and ribosome transcription. The bottom-level TF PSPPH3486 was involved in amino acid transportation, PSPPH0101 in ATP binding, and PSPPH1049 in catalytic activity. Notably, we found that TFs at the top level, without cooperating TFs, exhibited a large number of binding peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Previous study suggested that TFs preferred to regulate target genes by recruiting to specific sites of other TFs, facilitating the direct binding between other TFs and their specific targets, a phenomenon defined as tethered binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, top TFs in our study more likely regulated target genes by ‘direct binding’ than ‘tethered binding’. For example, the top-level TF PSPPH4700 yielded over 1700 peaks but cooperated with only 24 top-level TFs with low co-association scores of about 0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>).</p><p>To further elucidate this pattern, we examined the 125 TFs that were analysed through ChIP-seq and exhibited high co-association scores. We determined the co-association patterns among these regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and classified them into four clusters, denoted as C1–C4. Notably, C1 and C4 contained higher proportions of bottom-level TFs. Based on the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, we found that the proportions of bottom-level TF interaction in all the TF pair interactions and direct interaction were 43% and 49%, respectively. These results indicated that the bottom-level TFs tended to regulate downstream genes through cooperating with other level TFs. When comparing the co-association scores of TF pairs, we observed a stronger tendency towards cooperation among lower-level TFs, especially bottom-level TFs. In particular, 35 bottom-level TFs in C4 (83%) exhibited coregulation at the same peak locations with high co-association scores. For instance, PhnF and PSPPH4692 co-bound to three target genes (PSPPH4117, PSPPH4216, and PSPPHB0021), with co-association scores as high as 0.92. This co-binding relationship between all TF pairs was defined as an indirect interaction. In contrast to the trend observed for direct interactions and cooperativity, we observed stronger correlations between top-level TFs and TFs situated at higher levels (top and middle levels; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). For example, the top-level TFs PSPPH3798 and CysB co-bound to the promoter region of <italic>flhB</italic>, which encodes a flagellar biosynthesis protein. We found a similar co-association pattern among bottom-level TFs. However, middle-level TFs showed the weakest internal correlations, suggesting that they tend to collaborate with TFs from other levels rather than with other middle-level TFs. For instance, we observed that the middle-level TF PSPPH1100 cooperated with top-level TF PSPPH3798 and bottom-level TF PSPPH4920, binding to the promoter region of <italic>hopG1</italic>, which encodes a type III effector.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Bottom transcription factors (TFs) share the same binding sequences to coregulate in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The co-association map for 170 TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A shows the co-associated scores of binding peaks of these TFs (rows) that overlap each TF peak (columns).

MexT showed higher co-association scores (more than 60 scores) with more top-level TFs. The analysis of the peak locations of MexT demonstrated that MexT showed closer co-association relationships with top-level TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Within the binding peaks of MexT, the target genes PSPPH3643 (LysR family TF), PSPPH2618 (sulphite reductase (NADPH) haemoprotein, CysI) and PSPPH2411 (hypothetical protein) displayed high co-association scores with other TFs. UpSet plots demonstrated that 12 TFs in C3 bound to a highly overlapping region of CysI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

More than 68% of these TFs (24 of 35 TFs) were at the top levels, indicating that the virulence of <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A is primarily regulated by top-level TFs. Among these TFs in the network, the top-level TFs PSPPH1951, PSPPH2193, and PSPPH3268 were found to have abundant virulence-associated target genes based on ChIP-seq results. The <italic>de novo</italic> motif analysis of their peak sequences revealed the presence of three head-to-head motifs: a 17 bp motif (AT-N13-AT) for PSPPH1951, a 15 bp motif (ATC-N9-GAT) for PSPPH2193, and a 10 bp motif (AC-N6-GT) for PSPPH3268 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Three master TFs were identified to participate in virulence</title><p>To further verify the biological functions of these three uncharacterised TFs, we first purified the TF proteins and performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to confirm their direct interactions with key virulence genes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Next, we generated TF deletion strains to detect the transcription levels of target genes. We first detected the effect of the mutants on bacterial growth. The growth curve assay showed that the deletion of TF genes had no significant influence on the <italic>Psph</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1-d</xref>). We found that PSPPH1951 directly regulated multiple T3SS genes, including <italic>hrpR, hopAE1</italic> and <italic>hopAH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Among them, the expression of <italic>hopAE1</italic> in ∆PSPPH1951 was significantly decreased by twofold compared with the WT, suggesting that PSPPH1951 acts as an activator of <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A T3SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). In addition, PSPPH1951 was found to bind to the promoters of type IV pili genes (<italic>pilG</italic>, <italic>pilF,</italic> and <italic>pilZ</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 enhances its ability to infect the host by increasing bacterial motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buell et al., 2003</xref>).

Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results indicated that <italic>fleQ</italic> and <italic>flhF</italic> were downregulated fourfold in ∆PSPPH2193 compared with the WT. As expected, ∆PSPPH2193 exhibited weaker motility than the WT and complementary strain in KB medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), indicating that PSPPH2193 serves as an activator of motility in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A. To further investigate the influence of PSPPH2193 on the pathogenicity of <italic>P. syringae</italic>, we performed the plant infection assay. As expected, we found that the bacterial numbers of ∆PSPPH2193 strain were significantly reduced compared with WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1f</xref>). In summary, PSPPH2193 regulates the pathogenicity of <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A through motility pathway by directly binding to target genes.</p><p>PSPPH3268 was found to influence the pathogenicity of <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A by regulating multiple virulence-related pathways. During the initial stage of <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection, the bacteria produce biofilm components, including extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs), type IV pili, and other highly viscous compounds. These components help the bacteria to establish colonies, providing protection against the host’s immune defences and antimicrobial agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Whitchurch et al., 2002</xref>). We found that PSPPH3268 strongly interacted with the promoters of key genes involved in biofilm production such as <italic>hrpR</italic>, the alginate biosynthesis gene <italic>alg44,</italic> and the type IV pilus assembly gene <italic>pilM</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Furthermore, the transcription levels of <italic>alg44</italic>, <italic>algX</italic> (encoding the alginate biosynthesis protein), and <italic>pilM</italic> were markedly enhanced in ∆PSPPH3268. This resulted in enhanced biofilm formation and EPS production when the PSPPH3268 gene was deleted and then restored when PSPPH3268 was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). These results demonstrated that PSPPH3268 acts as a master regulator in various virulence-related pathways. In addition, we identified that the TF PSPPH3798 binds to the promoters of flagellar-related genes (<italic>fliK</italic>, <italic>fliE</italic>, <italic>fliD,</italic> and <italic>fleQ</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1g</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the ‘one-step trigger’ mechanism, we found that TFs also regulate downstream genes through one or two other TFs at different levels, which were regarded as ‘one jump-point trigger’ and ‘two jump-point trigger’. For example, PSPPH2555 indirectly influenced biofilm formation (<italic>algD</italic>), motility (<italic>fleQ</italic>), T3SS (<italic>hrpR</italic>), QS (<italic>ahlR</italic> and <italic>secE</italic>), and phytotoxin production (<italic>aprD</italic>) by directly regulating the bottom-level TF PSPPH4920 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). PSPPH3504 was found to be involved in a PSPPH3504-Lon/PSPPH4324/PSPPH4844-PSPPH0755/PSPPH4920/PSPPH4012-target gene pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, ‘/’ represents sibling nodes and ‘–’ represents downward regulation). Among these TFs, PSPPH0755, PSPPH4920, and PSPPH4012 are considered key performer TFs because they mediate most of the transcription regulatory signals from multiple TFs. We also found reverse regulatory pathways in our network. For example, the middle-level TF PSPPH4673 was found to directly regulate the top-level TF PSPPH4700 and then indirectly control the transcription of many virulence-related genes through regulating the bottom-level TFs PSPPH0755, PSPPH4920, Anr, and PSPPH2476 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Systematic mapping of TF targets revealed key metabolic regulators in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A</title><p>In addition to enhancing pathogenicity and resisting host defences, <italic>P. syringae</italic> adjusts its metabolic activities to survive in unpredictable environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rico et al., 2011</xref>). To comprehensively understand metabolic regulation in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A, we constructed a hierarchical network that includes key regulators and the genes they trigger, similar to the virulence hierarchical network. We focused on eight metabolic pathways, namely amino acid biosynthesis, DNA replication, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transportation, oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, RNA polymerase, phosphonate metabolism, and methyl-accepting chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Compared with the virulence network shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, we identified more TFs involved in metabolic regulation, many of which exhibited numerous interactions with genes related to oxidative phosphorylation (178 binding peaks) and the TCA cycle (154 binding peaks; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In a previous study, 12 master regulators were reported to control various metabolic pathways, including LexA1, PSPPH3004, and PSPPH1960, involved in reactive oxygen species resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). RhpR participates in several metabolic pathways, such as ABC transporters and oxidoreductase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shao et al., 2019</xref>). Lon is involved in glucokinase and oxidoreductase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hua et al., 2020</xref>). MgrA, GacA, PilR, PsrA, RpoN, CvsR, OmpR, and CbrB2 participate in oxidation resistance, amino acid transportation, and other metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shao et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we identified 111 TFs regulating these eight metabolic pathways. Similar to the aforementioned virulence network, three transcriptional regulatory channels were observed for the metabolic pathways. To provide a detailed view of metabolic regulation in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A, we counted the number of functionally annotated genes related to each pathway and calculated the proportion of targets for each TF, highlighting key regulators in these eight metabolic pathways using radar plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Hundreds of transcription factors (TFs) are identified to participate in metabolic pathways.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Metabolic hierarchical regulatory network shows the TF hierarchy and the large pool of target genes of multi-TF.

In our case, a resolution of 0.9 provided moderate modularity and ensured that each module contained 2.7–12.1% of the total elements and exhibited correlations with each other. We found that almost all nodes in the network had connections both within and between modules, indicating that the 16 modules were not isolated and contributed to extensive information flow throughout the network to regulate transcription in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Module 12 appeared to play a central role in facilitating large information flows with other modules. Module 15 also exhibited transcriptional information exchanges both between modules and within the same module.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Functional modularised regulatory network in <italic>P.</italic> <italic>syringae</italic> exhibits the specific functions of both transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The functional categorical regulation network in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A analysed by Gephi (resolution 0.9).

Module 3 contained the least TFs (181 elements, including 2 TFs and 179 target genes). To investigate the potential correlation between topological modularity and biological functions, we performed GO term and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for each module by hypergeometric test (BH-adjusted p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.05). As expected, 15 modules were enriched in specific biological functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c and d</xref>). In some modules, hundreds of elements were assessed. For example, genes in Module 2 (443 nodes), Module 12 (327 nodes, including 22 TFs and 318 target genes), and Module 14 (432 nodes, including 3 TFs and 324 target genes) were mainly enriched in the regulation of transcription and DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). DksA, a TF in Module 2, played a key role in regulating transcription-coupled DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meddows et al., 2005</xref>) and also participated in oxidative phosphorylation, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism and RNA degradation in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Twenty TFs (such as CapA, CapB, CysB, FruR, and MarR) classified in Module 12 were identified to be involved in transcriptional regulation. The TF PSPPH3798 located in Module 14 was observed to be involved in flagellar assembly, and these interactions were confirmed by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1g</xref>). The genes in Module 4 were enriched in oxidoreductase activity, and our analysis revealed that the TF PSPPH0755 played a role in regulating the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). MexT in Module 5, which was previously associated with motility in <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tabaci</italic> 6605 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kawakita et al., 2012</xref>), was found to participate in biofilm formation and QS pathways in our study. In addition, we not only identified the crucial roles of the TFs PSPPH1951 (Module 6), PSPPH2193 (Module 11), and PSPPH3268 (Module 15) in T3SS pathways, bacterial motility, and biofilm formation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–d</xref>), but also reported their potential biological functions in aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (PSPPH1951), RNA degradation (PSPPH2193), and catalytic activity (PSPPH3268) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Our results allowed us to identify the potential regulators of specific pathways and perform functional predictions for hypothetical proteins in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A. For instance, PSPPH1503 in Module 15, which encodes a hypothetical protein, was possibly correlated with glycerophospholipid metabolism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Most microbial studies on genome-wide transcriptional regulatory network focus on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, which reveal the principles of architecture and interactions of their regulatory networks. The analysis of the transcription regulatory associations in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mainly relies on the databases such as YEASTRACT (YEAst Search for Transcriptional Regulators And Consensus Tracking) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, relative complete transcriptional regulatory network has been generated through integrating three different data sources (RegulonDB, Ecocyc, and TRN-SO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2004</xref>). However, few study has yet comprehensively evaluated TFs in other prokaryotic species throughout a genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ishihama et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we successfully generated the most complete transcriptional regulatory network and data source, which profiled the transcriptional regulatory features of both the aforementioned 100 TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2020</xref>) and an additional 170 TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A through ChIP-seq. By mapping the TF-target hierarchical regulatory networks, we identified several novel master regulators involved in significant biological processes. Furthermore, our evolutionary analysis and assessment of the topological functional modularity of TFs and their respective targets revealed the evolutional conservation and functional diversity of TFs in <italic>P. syringae</italic>.</p><p>Although transcriptional regulatory networks are considered conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perez and Groisman, 2009</xref>), many studies reveal highly functional variability of TFs in inter- and intra-species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galardini et al., 2015</xref>). These observed diversities between different strains of the same species mainly result from the expression levels of TFs, contents of target genes, and differences of binding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Trouillon et al., 2021</xref>). In our study, we observed large differences of DNA-binding characteristic of TF Irp between the C48 strain and the <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 strain. The functional diversity of TFs may arise from the large difference in the contents of target genes and TFs, which are regarded as the main determinant of transcriptional regulatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Duin et al., 2023</xref>), although Irp display high homology in these pathovars.</p><p>Collaborations between TFs at higher levels (top and middle) were enriched, a pattern similar to the tendencies observed in human TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, TT TF pairs exhibited a greater degree of cooperative gene regulation, whereas TB TF pairs accounted for nearly half of direct interactions within all communications. Furthermore, we observed that both direct physical regulation and cooperative interactions were the least common among MM TF pairs. By contrast, in humans, direct regulation tends to occur between TT or TM TF pairs. Furthermore, interactions between TFs, in any form, within human and yeast transcriptional regulatory networks are more likely to appear between middle TFs, which act as information transfer centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhardwaj et al., 2010</xref>). This may be attributed to the higher abundance of bottom-level TFs than higher-level TFs observed in prokaryotic microorganisms, a pattern also found in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhardwaj et al., 2010</xref>). This finding indicates that the bottom-level TFs that are more likely to be regulated are evolutionarily preferred in multicellular eukaryotic organisms. However, they found that the deficient bottom-level TFs are more commonly co-associated with other same-level TFs in <italic>E. coli</italic>. When comparing co-associated TF pairs and the cooperativity of TFs, we observed a distinct and inverse relationship in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A compared with yeast or <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The enriched cooperativity of bottom-level TFs with high co-associated scores indicated that these bottom-level TFs preferred to coregulate target genes by binding to the same peak locations. Notably, seven TFs without correlations with other TFs appeared to independently participate in biological processes. These findings not only shed light on the inherent properties of direct regulation and co-association across various species but also indicate the unique characteristics of <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A in response to dynamic environmental variations.</p><p>The fundamental units of a transcriptional regulatory network are positive and negative loops. For a more comprehensive description, these regulatory units can be classified into six submodules, namely auto-regulation, multicomponent loops, feedforward loops, single-input, multi-input, and regulator chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2002</xref>). In yeast, only 10 TFs were found to auto-regulate themselves, whereas the majority of regulatory units among 116 TFs in <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibit auto-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thieffry et al., 1998</xref>). Similarly, we identified 92 auto-regulators in our transcriptional regulatory network in <italic>P. syringae</italic>. Feedforward loops are highly prevalent in eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory networks, such as human and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2002</xref>). The 696 feedforward loops (M13) identified in our study also highlighted this cooperative regulation of TFs in response to small signals in prokaryotic species, such as <italic>P. syringae</italic>. This enriched submodule is regarded as a temporal switch that provides constant feedback to respond rapidly to signal impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shen-Orr et al., 2002</xref>). Multistep regulation assists master regulators in enhancing the initial information flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goldbeter and Koshland, 1984</xref>). Unlike M3, the most abundant module (868) in the human TF regulatory network, we observed that M1 was the most prevalent module (24,479) in the <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A transcriptional regulatory network. This finding indicates that <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A prefers achieving transcriptional regulation through few TFs to ensure rapid transmission and response to environmental signals.</p><p>Despite more than 20 years of research, our understanding of the global regulatory network in the plant pathogen <italic>P. syringae</italic> remains inadequate. Our previous studies reported 16 key virulence-related regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shao et al., 2021</xref>), 25 master virulence-related regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2020</xref>), and 7 global regulators acting as TCSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xie et al., 2022</xref>). However, the regulatory relationships and functional crosstalk among all TFs in <italic>P. syringae</italic> remain unknown. In this study, we integrated all available interaction information concerning almost all TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A and mapped the first comprehensive transcriptional regulatory network in this plant pathogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This network offers a global view of the multiple functions of TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A. We also identified 35 vital TFs that participate in virulence pathways and 111 key TFs involved in metabolic pathways across the global transcriptional regulatory network in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A. This analysis uncovered new functions of previously characterised TFs, such as MexT. In addition to the previously reported <italic>mexEF-oprN</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sawada et al., 2018</xref>), this study identified <italic>fleQ</italic> (a flagellar regulator) and <italic>shcF</italic> (a type III chaperone protein) as the targets of MexT. In addition, we investigated the functional evolution and potential intra-species variability of TFs in <italic>P. syringae,</italic> demonstrating the functional diversity of TFs among <italic>P. syringae</italic> species during their long course of evolution. Based on the aforementioned results, we established the <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A transcriptional regulatory network (PSTRnet) database, which contains detailed binding peak information for all TFs in <italic>Psph</italic> 1448A (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jiadhuang0417.shinyapps.io/PSTF_NET/">https://jiadhuang0417.shinyapps.io/PSTF_NET/</ext-link>).

This observation enhanced our understanding of the influence of TFs in the network on their target genes based on the identified effects of other TFs. Furthermore, the TF PSPPH4700 was identified to bind to the promoters of genes involved in seven metabolic pathways, namely the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, methyl-accepting, amino acid biosynthesis, RNA polymerase, ABC transportation, and DNA replication.

Transcriptional regulation is key to plant infection and adaptation to host environments by this bacterium. However, researches have focused on limited number of transcription factors (TFs) that regulate virulence-related pathways. Thus, a comprehensive, systems-level understanding of regulatory interactions between transcription factors in P. syringae has not been achieved.</p><p>This study by Sun et al performed ChIP-seq analysis of 170 out of 301 TFs in P. syringae pv. syringae 1448A and used this unique dataset to infer transcriptional regulatory networks in this bacterium. The network analyses revealed hierarchical interactions between TFs, various network motifs, and co-regulation of target genes by TF pairs, which collectively mediate information flow.

Transcriptional regulation is key to plant infection and adaptation to host environments by this bacterium. However, researchers have focused on a limited number of transcription factors (TFs) that regulate virulence-related pathways. Thus, a comprehensive, systems-level understanding of regulatory interactions between transcription factors in P. syringae has not been achieved.</p><p>This study by Sun et al performed ChIP-seq analysis of 170 out of 301 TFs in P. syringae pv. syringae 1448A and used this unique dataset to infer transcriptional regulatory networks in this bacterium.

We defined ‘indirect interaction’ as ‘co-association’ and ‘cooperativity’ as ‘if the common target of two TFs is from a TF’. We added the definition of &quot;indirect interaction&quot; and &quot;cooperativity&quot; in the revised legend.</p><p>For Figure S3a, the low co-association scores and large peak numbers of these top-level TFs indicated that top-level TFs preferred to solely regulate target genes, but not to co-regulate with other top-level TFs. PSPPH4700 was an example to show that top-level TFs with low co-association scores and large peak numbers tend to solely regulate target genes, but not to co-regulate with other top-level TFs. We revised the sentence to ‘For example, the top-level TF PSPPH4700 yielded over 1,700 peaks but cooperated with only 24 top-level TFs with low co-association scores about 0.05 (Supplementary Table 2b).’.</p><p>We analyzed high co-association scores of 125 TFs in three levels and further determined the co-association patterns. To identify the tendency of co-association of all these 125 TFs, the co-association patterns were classified into 4 clusters. Bottom-level TFs tend to co-regulate target genes with other TFs. We revised the sentence in the revised manuscript.</p><p>For Figure 2b, in C1, C2 and C4, many bottom-level TFs performed co-association pattern with other TFs, especially bottom TFs (showed in C4). To explore the regulatory pattern in C3, the peak locations in target genes of MexT were analyzed with those of TFs in C3. Seven top-level TFs (PSPPH1435, PSPPH1758, PSPPH2193, PSPPH2454, PSPPH4638, PSPPH4998 and PSPPH3411), three middle-level TFs (PSPPH1100, PSPPH5132 and PSPPH5144) and four bottom-level TFs (PSPPH0700, PSPPH2300, PSPPH2444 and PSPPH2580) were compared with MexT. MexT showed higher co-association scores (more than 60 scores) with more top-level-TFs. Therefore, we demonstrated that MexT performed closer co-association relationships with top-level TFs. We added the statement in the revised manuscript.</p><p>For Figure 1a, the hierarchical network showed different number of TFs in three levels (54 top-level TFs, 62 middle-level TFs and 147 bottom-level TFs), which indicated that more than half of TFs (bottom-level TFs) tend to be regulated by other TFs and then directly bound to target genes. This finding showed a downward regulatory direction of transcription regulation in P. syringae.

This should also be applied to the introduction where many papers on P. syringae are cited without clear indication of strain names. I think this amendment is essential because target genes and thus biological functions of TFs could be different between P. syringae strains, as shown in the present study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.

More detailed information is required regarding the datasets used for each analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. The number of TFs analyzed by ChIP-seq in this research is 170, the number of TFs analyzed by HT-SELEX in our previous research is 100. Hierarchical analysis integrated data from ChIP-seq and HT-SELEX which included 270 TFs. As 8 TFs did not show hierarchical characteristic, the legend of Figure 1 said 262 TFs.

Please see Lines 174-176, 1084-1086.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) I found it very interesting that conserved TFs show different repertoires of target genes in different P. syringae strains. This suggests the rewiring of transcriptional regulatory networks in P. syringae strains, but the underlying mechanism is not explored in the current manuscript. It can be easily tested whether these conserved TFs bind to similar or different motifs by motif enrichment analysis. If they bind to similar motifs, it is possible that the promoter sequences of their target genes have diversified. Addressing or at least discussing these points would provide molecular insights into the diversification of the transcriptional regulatory networks in P. syringae. Similarly, functional enrichment analysis of target genes can be used to test whether the conserved TFs regulate different biological processes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We added the motif analysis and functional enrichment analysis of target genes of TFs (PSPPH3122 and PSPPH4127) in different P. syringae strains. We found two different motifs (AGACN4GATCAA and CGGACGN3GATCA) in 1448A and DC3000 strains, respectively. We also performed the GO analysis and found the specific functions of PSPPH3122 in Psph 1448A compared with Pst DC3000 and Pss B728a strains, including recombinase activity and DNA recombination. For PSPPH4127, we found four different motifs in four P. syringae strains. GO analysis showed its relationship with recombinase activity in Psph 1448A strain, and RNA binding, structural constituent of ribosome, translation and ribosome in Pss B728a strain. These results indicated the highly functional diversity of TFs in P. syringae. We added these points in the Results part, and Figure S9-S10 in the revised manuscript.

We revised the statement ‘Based on the analysis in Figure 1B, we found that the proportions of bottom-level TF interaction in all the TF pair interactions and direct interaction were 43% and 49%. These results indicated that the bottom-level TFs tended to regulate downstream genes through cooperating with other level TFs.’ in the revised manuscript. Please see Lines 269-272.</p><p>As not every TF performed co-association with other TFs, we only collected 125 TFs with co-association scores. For the numbers of TF in each level, we divided TFs into three levels according to hierarchy height. Hierarchy height from -1 to -0.3 represented bottom level; hierarchy height from -0.3 to 0.3 represented middle level ; hierarchy height from 0.3 to 1 represents top level. Each level was equally divided by height scores. We suggested that different numbers of TFs in three levels indicated the characteristic of transcriptional regulation in P. syringae.</p><p>Thank you for your suggestion. As the co-association patterns were determined by co-association scores of the same TFs, we first grouped the co-association scores into 3 possible TF pairs (TT, MM, and BB, in Figures S3a, S4a and S5a). Our results indicated that higher co-association scores preferred to occur in bottom-level TFs. We revised the statement in the revised manuscript.

The figure includes concepts discussed in later sections (e.g., cooperativity), making it difficult to understand. A diagram explaining these concepts would be highly helpful for readers to understand.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the missing information. We defined ‘indirect interaction’ as ‘co-association’, ‘cooperativity’ as ‘if the common target of two TFs is from a TF’.

Did the authors mean that top-level TFs with a large number of peaks showed a low level of co-association? If so, does this data suggest that these TFs do not tend to cooperate with other TFs? I was confused by the discussion in L253-L261.</p><p>Thank you for your comment, and we agree with you. The low co-association scores and large peak numbers of these top-level TFs indicated that top-level TFs preferred to solely regulate target genes, but not to co-regulate with other top-level TFs.</p><p>Thank you for your comment. From L253-256, PSPPH4700 was an example to show that top-level TFs with low co-association scores and large peak numbers tend to solely regulate target genes, but not to co-regulate with other top-level TFs. We revised the sentence to ‘For example, the top-level TF PSPPH4700 yielded over 1,700 peaks, but cooperated with only 24 top-level TFs with low co-association scores about 0.05 (Supplementary Table 2b).’.</p><p>From L257-261, we analyzed high co-association scores of 125 TFs in three levels and further determined the co-association patterns. To identify the tendency of co-association of all these 125 TFs, the co-association patterns were classified into 4 clusters. Bottom-level TFs tend to co-regulate target genes with other TFs. We revised the sentence.

Additional explanation and/or data visualization would be appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. In C1, C2 and C4, many bottom-level TFs performed co-association pattern with other TFs, especially bottom TFs (showed in C4). To explore the regulatory pattern in C3, the peak locations in target genes of MexT were analyzed with those of TFs in C3. Seven top-level TFs (PSPPH1435, PSPPH1758, PSPPH2193, PSPPH2454, PSPPH4638, PSPPH4998 and PSPPH3411), three middle-level TFs (PSPPH1100, PSPPH5132 and PSPPH5144) and four bottom-level TFs (PSPPH0700, PSPPH2300, PSPPH2444 and PSPPH2580) were compared with MexT. MexT showed higher co-association scores (more than 60 scores) with more top-level-TFs. Therefore, we demonstrated that MexT performed closer co-association relationships with top-level TFs.

The hierarchical network showed different number of TFs in three levels (54 top-level TFs, 62 middle-level TFs and 147 bottom-level TFs), which indicated that more than half of TFs (bottom-level TFs) tend to be regulated by other TFs and then directly bound to target genes.
