coordinate group behaviors through a form of cell-cell signaling called acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing (QS). In these systems, a signal synthase produces an AHL to which its paired receptor selectively responds. Selectivity is fundamental to cell signaling. Despite its importance, it has been challenging to determine how this selectivity is achieved and how AHL QS systems evolve and diversify. We hypothesized that we could use covariation within the protein sequences of AHL synthases and receptors to identify selectivity residues. We began by identifying about 6000 unique synthase-receptor pairs. We then used the protein sequences of these pairs to identify covariation patterns and mapped the patterns onto the LasI/R system from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1. The covarying residues in both proteins cluster around the ligand-binding sites. We demonstrate that these residues are involved in system selectivity toward the cognate signal and go on to engineer the Las system to both produce and respond to an alternate AHL signal. We have thus demonstrated that covariation methods provide a powerful approach for investigating selectivity in protein-small molecule interactions and have deepened our understanding of how communication systems evolve and diversify.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Communication is vital in any community and it is no different for bacteria. Some of the microbes living in bacterial communities are closely related to one another and can help each other survive and grow. They do this by releasing chemical signals that coordinate their behaviors, including those that are damaging to the infected host.</p><p>A key aspect of this coordination is knowing how many related bacteria are present in a given environment. In a process known as quorum sensing, the bacteria release a chemical signal which neighboring sibling bacteria detect and respond to. The larger the population of bacteria, the more the signal accumulates. At a certain threshold, the signal activates the genes needed to trigger a coordinated action, such as producing toxins or antibiotics. Many bacteria communicate using acylhomoserine lactone signaling systems, which involve different signals depending on the species of bacteria. But it is unclear how this diversity evolved, and how bacteria can distinguish between signals from related and unrelated bacterial cells.</p><p>To understand this, Wellington Miranda et al. used computational techniques to analyze how the proteins responsible for acylhomoserine lactone signaling coevolved. The analysis identified specific parts of these proteins that determine which signal will be produced and which will trigger a bacterium into action. Wellington Miranda et al. then used these insights to engineer the bacteria <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> to produce and respond to a signal that is naturally made by another bacterial species.</p><p>These computational methods could be used to analyze other proteins that have coevolved but do not physically interact. Within the area of quorum sensing, this approach will help to better understand the costs and benefits of signal selectivity. This may help to predict bacterial interactions and therefore behaviors during infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></kwd><kwd>LasR-LasI</kwd><kwd>protein coevolution</kwd><kwd>intercellular signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM136218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>EP</surname><given-names>Greenberg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program Grant P41 GM103533-24</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Q</surname><given-names>Cong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001906</institution-id><institution>Washington Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Q</surname><given-names>Cong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miranda S</surname><given-names>Wellington</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>D</surname><given-names>Baker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The extension of covariation analyses to proteins that coevolve but do not physically interact enabled identification of selectivity residues in quorum sensing proteins, providing insight into the evolution of signaling systems.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Quorum sensing (QS) is a widespread form of cell-cell signaling that bacteria use to coordinate the production of public goods including toxins, antibiotics, bioluminescence, and secreted enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waters and Bassler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Whiteley et al., 2017</xref>). Many Proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Case et al., 2008</xref>) and Nitrospirae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mellbye et al., 2017</xref>) employ a form of QS based on acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signals. AHL QS systems consist of two proteins: a LuxI-type signal synthase and a LuxR-type receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The signal synthase produces an AHL from <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and an acyl-acyl carrier protein for some LuxI-type synthases or an acyl-coenzyme A substrate for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schaefer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). AHL signals can freely diffuse through cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan and Greenberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pearson et al., 1999</xref>) and at low cell density the QS system is ‘off’. At high cell density, the signal accumulates and binds the LuxR-type receptor which is a cytosolic transcription factor that regulates gene expression in response to signal binding.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing (QS).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) AHL QS circuits contain a signal synthase, a LuxI homolog (LasI in this cartoon), that produces an AHL signal. At low cell densities, the system exists in an ‘off’ state. At high cell densities, the AHL concentration increases and the signal binds its cytosolic receptor, a LuxR homolog (LasR in this cartoon), which functions as a transcription factor. (<bold>B</bold>) LuxI-type synthases produce AHL signals from two substrates: <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and an activated organic acid in the form of an acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) or, in some cases, an acyl-coenzyme A (CoA). SAM provides the lactone core, which is conserved across all AHL signals, while the acyl-ACP (shown here) provides an acyl moiety which varies between signaling systems. In this example, the synthase LasI produces <italic>N</italic>-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69169-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>AHL signals share a conserved lactone core, but vary in the acyl moiety which can be a fatty acid ranging from 4 to 20 carbons long, with potential oxidation on the C3 carbon and varying degrees of unsaturation, or can have an aromatic or branched structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rajput et al., 2016</xref>). This variability in the acyl portion of the signal confers selectivity to the system. Typically, a LuxI-type synthase produces a primary AHL to which its paired LuxR-type receptor selectively responds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aframian and Eldar, 2020</xref>). Selectivity is critical to cell signaling in order to avoid undesired cross-talk or spurious outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laub, 2016</xref>). In the case of QS, selectivity ensures bacteria cooperate only with kin cells.</p><p>Despite its importance, we know little about how QS systems achieve selectivity or how they evolve and diversify to use new signals. Although the conserved amino acids essential for synthase and receptor activity are well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parsek et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>), residues that dictate selectivity are often different from those that are required for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2005</xref>). Due to the low amino acid sequence identity between LuxI/R homologues, it has been difficult to determine how QS systems discriminate between various AHL signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuqua et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that we could use covariation patterns to identify QS selectivity residues. Such methods have been used to identify amino acid residues that interact with each other within proteins and between proteins that physically bind one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aakre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ovchinnikov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Skerker et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we endeavored to expand these methods to assess the interaction between AHL synthases and receptors. While AHL synthases and receptors do not physically interact, they interact indirectly via binding to a shared cognate signal and are believed to coevolve to maintain this shared signal recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aframian and Eldar, 2020</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses also support coevolution of synthases and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray and Garey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lerat and Moran, 2004</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that we could apply covariation methods in a novel way to identify amino acid residues that covary between QS synthases and receptors, and further, that the covarying residues would be those responsible for signal selectivity.</p><p>We used a statistical method, GREMLIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>), to measure covariation within the sequences of AHL synthase-receptor pairs and mapped the covarying residues onto the LasI/R QS system of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1. By engineering substitutions in the top-scoring residues identified by GREMLIN, we demonstrate that they are indeed important for signal selectivity and, further, that these residues can be used to rationally engineer LasI/R to produce and respond to a non-native signal. We thus provide a proof of principle for a new use of covariation methods to investigate selectivity in non-physical protein-protein interactions and at the same time identify determinants of QS signal selectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Covariation patterns in QS systems</title><p>To begin our analysis, we gathered select protein sequences for known synthase-receptor pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) and used these sequences to search the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amid et al., 2019</xref>) from the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes (IMG/M) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) for additional synthase-receptor pairs. The genes for synthase-receptor pairs are frequently co-located on the genome, and organisms can harbor more than one complete QS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuqua et al., 1996</xref>). To increase the likelihood of identifying true pairs, we required that the two genes be separated by no more than two coding sequences. A total of 6360 non-identical pairs were identified. We further discarded pairs that were more than 90% identical to another pair, resulting in 3489 representative AHL synthase-receptor pairs.</p><p>We aligned these sequences to the LasI/R QS system from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1. Not only is <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> a clinically important pathogen, the Las system is well studied and crystal structures have been solved for both LasI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gould et al., 2004</xref>) and LasR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zou and Nair, 2009</xref>), making this a particularly useful model system for our studies. We connected the sequences of the synthase and the receptor from each pair and used GREMLIN to analyze covariation patterns in these sequences. We applied average product correction (APC) to the GREMLIN covariance coefficients, a common technique shown to improve the accuracy of coevolution analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buslje et al., 2009</xref>). An overview of our workflow is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. We performed the same analysis by aligning the synthase-receptor pairs to the LuxI/R system from <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic> MJ11.

Interestingly, two of our variants are more sensitive to 3OC12-HSL than wild-type LasR. LasR<sup>A127L</sup> is roughly threefold more sensitive and LasR<sup>L130F</sup> is twofold more sensitive. This increased sensitivity comes at the cost of decreased selectivity for both of these mutant proteins. In fact, many of our single amino acid variants displayed reduced selectivity compared to wild-type LasR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The observed changes in LasR sensitivity and selectivity could be due to multiple factors including altered receptor affinity for a signal, altered protein stability, or both. The stability of LuxR-type receptors is intertwined with signal binding. QS systems are subject to elaborate control, a key component of which is that QS receptors, including LasR, are unstable and insoluble in the absence of bound signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oinuma and Greenberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sappington et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, changes in signal affinity usually lead to changes in the amount of soluble receptor present in a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCready et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, changes to the expression level of the receptor can lead to altered signal sensitivity and selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wellington and Greenberg, 2019</xref>). To determine whether receptor stability was affected in our variants, we assessed the abundance of soluble LasR in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by immunoblotting in a selection of variants with altered 3OC12-HSL sensitivity: LasR<sup>A127L</sup>, LasR<sup>L130F</sup>, and LasR<sup>R61L</sup>. Comparing these variants to wild type, there were not substantial changes in the abundance of soluble LasR, though LasR<sup>R61L</sup> was somewhat less abundant than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>LasI substitutions alter activity and selectivity</title><p>Similar to LasR, we focused our LasI amino acid alterations on the top-scoring positions: L102, T142, T145, and L157 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E</xref>). We expressed wild-type or mutated <italic>lasI</italic> on a low copy number plasmid in the AHL synthase-null <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO-SC4 and extracted AHLs produced by these bacteria from culture fluid. While bioassays are commonly used for the detection of AHLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2011</xref>), they suffer from multiple drawbacks. In particular, bioassays are not equally sensitive to all AHLs and typically cannot be used to determine which AHLs are produced and in what ratio. To screen our LasI variants for altered activity and selectivity, we developed a thin layer chromatography (TLC) method based on our existing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) radiotracer assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>). In this method, the C1 position in the homoserine lactone ring is labeled with <sup>14</sup>C. The label is incorporated into AHLs at a ratio of one <sup>14</sup>C per AHL molecule. This results in unbiased detection of all AHLs produced. While the established method uses HPLC to separate and detect AHLs one sample at a time, we can run nine samples per TLC plate, resulting in a more high-throughput assay.</p><p>Using our TLC method, we confirmed that <italic>lasI</italic> directs the synthesis of the same primary product whether it is expressed on a plasmid or from the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). HPLC analysis of matched extracts confirmed that the major LasI product observed by TLC is 3OC12-HSL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As expected, an empty vector control did not produce detectable AHLs, nor did we detect radioactivity in a media-only control. We then screened the activity of each <italic>lasI</italic> mutant by TLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Several mutants produced little or no detectable AHLs, but others, such as LasI<sup>T145S</sup>, appeared to produce more 3OC12-HSL than wild-type LasI. These changes in selectivity and rate of synthesis may be due to biochemical changes in LasI or to altered protein expression or stability. We analyzed select extracts by both TLC and HPLC and found that the results were consistent between the two methods, further validating the TLC method.</p><p>Based on our TLC results, we selected one variant with altered selectivity, LasI<sup>L157W</sup>, for further study by HPLC. By TLC, LasI<sup>L157W</sup> produces three signals: 3OC12-HSL and two signals of unknown identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Using HPLC, we found that LasI<sup>L157W</sup> produces equal amounts of two <sup>14</sup>C-AHLs consistent with 3OC10-HSL and 3OC8-HSL along with a lesser amount of 3OC12-HSL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Residue L157 is located near the bottom of the acyl-binding pocket where it likely interacts with the end of the 12-carbon acyl chain in 3OC12-HSL. The L157W substitution could decrease the volume of the pocket, improving affinity for shorter substrates. These findings demonstrate that the covarying residues identified by GREMLIN influence LasI activity and selectivity, and that a single amino acid substitution is sufficient to significantly alter LasI selectivity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Activity of LasI variants.</title><p>High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of radiolabeled acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) extracted from culture fluid of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO-SC4 harboring (<bold>A</bold>) pJN-RBSlasI<sup>WT</sup> or (<bold>B</bold>) pJN-RBSlasI<sup>L157W</sup>.

To compare the activity of our LasR variants with that of MupR, we developed a transcriptional reporter of MupR activity in <italic>E. coli</italic>. To do this, we used the promoter of <italic>mupI</italic> to control <italic>gfp</italic> expression in the plasmid pPROBE-GT. LuxR-type receptors often positively regulate their paired synthase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ng and Bassler, 2009</xref>). Searching the promoter region upstream <italic>mupI</italic>, we identified an inverted repeat centered at −64.5 relative to the start codon of <italic>mupI</italic> that has high similarity (12/20 base pairs) to the LasR-binding site upstream the LasR-regulated gene <italic>rsaL</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Whiteley and Greenberg, 2001</xref>). It is therefore plausible that MupR regulates <italic>mupI</italic>. We created an arabinose-inducible <italic>mupR</italic> expression vector in the plasmid pJN105 and introduced it along with pPROBE-P<sub>mupI</sub> into <italic>E. coli</italic>. If MupR activates transcription from the <italic>mupI</italic> promoter, this reporter strain should express <italic>gfp</italic> in the presence of 3OC10-HSL. We validated the reporter by measuring GFP fluorescence in the presence or absence of arabinose (to induce <italic>mupR</italic> expression) and/or 3OC10-HSL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). While there is some leaky expression of <italic>mupR</italic> from the pJN105 vector, indicated by increased fluorescence in the presence of 3OC10-HSL and absence of arabinose, the reporter strain requires both arabinose and 3OC10-HSL for maximal fluorescence. Using this reporter we found that MupR, when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, is equally sensitive to 3OC10-HSL and 3OC12-HSL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Thus, our ‘MupR-like’ LasR variant mimics the activity of MupR in this context.</p><p>To confirm our findings in the native context, we engineered mutations into <italic>lasR</italic> on the chromosome of the AHL synthase-null <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO-SC4. We found that wild-type LasR has minimal 3OC10-HSL activity, whereas the ‘MupR-like’ LasR<sup>L125F, A127M, L130F</sup> is much more sensitive to 3OC10-HSL and responds to concentrations as low as 1 µM.

To determine whether the ‘MupR-like’ LasR variant stimulates social behaviors, we assessed QS-dependent protease production by plating <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> on casein agar. In this assay, QS-regulated protease production is required for cell growth, and high levels of protease result in a zone of clearing around the colony and a white zone of partially degraded casein at the periphery of the clearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). AHL synthase-null <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO-SC4 grows poorly on casein agar with 3OC10-HSL or with no signal added, but grows well and produces protease in response to 3OC12-HSL. In contrast, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO-SC4 LasR<sup>L125F, A127M, L130F</sup> grows on casein agar with either 3OC10-HSL or 3OC12-HSL, indicating that 3OC10-HSL stimulates protease production in the ‘MupR-like’ variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>LasI differs from MupI at five high-scoring covariation residues: LasI M125, T145, M152, V159, and N181 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the first three of which line the LasI acyl-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Swapping these three residues for their MupI identities resulted in a synthase that has substantially altered selectivity. LasI<sup>M125I, T145S, M152L</sup> produces about twofold more 3OC10-HSL than 3OC12-HSL. The M125I substitution alone was sufficient to relax LasI’s selectivity, resulting in a synthase that produces roughly equal amounts of 3OC10-HSL and 3OC12-HSL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).

We hypothesized that we could identify covariation patterns in AHL QS systems and that these patterns would illuminate residues important for signal selectivity. Using a novel application of GREMLIN to analyze the sequences of 3489 unique AHL QS systems, we identified amino acids that strongly covary between AHL synthases and receptors. The top-scoring residues in our analysis cluster near the ligand-binding pockets for both proteins and are more than three times closer to the signal molecule compared to top-scoring residues in a randomized control. We focused our study on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> LasI/R. Through targeted alterations in the top-scoring covarying residues, we demonstrate that these amino acids are indeed determinants of signal selectivity. We have thus validated a new application of covariation analysis for proteins that interact indirectly and not through direct binding to one another. This use of covariation analysis for non-physical protein-protein interactions may be useful for other systems in which proteins are connected by small molecules, for example, metabolic pathways. Additionally, these strong covariation results further support the view that AHL synthases and receptors coevolve.</p><p>For both the synthase, LasI, and the receptor, LasR, a single amino acid substitution is sufficient to significantly alter selectivity. Interestingly, our amino acid substitutions also revealed that LasR is not optimized to be as sensitive as possible to its native 3OC12-HSL signal. The increase in sensitivity of specific variants came at the cost of decreased selectivity, which suggests that QS systems may evolve to balance these two properties. Furthermore, increased sensitivity to the native signal may lead to premature activation of the QS regulon, which would likely decrease fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darch et al., 2012</xref>). The products and behaviors regulated by QS, such as pyocyanin and protease production, are complexly regulated not only by LasI/R, but also by other factors including additional QS receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brint and Ohman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ochsner et al., 1994</xref>). The variants generated in our study provide us with the tools to assess the impact of LasI/R sensitivity and selectivity on QS timing and gene expression level and, ultimately, on these more complex social phenotypes.</p><p>We also demonstrated that we can use covarying residues to rationally engineer a QS system to produce and respond to a non-native signal. By changing the covarying residues in LasI/R to their MupI/R identities, we improved the sensitivity of LasR to 3OC10-HSL over 20-fold and increased the production of 3OC10-HSL by LasI roughly 15-fold. For both the synthase and receptor, a single amino acid substitution was the primary driver of the altered selectivity. This was surprising given the low sequence identity between LasI/R and MupI/R. These findings suggest new QS systems might evolve with relative ease. Further, the ability to engineer QS selectivity could be beneficial to synthetic biology where AHL signaling is a powerful tool to build biological circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, there has not been a previous attempt to simultaneously engineer both an AHL synthase and receptor to use a non-native signal.</p><p>Though we were able to substantially increase the 3OC10-HSL activity of LasI/R, our variants retained their native 3OC12-HSL activity. We have thus generated a promiscuous system with broadened selectivity. Similarly, a directed evolution study of the AHL receptor LuxR found that it evolves through promiscuous intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2005</xref>). This has also been observed in other systems, such as toxin-antitoxin systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aakre et al., 2015</xref>). Proteins tend to evolve through broadly active intermediates before gaining new specificity. In this way, the system maintains functionality <italic>en route</italic> to altered selectivity. QS systems appear to follow these same trends.</p><p>Further work is needed to fully ‘rewire’ LasI/R to exclusively use a non-native signal and to enable the rational engineering of QS systems to use any signal of choice. One limitation we faced is a lack of close LasI/R homologs with known signals. The identification of a more closely related system to LasI/R may provide a better starting point for engineering altered selectivity. It has been demonstrated that ‘supporting’ residues, that is, residues within a protein that covary with the selectivity residues, may indirectly impact selectivity by influencing the orientation of selectivity residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aakre et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, given the large differences in sequence identity between the Las and Mup systems, there are likely other residues that must be changed to fully swap selectivity. Supporting residues may be a tractable starting point. Alternatively, our ‘Mup-like’ variants could serve as the basis for identifying QS proteins with altered selectivity using saturating mutagenesis and/or in vitro evolution. Such studies would illuminate additional determinants of selectivity and potentially uncover ‘rules’ of signal binding. The variants reported in this study serve as a foundation for future work on signal sensitivity and selectivity and the rational engineering of QS systems.</p><p>Collectively, our results provide insight into AHL QS selectivity and will help us predict signal selectivity in newly identified QS systems, in metagenomes, and in naturally occurring QS variants such as those found in clinical isolates. More broadly, we have gained insight into how AHL QS systems evolve and diversify and have validated a new use of covariation analysis for investigating protein-ligand selectivity in coevolving proteins that are connected by a small molecule.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td valign="top">PAO-SC4</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wellington and Greenberg, 2019</xref></td><td valign="top"><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 with unmarked deletions of <italic>lasI</italic> and <italic>rhI</italic></td><td valign="top">AHL synthase-null mutant</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td valign="top">PAO1Δ<italic>rhlI</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2015</xref></td><td valign="top">PAO1 with unmarked in-frame deletion of <italic>rhlI</italic></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td valign="top">PAO1∆<italic>lasR</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2015</xref></td><td valign="top">PAO1 with unmarked in-frame deletion of <italic>lasR</italic></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">5-Alpha</td><td valign="top">New England Biolabs</td><td valign="top"><italic>fhuA2 Δ(argF-lacZ)U169 phoA glnV44 Φ80 Δ(lacZ)M15 gyrA96 recA1 relA1 endA1 thi-1 hsdR17</italic></td><td valign="top">Chemically competent cells;

We filtered the BLAST hits by sequence identity (&gt;30%) to the query and the alignment coverage (query coverage &gt;0.75 and hit coverage &gt;0.75), and the filtered hits were aligned by Clustal Omega (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sievers and Higgins, 2021</xref>). We selected the LasI/R system from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 as the target and mapped the multiple sequence alignments (MSA) to the target system. We built sequence profiles from the MSA with HMMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eddy, 2009</xref>) and hmmbuild for the QS synthases and receptors, respectively. The sequence profiles were then used to search against the ENA database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amid et al., 2019</xref>) and the IMG/M database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) from JGI using HMMER hmmsearch. A total of 149,837 and 5,046,620 homologs were found in these databases for the QS synthase and receptor, respectively. Because the synthases and receptors of the known QS systems frequently locate near each other in the genome, we kept synthase-receptor gene pairs that are separated by no more than two other open reading frames in the genome or contig. A total of 14,980 synthase-receptor gene pairs were identified and they represent 6360 non-identical QS systems. In another attempt, we carried out the same procedure using the LuxI/R system from <italic>V. fischeri</italic> MJ11 as the target system. A similar number of QS systems were identified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Identification of covarying residues</title><p>We connected the synthase and receptor protein sequences for each QS system we found in the databases and derived the alignments between these QS systems to the target QS system (LasI/R) from the hmmsearch result. We filtered the MSA for synthase-receptor pairs by sequence identity (maximal identify for remaining sequences ≤90%) and gap ratio in each sequence (maximal gap ratio ≤25%). We applied GREMLIN to analyze the covariation in the MSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>), and the GREMLIN coefficients were normalized using APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buslje et al., 2009</xref>) as we described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ovchinnikov et al., 2014</xref>). The GREMLIN coefficients after APC were used as measures for covariation signals between synthase and receptor amino acid residues. As a control, we connected each synthase sequence with a randomly selected receptor sequence and performed the covariation analysis in the same way.</p><p>We mapped the top-scoring covarying residues in the LasI/R system onto the crystal structures for each protein. Reported distances between residues and ligands are the shortest distance between any non-hydrogen atoms. For LasR, distances were calculated using PDB 6V7X. For LasI, distances were calculated using a LasI structure with 3-oxo-C12-acyl-phosphopantetheine modeled into the acyl-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gould et al., 2004</xref>).

The resulting PCR products were treated with the restriction enzyme DpnI to remove the parent template. Both PCR products were then used to transform <italic>E. coli</italic> (NEB 5-alpha). The resulting constructs were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. For pJN-RBSmupI, we began by amplifying <italic>mupI</italic> from <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> Migula (ATCC 49323) gDNA using primers mupI-F and mupI-R. We then used primers mupI-pJN-F and mupI-pJN-R to amplify the <italic>mupI</italic> PCR product and used the reverse complement of these two primers to amplify pJN-RBSlasI. The resulting PCR products were treated the same as for pJN-lasI. We constructed pJN-RBSlasI using restriction digestion. The <italic>lasI</italic> gene, including its upstream ribosomal binding site (RBS), was amplified from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 gDNA using primers RBS-lasI-F and lasI-pJN-R. pJN-lasI and the RBS-<italic>lasI</italic> PCR product were digested using NheI and SacI, gel or column purified, respectively, ligated by T4 DNA ligase, and transformed into NEB 5-alpha.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper nicely uses amino-acid covariation analysis to guide mutagenesis work that provides important new insight into the basis of specificity in quorum-sensing systems. The origins of ligand specificity in the LuxI-LuxR family of quorum-sensing systems has been poorly defined and this work now makes major advances in determining the key residues involved. The work lays the foundation for future studies of how selectivity, or a lack thereof, impacts the social behaviors of bacteria.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A covariation analysis reveals elements of selectivity in quorum sensing systems&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Michael T Laub as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sampriti Mukherjee (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have each provided a series of comments and suggestions that the authors should consider and respond to as fully as possible in a revision. From those comments/suggestions, there are 4 of particular note/importance:</p><p>1. The authors should revise the manuscript to more carefully note when selectivity has been broadened as opposed to 'rewired'.

The authors should show, for at least some of their mutants, whether the solubility and/or stability has changed and accounts for the observed changes in sensitivity and/or selectivity.</p></disp-quote><p>The abundance and stability of LuxR-type receptors is intertwined with signal binding. A key component of the natural regulation of AHL QS systems is that receptors, including LasR, are unstable/insoluble in the absence of bound signal. Thus, changes in affinity for a signal often lead to changes in the amount of soluble receptor present in a cell. Mutant LasR sensitivity and selectivity could be altered for many reasons including changed signal affinity, protein solubility, or, likely, both, and cause and effect is difficult to determine. Small differences in LasR level could conceivably correspond to the differences in 3OC12 sensitivity we see, even if these differences were not detected by immunoblotting. We have added a discussion of the link between LasR solubility and signal binding and the factors that may account for changes in LasI/R sensitivity and selectivity to the text (lines 186-219, 252-254).</p><p>We have also performed additional experiments to measure LasR solubility in some of the mutants (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2). These studies show that there is not a substantial difference in the level of soluble LasR between the variants and wild type (lines 219-224). Unfortunately we do not have a LasI antibody available for similar studies on synthase variants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The work relies solely on reporter assays and does not demonstrate changes in selectivity or sensitivity in a native quorum-sensing context. Although not essential to do, if the data are readily obtained, the reviewers felt that it could further strengthen the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to use reporter assays for our study because they are the best way to directly measure the primary activity of LasR, which is as a transcriptional activator. This is the most appropriate method by which to draw conclusions about LasR sensitivity and selectivity in a whole cell, and by studying LasI/R in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we have measured their activity in the native context. Whether changes in LasI/R sensitivity and selectivity affect sociality is a very intriguing, but separate, question. The products regulated by quorum sensing, such as pyocyanin and protease, are complexly regulated not only by LasR, but also by other factors including additional quorum sensing receptors. Changes in the sensitivity and selectivity of LasI/R could impact the timing and expression level of these products, and, ultimately, strain fitness in various environments. This is a subject we are excited to research in the future.</p><p>As a step toward these future research goals we have performed additional experiments and demonstrate that “MupR-like” LasR promotes a social phenotype in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (production of secreted protease) in response to the newly detected signal 3OC10-HSL (new Figure 6D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Could the authors elaborate on (a) why the highest GREMLIN scores for top covarying residues of LasI/R pair were so low (max being 0.109), and (b) the basis for choosing the MupI/R system as the target.</p></disp-quote><p>The scores we reported are not original GREMLIN scores; they are the GREMLIN scores with Average Product Correction, which is a common practice to improve the performance of GREMLIN prediction. The original GREMLIN scores for top-ranking residue pairs between the synthases and the receptors are about 0.4, which is also not a high value. From what we have observed, residues at the interface of directly interacting proteins generally have lower GREMLIN scores than contacts within the same protein, and transiently interacting proteins will have lower scores than obligate interactions. This is expected because the strength of the coevolution signal should correlate with how important it is to maintain a specific contact. Because the synthases and receptors do not directly interact, it is not a surprise to us that they have GREMLIN scores lower than we normally see in proteins that directly interact.</p><p>The lower GREMLIN score for indirectly interacting proteins does impose a difficulty in deciding the threshold for confident prediction. Therefore, in this particular study, we used a randomized control to help us determine which scores could be considered strong: those that are higher than the randomized control. We have added new Figure 2B to show a comparison of the GREMLIN analysis (with APC) for synthases and receptors compared to the randomized control. This figure also highlights the threshold for scores that are higher than the randomized control.</p><p>MupI/R was chosen as the target sequence because it is among the closest LasI/R homologs (by sequence identity) that uses a signal other than 3OC12-HSL. We have added this explanation to the text (271-272).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure-1: In addition to the current panels, it would be helpful to include a schematic for the GREMLIN APC pipeline so that the readers clearly understand the workflow.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added our workflow as suggested.

While we can rationalize some outcomes based on crystal structures, we are not yet at a point where we can predict signal from sequence or use GREMLIN to rationally engineer any desired response. This is a goal and a focus for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure-5a: A zoomed out view, i.e., annotating the residues in LasR and LasI AHL binding pockets in the context of the entire protein structure would be helpful for the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these images to the supplemental figures dealing with these variants (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure-5b: How does the &quot;MupR&quot;-like LasR variant control quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa? 5b shows data only for <italic>E. coli</italic> reporter assay.

The reason behind the altered activity of particular mutants is not a focus of this study; that selectivity and the rate of synthesis are changed verifies that covariation analysis works to identify selectivity residues in QS systems, regardless of the mechanisms behind those changes.

LasI<sup>L157W</sup> showed altered selectivity by TLC and we wanted to know which signals were being produced and in what ratio. This mutant was sufficient to demonstrate that 1) TLC is an appropriate screening method and 2) changes to LasI covarying residues can alter selectivity.

We sincerely appreciate the attention to detail and the insight provided by the reviewer.</p><p>Though we have not presented the data in the manuscript, we have indeed identified residues that covary within synthases and within receptors. We believe this might point us toward residues that interact with the selectivity residues and play a role in properly orienting them. These amino acids could serve as additional targets of substitutions for engineering. Additionally, some of the selectivity residues do covary with one another in the analysis within synthase and within receptors. At a first pass, these do not form networks that would have told us the most important selectivity residues from the start. We think this is because the strongest coevolution is between residues that directly interact with each other: they need to change accordingly to ensure the stability of proteins. The residues that are important for the cooperation between synthases and receptors will coevolve but to a lower extent.</p></body></sub-article></article>
