aging as individuals who reached the extreme decades of human life avoided or largely postponed all major age-related diseases. In this study, we sequenced at high coverage (90X) the whole genome of 81 semi-supercentenarians and supercentenarians [105+/110+] (mean age: 106.6 ± 1.6) and of 36 healthy unrelated geographically matched controls (mean age 68.0 ± 5.9) recruited in Italy. The results showed that 105+/110+ are characterized by a peculiar genetic background associated with efficient DNA repair mechanisms, as evidenced by both germline data (common and rare variants) and somatic mutations patterns (lower mutation load if compared to younger healthy controls). Results were replicated in a second independent cohort of 333 Italian centenarians and 358 geographically matched controls. The genetics of 105+/110+ identified DNA repair and clonal haematopoiesis as crucial players for healthy aging and for the protection from cardiovascular events.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>longevity</kwd><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>clonal hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>sequencing</kwd><kwd>geroscience</kwd><kwd>semi-supercentenarians</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>634821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garagnani</surname><given-names>Paolo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003443</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>074-02-2018-330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franceschi</surname><given-names>Claudio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010886</institution-id><institution>Nestlé Health Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Descombes</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011102</institution-id><institution>European Union 7th Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>602757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franceschi</surname><given-names>Claudio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic variants located in DNA repair genes and a reduced burden of somatic mutations protect the oldest living persons from age-related diseases, allowing an healthy aging phenotype.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The study of healthy aging is of increasing importance since the phenomenon of human aging is inevitably linked to cumulative burden of age-associated diseases – such as cardiovascular disease (CVDs), stroke, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, different type of cancer, or dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christensen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franceschi and Bonafè, 2003</xref>). The geroscience perspective suggested to consider ageing as the major common risk factor for several chronic diseases and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). However few genetics studies followed this theory to elucidate the common mechanisms between aging and age-related diseases.</p><p>The geroscience approach may be applied to many diseases and many experimental designs. Here, we decided: (i) to select an informative model of extreme longevity; (ii) to use a whole genome sequencing at high coverage approach; (iii) to analyze the link with the genetic determinants of CVDs.</p><p>The study of human extreme longevity constitutes a model useful to assess the impact of genetic variability on this trait according to the following considerations. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sebastiani et al., 2016</xref> showed that, considering individuals surviving to age 105 years, the relative risk of sibling surviving to 105 years is 35 times the chance of living to age 105 of the control population. These data suggest a more potent genetic contributions if samples are recruited in the last percentile of survival in accord with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2008</xref> who reported that the power to detect association with longevity is greater for centenarians versus nonagenarians samples of the same birth cohort. Second, despite different definitions and opinion regarding the concept of healthy aging, the clinical and biochemical data on centenarians showed that they can be considered as a paradigm of healthy aging as they avoid or largely postpone all major age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, healthy aging and exceptional longevity (people who live more than 100 years) are deeply related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christensen and McGue, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Many approaches applied in the last decades to the study of the genetics of human longevity seem to have many limitations, as extensively described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sebastiani et al., 2017</xref>). Heterogeneity of the groups – in terms of birth cohort and of population variability – seems to play the most problematic role when different cohorts and datasets are put together in order to increase statistical power. This approach identified genes and pathways important for longevity and healthy aging that are common between human populations, but at the same time misses the context, that is the ‘ecological’ dimension of healthy aging and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giuliani et al., 2017</xref>). In this view, the genetic determinants of longevity are dynamic and historically dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giuliani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giuliani et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yashin et al., 2015</xref>) and, while the genetic determinants of longevity may be shared by different populations, population-specific genes are expected to play a major role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Benedictis and Franceschi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>From <italic>a technological point of view</italic>, the decreasing cost of genotyping arrays has allowed in-depth study of the genetic variability of common variants, using increasingly dense microarrays (&gt;4M SNPs). However, whole genome sequencing (WGS) constitutes a major approach to study genomic variability of each individual (both in coding and noncoding regions). In the study of the genetics of human longevity, there are to date only few examples of WGS. The first studies were published in 2011 by Sebastiani and colleagues who characterized two supercentenarians, in 2014 by Gierman and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gierman et al., 2014</xref> who published a study on 13 supercentenarians (110 years or older) and in 2014 considering 44 Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freudenberg-Hua et al., 2014</xref>). These studies analyzed long-living people without considering a group of controls from the general population, thus reducing the number of potential new information which could be obtained. In 2016 Erickson and colleagues published a WGS paper on a high number of old individuals (N = 511, median age = 84.2 ± 9.3 years) whose health was assessed by self-reported data (‘Wellderly’) and 686 younger controls (median age = 33.3 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erikson et al., 2016</xref>). However, despite the potential of the technological approach, the relative ‘young’ age of the elderly, the low number of centenarians and the limitations of the self-reported health status suggest that the possibility to identify the contribution of genetics to human longevity of this study was limited, as argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sebastiani et al., 2017</xref>.</p><p>CVDs constitute the first cause of death globally and many studies highlighted the intersection between CVDs and aging as cardiac and vascular aging are considered the major risk factor for CVDs. Many molecular mechanisms have been described as hallmarks of this process such as cellular senescence, genomic instability, chromatin remodeling, macromolecular damage and mitochondrial oxidative stress perturbed proteostasis, vascular and systemic chronic inflammation, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furman et al., 2019</xref>). An emerging common mechanism between aging and CVD is the accumulation with age of somatic mutations. An age-related expansion of hematopoietic clones characterized by disruptive somatic mutations in few recurrent genes (such as DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, PPM1D, TP53), conferring to the mutated cells a selective proliferative advantage, has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaiswal et al., 2014</xref>). The expansion of such mutated clones (‘clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential’, CHIP), has been associated to an acceleration of the atherosclerotic process, an increased risk of haematological malignancies (hazard ratio 11,1), ischemic stroke (hazard ratio 2,6), coronary heart disease (hazard ratio 2,0) and all-cause mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaiswal et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we generated and analyzed the first WGS data with high coverage (90X) in a cohort of 81 semi-supercentenarians and supercentenarians [105+/110+] (mean age: 106.6 ± 1.6) recruited across the entire Italian peninsula together with a control cohort of 36 healthy geographically matched individuals (Northern, Central, and Southern Italy) (mean age 68.0 ± 5.9).

We used the data produced by WGS in 105+/110+ as discovery data (Cohort 1) to have information about all the variants, and to maximize the probability to identify significant genetic association according to biological models. This design is supported by data showing that the power to detect association with longevity is greater for centenarians versus nonagenarians subjects of the same birth cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The choice of controls is an issue often debated in longevity studies. A number of unrelated samples from the general population matched for geographical origin has been included as control (N = 36). The prevalence of individuals that will become centenarians and semi-supercentenarians in the control group is negligible because of the rarity of the trait. To validate the results obtained in Cohort 1 (discovery phase), we used Cohort 2 (data produced by CoreExomeChip v.1.1 array Illumina 550 k, see details in Materials and methods) that is characterized by a high number of samples (333 centenarians and 358 controls).

The SNP rs10279856 seems to play a pleiotropic role as it is an eQTL for STK17A gene and for two other genes (COA1 and BLVRA). The haplotype-based analysis confirmed that COA1 presented the most significant signal and identified a haplotype strongly associated to extreme longevity (chr7: 43720429–43756081) (p-value=1.84*10<sup>–8</sup>). Moreover, the comparison with existing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giuliani et al., 2018b</xref>) also identified one SNP (rs623108) with potential impact on STK17A expression, indicating that different signals from different SNPs in moderate LD seems to converge on regulating the expression of COA1, STK1A, and BLVRA genes. Further functional studies are needed to elucidate the role of these genes.</p><p>Considering the four SNPs identified by Riviera analysis – that is rs10279856, rs3779059, rs849166, rs849175 – we observed that the most frequent alleles in 105+/110+ (rs10279856-G reference allele and rs3779059-A, rs849166-A, rs849175-A alternative alleles) are associated with the increase in SKT17A gene expression in heart (atrial and left ventricle), lung, nerve, and thyroid (data from GTEx portal). STK17A is involved in DNA damage response and positive regulation of apoptotic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sanjo et al., 1998</xref>) and regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic process. Moreover, it has been suggested that STK17A can be activated in response to external stimuli such as UV radiation and drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sanjo et al., 1998</xref>). SNP rs7805969-A allele (located in STK17A/COA1 region) was found to be associated to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a population from Southern Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">da Silva Fonseca et al., 2013</xref>), and a reduced expression of SKT17A has been observed during the active phase of SLE disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sandrin-Garcia et al., 2009</xref>). These data suggest a possible role of this gene in DNA damage response as the variants associated to an increase of SKT17A expression (in-silico prediction) were found more frequent in 105+/110+ than controls, supporting the data by Gorbunova and colleagues on a central role of DNA repair mechanisms in aging and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gorbunova et al., 2007</xref>). They proposed the following sequence of events that occurs during aging: (i) mutation impairs function of genes involved in stress response and DNA repair; (2) DNA repair became more error-prone leading to accumulation of DNA damage; (3) this process accelerates age-related decline. In this model, genetic variants in STK17A may maintain DNA damage responses in 105+/110+, favoring healthy aging. On the contrary, autoimmune disease (such as SLE) are characterized by the accumulation of DNA double strand breaks possibly due to impaired repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Souliotis et al., 2016</xref>) which is in line with data that described a reduced expression of SKT17A. These data on human extreme longevity support a recent study on lifespan in mammals which analyze evolutionary constraints at protein level and found DNA repair as one of the mechanisms allowing an extended lifespan across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kowalczyk et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the most frequent genotypes in 105+/110+ (rs10279856-G reference allele and rs3779059-A, rs849166-A, rs849175-A alternative alleles) are not only associated to STK17A expression but also to a reduced expression of COA1 gene in adipose, artery, esophagus – mucosa, nerve – tibial and skin. COA1 gene is a component of the MITRAC complex (mitochondrial translation regulation assembly intermediate of cytochrome c oxidase complex) that regulates cytochrome c oxidase assembly. MITRAC complexes regulate both the translation of mitochondrial-encoded components and the assembly of nuclear-encoded components imported in mitochondrion and in particular the respiratory chain complex I and IV. Our result constitute the first evidence of an association with longevity of nuclear loci mapping in a gene deeply involved in mitochondrial dynamics, supporting the hypothesis that nuclear/mitochondrial co-evolution may have a crucial role for human longevity and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garagnani et al., 2014</xref>). The same SNPs are associated with an increase in BLVRA expression in whole blood and a decrease of the expression of the same gene in artery (tibial) and esophagus (mucosa). The protein encoded by the BLVRA gene belongs to the biliverdin reductase family, members of which catalyze the conversion of biliverdin to bilirubin. Recently it has been established that a redox cycle based on BVRA activity provides physiologic cytoprotection as BVRA depletion exacerbates the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increase cell death. Interestingly, BLVRA contributes significantly to modulation of the aging process by adjusting the cellular oxidative status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, Biliverdin reductase A was previously shown to regulate the inflammatory response to endotoxin, by inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wegiel et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Considering the complexity of the trait under study, it has recently been proposed that even suggestive and marginally significant p-values can be highly informative in the case of longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erikson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>), an argument supported by Yashin and colleagues who showed that longevity also depends on several small-effect alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yashin et al., 2010</xref>). In this context, the pathway analysis is crucial as the integration of many SNPs with modest p-values may identify biological functions and crucial pathways involved in longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). This analysis identified in several pathways enriched in our cohort: axon guidance, calcium signaling, glycine serine and threonine metabolism, long-term potentiation, melanogenesis, PPAR signaling and taste transduction (see Supplementary Material 1 for more details).</p><p>In this study, APOE-e4, the gene identified in a high number of studies on human longevity showed only a general trend but no significant association with longevity was found in Cohort 1. This is in line with recent data published by the GEHA Consortium (European project on the Genetics of Healthy Ageing) where APOE-e4 did not show association with longevity in the Italian population. Factors explaining this discrepancy are the variability of this haplotype across Europe, the cline that led to the low frequency in Italy (APOE-e4 is around 8% in South Italy), the peculiar gene-environment interaction experienced by certain birth cohort, and the gender effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giuliani et al., 2018a</xref>). The analysis of private mutations of 105+/110+ showed that some damaging variants and pathogenic variants are compatible with extreme longevity and healthy ageing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>).</p><p>Rare variants analysis showed significant associations for the NME1 gene when all rare variants were considered, and for the PLEKHG4 (puratrophin-1) gene when only damaging rare variants were considered. NME-1 is the first metastasis suppressor gene discovered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steeg et al., 1988</xref> whose expression inhibits cell motility and metastasis in different human cancers. It regulates signalling pathways stimulated by various growth factors, including TGF-beta, platelet-derived growth factor, IGF1, lysophosphatidic acid, and serum, which suppresses metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Russell et al., 1998</xref>). Recently, it has been demonstrated that NME1 is rapidly recruited to double-strand breaks promoting DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaetzel et al., 2015</xref>). PLEKHG4 is associated with Spinocerebellar ataxia, a neurodegenerative disease affecting cerebellar Purkinje cells. Atrophic Purkinje cells from these SCA patients have cytoplasmic aggregates containing Puratrophin-1 and the actin-binding protein Spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishikawa et al., 2005</xref>). These regions seems to be preserved in 105+/110+ individuals who largely postpone age-related diseases and cancers, among other common diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishikawa et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The analysis of somatic mutations suggests that 105+/110+ individuals seem to be protected from accumulation of such mutations and we did not observe such an increase as would be expected considering their age. 105+/110+ individuals are characterized by a lower prevalence of somatic mutations in six out of the seven genes considered that is statistically significant for DNMT3A and ASXL1 genes.

A lower sequencing depth is less sensitive to detect low allele fraction variants.

Gene-environment interactions are population-specific also because of the variability in environmental and cultural settings (dietary habits and lifestyle among others) and thus we cannot exclude that these results will not be generalizable. Only more data on semi-supercentenarians from other countries will clarify this point.</p></list-item></list><p>We selected a population of 105+/110+ perfectly matched with controls for geographical origin (from Northern to Southern Italy) to reduce bias due to genetic population variability, however a potential limitation is inextricably intertwined with this experimental design. Gene-environment interactions are population-specific also because of the variability in environmental and cultural settings (dietary habits and lifestyle among others) and thus it is likely that interactions with genetics may be different and not generalizable. Population-driven studies in which environmental and cultural data are included are desirable in this sense.</p><p>The major strengths of the present study are the following: (1) the design of this study based on the careful selection of individuals with more than 105 years old in order to focus on a peculiar phenotype that is extreme longevity; (2) the selection of 105+/110+ and controls in an homogenous population all matched for geographical origin; (3) the use of a second validation cohort of centenarians from the same population; (4) the high coverage of the sequencing that allowed somatic mutations analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, this study constitutes the first whole genome sequencing of extreme longevity at high coverage, that also allows somatic mutations analysis, in which 105+/110+ are compared with a group of healthy individual geographically matched. The results showed that 105+/110+ are characterized by a peculiar genetic background associated to efficient DNA repair mechanisms, as evidenced by both germline data and somatic mutations patterns (low/similar mutation load if compared to younger healthy controls from the general population). The model of 105+/110+ supports the recent literature that suggests a genetic signature in DNA repair mechanisms and clonal haematopoiesis are crucial players for cellular homeostasis and in cardiovascular events and that they can be the two central mechanisms that have protected 105+/110+ from age-related diseases, including CVDs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cohorts description</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Cohort 1 (discovery cohort)</title><p>The cohort consists of 84 unrelated Italian healthy semi-supercentenarians and supercentenarians [105+/110+] older than 104 years (mean age 106.6 ± 1.6) recruited in North, Centre, and South of the Italian peninsula and 5 out of 84 were supercentenarians and 40 healthy unrelated controls (mean age 68.0 ± 5.9) matched for geographic origin (as also demonstrated by PCA).</p><p>After quality check 81 [105+/110+] and 36 controls were analyzed.

Briefly the definition of PUTATIVE SOMATIC MUTATIONS includes those mutations that followed the following criteria: (a) SNPs; (b) Observed once or twice in the cohort; (c) AF above 10%; (d) Failed the hypothesis that the alternate allelic count was distributed as a binomial process with mean 50% with a designed false positive rate of 10<sup>–5</sup>. We fixed the mean 50% for the binomial test as we do not have the same problems of exome sequencing in the experimental procedure described by Genovese and colleagues. We selected seven genes which are the most frequently associated to clonal hematopoiesis (ASXL1, DNMT3A, JAK2, PPM1D, TET2, TP53, SF3B1). Variants have been annotated with SnpEff [15], which predicts the effects of genetic variants to the final encoded protein, in order to detect mutations that would lead to a reduced or abnormal function of the protein. In this scenario, we identified different types of mutations with low, modifier, moderate and high impact on the protein function. Moderate (e.g. missense variant, inframe deletion) and high impact variants (e.g. stop gained, frameshift variant) are highly likely to disrupt the protein function. Low impact variants (e.g. synonymous variant) and modifier (usually non-coding variants or variants affecting non-coding genes) have usually no impact on function or there is no evidence of impact, thus in these cases predictions are difficult. After excluding variants with alternative frequency equal to 1 or 0, we transformed the coverage distribution of centenarians so that their cumulative distribution was the same as the one of controls. We called that normalized coverage. The alternative (alt) and reference (ref) counts were recomputed as (frequency * normalized coverage). We excluded variants with normalized coverage &lt;10 reads, with normalized alternative counts &lt; 3 reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaiswal et al., 2014</xref>), and that were observed in more than one control or in more than two centenarians minor allele frequency less than 0.025% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Genovese et al., 2014</xref>). To exclude germinal (inherited) variants [Genovese et al.], we defined as somatic mutations SNPs that failed the hypothesis that the alternate allelic count was distributed as a binomial process with mean 47.13% for control subjects and 46.43% for centenarians, indels were excluded from this analysis. The means of the binomial processes were computed as the median frequency of variants with frequency between 0.2 and 0.8. Analogously, we excluded homozygous germinal variants by testing the hypothesis that the alternate allelic count was distributed as a binomial process with mean 1% or 99%. In both cases, a significance threshold of 0.05 was used to reject the null hypothesis. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the average number of variants in each gene between the two groups and Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the proportion of subjects with at least one mutation in the two groups.

In the effect, 24 absent leading SNPs were successfully substituted and identified proxies were incorporated in the risk score calculation with original loadings. This operation was not considered necessary for other GRS since the ratio of absent SNPs was neglectable.</p><p>We checked whether the genetic risk score values were significantly different between centenarians and the controls: if the assumptions of sample independency, normal distribution and homogeneity of variances were met we applied Student’s t-test, otherwise - Wilcoxon rank test was used. Further, since it was proposed that aging may be characterized by increase in variation of biological system – observing that with aging individuals tend to drift from the population average, we additionally checked with Levenne’s test whether phenotypic groups differ in GRS variance.</p><p>Genetic risk score for each individual was calculated also considering 353 disease variants described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erikson et al., 2016</xref>: 15 SNPs associated to Alzheimer disease, 83 SNPs to breast cancer, 138 SNPs to coronary disease, 25 SNPs to stroke, 65 SNPs to type 2 diabetes, 8 SNPs to colon cancer, 4 SNPs to lung cancer, 12 SNPs to pancreatic cancer and 3 SNPs to prostate cancer. These SNPs were selected from a previously described list of SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erikson et al., 2016</xref>) in order to generate comparable results. Logistic regression was performed to compare score distribution between cases and controls.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by Nestlé Research, Société des Produits Nestlé SA and by the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme to C Franceschi (grant number 602757, HUMAN); by the European Union’s H2020 Project to C Franceschi and P Garagnani (grant number 634821, PROPAG-AGING); by JPco-fuND to C Franceschi (ADAGE) and by a grant of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russian Federation (agreement No. 075-15-2020-808). We thank Leon Pietro Menicanti for his support on ethical issues.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is affiliated with Nestlé Research, Société des Produits Nestlé SA.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Garagnani and colleagues reports a whole genome sequencing (WGS) study of a unique cohort of 81 semi/supercentenarians and 36 controls from Italy and a replication study involving geographically matched 333 centenarians and 358 controls. The authors find suggestive evidence for association of a common variant near STK17A with longevity from the WGS analysis and provide evidence for replication based on imputed genome-wide chip data. By performing rare variant analysis, the authors implicate a role of DNA damage response/repair in longevity. The authors also present data showing that semi/super-centenarians have fewer clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) variants than would be expected, suggesting better DNA integrity/repair in the oldest old. The study represents the largest whole genome sequence study of a rare population of exceptionally extreme longevity involving semi/supercentenarians and will certainly be of interest to the community of researchers studying the biology of aging. All three reviewers agree that this study is unique and should be of broad interest. However, as detailed below, many concerns were also raised, relating in large part to insufficient power of detecting longevity-associated rare variants, inadequate clarity in the authors' methods, the limitations of their approach, and data presentation/interpretation in the current version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The SNP rs7456688 that is included among the top association in the common variant analysis is very common in Europeans (MAF = 0.36 from dbSNP). The authors report MAF=22% in controls and MAF=56% in centenarians. These numbers are way off from what would be expected. If centenarians were so enriched of the uncommon allele, the association would be detected in other GWAS of extreme human longevity. In addition, such difference in MAF from other reference panel would point to an issue of population stratification. Therefore, text, data analysis, data presentation, and discussion should be clarified to address the concerns that: (1) there is no flip of alleles in the analysis; (2) there are no artifacts in the WGS data by including a display of the pile-up of the reads; (3) the analysis is adjusted for the genome-wide genotype PC; and (4) the analysis should be replicated in other studies.</p><p>2. The main strength of this study is also the main weakness: while sample size is the largest to date of supercentenarians, it is still small for discovery of moderate/modest effect sizes. Furthermore, there is the unbalanced case/control ratio where the case group is more than twice as large compared to the control group. In this respect, detailed answers to the following key questions must be available in the present manuscript:</p><p>i. It needs to be discussed (a) why so few controls were included; and (b) how such difference in such a small group may affect the results. In addition, the authors should (c) consider the possibility of boosting power for modest case numbers by increasing the number of controls to 2-3X (or more) the number of cases; or (d) discuss why such analysis with increased control sample size could not be done.</p><p>ii. Were any cases related to one another? If so, how was this accounted for?</p><p>iii. Gene-based analyses using VEGAS2 uncovered 179 genes with evidence for association with longevity at p&lt;0.01. Assuming 20,000-25,000 genes were queried genome-wide, we would have expected 200-250 &quot;significantly&quot; associated genes. Thus 179 genes is no more (in fact is less) than one would expect by chance. Further, if 179 genes were advanced to the replication phase and evidence for replication was set at p&lt;0.05, we would expect 9 genes to replicate by chance, whereas there was just 1, again, no more (in fact less) than would be expected by chance. The statistical robustness of the STK17A association needs to be convinced.</p><p>iv. Given that the significant differences of the allele frequency between groups have not reached significance threshold, even not a suggestive one (which is 5*10-6), the authors wisely used SLIDE (Han et al., 2009); however, it seems that this adjustment doesn't work because:</p><p>a. It was designed for much larger sample size (in fact Asif et al., Mol. Psychiatry 2020, have shown that using SLIDE in small sample size may not be reliable);</p><p>b. The candidate gene association did not reach significance threshold (7x10-2=0.07 in the p adjusted SLIDE column in table 1 is bigger than 0.05); and</p><p>c. SLIDE assumes normal distribution of variants across the sliding windows especially in unbalanced case-control analyses. It needs to be clarified if normal distribution (within the sliding windows) was observed and, if not given the small sample size, how significance of the results and the resulting interpretation were affected by this bias. Consider haplotype analysis of the suggestive significance area.</p><p>v. The analysis of the rare variants is unfortunately underwhelming, but the authors could expand this part by analyzing the burden of rare and damaging variants in these sequences, and by examining the private mutations that are carried by these 81 sequences.</p><p>vi. Most of the results are focused on the association between a group of common variants and longevity, which does not really leverage the use of WGS analysis. We are told very little about the sequences of these 81 people. The authors need to include analysis that leverage the whole genome sequence data.</p><p>vii. Given the rareness of semi- and supercentenarians, the results should be presented as highly exploratory worthy of further investigation. Consider changing the title to &quot;Whole-genome sequencing analysis of semi-supercentenarians&quot;.</p><p>3. The authors describe the lengths they went through to make sure that semi/super-centenarian cases and controls were ethnically matched and provide data in the form of geographic distribution and principal components. They also mention the well-known north-south cline in genetic ancestry in Italy.</p><p>i. Looking at Figure 1, it appears that there are a higher proportion of cases that originate from the south compared to controls (only 3 &lt;10%) of the controls come from the south whereas approximately 1/3 of cases came from the South. PCs should be included in the genetic analyses to help account for cryptic population substructure/stratification.</p><p>ii. Since there is clear dichotomy between north and south it would be interesting to present the difference in allele frequency between the two regions (central Italy is negligible as there are only 3 exceptional long lived subjects without matched controls) and how it affects the overall p value.</p><p>iii. Franceschi et al. (Aging 2000) reported the significant F:M ratio differences between north and south. It would be interesting to see if it affects allele frequency.</p><p>4. Perhaps the most intriguing findings of this manuscript is that the oldest old have fewer CHIP variants than would be expected. It is essential that they provide clear and complete details in the analysis of identifying the CHIP variants.</p><p>i. The authors appeared to do an adequate job in identifying the CHIP variants they reported based on relatively deep sequencing and reasonable allelic imbalance cut-offs.. However, somatic mutation rates appear to be very high (Figure 5). Did 80.6% of 68 year old controls actually have somatic mutations in DNMT3A?</p><p>ii. It is not clear how the authors distinguish between somatic mutations and rare, germline mutations without using the AF. This analysis should not use the MAF.</p><p>iii. The authors should discuss whether a depth of coverage of 90X is sufficient to detect somatic mutations.</p><p>iv. Were the bloods drawn at the time the cases were indeed semi- and super-centenarians or possibly years before?</p><p>5. Some of the statements about the lack of difference between PRS in different populations maybe an issue of power or of PRS that are too restrictive. The authors could expand their analyses by using PRS that includes SNPs that did not meet the level of genome wide significance</p><p>6. Clarify how the enrichment analyses were conducted, since it is not clear what genes were included in these analyses.</p><p>7. In Discussion, include a statement about generalizability to populations beyond Italy where diet and lifestyle and their interactions with genetics may be different.</p><p>8. The manuscript requires edits for many grammatical errors and awkward sentence structure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57849.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The analysis is not adjusted for the first Principal Components (PCs). This is because other papers suggested to not include the first PCs as covariate in ageing studies if process of mortality selection may have occurred in the population of controls (Yashin et al. 2014 – “Genetic Structures of Population Cohorts Change with Increasing Age: Implications for Genetic Analyses of Human aging and Life Span”). The mean age of our controls is 68.0 ± 5.9 and we do not have a WGS of young population of controls to use to calculate PCs to include as covariates as suggested in the paper. The only Italian WGS data available are the one here reported and the Tuscans in 1000 Genomes. The latter cannot be included as they are not representative of the Italian peninsula but of the Centre of Italy only.</p><p>However as requested by reviewers we run again the analysis and we include in Supplementary file 1 a new column with the nominal p-values (logistic regression) after including PC1 and PC2 as covariates.</p><p>4. The signal on the same region was described in a second cohort of Italian centenarians. We have clarified this point in the text as follows:</p><p>“The five variants (rs7456688, rs10257700, rs10279856, rs69685881, rs7805969) identified in Cohort 1 were evaluated for association with longevity in the validation Cohort 2. Cohort 2 includes 333 centenarians (mean age: 100.4 ± 1.4) and a group of 358 unrelated healthy individuals (controls; mean age: 60.7 ± 7.2), genotyped on the Illumina 550k array platform. The analysis of Cohort 2 imputed genotypes (see Materials and methods) returned nominal p-values &lt; 0.05 for all the 5 variants, as reported in Table 1”.</p><p>These are all the genetics data produced to date for Italian centenarians and new recruitments are impossible in this period.</p><p>However, we are aware that the frequencies are different from the data from 1000 Genomes and we are aware that our control group has a reduce sample size (we discussed this point in the discussion). For this reason, we added Figure 2C with the frequency of rs7456688-A in all the cohorts analyzed and we added imputed data from another published group of individuals &lt; 50 years (Giuliani et al. 2018).</p><p>We hypothesized that these loci have never been described before because they are peculiar of the cohorts of 105+/110+ as the new Figure 2C reported. No other studies have the possibility to analyze an “high” number of semi-supercentenarians with more than 105 years.</p><p>The allele (rs7456688-A) increases in frequency in 105+/110+ (evident by the significant p-value) and the signal is detectable only when this group is included. If we perform a logistic regression comparing the group of 105/110 with all the controls (Cohort 1 + Cohort 2 – N=394) the p-value is still significant (p-value = 5.366e-05).</p><p>Considering all these data we modified the text adding the following sentences:</p><p>“Figure 2C reports the allele frequency of rs7456688-A in individuals from Cohort 1 (105+/110+ and CTRL) and Cohort 2 (100+ and CTRL), and of another cohort of healthy controls &lt; 50 years (N=392, mean age = 39.5± 7.2) already described in (Giuliani et al. 2018). The Tuscans data (TSI) reported in 1000 Genomes project is also included. The pattern follows a U-shaped with the highest allele frequency observed for 105+/110+, indicating the relevant role of the variant in extreme longevity.”</p><p>We added this point in the discussion:</p><p>“The U-shaped in allele frequency of rs7456688-A allele supports that these variants are peculiar of 105+/110+ individuals and this is the first study that include a high number of 105+/110+ to detect this signal.”</p><p>As requested, we also calculated the frequency of the same variants in Northern, Centre, Southern Italy and no significant differences were detected (we added this sentence “All the identified signals described in Supplementary file 1 showed a non-significant p-values in the analysis based on geography. This indicates that the Italian genetic structure does not bias the signals identified.”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The main strength of this study is also the main weakness: while sample size is the largest to date of supercentenarians, it is still small for discovery of moderate/modest effect sizes. Furthermore, there is the unbalanced case/control ratio where the case group is more than twice as large compared to the control group. In this respect, detailed answers to the following key questions must be available in the present manuscript.</p><p>i. It needs to be discussed (a) why so few controls were included; and (b) how such difference in such a small group may affect the results. In addition, the authors should (c) consider the possibility of boosting power for modest case numbers by increasing the number of controls to 2-3X (or more) the number of cases; or (d) discuss why such analysis with increased control sample size could not be done.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for this comment. Unfortunately, we do not have the possibility to increase the number of controls in our study and we decided to discuss this limitation. We add in the discussion the following sentence:</p><p>“(2) the unbalanced case/control ratio where the case group is more than twice as large compared to the control group whose sample size is low (N=36). […] We decided to not include the TSI of the 1000 Genomes project in the control group first because their age is not known, secondly because they are not representative of the Italian peninsula (as Tuscany is located in the Centre of Italy) and to maintain the matched with the 81 semi-supercentenarians who comes from Northern, Centre and Southern Italy”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii. Were any cases related to one another? If so, how was this accounted for?</p></disp-quote><p>All the individuals are not related to each other. We add this info in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii. Gene-based analyses using VEGAS2 uncovered 179 genes with evidence for association with longevity at p&lt;0.01. Assuming 20,000-25,000 genes were queried genome-wide, we would have expected 200-250 &quot;significantly&quot; associated genes. Thus 179 genes is no more (in fact is less) than one would expect by chance. Further, if 179 genes were advanced to the replication phase and evidence for replication was set at p&lt;0.05, we would expect 9 genes to replicate by chance, whereas there was just 1, again, no more (in fact less) than would be expected by chance. The statistical robustness of the STK17A association needs to be convinced.</p></disp-quote><p>The gene-based analysis has been performed including as input the p-values taken from the analysis of common variants. The qqplot showed deflation that is consequently evident in gene-based analysis. We move the section of gene-based analysis in the results to improve quality and we first describe the analysis of common variants and then the gene-based analysis.</p><p>Following the comment of reviewers, we realized that in the first submission we described only the top signal (STK17A gene) but the genes with evidence for replication (p-value &lt; 0.05) were 8 (STK17A, BLVRA, MYRF, DNAH7, LOC553103, PHF14, SLC22A4, TBRG4). We calculated and reported in the manuscript the combined p-values and STK17A is the most significant (p-values=2.03*10<sup>-9</sup>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv. Given that the significant differences of the allele frequency between groups have not reached significance threshold, even not a suggestive one (which is 5*10-6), the authors wisely used SLIDE (Han et al., 2009); however, it seems that this adjustment doesn't work because:</p><p>a. It was designed for much larger sample size (in fact Asif et al., Mol. Psychiatry 2020, have shown that using SLIDE in small sample size may not be reliable);</p><p>b. The candidate gene association did not reach significance threshold (7x10-2=0.07 in the p adjusted SLIDE column in table 1 is bigger than 0.05); and</p><p>c. SLIDE assumes normal distribution of variants across the sliding windows especially in unbalanced case-control analyses. It needs to be clarified if normal distribution (within the sliding windows) was observed and, if not given the small sample size, how significance of the results and the resulting interpretation were affected by this bias. Consider haplotype analysis of the suggestive significance area.</p></disp-quote><p>The p-values reported after SLIDE correction is 0.07, but we stated in Materials and methods that we described the top signals “loci with significance at adjusted p-values 10% for the discovery”. Then we followed the suggestion of reviewers and we added a haplotype analysis considering the top signals reported in Table 2S (now Supplementary file 1). As suggested by reviewers we included a new section of results and Materials and methods for the haplotype analysis. Interestingly we identified in this region a haplotype in COA1 gene with a p-value of 1.84*10-8. Thus gene-based analysis and haplotype analysis reinforced the signals we identified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>v. The analysis of the rare variants is unfortunately underwhelming, but the authors could expand this part by analyzing the burden of rare and damaging variants in these sequences, and by examining the private mutations that are carried by these 81 sequences.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for this comment, and we followed this suggestion, and we added all the analyses suggested in a new section called “105+/110+ private mutations and rare variants analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>vi. Most of the results are focused on the association between a group of common variants and longevity, which does not really leverage the use of WGS analysis. We are told very little about the sequences of these 81 people. The authors need to include analysis that leverage the whole genome sequence data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for this observation. The analysis of rare and private variants, of haplotypes and of the somatic mutations reported in this paper represent a novelty respect to available GWAS on longevity, and here we would prefer to focus on these topics. Future works will include other analysis (like CNV, LINE, SINE, indel).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>vii. Given the rareness of semi- and supercentenarians, the results should be presented as highly exploratory worthy of further investigation. Consider changing the title to &quot;Whole-genome sequencing analysis of semi-supercentenarians&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We perfectly agree with this viewpoint and we have changed the title accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors describe the lengths they went through to make sure that semi/super-centenarian cases and controls were ethnically matched and provide data in the form of geographic distribution and principal components. They also mention the well-known north-south cline in genetic ancestry in Italy.</p><p>i. Looking at Figure 1, it appears that there are a higher proportion of cases that originate from the south compared to controls (only 3 &lt;10%) of the controls come from the south whereas approximately 1/3 of cases came from the South. PCs should be included in the genetic analyses to help account for cryptic population substructure/stratification.</p></disp-quote><p>The total number of controls coming from Southern Italy in the Cohort 1 is 5. Figure 1 can be misleading because 2 individuals came from Petronà (CZ), 2 individuals from Carolei (CS) and one individual from San Lucido (CS). This is why the picture reported only three dots. The exact numbers have been clarified in the Materials and methods section. As mentioned above, to exclude that geographical genetic structure could have affected the results, we performed the analysis also including the first PCs in supplementary materials and the top signals did not vary.</p><p>We do not include the correction with PCs in the main text because (1) the genomic inflation factor (based on median chi-squared) is 1,02 (we reported this info in the manuscript) and (2) because other papers suggest to not include the first PCs as covariate in ageing studies if process of mortality selection may have occurred in the population of controls (Yashin et al. 2014 – “Genetic Structures of Population Cohorts Change with Increasing Age: Implications for Genetic Analyses of Human aging and Life Span” ). The mean age of our controls is 68.0 ± 5.9 and we do not have a WGS of young population of controls to use to calculate PCs to include as covariates as suggested in the paper. The only Italian WGS sequencing data available are the one here reported and the TSI in 1000 Genomes that we cannot use as they are not representative of the Italian peninsula but of the Centre of Italy.</p><p>However as requested by reviewers we run again the analysis and we include in Supplementary file 1 a new column with the nominal p-values (logistic regression) after including PC1 and PC2 as covariates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii. Since there is clear dichotomy between north and south it would be interesting to present the difference in allele frequency between the two regions (central Italy is negligible as there are only 3 exceptional long lived subjects without matched controls) and how it affects the overall p value.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the suggestion of the reviewer and we compared Northern 105+/110+ to Southern 105+/110+ and we add in the text the following:</p><p>“Given the presence of the well-known Italian genetic structure we decided to perform an association analysis comparing Northern 105+/110+ to Southern 105+/110+subjects.

Franceschi et al. (Aging 2000) reported the significant F:M ratio differences between north and south. It would be interesting to see if it affects allele frequency.</p></disp-quote><p>We perfectly agree with this comment, but we decided to include the same sex:ratio in 105+/110+ from Northern and Southern Italy, thus it is unlikely that sex differences impact on our results. We added the information in Cohorts description (Materials and methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Perhaps the most intriguing findings of this manuscript is that the oldest old have fewer CHIP variants than would be expected. It is essential that they provide clear and complete details in the analysis of identifying the CHIP variants.</p><p>i. The authors appeared to do an adequate job in identifying the CHIP variants they reported based on relatively deep sequencing and reasonable allelic imbalance cut-offs.. However, somatic mutation rates appear to be very high (Figure 5). Did 80.6% of 68 year old controls actually have somatic mutations in DNMT3A?</p><p>ii. It is not clear how the authors distinguish between somatic mutations and rare, germline mutations without using the AF. This analysis should not use the MAF.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for this comment, in the first submission to exclude germinal (inherited) variants we defined as somatic mutations SNPs that failed the hypothesis that the alternate allelic count was distributed as a binomial process with mean 47.13% for control subjects and 46.43% for centenarians as suggested in the paper of Genovese and colleagues. After the comment of review, we realized that the p-value we setted in the first version was too high (p-value=0.05). Thus, we decided to set a more stringent p-value (p-value &lt; 10-5) and we filtered allelic fraction above 10% in order to address the concerns of reviewers. We then fixed the mean 50% for the binomial test as we do not have the same problems of exome sequencing in the experimental procedure described by Genovese and colleagues. All the analysis and data have been updated.</p><p>For clarity we reported the AF distribution in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Even after this filter the mutations in DNMT3A are 20,25% in centenarians and 54,8% in controls. Since this data come from whole genome sequencing (and not exome sequencing) it is likely that the percentage is higher than expected and difficult to compare with published papers. We added the following sentence to address this point “The methodological variability (in term of coverage and part of the genome analyzed) make the comparison of existing data difficult and not always possible.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii. The authors should discuss whether a depth of coverage of 90X is sufficient to detect somatic mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed reviewers suggestion and we added the following consideration in the text:</p><p>“However, it is to note that a depth of coverage of 90x is not the golden standard to call somatic mutations that require a coverage around 4,000x as performed in recent studies (Buscarlet et al. 2017). […] Other studies about somatic mutations have been performed considering exome sequencing data or whole genome sequencing with a 30x mean coverage only (Zink et al. 2017 ; Jaiswal et al. 2014, Genovese et al. 2014 among others).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv. Were the bloods drawn at the time the cases were indeed semi- and super-centenarians or possibly years before?</p></disp-quote><p>The blood has been collected when semi and super-centenarians reached the reported age (105 or 110) and not years before. We agree that this detail is important and we reported it in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Some of the statements about the lack of difference between PRS in different populations maybe an issue of power or of PRS that are too restrictive. The authors could expand their analyses by using PRS that includes SNPs that did not meet the level of genome wide significance</p></disp-quote><p>The selection of PRS is based on the scores already described in scientific papers and already validated in other publications and in other cohorts. We prefer to not include “new” scores changing the number of SNPs included to make the results comparable with existing literature. Further analysis and a dedicated paper is needed to identify new scores in these cohorts or to use this cohorts to create new PRSs. We added this point in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Clarify how the enrichment analyses were conducted, since it is not clear what genes were included in these analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this observation. Details have been included in Materials and methods as follows: “Pathway analyses were performed by means of i-GSEA4GWAS v.2. The used algorithm combined the list of p-values for all the positions (MAF&gt; 0.05) according to SNP-mapped genes and then filtered the collection of pathways/gene sets to obtain a general p-value for each pathway.

In Discussion, include a statement about generalizability to populations beyond Italy where diet and lifestyle and their interactions with genetics may be different.</p></disp-quote><p>Discussion has been modified accordingly. We added the following sentence: “(3) the possibility that the signals here identified are peculiar of the Italian population.
