motivation in animal studies. A corresponding effect in humans would be important clinically, since anticholinergic drugs are frequently used in Parkinson’s disease, a condition that can also disrupt motivation. Reward and dopamine make us more ready to respond, as indexed by reaction times (RT), and move faster, sometimes termed vigour. These effects may be controlled by preparatory processes that can be tracked using electroencephalography (EEG). We measured vigour in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of trihexyphenidyl (THP), a muscarinic antagonist, with an incentivised eye movement task and EEG. Participants responded faster and with greater vigour when incentives were high, but THP blunted these motivational effects, suggesting that muscarinic receptors facilitate invigoration by reward. Preparatory EEG build-up (contingent negative variation [CNV]) was strengthened by high incentives and by muscarinic blockade, although THP reduced the incentive effect. The amplitude of preparatory activity predicted both vigour and RT, although over distinct scalp regions; frontal activity predicted vigour, whereas a larger, earlier, central component predicted RT. The incentivisation of RT was partly mediated by the CNV, though vigour was not. Moreover, the CNV mediated the drug’s effect on dampening incentives, suggesting that muscarinic receptors underlie the motivational influence on this preparatory activity. Taken together, these findings show that a muscarinic blocker impairs motivated action in healthy people, and that medial frontal preparatory neural activity mediates this for RT.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>motivation</kwd><kwd>vigour</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>saccade</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P00878X</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grogan</surname><given-names>John P</given-names></name><name><surname>Manohar</surname><given-names>Sanjay G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_ST_U16042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Swieten</surname><given-names>Maaike MH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100023262</institution-id><institution>Jon Moulton Charity Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillies</surname><given-names>Martin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000691</institution-id><institution>Academy of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manohar</surname><given-names>Sanjay G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Muscarinic antagonism is causally involved in motivation and incentivisation in healthy human participants, partially mediated via preparatory neural signatures, with implications for cholinergic treatment of Parkinson's disease.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Motivation is our ability to exert effort to obtain reward, and can be dramatically impacted in psychiatric and neurological disorders. One simple index of motivation is response vigour: an increase in movement speed with reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dudman and Krakauer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shadmehr et al., 2010</xref>). Motivation and the lack of motivation (apathy) have been linked to dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McGuigan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walton and Bouret, 2019</xref>), and accordingly, vigour is reduced in Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beierholm et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mazzoni et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zénon et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Striatal dopamine levels ramp up before potentially rewarding actions. Animal work demonstrates that acetylcholine controls these dopaminergic effects, via both firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Forster and Blaha, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mark et al., 2011</xref>) and local release in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cachope and Cheer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shen et al., 2007</xref>). These provide two mechanisms for acetylcholine to affect motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoebel et al., 2007</xref>), with muscarinic receptors in nucleus accumbens playing an important role in facilitating reward-related vigour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2016</xref>), possibly by potentiating dopamine release and affecting the frequency sensitivity of striatal dopaminergic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Threlfell et al., 2010</xref>). However, the ultimate effect of systemic muscarinic drugs on motivation is complex. Muscarinic antagonism has impaired motivation in some animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ostlund et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pratt and Kelley, 2004</xref>), while improving it in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hailwood et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nunes et al., 2013</xref>), and even less is known of how they affect humans. Pro-cholinergic drugs may ameliorate clinical apathy, a disabling symptom seen in around 50% of patients with Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Devos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fahed and Steffens, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pagonabarraga et al., 2015</xref>), yet cholinergic <italic>blockers</italic> are commonly used to treat the motor symptoms. This frequently puts clinicians in a dilemma when treating patients with both tremor, which responds well to anticholinergic drugs such as trihexyphenidyl (THP), but also apathy and cognitive impairment, which both respond to pro-cholinergic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bohnen et al., 2022</xref>). Distinguishing the mechanisms by which acetylcholine receptors contribute to movement and motivation will be critical for selecting appropriate treatments in these patients. A first step would be to test whether the effects of muscarinic blockade on motivation, observed in animals, generalise to humans.</p><p>Motivation influences action selection and movement invigoration based on the motivational state that is set up before the action. One potential mechanism of this may be preparatory activation of frontal premotor areas, which may be indexed on electroencephalography (EEG) by the contingent negative variation (CNV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Walter et al., 1964</xref>), a slow negative potential that appears between a warning stimulus and a prompt to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunia et al., 2012</xref>). Early models of the CNV proposed that it reflected cholinergic activity, modulated by dopamine, noradrenaline, and GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Timsit-Berthier, 1991</xref>). Supporting this, muscarinic antagonists were found to disrupt the CNV in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ebenezer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Papart et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pirch et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Papart et al., 1997</xref>). This anticipatory signal reflects preparatory activation of supplementary motor area and anterior cingulate, that can be amplified by reward signals from ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nagai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Plichta et al., 2013</xref>). As a marker of motivation, the CNV is of great clinical interest, being decreased by depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ansseau et al., 1985</xref>) and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ikeda et al., 1997</xref>), and conversely, increased by dopaminergic medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Linssen et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, the CNV is strengthened by monetary incentives dependent on performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berchio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Novak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Novak and Foti, 2015</xref>) and reward contingency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frömer et al., 2021</xref>). Changes in the CNV could therefore provide a mechanistic handle on the effect of drugs on motivation.</p><p>Here, we ask whether blocking muscarinic receptors would reduce motivation and increase distractibility in humans, and further, whether this is mediated by preparatory activity in medial frontal areas. To test this, we measured the CNV in healthy adults after administration of an anti-muscarinic M1 receptor (M1r) acetylcholine antagonist (THP) or placebo (double-blinded), while they performed an incentivised eye movement task. We used a task that independently measured action selection and energisation, which may involve different neural mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>After fixating on one of three circles, participants heard an incentive cue stating the maximum reward available for the trial (50p or 0p), and 1500 ms after a preparation cue they made a saccade towards the circle that dimmed, and received a proportion of the maximum reward depending on their speed. On half of the trials, the non-target circle lit up, presenting a high-salience distractor. Participants completed this task once after receiving THP (M1r antimuscarinic acetylcholine antagonist) and once after placebo (double-blinded), and we measured saccade initiation times, velocity, and the pull of the distractor on the saccade trajectory, along with EEG.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Acetylcholine modulates invigoration by incentives</title><p>We measured vigour as the residual peak velocity of saccades within each drug session (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and Methods/Eye-tracking), which is each trial’s deviation of velocity from the main sequence. This removes any overall effects of the drug on saccade velocity, while still allowing incentives and distractors to have different effects within each drug condition. We used single-trial mixed-effects linear regression (20 participants, 18,585 trials in total) to assess the effects of incentive, distractors, and THP, along with all the interactions of these (and a random intercept per participant), on residual velocity and saccadic RT. As predicted, residual peak velocity was increased by incentives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>; β=0.1266, p&lt;0.0001), while distractors slightly slowed residual velocity (β=–0.0158, p=0.0294; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for full behavioural statistics). THP decreased the effect of incentives on velocity (incentive * THP: β=–0.0216, p=0.0030), indicating that muscarinic blockade diminished motivation by incentives. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> shows that this effect was similar in distractor absent/present trials, although slightly stronger when the distractor was absent; the three-way (distractor*incentive*THP) interaction was not significant (p&gt;0.05), suggesting that the distractor-present trials had the same effect but weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Trihexyphenidyl (THP) modulates saccadic measures.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Trial structure for a high incentive trial with a salient distractor.

Additionally, the THP*incentive interactions were correlated between saccadic RT and residual velocity at the participant level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cholinergic blockade increases distractibility</title><p>We measured distractibility as the angular deviation of the eye position away from the target’s orientation towards the distractor’s location, at the start of the saccade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), which indicates the pull of the distractor. The distribution of distractor pull is bimodal, with saccades directed towards either the target or distractor locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). When the distractor did not light up, the mean distractor angle was negative (i.e. away from the distractor angle), indicating repulsion away from the angle of the distractor, whereas when the distractor lit up and was salient the mean angle was biased towards the distractor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; β=0.2446, p&lt;0.0001; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Single-trial linear mixed-effects regression found that THP increased the pull (main effect of drug, β=0.0283, p&lt;0.0001), but only when the distractor was salient (THP*distractor, β=0.0226, p=0.0012, pairwise drug effect: distractor absent: p&gt;0.3; present: β=0.0511, p&lt;0.0001).

However, when the distractor did light up, distractor pull was positive (single-trial linear mixed-effects regression; β=0.2446, p&lt;0.0001), reflecting a bias towards it, and this bias was greater on trihexyphenidyl (THP) than placebo (distractor*THP interaction: β=0.0226, p=0.0012; full statistics are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

strengthened the CNV, and the incentive*THP interaction was only seen on the CNV in the same direction as that seen with the vigour and RT – THP reduced the incentive effect. Thus, although the drug and reward both increased the CNV build-up, the drug reduced the reward effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Neural preparation predicts RT and distraction</title><p>We regressed the mean amplitude of the pre-preparation activity, P3a and CNV against velocity, RT, and distractor pull (including incentive, distractor, and drug conditions as covariates), and Bonferroni-corrected the p-values for nine multiple comparisons.

We regressed each electrode and time-point against the three behavioural variables separately, while controlling for effects of incentive, distractor, THP, the interactions of those factors, and a random effect of participant. This analysis therefore asks whether trial-to-trial neural variability predicts behavioural variability.

Finally, we ask whether the neural activity can <italic>explain</italic> the effects of incentives and THP, through mediation analyses. We used the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron and Kenny, 1986</xref>, method to assess mediation (see Methods/Analysis for full details). This tests whether the significant incentive effect on behaviour could be partially reduced (i.e. explained) by including the CNV as a mediator in a mixed-effects single-trial regression. We measured mediation as the reduction in (absolute) beta-coefficient for the incentive effect on behaviour when the CNV was included as a mediator (i.e. RT ~ 1 + incentive + CNV + incentive*CNV + (1 | participant)). This is a directional hypothesis of a reduced effect, and to assess significance we ran a permutation test, shuffling the CNV within participants, and measuring the change in absolute beta-coefficient for the incentive effect on behaviour. This generates a distribution of mediation effects where there is no relationship between CNV and RT on a trial (i.e. a null distribution). We ran 2500 permutations, and calculated the proportion with an equal or more negative change in absolute beta-coefficient, equivalent to a one-tailed test. We ran this mediation analysis separately for the two behavioural variables of RT and residual velocity, but not for distractor pull as it was not affected by incentive, so failed the assumptions of mediation analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron and Kenny, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muller et al., 2005</xref>).

We assessed the significance of this change via permutation testing, shuffling the CNV across trials (within participants) and calculating the change in absolute beta-coefficient for the incentive effect on RT when the permuted CNV was included as a mediator. We repeated this 2500 times to build a null distribution of Δβ, and calculated the proportion with equal or stronger reductions for a one-tailed p-value, which was highly significant (p&lt;0.0001). This suggests that the incentive effect on RT is partially mediated by the CNV’s amplitude during the preparation period, and this is not the case for residual velocity.</p><p>We also investigated whether the CNV could explain the cholinergic reduction in motivation (THP*incentive interaction) on RT – i.e., whether CNV mediated the THP moderation. We measured mediated moderation as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muller et al., 2005</xref>; see Methods/Analysis for full explanation: incentive*THP was associated with RT (β=0.0222, t(1,16,474)=3.8272, p=0.0001); and incentive*THP was associated with CNV (β=0.1619, t(1,16,474)=2.1671, p=0.0302); and CNV*THP was associated with RT (β=0.0014, t(1,16,472)=2.4061, p=0.0161). Mediated moderation was measured by the change in absolute incentive*THP effect when THP*CNV was included in the mixed-effects model (β=0.0214, t(1,16,472)=3.7298, p=0.0002; change in beta-coefficient: Δβ=–0.0008), and permutation testing (permuting the CNV as above) found a weakly significant effect (p=0.0132). This indicates cholinergic blockade changes how incentives affect preparatory negativity, and how this negativity reflects RT, which can explain some of the reduced invigoration of RT. However, this was not observed for saccade velocity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>When incentivised, participants initiated movements faster, and with faster velocity, but these motivational effects were reduced by blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors with THP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>). THP also reduced repulsion away from a salient distractor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The CNV, a fronto-central signal believed to reflect premotor preparatory activation, was stronger when incentives were present, and with THP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), and crucially, THP reduced the incentive benefit on CNV, mirroring the behavioural effects. Neural preparation predicted RT and distractibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>), with distinct scalp distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–c</xref>). The CNV partially mediated the incentivisation of RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), and could explain the drug-induced reduction in incentivisation of RT via a mediated moderation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). No such associations were seen in the window before the preparation cue onset, suggesting these effects relate specifically to preparing motivated action, rather than simply an incentive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and e</xref>). These results demonstrate a role of acetylcholine, and specifically muscarinic M1 receptors (M1rs), in motivation in humans.</p><p>Our behavioural measure of vigour was residual peak saccadic velocity, calculated separately within the drug and placebo sessions, and thus accounting for any overall drug effects on saccadic velocity or amplitude (or the linear relationship between the two, i.e. the main sequence). Previous studies have found this measure highly sensitive to incentivisation and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grogan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manohar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Muhammed et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muhammed et al., 2018</xref>), with higher peak velocities than expected for a saccade of that amplitude, the same pattern seen here, and that was reduced when M1rs were antagonised. As antagonising M1rs reduced the incentivisation of residual peak velocity and saccadic RT, we can assume that M1rs normally play a facilitating role. This mirrors some studies using antimuscarinics in animal striatum to impair motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ostlund et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pratt and Kelley, 2004</xref>), although those studies used scopolamine which antagonises M1-like and M2-like receptors, so effects may have been due to M2r antagonism. This complements previous work demonstrating that nicotine increases reward responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) by enhancing striatal anticipatory activity. Basal ganglia outputs, along with cholinergic activity from the pedunculopontine nucleus, project to the superior colliculus to disinhibit saccade initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kobayashi and Isa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Naicker et al., 2017</xref>) and also modulate ongoing instantaneous firing that controls velocity during saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smalianchuk et al., 2018</xref>). This offers potential mechanisms for muscarinic receptors to influence movement vigour, together with other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, implicated in incentivisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manohar et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The three different ERPs used here reported differing effects: the incentive-cue response was affected by the drug but not by the incentive itself; the P3a was decreased by higher incentives but not affected by the drug; the CNV was the only one affected by both incentives and the drug, and showing an interaction of the two. The specificity to the CNV suggests that M1r antagonism is reducing incentivisation during the action-preparation process, and not affecting the overall sensitivity to the incentive. The CNV in the lead up to the target appearing was strengthened by the incentives, replicating previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frömer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Novak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Novak and Foti, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schevernels et al., 2014</xref>). M1r antagonism reduced the effect of incentives on CNV, mirroring the reduced incentivisation on RT and residual velocity. This suggests that cholinergic transmission is needed at an early stage of motivational preparation. CNV amplitude predicted RT, along with distractor pull, and frontal activity in this same time-window predicted residual velocity, aligning with recent studies linking CNV to RT and accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frömer et al., 2021</xref>), and to incentivisation of effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berchio et al., 2019</xref>). Our associations held up even when controlling for the other behavioural variables, suggesting they were not due to factors such as the negative correlation of RT and velocity. Together these findings suggest that incentives determine a baseline level of motivation, dependent on acetylcholine, that is integrated while we decide to act, thus influencing the speed of action initiation.</p><p>The CNV has been linked to activity in the supplementary motor area and cingulate cortex, dependent on inputs from ventral striatum and thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nagai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Plichta et al., 2013</xref>), and on a range of neurotransmitters including dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Linssen et al., 2011</xref>) which also modulates motivational effects on vigour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grogan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Manohar and Husain, 2015</xref>). Therefore a potential mechanism for our observed effects is that M1r activation in the striatum modulates the excitability of striatal pathways, and increases dopamine release as seen in animal work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Klippel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galarraga et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shen et al., 2005</xref>). Striatal muscarinic receptors could signal the pre-action, pre-decision level of motivation in humans.</p><p>No cognitive or computational model currently exists of how cholinergic modulation of dopamine affects aspects of motivation and motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grahek et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies have proposed that dopamine signals reward expectation which allows more cognitive and motor costs to be paid, in the form of both vigour and cognitive precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ott and Nieder, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Westbrook et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, acetylcholine has often been framed as increasing signal-to-noise ratio or amplifying attention in cortical processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cragg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laube et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sarter et al., 2006</xref>). While a unified quantitative model will need considerable work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cools and Arnsten, 2022</xref>), our data contribute by demonstrating that more than one locus of effect is likely.</p><p>The mediation analysis showed the incentivisation of RT could be partially explained by stronger CNV amplitudes, as could the antimuscarinic reduction in incentivisation. This mediated moderation was due to both reduced incentivisation of the CNV and reduced influence of the CNV on RT. These effects were rather small, which suggests the presence of an additional direct way for drug to affect incentivisation, perhaps via subcortical routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Faure et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mena-Segovia et al., 2008</xref>) which could not be indexed by the ERPs in our study. There were no such mediations to explain the incentivisation of residual velocity, suggesting the CNV is not associated with the motivational preparation of <italic>motor</italic> speed of saccades. Animal studies link saccadic velocity to the instantaneous firing rate in the superior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smalianchuk et al., 2018</xref>), which is inaccessible to EEG recordings, although the motivational modulation of this activity presumably arises from cortex or basal ganglia. Future investigations of other aspects of the EEG signals may illuminate us. Such studies could also investigate other potential signals that may be more sensitive to invigoration and/or muscarinic antagonism, including frequency-band power and phase coherence, or measures of variability in brain signals such as entropy, which may give greater insight into processes affected by these factors.</p><p>One potentially confusing finding is that although stronger CNV benefits RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frömer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Novak and Foti, 2015</xref>), M1r antagonism strengthened the CNV while <italic>slowing</italic> RT. The mediated moderation we found indicates that THP changes how CNV predicts RT, which suggests that THP has two effects: one upstream of the CNV strengthening anticipation, and one downstream, decreasing the coupling to RT. The former could be associated with ventral striatal drive to the CNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Plichta et al., 2013</xref>), while the latter could reflect drug-induced changes in non-motivational cholinergic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gritton et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While we have interpreted these effects as due to incentivisation, other closely related factors cannot be ruled out. When incentivised on this task, people expend more effort and also have a higher expectation of reward, which is linked to the effort they expend. Therefore, it is possible that the CNV is measuring the greater expected reward induced by motivation, which is linked to faster saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shadmehr et al., 2019</xref>). The fact that no associations were seen between behaviour and neural activity in the time-window before the preparation cue might suggest that factors such as expected reward or arousal are less likely to explain our results. However, these explanations cannot be fully disentangled in this paradigm. We found that M1r antagonism led to a greater bias of distractor pull angles towards a salient distractor, which was unaffected by incentives. This fits with previous studies finding cholinergic involvement in attention and distraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fallon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gritton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laube et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sarter et al., 2016</xref>). However, we did <italic>not</italic> observe clear motivational improvements in distractibility, which have been seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hickey and van Zoest, 2012</xref>). This may be less surprising considering that the speed-accuracy trade-off dictates worse accuracy for faster saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reppert et al., 2018</xref>) which is sensitive to the rewards available for responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hickey and van Zoest, 2012</xref>). Any motivational distraction effects might be weak in this study because the incentive schedule strongly favoured faster responses, and distractors were only present on half the trials, reducing the value of greater cognitive control. The repulsive bias away from the distractor was weakened by THP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), which may be a behavioural manifestation of reduced reactive top-down control reported with muscarinic antagonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laube et al., 2017</xref>). But in our data, the distractor pull could be predicted by preparatory activity over 1 s before the target onset, and this was also affected by muscarinic blockade. The frontal signature of distractor pull was distinct to the pattern predicting RT, suggesting that cholinergic effects on proactive control and speed are dissociable.</p><p>Care should be taken when interpreting a lack of effects in this study, given the reduced power due to a smaller than expected sample size. This may be more applicable to the whole-brain regressions and the mediation analysis, so future replications would be useful to verify these results. Additionally, as this study only tested young men, it is not known how generalisable the findings are to older adults, who may have age-induced changes in their cholinergic function, or indeed to patients with Parkinson’s disease, who have additional dopaminergic deficits. Recent work showed that cholinesterase inhibitor withdrawal in patients with Parkinson’s disease impaired a range of attentional and memory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fallon et al., 2023</xref>), and investigating motivational impairments would be useful too. The effects of acetylcholine on motivation are of crucial importance in Parkinson’s disease, where the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pisani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>), leading to apathy or impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Devos et al., 2014</xref>). As THP is often used to treat tremor in Parkinson’s disease, the finding that it impairs motivation suggests that it may worsen motivational symptoms in a population already troubled by apathy.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Muscarinic M1r antagonism reduced the incentivisation of saccadic peak velocity and RT, suggesting that normally M1r activity is important for motivation. The incentives strengthened the CNV, a preparatory EEG component, and this mediated the incentivisation of RT and the reduction of this incentivisation by the drug, implicating the CNV as a potential marker of muscarinic invigoration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Design</title><p>We used a randomised, counterbalanced, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of THP. Participants were tested twice (minimum 1 week separation), once on placebo, and once on THP, making this a within-subject study. Ethical approval was granted by the University of Oxford MSIDREC (R45265/RE001).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Drugs</title><p>Participants were administered 2 mg THP or 200 mg lactose pills, both encapsulated in a digestible shell, and labelled A and B by a colleague not involved in the study. Participants were randomised to receive either tablet A or B on their first session, and B or A on their second. The experimenters did not know whether A or B contained the drug until all data were collected and pre-processed. On arrival, we checked participants felt well, and administered the dose. Testing began 1.5–2 hr later.</p><p>The risks of THP in pregnancy are unknown, but the Summary Product of Characteristics states that it ‘should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary’. As this was a basic research study with no immediate clinical applications, there was no justification for any risk of administering the drug during pregnancy, so we only recruited male participants to keep this risk at zero.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Participants</title><p>Our sample size calculations suggested 27 participants would detect a 0.5 effect size with 0.05 sensitivity and 0.8 power. We recruited 27 male participants (see Drugs section above), but due to the pandemic, we had to halt the study part-way, with 20 completed participants and 5 participants who had completed one session only. We only analysed the 20 completed participants, which achieved a post hoc power of 0.7. The mean age was 28.15 years (SD = 8.03 years).</p><p>Participants read the information sheet, and gave written informed consent. Participants were screened for contraindications (e.g. cardiovascular disease, hypo/hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, kidney/liver disease, psychiatric conditions, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, glaucoma, epilepsy, lactose hypersensitivity, porphyria) for the drug and placebo, and 1-lead ECG was taken to check for prolonged QTc interval of over 480 ms. A medical doctor checked all this information before the participant was admitted to the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Task</title><p>To measure invigoration of saccades by incentives, we adapted an incentivised saccade task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Manohar and Husain, 2015</xref>), where participants had to make speeded saccades to a low-salience target in exchange for money, while avoiding a high-salience distractor. The task was run in Matlab R2018b and Psychtoolbox-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kleiner et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Participants saw three grey circles each with a black fixation cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) on a black screen (11° apart), and had to fixate on the one that turned pink after 500 ms (+0–100 ms jitter) for 300 ms. An audio <italic>incentive cue</italic> was played 200 ms after fixation, 1100 ms duration, of a voice saying ‘50p maximum’ or ‘0p maximum’ to indicate the maximum money available on this trial. Fixation was checked again after this to ensure fixation (300 ms + 100 ms wait), and then the black fixation cross turned white. This was the <italic>preparation cue</italic>, which occurred 1500 ms before the target onset. Then, one of the other two circles dimmed, indicating it was the target, and on 50% of trials the other circle simultaneously brightened, as a salient distractor. Participants were rewarded a proportion of the incentive based on how quickly they looked at the target circle, with an adaptive reward rule that had an exponential fall-off depending on the average RT in the previous up to 20 trials. This kept the rewards received roughly constant over the task. If participants looked at the distractor, they would need to make a corrective eye movement to the target, which would slow the time to reach the target, and result in less reward. Once gaze reached the target, a feedback sound was played if a medium (10–30p) or large (&gt;30p) reward was obtained, while the value of reward earned flashed in the centre of the target circle for 800 ms. A 1100 ms (+0–100 ms jitter) rest period followed each trial, where participants were allowed to blink. The target on one trial became the fixation location for the next trial.</p><p>There were thus four trial types, with two maximum incentive levels (50p or 0p) and the presence or absence of a distractor. There were six of each trial in a block, giving 24 trials, and 20 blocks (480 trials in total; 120 per condition). Participants could pause as long as they liked between blocks, with a minimum 4 s break. The first trial of each block also had an extra 4 s rest period before the trial began to ensure participants were settled and ready.</p><p>Participants were given 24 practice trials during the screening visit and before the main task on each main visit. These included an extra fixation check during the 1500 ms delay between the preparation cue and target onset, and if they moved their eye more than 1° during this time, the trial was flagged for repetition and the experimenter asked them to maintain fixation better. This training improved fixation during piloting.</p><p>In addition to this task, two other tasks were performed that are not reported in this paper, including a working memory task and a reversal learning task. We asked participants to rate how they felt on a visual analogue scale before and after the tasks, and participants also performed a pro- and anti-saccade task, and measurement of the pupillary light reflex.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Eye-tracking</title><p>We tracked participants’ eyes with an EyeLink 2000 (SR Research) at 1000 Hz. Participants were seated 75 cm from the screen, with their head on a chin-rest and forehead-rest. Nine-point calibration was performed at the start of the task, and one-point validation was done at the start of each block, with re-calibrations if necessary. Stimuli were shown on an ASUS VG248Qe3D screen (53×30 cm, 1920×1080 pixels, 60 Hz).</p><p>Saccades were parsed with standard criteria (velocity &gt;30°s<sup>–1</sup>, acceleration &gt;8000°s<sup>–2</sup>). We took the first saccade over 1° in amplitude within 100–900 ms after the target onset, and calculated velocity with a sliding window of 4 ms, excluding segments faster than 3000°s<sup>–1</sup> or where eye-tracking was lost. Saccades with peak velocities outside 50–1600°s<sup>–1</sup> were excluded.</p><p>Saccadic velocity is correlated with the amplitude of the saccade, an effect known as the main sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahill et al., 1975</xref>), and saccade amplitude can also be affected by reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grogan et al., 2020</xref>). To remove the effect of amplitude on velocity, we regressed peak velocity against amplitude within each participant and drug session, combining across incentive level and distractor level, and took the residual peak velocity for each individual trial as our main measure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This reflects the difference between the velocity measured and the velocity predicted by the main sequence, with positive values meaning faster than expected velocity. By calculating velocity residuals for each drug condition separately, this method removes any overall effects of the drug on velocity or amplitude, and instead measures individual trial variations within that drug condition. Velocity residuals have previously been shown to be most sensitive to reward manipulations of vigour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blundell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grogan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manohar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manohar et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Saccadic RT was taken as the time between target onset and the start of the saccade (as detected by EyeLink velocity and acceleration criteria; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) in ms; we used log RT for the analyses but plot raw RT. Distractor pull was measured as the angular deviation of the eye from a straight line linking the fixation and target circles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) when it left the fixation circle; positive values reflected a bias towards the distractor, while negative values reflected a bias away from the distractor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>EEG acquisition and pre-processing</title><p>We recorded EEG with a Refa72 amplifier (TMSi, B.v Netherlands) at 1024 Hz and using OpenVibe software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Renard et al., 2010</xref>). We used a 64-channel cap (TMSi). The ground was placed on the left clavicle, and we recorded horizontal EOG with bipolar electrodes placed either side of the eyes. Due to the cap, we could not place an EOG electrode above the eye, so one was placed 1 cm under the left eye, and this was converted into a bipolar EOG signal as the difference from electrode FP1, which was the closest cap electrode to the left eye. Impedances were kept below 10 kΩ as it was a high-impedance system.</p><p>Data were processed with custom Matlab scripts, and EEGLab and ERPLab toolboxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delorme and Makeig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lopez-Calderon and Luck, 2014</xref>). Channels were referenced to the average of the two mastoid electrodes A1+A2, and synchronised with the eye-tracking traces using the EYE-EEG toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dimigen et al., 2011</xref>). Data were band-pass filtered at 0.1–80 Hz with an IIR Butterworth filter, notch filtered at 50 Hz with a stop-band Parks-McClellan filter, and down-sampled to 256 Hz.</p><p>Epochs were from –200:1500 ms around the preparation cue onset, and were baselined to the 100 ms before the preparation cue appeared. Visual inspection found no channels with outlying variance, so no channel rejection or interpolation was performed. We rejected trials from the EEG analyses where participants blinked or made saccades (according to EyeLink criteria above) during the epoch, or where EEG voltage in any channel was outside –200:200 μV (muscle activity). On average 104/120 trials per condition per person were included (SD = 21, range = 21–120), and 831/960 trials in total per person (SD = 160, range = 313–954). A repeated-measures ANOVA found there were no significant differences in number of trials excluded for any condition (p&gt;0.2).</p><p>We took the late CNV period (1200:1500 ms) at electrode Cz as our a priori region of interest, along with the cue-P3 (200–280 ms). In order to see whether our results were specific to preparatory activity, we looked at activity before the preparation cue began, and looked at the late ERP to the incentive cue. We epoched the data from –200:1100 ms around the incentive cue onset (which was the duration of the incentive cue), and used the same artefact rejection criteria as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis</title><p>Behavioural and EEG analysis included all 20 participants, although trials with EEG artefacts were included in the behavioural analyses (18,585 trials in total) and not the EEG analyses (16,627 trials in total), to increase power in the former.

We z-scored all factors to give standardised beta-coefficients.</p><p>For the difference-wave cluster-based permutation tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), we used the DMGroppe Mass Univariate toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groppe et al., 2011</xref>), with 2500 permutations, to control the FWER at 0.05. This was used for looking at difference waves to test the effects of incentive, THP, and the incentive*THP interaction (using difference of difference waves), across all EEG electrodes.</p><p>We adapted this toolbox to also run cluster-based permutation regressions to examine the relationship between the behavioural variables and the voltages at all EEG electrodes at each time-point. On each iteration we shuffled the voltages across trials within each condition and person, and regressed it against the behavioural variable, with the model ‘~1 + voltage + incentive*distractorPresent*THP + (1 | participant)’. The voltage term measured the association between voltage and the behavioural variable, after controlling for effects of incentive*distractor*THP on behaviour. By shuffling the voltages, we removed the relationship to the behavioural variable, to build the null distribution of t-statistics across electrodes and time samples. We used the ‘cluster mass’ method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullmore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groppe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>) to build the null distribution, and calculated the p-value as the proportion of this distribution further from zero than the true t-statistics (two-tailed test).

We used permutation testing to quantify the likelihood of finding these mediations under the null hypothesis, achieved by shuffling the ERP across trials (within each participant) to remove any link between the ERP and behaviour. We repeated this 2500 times to build a null distribution of the change in absolute beta-coefficients for the RT ~ incentive effect when this permuted mediator was included (model #3 vs model #1). We calculated a one-tailed p-value by finding the proportion of the null distribution that was equal or more negative than the true value (as mediation is a one-tailed prediction). For this mediation analysis, we only included trials with valid ERP measures, even for the models without the ERP included (e.g. model #1), to keep the trial numbers and degrees of freedom the same.</p><p>Mediated moderation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muller et al., 2005</xref>) was used to see whether the effect of THP (the moderator) on behaviour is mediated by the ERP, with the following tests (after the previous mediation tests were already satisfied):</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>THP moderates the incentive effect, via a significant treatment*moderator interaction on the outcome (RT ~1 + incentive + THP + incentive*THP + (1 | participant)).</p></list-item><list-item><p>THP moderates the incentive effect on the mediator, via a treatment*moderator interaction on the outcome (ERP ~1 + incentive +THP + incentive*THP + (1 | participant)).</p></list-item><list-item><p>THP’s moderation of the incentive effect is mediated by the ERP, via a reduction in the association of treatment*moderator on the outcome when the treatment*moderator interaction is included (RT ~1 + incentive + THP + incentive*THP + ERP + ERP*THP + (1 | participant)).</p></list-item></list><p>Mediated moderation is measured as the reduction in absolute beta-coefficients for ‘RT ~ incentive*THP’ between model #5 and #7, which captures how much of this interaction could be explained by including the mediator*moderator interaction (ERP*THP in model #7).

We calculated a one-tailed p-value from the proportion of these that were equal or more negative than the true change.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Participants read the information sheet, and gave written informed consent before starting the study.

In one place, the authors state:</p><p>On each iteration we shuffled the voltages across trials within each condition and person, and regressed it against the behavioural variable, with the model 'variable ~1 + voltage + incentive*distractorPresent*THP + (1 | participant)'.</p><p>I take this to mean that the regression model includes a voltage regressor and a three-way interaction term, along with participant level intercept terms.</p><p>However, elsewhere, the authors state:</p><p>&quot;We regressed each electrode and time-point against the three behavioural variables separately, while controlling for effects of incentive, distractor, THP, the interactions of those factors, and a random effect of participant.&quot;</p><p>I take this to mean that the regression model included regressors for incentive, distractorPresent, THP, along with their 2 and 3 way interactions.

They also simultaneously recorded neural activity using EEG with event-related potential (ERP) focused analyses. This study provides evidence that the muscarinic antagonist Trihexyphenidyl (THP) modulates the motivational effects of reward on both saccade velocity and RT, and also increases the distractibility of participants. The study also examined the correlational relationships between reaction time and vigor and manipulations (THP, incentives) with components of the EEG-derived ERPs. While an interesting correlation structure emerged from the analyses relating the ERP biomarkers to behavior, it is unclear how these potentially epiphenomenal biomarkers relate to relevant underlying neurophysiology.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study is a logical translational extension from preclinical findings of cholinergic modulation of motivation and vigor and the CNV biomarker to a normative human population, utilizing a placebo-controlled, double-blind approach.</p><p>While framed in the context of Parkinson's disease where cholinergic medications can be used, the authors do a good job in the discussion describing the limitations in generalizing their findings obtained in a normative and non-age-matched cohort to an aged PD patient population.</p><p>The exploratory analyses suggest alternative brain targets and/or ERP components that relate to the behavior and manipulations tested. These will need to be further validated in an adequately powered study. Once validated, the most relevant biomarkers could be assessed in a more clinically relevant population.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The relatively weak correlations between the main experimental outcomes provide unclear insight into the neural mechanisms by which the manipulations lead to behavioral manifestations outside the context of the ERP. It would have been interesting to evaluate how other quantifications of the EEG signal through time-frequency analyses relate to the behavioral outcomes and manipulations.</p><p>The ERP correlations to relevant behavioral outcomes were not consistent across manipulations demonstrating they are not reliable biomarkers to behavior but do suggest that multiple underlying mechanisms can give rise to the same changes in the ERP-based biomarkers and lead to different behavioral outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their review and their comments.</p><p>We agree that these ERPs may not be reliable biomarkers yet, given the many-to-one mapping we observed where incentives and THP antagonism both affected the CNV in different ways, and hope that future studies will help clarify the use and limitations of the CNV as a potential biomarker of invigoration.</p><p>Our original hypothesis was specifically about the CNV as an index of preparatory behaviour, but we plan to look at potential changes to frequency characteristics in future work. We have included this in the discussion of future investigations. (page 16, line 428):</p><p>“Future investigations of other aspects of the EEG signals may illuminate us. Such studies could also investigate other potential signals that may be more sensitive to invigoration and/or muscarinic antagonism, including frequency-band power and phase-coherence, or measures of variability in brain signals such as entropy, which may give greater insight into processes affected by these factors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work by Grogan and colleagues aimed to translate animal studies showing that acetylcholine plays a role in motivation by modulating the effects of dopamine on motivation.

Trihexyphenidyl is categorized by the FDA as a Pregnancy Category Class C drug, and the ‘Summary of Product Characteristics’ states: “There is inadequate information regarding the use of trihexyphenidyl in pregnancy. Animal studies are insufficient with regard to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition and postnatal development. The potential risk for humans is unknown. Trihexyphenidyl should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.”</p><p>While the drug can be prescribed where benefits may outweigh this risk, as there were no benefits to participants in this study, we only recruited men to keep the risk at zero.</p><p>We have updated the Methods/Drugs section to explain this (page 17, line 494):</p><p>“The risks of Trihexyphenidyl in pregnancy are unknown, but the Summary Product of Characteristics states that it “should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary”. As this was a basic research study with no immediate clinical applications, there was no justification for any risk of administering the drug during pregnancy, so we only recruited male participants to keep this risk at zero.”</p><p>And we reference to this in the Methods/Participants section (page 18, line 501):</p><p>“We recruited 27 male participants (see Drugs section above),…”</p><p>We agree that future work is needed to replicate this in different samples, and that this work cannot tell us the mechanism by which the drug is dampening invigoration, but we think that showing these effects do occur and can be linked to anticipatory/preparatory activity rather than overall reward sensitivity is a useful finding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Grogan et al examine a role for muscarinic receptor activation in action vigor in a saccadic system.

Blinks) or in preparation for an upcoming saccade.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for re-reviewing the manuscript and for raising this issue.</p><p>All the EEG analyses (both ERP and whole-brain) are analysing the preparation period between the ready-cue and target appearance when no eye-movements are required. We reject trials with blinks or saccades over 1 degree in size, as detected by the Eyelink software according the sensitive velocity and acceleration criteria specified in the manuscript (Methods/Eye-tracking, page 19, line 550). This means that there should be no overt eye movements in the data. However, microsaccades and ocular drift are still possible within this period, which indeed could drive some effects. To measure this, we counted the number of microsaccades (&lt;1 degree in size) in the preparation period between incentive cue and the target onset, for each trial. Further, we measure the mean absolute speed of the eye during the preparation period (excluding the periods during microsaccades) for each trial.</p><p>We have run a control analysis to check whether including ocular drift speed or number of microsaccades as a covariate in the whole-brain regression analysis changes the association between EEG and the behavioural metrics at frontal or other electrodes. Below we show these ‘variable ~ EEG’ beta-coefficients when controlling for each eye-movement covariate, in the same format as Figure 4. We did not run the permutation testing on this due to time/computational costs (it takes &gt;1 week per variable), so p-values were not calculated, only the beta-coefficients. The beta-coefficients are almost unchanged, both in time-course and topography, when controlling for either covariate. The frontal associations to velocity and distractor pull remain, suggesting they are not due to these eye movements.</p><p>We have added this figure as a supplemental figure.</p><p>For additional clarity in this response, we also plot the differences between these covariate-controlled beta-coefficients, and the true beta-coefficients from figure 4 (please note the y-axis scales are -0.02:0.02, not -0.15:0.15 as in Figure 4 and Figure 4-figure supplement 2). This shows that the changes to the associations between EEG and velocity/distractor-pull were not frontally-distributed, demonstrating eye-movements were not driving these effects. Relatedly, the RT effect’s change was frontally-distributed, despite Figure 4 showing the true relationship was central in focus, again indicating that effect was also not related to these eye movements.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Difference in beta-coefficients when eye-movement covariates are included.</title><p>This is the difference from the beta-coefficients shown in Figure 4, please note the smaller y-axis limits.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98922-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The same pattern was seen if we controlled for the change in eye-position from the baseline period (measured by the eye-tracker) at each specific time-point, i.e., controlling for the distance the eye had moved from baseline at the time the EEG voltage is measured.

The authors address the sample size in several places and I completely understand the reason for the reduced sample size (study halt due to COVID). That said, they only report the sample size in one place in the methods rather than through degrees of freedom in their statistical tests conducted throughout the results. In part because of this, I am not totally clear on whether the sample size for each analysis is the same - or whether participants were removed for specific analyses (ie. due to poor EEG recordings, for example).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the lack of clarity here. All 20 participants were included in all analyses, although the number of trials included differed between behavioural and EEG analyses. We only excluded trials with EEG artefacts from the EEG analyses, not from the purely behavioural analyses such as Figures 1&amp;2, although trials with blinks/saccades were removed from behavioural analyses too. Removing the EEG artefactual trials from the behavioural analyses did not change the findings, despite the lower power. The degrees of freedom in the figure supplement tables are the total number of trials (less 8 fixed-effect terms) included in the single-trial / trial-wise regression analyses we used.</p><p>We have clarified this in the Methods/Analysis (page 20, line 602):</p><p>“Behavioural and EEG analysis included all 20 participants, although trials with EEG artefacts were included in the behavioural analyses (18585 trials in total) and not the EEG analyses (16627 trials in total), to increase power in the former.

This is likely because that while that participant did have slower RTs for higher incentives on THP, they were also slower for higher incentives under placebo (and similarly for distractor present/absent), making them less of an outlier in terms of effects than in raw RT terms.

Furthermore, the methods should also describe how mediation was tested statistically (ie. What is the null distribution that the difference in coefficients with/without moderator is tested against?).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a more detailed explanation of how we investigated mediation and mediated moderation, and now report the mediation effects for all tests run and the permutation-test p-values.</p><p>We had been using the Baron &amp; Kenny (1986) method, based on 4 tests outlined in the updated text below, which gives a single measure of change in absolute beta-coefficients when all the tests have been met, but without any indication of significance; any reduction found after meeting the other 3 tests indicates a partial mediation under this method. We now use permutation testing to generate a p-value for the likelihood of finding an equal or larger reduction in the absolute beta-coefficients if the CNV were not truly related to RT. This found that the CNV’s mediation of the Incentive effect on RT was highly significant, while the Mediated Moderation of CNV on THP*Incentive was weakly significant.</p><p>During this re-analysis, we noticed that we had different trial-numbers in the different regression models, as EEG-artefactual trials were not excluded from the behavioural-only model (‘RT ~ 1 + Incentive’). However, this causes issues with the permutation testing as we are shuffling the ERPs and need the same trials included in all the mixed-effects models. Therefore, we have redone these mediation analyses, including only the trials with valid ERP measures (i.e. no artefactual trials) in all models. This has changed the beta-coefficients we report, but not the findings or conclusions of the mediation analyses. We have updated the figure to have these new statistics.</p><p>We have updated the text to explain the methodology in the Results section (page 12, line 284):</p><p>“We have found that neural preparatory activity can predict residual velocity and RT, and is also affected by incentives and THP. Finally, we ask whether the neural activity can <italic>explain</italic> the effects of incentives and THP, through mediation analyses. We used the Baron &amp; Kenny (1986) method to assess mediation (see Methods/Analysis for full details). This tests whether the significant Incentive effect on behaviour could be partially reduced (i.e., explained) by including the CNV as a mediator in a mixed-effects single-trial regression. We measured mediation as the reduction in (absolute) beta-coefficient for the incentive effect on behaviour when the CNV was included as a mediator (i.e., RT ~ 1 + Incentive + CNV + Incentive*CNV + (1 | participant)). This is a directional hypothesis of a reduced effect, and to assess significance we ran a permutation-test, shuffling the CNV within participants, and measuring the change in absolute beta-coefficient for the Incentive effect on behaviour. This generates a distribution of mediation effects where there is no relationship between CNV and RT on a trial (i.e., a null distribution). We ran 2500 permutations, and calculated the proportion with an equal or more negative change in absolute beta-coefficient, equivalent to a one-tailed test. We ran this mediation analysis separately for the two behavioural variables of RT and residual velocity, but not for distractor pull as it was not affected by incentive, so failed the assumptions of mediation analyses (Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986; Muller et al., 2005). We took the mean CNV amplitude from 1200:1500ms as our Mediator.</p><p>Residual velocity passed all the assumption tests for Mediation analysis, but no significant mediation was found. That is, Incentive predicted velocity (β=0.1304, t(1,16476)=17.3280, p&lt;.0001); Incentive predicted CNV (β=-0.9122, t(1,16476)=-12.1800, p&lt;.0001); and CNV predicted velocity when included alongside Incentive (β=0.0015, t(1,16475)=1.9753, p=.0483). However, including CNV did not reduce the Incentive effect on velocity, and in fact strengthened it (β=0.1318, t(1,16475)=17.4380, p&lt;.0001; change in absolute coefficient: Δβ=+0.0014). Since there was no mediation (reduction), we did not run permutation tests on this.</p><p>However, RT did show a significant mediation of the Incentive effect by CNV: Incentive predicted RT (β=-0.0868, t(1,16476)=-14.9330, p&lt;.0001); Incentive predicted CNV (β=-0.9122, t(1,16476)=-12.1800, p&lt;.0001); and CNV predicted RT when included alongside Incentive (β=0.0127, t(1,16475)=21.3160, p&lt;.0001). The CNV mediated the effect of Incentive on RT, reducing the absolute beta-coefficient (β=-0.0752, t(1,16475)=-13.0570, p&lt;.0001; change in absolute coefficient: Δβ = -0.0116). We assessed the significance of this change via permutation testing, shuffling the CNV across trials (within participants) and calculating the change in absolute beta-coefficient for the Incentive effect on RT when the permuted CNV was included as a mediator. We repeated this 2500 times to build a null distribution of Δβ, and calculated the proportion with equal or stronger reductions for a one-tailed p-value, which was highly significant (p&lt;.0001). This suggests that the Incentive effect on RT is partially mediated by the CNV’s amplitude during the preparation period, and this is not the case for residual velocity.</p><p>We also investigated whether the CNV could explain the cholinergic reduction in motivation (THP*Incentive interaction) on RT – i.e., whether CNV mediation the THP moderation. We measured Mediated Moderation as suggested by Muller et al. (2005; see Methods/Analysis for full explanation): Incentive*THP was associated with RT (β=0.0222, t(1,16474)=3.8272, p=.0001); and Incentive*THP was associated with CNV (β=0.1619, t(1,16474)=2.1671, p=.0302); and CNV*THP was associated with RT (β=0.0014, t(1,16472)=2.4061, p=.0161). Mediated Moderation was measured by the change in absolute Incentive*THP effect when THP*CNV was included in the mixed-effects model (β=0.0214, t(1,16472)=3.7298, p=.0002; change in beta-coefficient: Δβ = -0.0008), and permutation-testing (permuting the CNV as above) found a significant effect (p=.0132). This indicates cholinergic blockade changes how incentives affect preparatory negativity, and how this negativity reflects RT, which can explain some of the reduced invigoration of RT. However, this was not observed for saccade velocity.</p><p>And we have updated the Methods/Analysis section with a more detailed explanation too (page 21, line 627):</p><p>“For the mediation analysis, we followed the 4-step process (Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986; Muller et al., 2005), which requires 4 tests be met for the outcome (behavioural variable, e.g. RT), mediator (ERP, e.g., CNV) and the treatment (Incentive):</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>(1) Outcome is significantly associated with the Treatment (RT ~ 1 + Incentive + (1 | participant))</p></list-item><list-item><p>(2) Mediator is significantly associated with the Treatment (ERP ~ 1 + Incentive + (1 | participant))</p></list-item><list-item><p>(3) Mediator is significantly associated with the Outcome (RT ~ 1 + Incentive + ERP + (1 | participant))</p></list-item><list-item><p>(4) And the inclusion of the Mediator reduces the association between the Treatment and Outcome (Incentive effect from model #3)</p></list-item></list><p>The mediation was measured by the reduction in the absolute standardised beta coefficient between incentive and behaviour when the ERP mediator was included (model #3 vs model #1 above).

Ideally, for every outcome, the analysis approach used should be detailed and justified.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the confusion from this. To clarify, we found a 2-way regression (incentive*THP) on both residual velocity and saccadic RT and this pattern was stronger in distractor-absent trials for residual velocity, and stronger in distractor-present trials for saccadic RT, as can be seen in Figure 1d&amp;e. However, as there was no significant 3-way interaction (incentive*THP*distractor) for either metric, and the 2-way interaction effects were in the same direction in distractor present/absent trials for both metrics, we think these effects were relatively unaffected by distractor presence.</p><p>We have updated the Results section to make this clearer: (page 3, line 94):</p><p>We measured vigour as the residual peak velocity of saccades within each drug session (see Figure 1c &amp; Methods/Eye-tracking), which is each trial’s deviation of velocity from the main sequence. This removes any overall effects of the drug on saccade velocity, while still allowing incentives and distractors to have different effects within each drug condition. We used single-trial mixed-effects linear regression (20 participants, 18585 trials in total) to assess the effects of Incentive, Distractors, and THP, along with all the interactions of these (and a random-intercept per participant), on residual velocity and saccadic RT. As predicted, residual peak velocity was increased by incentives (Figure 1d; β = 0.1266, p &lt; .0001), while distractors slightly slowed residual velocity (β = -0.0158, p = .0294; see Figure 1 – Figure supplement 1 for full behavioural statistics). THP decreased the effect of incentives on velocity (incentive * THP: β = -0.0216, p = .0030), indicating that muscarinic blockade diminished motivation by incentives. Figure 1d shows that this effect was similar in distractor absent/present trials, although slightly stronger when the distractor was absent; the 3-way (distractor*incentive*THP) interaction was not significant (p &gt; .05), suggesting that the distractor-present trials had the same effect but weaker (Figure 1d).</p><p>Saccadic RT (time to initiation of saccade) was slower when participants were given THP (β = 0.0244, p = &lt; .0001), faster with incentives (Figure 1e; β = -0.0767, p &lt; .0001), and slowed by distractors (β = 0.0358, p &lt; .0001). Again, THP reduced the effects of incentives (incentive*THP: β = 0.0218, p = .0002). Figure 1e shows that this effect was similar in distractor absent/present trials, although slightly stronger when the distractor was present; as the 3-way (distractor*incentive*THP) interaction was not significant and the direction of effects was the same in the two, it suggests the effect was similar in both conditions. Additionally, the THP*Incentive interactions were correlated between saccadic RT and residual velocity at the participant level (Figure 1 – Figure supplement 2).</p><p>We have given more details of the analyses performed in the Methods section and the results, as requested by you and the other reviewers (page 20, line 602):</p><p>Behavioural and EEG analysis included all 20 participants, although trials with EEG artefacts were included in the behavioural analyses (18585 trials in total) and not the EEG analyses (16627 trials in total), to increase power in the former.

For this mediation analysis, we only included trials with valid ERP measures, even for the models without the ERP included (e.g., model #1), to keep the trial-numbers and degrees of freedom the same.</p><p>Mediated moderation (Muller et al., 2005) was used to see whether the effect of THP (the Moderator) on behaviour is mediated by the ERP, with the following tests (after the previous Mediation tests were already satisfied):</p><p>(5) THP moderates the Incentive effect, via a significant Treatment*Moderator interaction on the Outcome (RT ~ 1 + Incentive + THP + Incentive*THP + (1 | participant))</p><p>(6) THP moderates the Incentive effect on the Mediator, via a Treatment*Moderator interaction on the Outcome (ERP ~ 1 + Incentive + THP + Incentive*THP + (1 | participant))</p><p>(7) THP’s moderation of the Incentive effect is mediated by the ERP, via a reduction in the association of Treatment*Moderator on the Outcome when the Treatment*Moderator interaction is included (RT ~ 1 + Incentive + THP + Incentive*THP + ERP + ERP*THP + (1 | participant))</p><p>Mediated moderation is measured as the reduction in absolute beta-coefficients for ‘RT ~ Incentive*THP’ between model #5 and #7, which captures how much of this interaction could be explained by including the Mediator*Moderator interaction (ERP*THP in model #7). We tested the significance of this with permutation testing as above, permuting the ERP across trials (within participants) 2500 times, and building a null distribution of the change in the absolute beta-coefficients for RT ~ Incentive*THP between models #7 and #5. We calculated a one-tailed p-value from the proportion of these that were equal or more negative than the true change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Please explain why only men were included in this study. We are all hoping that men-only research is a practice of the past.</p></disp-quote><p>We only included men to prevent any chance of administering the drug to someone pregnant. Trihexyphenidyl is categorized by the FDA as a Pregnancy Category Class C drug, and the ‘Summary of Product Characteristics’ states: “There is inadequate information regarding the use of trihexyphenidyl in pregnancy. Animal studies are insufficient with regard to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition and postnatal development. The potential risk for humans is unknown. Trihexyphenidyl should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.”</p><p>While the drug can be prescribed where benefits may outweigh this risk, as there were no benefits to participants in this study, we only recruited men to keep the risk at zero.</p><p>We have updated the Methods/Drugs section to explain this (page 17, line 494):</p><p>“The risks of Trihexyphenidyl in pregnancy are unknown, but the Summary Product of Characteristics states that it “should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary”. As this was a basic research study with no immediate clinical applications, there was no justification for any risk of administering the drug during pregnancy, so we only recruited male participants to keep this risk at zero.”</p><p>And we have referenced this in the Methods/Participants section (page 18, line 501):</p><p>“Our sample size calculations suggested 27 participants would detect a 0.5 effect size with .05 sensitivity and .8 power.

The artefact rejection was applied across all EEG channels, so any trials with absolute voltages over 200uV in any channel were removed from the analysis. On average 104/120 trials were included (having passed this check, along with eye-movement artefact checks) per condition per person, and we have added the range of these, along with totals across conditions to the Analysis section and a statement about channel rejection/interpolation (page 20, line 588):</p><p>“Epochs were from -200:1500ms around the preparation cue onset, and were baselined to the 100ms before the preparation cue appeared.

On average 104/120 trials per condition per person were included (SD = 21, range = 21-120), and 831/960 trials in total per person (SD=160, range=313-954). A repeated-measures ANOVA found there were no significant differences in number of trials excluded for any condition (p &gt; .2).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
