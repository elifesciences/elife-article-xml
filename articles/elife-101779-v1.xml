Weak synapses are preferentially removed, but the mechanism linking neuronal activity to synapse removal is unclear. Here, we show that, in the developing mouse visual pathway, inhibiting synaptic transmission induces postsynaptic activation of caspase-3. Caspase-3 deficiency results in defects in synapse elimination driven by both spontaneous and experience-dependent neural activity. Notably, caspase-3 deficiency blocks activity-dependent synapse elimination, as evidenced by reduced engulfment of inactive synapses by microglia. Furthermore, in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, caspase-3 deficiency protects against synapse loss induced by amyloid-β deposition. Our results reveal caspase-3 activation as a key step in activity-dependent synapse elimination during development and synapse loss in neurodegeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse elimination</kwd><kwd>synaptic activity</kwd><kwd>caspase-3</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Zhou</given-names></name><name><surname>Gutu</surname><given-names>Andrian</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Namsoo</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Shea</surname><given-names>Erin K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Caspase-3 activation links synapse weakening to synapse elimination.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synapse elimination is the process in which excess synapses formed early during brain development are subsequently eliminated to form mature circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kano and Hashimoto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Faust et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riccomagno and Kolodkin, 2015</xref>). The outcome of synapse elimination depends on both spontaneous and experience-driven neural activity, with less active synapses being preferentially removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Faust et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katz and Shatz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hua and Smith, 2004</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms that connect neuronal activity to synapse elimination remain unclear. Previous studies have proposed that microglia and astrocytes, two major glial cell types of the brain, mediate activity-dependent synapse elimination by engulfing weak synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stevens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott-Hewitt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Barres, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>), but it is unclear how glia can detect the ‘strength’ of a synapse. A recent study proposed a molecular mechanism for activity-dependent synapse elimination in which the JAK2-STAT1 pathway is activated in inactive callosal projection neurons and regulates the removal of synapses and axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yasuda et al., 2021a</xref>). However, the JAK-STAT pathway canonically functions through transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Philips et al., 2022</xref>), which affects entire cells. If not all synapses made by a neuron are destined for removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riccomagno and Kolodkin, 2015</xref>), activation of the JAK2-STAT1 pathway alone may not provide sufficient elimination specificity. Therefore, other unidentified, locally effective mechanisms likely exist that confer elimination specificity at the synapse level.</p><p>Caspase-3 is a protease crucial for the execution of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McIlwain et al., 2013</xref>). In hippocampal neurons, transient activation of caspase-3 is required for long-term depression (LTD), a form of synaptic plasticity that induces long-lasting decreases in synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Caspase-3 activation in apoptotic cells is also known to lead to the clearance of these cells by phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park and Kim, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trouw et al., 2008</xref>). These findings led us to hypothesize that caspase-3 may link synapse weakening with synapse removal by glia. Although caspases were previously implicated in dendrite pruning in metamorphosis, degeneration-like axon elimination, and the regulation of hippocampal spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Williams et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ertürk et al., 2014</xref>), the role of caspase-3 in synapse elimination in response to neural activity was not clear. In this work, we identify caspase-3 as a key molecule that is activated in postnatal development in dendritic compartments upon synaptic weakening and is necessary for the elimination of weak synapses by microglia. Furthermore, we discovered that caspase-3 deficiency protects against amyloid-β-induced synapse loss in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting its significance not only in developmental synapse elimination but also in adult neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tetanus toxin expression inactivates retinogeniculate synapses</title><p>We chose the mouse retinogeniculate visual pathway as a model system to study synapse elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liang and Chen, 2020</xref>). In mice, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in each eye send out axons to form retinogeniculate synapses with relay neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei (dLGN) of the thalamus on both sides of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liang and Chen, 2020</xref>).

Regions in each dLGN innervated by the two eyes initially overlap but later segregate into eye-specific territories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This segregation process is a hallmark of retinogeniculate pathway development at the morphological level and depends on synapse elimination and spontaneous RGC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liang and Chen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Penn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stellwagen and Shatz, 2002</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the role of caspase-3 in activity-dependent synapse elimination, we first needed to establish a method that could manipulate the strength of a subset of retinogeniculate synapses. For this purpose, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver a construct expressing tetanus toxin light chain (TeTxLC) under the control of the neuron-specific human synapsin promoter (AAV-hSyn-TeTxLC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yasuda et al., 2021b</xref>). In utero intraocular injection of AAV-hSyn-TeTxLC at embryonic day 15 (E15) leads to TeTxLC expression in RGCs by the time of birth, blocking neurotransmitter release at retinogeniculate synapses by cleaving synaptobrevin and leading to synapse inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yasuda et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schiavo et al., 1992</xref>). To label RGC axons and facilitate quantification, we co-injected AAVs that express fluorescent proteins (mTurquoise2, eGFP, or tdTomato, depending on the experiment) as anterograde tracers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These AAVs expressing fluorescent proteins also served as controls for eye injections.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inactivation of retinogeniculate synapses induces caspase-3 activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of experimental setup.

To quantify the overlap between eye-specific territories in an unbiased manner, we applied a set of increasing thresholds to signals from both eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Torborg and Feller, 2004</xref>).

To address this question, we injected AAV-hSyn-TeTxLC into the right eyes of E15 embryos and looked for caspase-3 activation in dLGNs of TeTxLC-injected mice at the age of P5 (a time when synapse elimination is most active) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liang and Chen, 2020</xref>). We used immunohistochemistry against the cleaved and active form of caspase-3 to detect caspase-3 activity in the dLGN area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McIlwain et al., 2013</xref>). If synapse inactivation leads to caspase-3 activation, we would expect higher levels of caspase-3 activity in dLGNs with more inactivated synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In agreement with this hypothesis, caspase-3 activity in left dLGNs of TeTxLC-injected animals (dLGNs with the most inactivated synapses) was significantly higher compared to that in right dLGNs of the same animals (dLGNs with intermediate amount of inactivated synapses) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C and E</xref>) and compared to that in dLGNs of animals receiving control injections in the right eyes (dLGNs with no inactivation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D and E</xref>). Reassuringly, caspase-3 activities in left and right dLGNs of control animals were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), despite injections being administered only in the right eyes. This suggests that surgical manipulation and viral transduction had no measurable contribution to caspase-3 activation. These findings support the model that inactivation of retinogeniculate synapses leads to caspase-3 activation.</p><p>Does inactivation of retinogeniculate synapses activate caspase-3 pre-synaptically in RGCs or post-synaptically in dLGN relay neurons? Caspase-3 activity in dLGNs of TeTxLC-injected mice was present either as discrete, punctate signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) or as staining of entire cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4Bi-iii</xref>). Both types of signals were more abundant in dLGNs with strong synapse inactivation than in control dLGNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D and F</xref>). Intriguingly, punctate caspase-3 activity was not found within TeTxLC-expressing RGC axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Instead, punctate caspase-3 activity closely juxtaposed inactivated axon terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and co-localized with the dendritic marker MAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). In the case where caspase-3 was activated in entire cells, the cells were positive for the neuronal marker NeuN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>) and possessed relatively large round somas and multipolar dendritic arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4Bi-iii</xref>), all of which are characteristics of dLGN relay neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krahe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parnavelas et al., 1977</xref>). These observations suggest that caspase-3 activation triggered by synapse inactivation occurs predominantly in the dendritic compartments of dLGN relay neurons that are postsynaptic to the inactivated synapses.</p><p>Although morphologically distinct, localized and whole-cell caspase-3 activity may be mechanistically linked. In support of this, we observed transitional states of caspase-3 activation where multiple dendrites of a relay neuron were positive for active caspase-3 without the cell body becoming apoptotic (an example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4Biv</xref>), suggesting that whole-cell caspase-3 activation may arise from accumulation of local caspase-3 activity. Such transitions might be particularly relevant in dLGNs that receive the majority of TeTxLC-expressing axons, as systematic silencing of synapses could lead to widespread caspase-3 activation in the postsynaptic neuron, potentially overwhelming negative regulatory mechanisms that normally keep caspase-3 activation localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ertürk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Choi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suzuki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McComb et al., 2019</xref>). While our data cannot determine which form of caspase-3 activation plays a more significant role in the normal development of the visual pathway, the infrequent occurrence of whole-cell caspase-3 activation in control dLGNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) -- which undergo normal synapse elimination -- suggests that localized caspase-3 activation is necessary to drive synapse elimination under physiological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Caspase-3 activation at weak synapses requires the presence of strong synapses</title><p>Previous experiments have manipulated RGC neuronal activities and demonstrated that, regardless of the absolute level of RGC activity, the dLGN territory of less active RGCs always contracted relative to that of more active RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Penn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stellwagen and Shatz, 2002</xref>). This observation suggests that the outcome of synapse elimination is driven by competitive interactions between strong and weak synapses. Consistent with this idea, a recent study demonstrated that elimination of weak synapses in callosal projections occurred only when other strong synapses are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yasuda et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nagappan-Chettiar et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>To test if caspase-3 activation at weak synapses requires the presence of strong synapses, we designed two experimental conditions.

We termed this condition ‘single inactivation.’ In the second condition, we inactivated RGCs in both eyes, leading to the presence of only inactive synapses in the dLGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We termed this condition ‘dual inactivation.’ We also included a control condition where no RGCs were inactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Although not reaching statistical significance, dLGN caspase-3 activity on average was still higher in the dual inactivation condition compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), possibly due to incomplete inactivation of retinogeniculate synapses, or interaction between weak retinogeniculate synapses and strong synapses from other pathways, or additional mechanisms that activate caspase-3 independently of interactions between weak and strong synapses.

At the time of the second stimulus, the RRP does not have sufficient time to recover and remains depleted, resulting in a weaker second response (right).

We fitted ellipsoids to SV2 and Homer1 signals to identify pre- and post-synaptic puncta and defined synapses as Homer1-SV2 puncta pairs that were less than 300 nm apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We observed that synapse density in <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice was significantly reduced compared to that in <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>), and that this reduction could be attributed to lower densities of both pre- and post-synaptic puncta in <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). We then crossed APP/PS1 mice to caspase-3 deficient mice and quantified synapse density in 6-mo-old <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> littermate mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). We observed that, in the caspase-3 deficient background, overexpression of mutant APP and PS1 no longer resulted in a reduction in the density of synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>) or pre-/post-synaptic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>), suggesting that caspase-3 activity is required for Aβ-induced synapse loss in the APP/PS1 mouse model. Intriguingly, levels of amyloid deposition were comparable between <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1Aiv and B</xref>), and reactive microglia were observed near amyloid deposits regardless of caspase-3 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that protection conferred by caspase-3 deficiency against Aβ-induced synapse loss might not require inhibition of amyloid accumulation or microgliosis. We also investigated whether Aβ accumulation induced elevated levels of caspase-3 activity. We analyzed 4, 5, and 6-mo-old <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice but only observed robust upregulation of caspase-3 activity in the dentate gyrus of a subset of 4-mo-old <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5A–C</xref>). Upregulated caspase-3 activity in these mice remained in a punctate pattern without inducing neuronal death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5D–F</xref>). It is possible that Aβ transiently induces caspase-3 activation in <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice, but stochasticity in the onset and duration of such induction prevents reliable detection with our sample size and temporal resolution. Overall, our results demonstrate caspase-3 as an important regulator of Aβ-induced synapse loss and a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Caspase-3 deficiency protects against Aβ-induced synapse loss.</title><p>(<bold>A and C</bold>) Representative 3D-reconstructed images (3 μm in z) showing presynaptic (SV2, in green) and postsynaptic (Homer1, in red) signals in dentate gyrus of female 6-mo-old amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 mice on caspase-3 wild-type (<bold>A</bold>) and deficient (<bold>C</bold>) backgrounds.

Conversely, while caspase-3 is activated in the postsynaptic compartment, we were able to detect defects in synapse elimination using assays that measure presynaptic inputs. These observations suggest that activity-dependent caspase-3 activation requires synaptic transmission, and that caspase-3-dependent synapse elimination is not strictly axonal or dendritic but involves both pre- and post-synaptic compartments. An important limitation of this study is that experiments in full-body <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice cannot query the roles of caspase-3 in presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments separately. Future experiments that perturb caspase-3 activation and other signaling events specifically in the pre- or post-synaptic compartments are needed to reveal more detailed mechanisms of activity-dependent synapse elimination.</p><p>The observation that activity-dependent caspase-3 activation requires the presence of both weak and strong synapses resonates with previous research demonstrating that relative synaptic efficacy biases the outcome of synapse elimination during development of neuromuscular junctions and the callosal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yasuda et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nagappan-Chettiar et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Buffelli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee, 2020</xref>).

One of the best understood markers is phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), a phospholipid that translocates from the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane to the exoplasmic leaflet during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park and Kim, 2017</xref>). Importantly, caspase-3 directly regulates the enzymes that translocate PtdSer through enzymatic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Segawa et al., 2014</xref>).

The observation that synaptic activity promotes microglial engulfment through caspase-3 activation raises the possibility that weakened synapses partially disintegrate through apoptosis-like mechanisms prior to being engulfed by microglia.

Briefly, pregnant mouse females with embryos at E15 gestation were anesthetized by 3% isoflurane inhalation, abdomens shaved, eye lube applied to each eye, then transferred to a nose cone and set to maintenance level of 2% isoflurane inhalation anesthesia. Warm fluids (lactated Ringer’s solution + 5% dextrose, Strategic Applications Inc), Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg, Butler Animal Health), and Ketoprofen (5 mg/kg, Covetrus) were administered subcutaneously just prior to starting surgery. The animal was placed in dorsal recumbency, and the abdomen was cleansed using alternating swabs of 70% ethanol and 4% Chlorhexidine Gluconate (Molnlycke Health Care). A sterile drape was placed over the abdomen and using aseptic technique, the abdominal skin and wall were cut at midline, before gently removing the uterus from the abdomen. While keeping the uterus/embryos hydrated with warm saline sterile solution, the embryos were gently positioned with ring forceps to hold each embryo securely for injection. A previously filled glass pipette (Drummond Scientific), beveled to 30–40 μm at the opening was utilized to deliver constructs utilizing a pre-programmed Nanoject III microinjector (Drummond Scientific). 200–250 nl of AAVs prep was injected through the uterine wall and into each eye at a speed of 50 nl per second. To confirm proper targeting within the eye, the AAV solution was pre-mixed with 0.05% Fast Green (Sigma Aldrich). After all injections were completed, the uterus/embryos were carefully placed back into the abdomen and the abdomen was flushed with warm sterile saline. The abdominal wall and skin were sutured, and Marcaine (Hospira) was applied subcutaneously below the skin incision. A small drop of Vetbond (3 M) was applied to seal the skin incision. The animal was then removed from the anesthesia apparatus and allowed to recover on a heating pad before being placed back into a clean cage.</p><p>For intraocular injection at P4 and P9, pups with desired genotypes were anesthetized in an induction chamber filled with 2.5–3% isoflurane using a calibrated vaporizer.

Proparacaine ophthalmic solution (0.5%, Sandoz, NDC 61314-016-01) was applied to each eye to be injected. A re-breathing nose cone was used to deliver 1.25–2% isoflurane throughout the procedure. A gentle blunt dissection was performed at each eyelid junction utilizing closed No. 5 Dumont forceps (Fine Science Tools) to create a 2–3 mm opening. A 33-gauge sharp beveled needle attached to a Hamilton microliter syringe (Hamilton Company) was used to draw up CTB-AF solutions. Just prior to injecting, the eye was proptosed and held securely in place by the Dumont forceps in preparation for injection.

After reaching 1×10<sup>6</sup> viable cells/ml density, the cells were diluted 1:2 by adding an equal volume of serum-free CD Hybridoma medium supplemented with 4% GlutaMax<sup>Tm</sup> and returned to the incubator. This dilution process was repeated two more times so that the cells reached 1×10<sup>6</sup> viable cells/ml density in a mixed medium containing ~1% FBS. Cell viability obtained was at least 90%. The cells were then spun down at 150×G for 10 min and resuspended in complete CD Hybridoma medium at 5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml density. The cells were further expanded by adding more complete CD Hybridoma medium when cells reach 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml density.

The channels were acquired sequentially (line-by-line) with the anti-caspase-3 first and anti-mTurquoise2 second. A 590 nm laser and emission read of 596 nm–748 nm was used for the anti-cleaved caspase-3 channel, and 440 nm and 488 nm lasers and an emission read of 457 nm–579 nm were used for anti-mTurquoise2 channel. The imaging parameters (laser power, pixel dwell time, signal averaging or accumulation) were set to maximize signal-to-background values while avoiding detector (SiPM type Power HyD S) saturation. Photon detection was set in counting mode and acquired as 12-bit images at 227 nm×227 nm pixel size. All datasets used for measurement of caspase-3 activity were acquired as Z-stacks (seven slices spaced 2.4 μm apart). To measure the total amount of active caspase-3 signal in the 3D stacks of dLGN we used the Labkit (<italic>66</italic>) Fiji plugin to generate and train a pixel classifier through Imaris v. 10 (Oxford Instruments). The same pixel classifier and surface creation settings were applied to data from both the control and the synapse inactivation groups to generate surface objects of active caspase-3 signal. All active caspase-3 objects found within the dLGN area (manually delineated based on mTurquoise2 signal) were selected, and the sum of voxel intensities the active caspase-3 objects was calculated and divided by the area of dLGN.

Laser power and detector gain settings were maintained at the same level for most images, with occasional adjustment to avoid saturation. One image per dLGN per section was acquired.</p><p>To quantify the overlap between contralateral-specific and ipsilateral-specific territories in the dLGN, we selected 7–8 sections per animal that span the majority of left dLGN and analyzed their images in ImageJ. For each image, a mask for the entire dLGN region and a mask for a background region in the thalamus with no labeling were manually created. Background signal from each channel was estimated as the average signal in the background region and was subtracted from signals in the dGLN region. Then the background-subtracted signals in the dLGN region were normalized to between 0 and 1 for each image and each channel. We picked 7 increasing cutoff thresholds (0.1, 0.125, 0.15, 0.175, 0.2, 0.225, and 0.25), and for each threshold and each channel, signals that are greater than or equal to the threshold were considered real signals. For each animal (corresponding to 7–8 images of left dLGN) and each threshold, we calculated percentage overlap as the ratio between the total number of pixels with real signals in both channels in all images and the total number of pixels in the entire dLGN region of all images.

To measure astrocyte-mediated synapse engulfment in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), we bred <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> males to <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>+/-</sup>; <italic>Aldh1l1-Gfp<sup>+/-</sup></italic>to generate <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>Aldh1l1-Gfp<sup>+/-</sup></italic>and <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>+/-</sup>; <italic>Aldh1l1-Gfp<sup>+/-</sup></italic>littermate pups. P4 pups with desired genotypes were injected with 2 µL of CTB-AF555 in left eyes and 2 µL of CTB-AF647 in right eyes as described above. 24 hr later, the brains were harvested, sectioned, and mounted as described above.</p><p>To analyze engulfment of synapses, the sections were imaged using a Leica TCS SP8 Laser Scanning Microscope equipped with an HC Plan Apo CS2 40 x (NA = 1.3) oil objective and a White Light Laser Unit. The 3D multichannel stacks with a voxel size of 0.075×0.075×0.312 µm for microglia samples or 0.048×0.048×0.2 µm for astrocyte samples were acquired as 16-bit images with 4 x line averages for microglia or 2 x for astrocytes at 400 Hz scanner speed. The stacks were set to collect a volume of 20 micrometers in the Z dimension and 387.5 micrometers in XY dimensions for microglia or 288 μm in XY for astrocytes. The pinhole was set at 1 Airy unit for 520 nm wavelength. The excitation lasers and detection windows were set to minimize crosstalk and bleed-through as well as the saturation of detectors while simultaneously imaging the three channels. A 478 nm laser and a detection window of 488–537 nm were used for the GFP channel, a 550 nm laser and a detection window of 596–629 nm were used for CTB-AF555, and a 651 nm laser and a detection window of 665–750 nm were used for CTB-AF647. Imaris 9.6 (Oxford Instruments) was used to segment microglia, astrocytes, ipsilateral RGC axon terminals, and contralateral RGC terminals from the 3D stacks using the Surface Creation module with background subtraction. For segmentation of RGC axon terminals and astrocytes, all parameters used were left at default values (auto). For segmentation of microglia, we set the threshold manually at the highest inflection curve in the histogram of voxel intensities, which in our experience provided a good trade-off for good segmentation of cell bodies and major processes while keeping the adjustment consistent across different image datasets. A background subtraction ball size of 1 µm was used for microglia, a ball size of 1.4 µm was used for astrocytes, and a ball size of 0.5 µm was used for AF555 and AF647 labeled axonal materials. The segmented signal of AF555 and AF647 was each converted to a binary mask of 0 and 1 voxels. Finally, the sum of the segmented volume (i.e. sum of ones) of AF555 and/or AF647 in each microglia or astrocyte was either directly plotted or normalized to the microglia or astrocyte volume and plotted. To control the inherent signal variability across LGN, only microglia and astrocytes present in the ipsilateral region of the 3 middle sections of the left dLGN of each mouse were included in the analysis. Also, only microglia or astrocytes whose soma and proximal processes were contained in the volumetric stack were included in the final analysis. All littermate pups of the same genotype were pooled together.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Measuring activity-dependent engulfment of synapses by microglia</title><p>To investigate the role of caspase-3 in activity-dependent synapse elimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), we used C57Bl/6 J wild-type mice as controls and bred <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> males with <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> females to generate <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.

C57Bl/6 J and <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos were injected at E15 in their right eye either with AAV carrying hSyn-TeTxLC-P2A-mTurquoise2 or AAV carrying hSyn-mTurquoise2 as described above. To label the RGC axons, at P4, the pups were injected with 2 µL of CTB-AF555 in left eyes and 2 µL of CTB-AF647 in right eyes as described above. At P5, the brains were harvested and sectioned. Two 50 μm sections that spanned the central part of the dLGN were stained with anti-Iba1 antibody and goat anti-rabbit AF488 secondary (as described above) to label microglial cell bodies.</p><p>Mounted and cured sections were then imaged on Leica Stellaris 8 confocal microscope using a 63 x/1.4 NA oil objective (Leica HC PL APO 63 x/1,40 OIL CS2). Four stitched 3D-stacks were acquired for each left dLGN (the side where CTF-AF647 and mTurquoise2 occupied the majority of the dLGN) to generate a 3D volume of 366 μm×366 μm in XY and approximately 20 μm in the Z dimension, with a voxel size of 64 nm×64 nm×299 nm. The channels were acquired sequentially: first using a 499 nm laser with an emission window of 507–556 nm together with a 653 nm laser with an emission window of 663–750 nm for Iba1-AF488 and CTB-AF647 signal, respectively, then using a 553 nm laser with an emission window of 558–663 nm for the CTB-AF555 signal. Images acquired were collected as 12-bit datasets, and care was taken to set the laser power, signal accumulation, and pixel dwell time to avoid detector saturation. Only animals whose dLGN areas were fully labeled with both AF555 and AF647 as well as the mTurquoise signals were imaged and analyzed. Animals in which CTB signal appeared widespread throughout the brain parenchyma were excluded from the analysis as these labeling patterns were likely due to surgical mistargeting or issues with tissue integrity.</p><p>To segment volumes corresponding to microglia and CTB-AF555 and CTB-AF647 labeled RGC axon terminals, we utilized the Surface Creation module with machine learning segmentation of Imaris 10.1.1 (Oxford Instruments). We first trained for several rounds a pixel classifier for each channel using two independent image files and saved the classifiers along with the other settings (smoothing grain size of 100 nm and discarding volumes smaller than 10 voxels) as ‘Favorite Creation Parameter.’ Subsequently, the same Favorite Creation Parameters were applied to all data sets, with the rare instances when microglia segmentation was slightly tuned via the same pixel classifier to better capture some of the cell border areas. Similar to the previous analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the segmented signals of CTB-AF647 and CTB-AF555 were converted to binary images (0 or 1 voxels), and the total volume of CTB-AF647- or CTB-AF555-positive voxels in each microglia was extracted, converted to fraction of the microglia volume, and plotted. Only the cells whose body and major processes were bound within the 3D stack and present within the middle area of dLGN (where the ipsilateral signal is present) were included in the analysis. Data from the same genotype and treatment were pooled together. Either one or two sections were analyzed for each animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Measuring microglia activation</title><p>To measure if lack of caspase 3 causes microglia activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), we bred <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> males with <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> females to generate <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and Casp3<sup>+/+</sup> littermates. After genotyping, at P5, the brains were harvested and sectioned coronally as described above. Two 50 μm sections that spanned the central part of the dLGN were stained with anti-Iba1 antibody (detected by goat anti-rabbit AF488 secondary) to label microglial cell bodies and anti-CD68 antibody (detected by donkey anti-rat AF555 secondary) to detect CD68 protein. Mounted and cured sections were imaged on Leica Stellaris 8 confocal microscope using a 63 x/1.4 NA oil objective (Leica HC PL APO 63 x/1,40 OIL CS2). A 3D image stack of 185 μm x 185 μm in XY and approximately 20 μm in the Z dimension, with a voxel size of 72 nm×72 nm×299 nm was acquired for each dLGN. The channels were acquired in photon counting mode simultaneously: a 499 nm laser with an emission window of 504–548 nm together with a 553 nm laser with an emission window of 560–650 nm for Iba1-AF488 and CD68-AF555. To eliminate any fluorescence emission bleed-through between channels, the photon arrival times were gated to 3–5 ns for Iba1-AF488 and to 0–1.5 ns for Iba1-AF555 channels, respectively. Images acquired were collected as 8-bit datasets, and care was taken to set the laser power, signal accumulation, and pixel dwell time to avoid fluorophore bleaching or detector saturation.</p><p>For segmentation of microglia and CD68 signals, we utilized the Surface Creation module with machine learning segmentation of Imaris 10.1.1 (Oxford Instruments). We first trained for several rounds a pixel classifier for each channel then saved the classifiers along with the other settings (smoothing grain size of 145 nm and discarding volumes smaller than 10 voxels) as ‘Favorite Creation Parameter.’ Subsequently, the same Favorite Creation Parameters were applied to all data sets, with the rare instances when microglia segmentation was slightly adjusted via the same pixel classfier to better capture some of the cell border areas.

For measurement of relative CD68 intensity, the sum of CD68 signal was divided by the microglia volume. Only the microglia whose body and major processes were confined within the 3D stack were included in the analysis. All staining, imaging, and analysis parameters were identically applied to all sections. Two sections were analyzed for each animal.

A 460 nm laser line was used for excitation and a window of 469–600 nm was used for emission.

Stained sections were imaged on a Leica Stellaris 8 confocal microscope using a 63 x/1.4 NA oil objective (Leica HC PL APO 63 x/1,40 OIL CS2). To acquire a representative dataset, we focused on the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus from both the left and right side of the brain and sampled three regions from each side, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>. 3D-stacks (61.5 μm×61.5 μm×20 μm) were acquired with a voxel size of 64 nm×64 nm×298 nm. 561 nm and 638 nm laser lines were used for excitation, 555–635 nm and 642–792 nm windows were used for emission reading, and appropriate notch filters were used for blocking the exciting laser lines. The channels were acquired as 8-bit data sets with detectors set in counting mode, and the lasers power, signal accumulation, and pixel dwell time set at levels that avoided detector saturation. To measure synapse number per unit volume, we first trimmed the raw 3D stacks to a stack of approximately 3.5 μm thickness on the side closest to the coverslip (to avoid any signal depletion in the middle part of the section due to antibody penetration issues) and cropped out regions where large gaps (corresponding to blood vessels) devoid of Sv2 or Homer1 staining were present. The punctate signals of SV2 and Homer1 were fit in Imaris 10.1 (Oxford Instruments) to ellipsoids (500 nm in XY and 850 nm in Z for SV2; 400 nm in XY and 800 nm in Z for Homer1) with background subtraction (‘Spot Creation’). Then we designated as ‘synapses’ all Homer1 ellipsoids that were within 300 nm of a SV2 ellipsoid (center-to-center distance). For each animal, the total number of synapses in all 3D-stacks analyzed was divided by the total volume of all stacks analyzed and plotted as a single value.</p><p>To detect Aβ-induced microglia activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>), brains of 6-mo-old female <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, and <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice were harvested, sectioned, and stained with anti-Iba1 antibody (using goat anti-rabbit AF647plus as the secondary) and anti-Cd68 (using goat anti-rat AF555plus as the secondary) as labels of microglia cell body and microglial activation, respectively. Stained sections were imaged on a Leica Stellaris 8 confocal microscope using a 20 x/0.7 NA water objective (Leica HC PL APO 20 x/0,7 IMM CORR CS2). Tile images spanning the hippocampus were acquired at voxel sizes of 142 nm×142 nm×300 nm. A 548 nm laser line and a 554–634 nm emission window were used for the CD68-AF555 channel, and a 653 laser line and a 663–748 nm emission window were used for the Iba1-AF647 channel. Microgliosis could be detected as clusters of microglia with stubby processes and strong intracellular Cd68 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To quantify Aβ-induced caspase-3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>), brains of 4-mo-old, 5-mo-old, and 6-mo-old female <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> littermates were harvested, sectioned, and stained with anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (using goat anti-rabbit AF555plus as the secondary). Stained sections were imaged on a Leica Stellaris 8 confocal microscope using a 63 x/1.4 NA oil objective (Leica HC PL APO 63 x/1,40 OIL CS2). We sampled at least 2 regions of interest from the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus on each side of the brain. 3D-stacks (92.26 μm×92.26 μm×22 μm) were acquired with a voxel size of 81 nm×81 nm×299 nm. A 561 nm laser line was used for excitation and an emission window of 550–728 nm was used for the active caspase-3 channel. To measure the number of caspase 3 objects in the dataset, we first trimmed the 3D stacks to a volume where the signal is uniformly distributed (i.e. in focus) and segmented the objects using the ‘Surface creation’ analysis in Imaris 10.1 (Oxford Instruments). The dataset was first smoothed by a two-pixel filter, then a ball size of 400 nm was used to find the objects with background subtraction. Only objects bigger than 10 and smaller than 2000 voxels were kept. Finally, the number of caspase 3 objects was divided by the volume of the 3D stack analyzed and reported per brain side (left or right) for each animal.</p><p>To measure the relative density of granule cells in the dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>), brains of 6-mo-old female <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, and <italic>Casp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>App/Ps1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice were harvested, sectioned, and stained with anti-NeuN antibody (using goat anti-mouse AF594plus as the secondary) to label neuronal nuclei. Stained sections were imaged on a Leica Stellaris 8 confocal microscope using a 20 x/0.7 NA water objective (Leica HC PL APO 20 x/0,7 IMM CORR CS2). 3D stacks of the dentate gyrus (581 μm×581 μm×30 μm) were acquired at voxel sizes of 160 nm×160 nm×1000 nm for each section and side (left and right) using a 594 nm laser and an emission window of 597–750 nm. The channels were acquired as 8-bit images with the detector set in counting mode, and the lasers power, signal accumulation, and pixel dwell time set at levels that avoided detector saturation. To count the number of nuclei, images were first rotated to position vertically the cortical side of the dentate gyrus. A maximum projection of the brightest two Z-slices was extracted from each 3D stack, and NeuN + nuclei were manually counted within a rectangular region of interest (89 μm×150 μm) that was positioned on the granule cell layer at 300 μm away from the tip of the gyrus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistics</title><p>For all experiments, we aim to reach a sample size of n=7 mice for each experimental group.

The method for synaptic silencing is elegant and requires intrauterine injection of a tetanus toxin light chain into the eye. The authors report that this silencing leads to increased caspase 3 in the contralateral eye (Figure 1) and demonstrate evidence of punctate caspase 3 that does not overlap neuronal markers like map2. However, the quantifications showing increased caspase 3 in the silenced eye (done at P5) are complicated by overlap with the signal from entire dying cells in the thalamus. The authors also show that global caspase 3 deficiency impairs the process of eye-specific segregation and circuit refinement (Figures 3-4).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer states: “this silencing leads to increased caspase 3 in the contralateral eye”. We observed increased caspase-3 activity, not protein levels, in the contralateral dLGN, not eye.</p><p>The reviewer states: “and demonstrate evidence of punctate caspase 3 that does not overlap neuronal markers like map2”. We do not believe that this statement is accurate, as we show that the punctate active caspase-3 signals overlap with the dendritic marker MAP2 (Figure S4A).</p><p>The reviewer also states: “, the quantifications showing increased caspase 3 [<italic>activity</italic>] in the silenced [<italic>dLGN</italic>] (done at P5) are complicated by overlap with the signal from entire dying cells in the thalamus”. We do not believe that this statement is accurate. The apoptotic neurons we observed are relay neurons (confirmed by their morphology and positive staining of NeuN – Figure S4B-C) located in the dLGN (the dLGN is clearly labeled by expression of fluorescent proteins in RGCs, and only caspase-3 activity in the dLGN area is analyzed), not “cells” of unknown lineage (as suggested by the reviewer) in the general “thalamus” area (as suggested by the reviewer). If the dying cells were non-neuronal cells, that would indeed confound our quantification and conclusions, but that is not the case.</p><p>We argue that whole-cell caspase-3 activation in dLGN relay neurons is a <italic>bona fide</italic> response to synaptic silencing by TeTxLC and therefore should be included in the quantification. We have two sets of controls: one is between the strongly inactivated dLGN and the weakly inactivated dLGN in the same TeTxLC-injected animal; and the second is between the dLGN of TeTxLC-injected animals and mock-injected animals. In both controls, only the dLGNs receiving strong synapse inactivation have more apoptotic dLGN relay neurons, demonstrating that these cells occur because of synapse inactivation. It is also unlikely that our perturbation is causing cell death through a non-synaptic mechanism. Since mock injections do not cause apoptosis in dLGN neurons, this phenomenon is not related to surgical damage. TeTxLC is injected into the eyes and only expressed in presynaptic RGCs, not in postsynaptic relay neurons, so this phenomenon is also unlikely to be caused by TeTxLC-related toxicity. Furthermore, if apoptosis of dLGN relay neurons is not related to synapse inactivation, then when TeTxLC is injected into both eyes, one would expect to see either the same amount or more apoptotic relay neurons, but we instead observed a reduction in dLGN neuron apoptosis, suggesting that synapse-related mechanisms are responsible. Considering the above, occasional whole-cell caspase-3 activation in relay neurons in TeTxLC-inactivated dLGN is causally linked to synapse inactivation and should be included in the quantification.</p><p>We also revised the manuscript to better explain the possible mechanistic connection between localized caspase-3 activity and whole-cell caspase-3 activity. We propose that whole-cell caspase-3 activation occurs because of uncontrolled accumulation of localized caspase-3 activation. Please see line 127-140 and line 403-413 for details.</p><p>Additionally, we would like to clarify that we are not claiming that synapse inactivation leads to only localized caspase-3 activation or only whole-cell caspase-3 activation, as is suggested by the editors and reviewers in the eLife assessment. We have clearly stated in the manuscript that both types of signals were observed. However, we reasoned that, because whole-cell caspase-3 activation in unperturbed dLGNs – which undergo normal synapse elimination – is infrequently observed, whole-cell caspase-3 activation may not be a significant driver of synapse elimination during normal development. In this revision, we included a new experiment to corroborate this hypothesis. If whole-cell caspase-3 activation in dLGN relay neurons is a prevalent phenomenon during normal development, such caspase-3 activity would lead to significant death of dLGN relay neurons during normal development. Consequently, if we block caspase-3 activation by deleting caspase-3, the number of relay neurons in the dLGN should increase. However, in support of our hypothesis, we observed comparable numbers of relay neurons in <italic>Casp3+/+</italic> and <italic>Casp3-/-</italic> mice. Please see Figure S7 for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also report that &quot;synapse weakening-induced caspase-3 activation determines the specificity of synapse elimination mediated by microglia but not astrocytes&quot; (abstract). They report that microglia engulf fewer RGC axon terminals in caspase 3 deficient animals (Figure 5), and that this preferentially occurs in silenced terminals, but this preferential effect is lost in caspase 3 knockouts. Based on this, the authors conclude that caspase 3 directs microglia to eliminate weaker synapses. However, a much simpler and critical experiment that the authors did not perform is to eliminate microglia and show that the caspase 3 dependent effects go away. Without this experiment, there is no reason to assume that microglia are directing synaptic elimination.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer states: “microglia engulf fewer RGC axon terminals in caspase 3 deficient animals (Figure 5), and that this preferentially occurs in silenced terminals, but this preferential effect is lost in caspase 3 knockouts”. We are not sure what the reviewer means by “this preferentially occurs in silenced terminals”. Our results show that microglia preferentially engulf silenced terminals, and such preference is lost in caspase-3 deficient mice (Figure 6).</p><p>We do not understand the experiment where the reviewer suggested to: “eliminate microglia and show that the caspase 3 dependent effects go away”. To quantify caspase-3 dependent engulfment of synaptic material by microglia or preferential engulfment of silenced terminals by microglia, microglia must be present in the tissue sample. If we eliminate microglia, neither of these measurements can be made. What could be measured if microglia are eliminated is the refinement of retinogeniculate pathway. This experiment would test whether microglia are required for caspase-3 dependent phenotypes. This is not a claim made in the manuscript. Instead, we claimed caspase-3 is required for microglia to engulf weak synapses, as supported by the evidence presented in Figure 6.</p><p>We did not claim that “microglia are directing synaptic elimination”. Our claim is that synapse inactivation induces caspase-3 activity, and caspase-3 activation in turn leads to engulfment of weak synapses by microglia. Based on this model, it is the neuronal activity that fundamentally directs synapse elimination. Synapse engulfment by microglia is only a readout we used to measure the outcome of activity-dependent synapse elimination. We have revised all sections in the manuscript that are related to synapse engulfment by microglia to emphasize the logic of this model.</p><p>We have also revised the abstract and title of the paper to better align it with our main claims, removed the reference to astrocytes, and clarified that microglia engulfment measurements are used as readouts of synapse elimination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors also report that caspase 3 deficiency alters synapse loss in 6-month-old female APP/PS1 mice, but this is not really related to the rest of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree that Figure 7 is not related to the rest of the paper. Many genes involved in postnatal synapse elimination, such as C1q and C3, have been implicated in neurodegeneration. It is therefore natural and important to ask whether the function of caspase-3 in regulating synaptic homeostasis extends to neurodegenerative diseases in adult animals. The answer to this question may have broad therapeutic impacts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Yu et al. demonstrates that activation of caspase-3 is essential for synapse elimination by microglia, but not by astrocytes.

The schematic drawings are helpful for understanding the experimental designs and purposes.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It seems that astrocytes contain large amounts of engulfed materials from ipsilateral and contralateral axon terminals (Figure S11B) and that caspase-3 deficiency also decreased the volume of engulfed materials by astrocytes (Figures S11C, D). So the possibility that astrocyte-mediated synapse elimination contributes to circuit refinement in dLGN cannot be excluded.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that we do not claim that astrocytes are unimportant for synapse elimination or circuit refinement. We acknowledge that the claim made in the original submitted manuscript that caspase-3 does not regulate synapse elimination by astrocytes lacks strong supporting evidence. We have removed this claim and revised the section related to synapse engulfment by astrocytes to provide a more rigorous interpretation of our data. We also removed the section in discussion regarding distinct substrate preferences of microglia and astrocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does blocking single or dual inactivation of synapse activity (using TeTxLC) increase microglial or astrocytic engulfment of synaptic materials (of one or both sides) in dLGN?</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that by “blocking single or dual inactivation of synapse activity”, the reviewer refers to inactivating retinogeniculate synapses from one or both eyes.</p><p>We showed that inactivating retinogeniculate synapses from one eye (single inactivation) increases engulfment of inactive synapses by microglia (Figure 6). We did not measure synapse engulfment by microglia while inactivating retinogeniculate synapses from both eyes (dual inactivation). However, based on the total active caspase-3 signal (Figure 2) in the dual inactivation scenario, we do not expect to see an increase in engulfment of synaptic material by microglia.</p><p>We did not measure astrocyte-mediated engulfment with single or dual inactivation, as we did not see a robust caspase-3 dependent phenotype in synapse engulfment by astrocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 1 - It is not clear from this figure whether the authors are measuring caspase 3 in dendritic compartments or in dying relay neurons in the thalamus. The authors state that &quot;either&quot; whole cell death (1B) or smaller punctate signals (1F) were observed. When quantifying &quot;photons&quot; in Figure 1E, it appears most of the signal captured will be of dying relay neurons. What determined which signal was observed, and what is being quantified in Figure 1E? This also applies to the quantifications being reported in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>The quantification includes both types of signals – it is sum of all active caspase-3 signal within the dLGN boundary. We note that there is a significant amount of punctate signal in the TeTxLC-inactivated dLGN. Unfortunately, due to file compression, these signals are not clearly visible in the submitted manuscript file. We have provided high resolution figures in this revision.</p><p>As argued above in the response to the public review, apoptotic relay neurons in TeTxLC-inactivated dLGN (not the general thalamus area) occur as a direct consequence of synapse inactivation. Therefore, active caspase-3 signals in these relay neurons should be included in the quantification.</p><p>We believe it is the extent of synapse inactivation (i.e., the number of synapses that are inactivated) that determines whether dLGN relay neuron apoptosis occurs or not. Such apoptosis is expected considering the nature of the apoptosis signaling cascade. In the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, release of cytochrome-c from mitochondria induces cleavage of the initiator caspase, caspase-9, and caspase-9 in turn cleaves the executioner caspases, caspase-3/7, which causes apoptosis. Caspase-3 can cleave upstream factors in the apoptosis pathway, leading to explosive amplification of caspase-3 activity (McComb et al., DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aau9433). When a relay neuron receives a few inactivated synapses, caspase-3 activation in the postsynaptic dendrite can remain local (as we observed in Figure 1), constrained by mechanisms such as proteasomal degradation of cleaved caspase-3 (Erturk et al., DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3121-13.2014). However, when a relay neuron receives many inactivated synapses, the cumulative caspase-3 activity induced in the dendrite can overwhelm negative regulation and lead to significantly higher levels of caspase-3 activity in entire dendrites (Figure S4B) through positive feedback amplification, eventually leading to caspase-3 activation in entire relay neurons. Please see line 127-140 and line 403-413 for our discussion in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 5 - Figures 5c-d and Fig 6 are confounded by pseudoreplication, whereby performing statistics on 50-60 microglia inflates statistical significance. Could the authors show all these data per mouse?</p></disp-quote><p>If we understand the reviewer correctly, the reviewer is suggesting that reporting measurements from multiple microglia in one animal constitutes pseudo-replication. This is correct in a strict sense, as microglia in the same animal are more likely to be similar than microglia from different animals. In the revised version, we have plotted the data by animal in Figure S11 and S13. The observations remain valid. However, we would like to point out that averaging measurements from all microglia in each animal and report by mouse is very conservative, as measurements from microglia in the same animal still vary greatly due to cell-to-cell differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Although the authors are not the only ones to use this strategy, it is worth noting that performing all microglial experiments in Cx3cr1 heterozygotes could lead to alterations in microglial function that may not be reflective of their homeostatic roles.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that Cx3cr1 heterozygosity could cause alterations in microglial physiology.</p><p>While Cx3cr1 heterozygosity may impact microglia physiology, we note that the engulfment assay in Figure 5 is comparing microglia in <italic>Cx3cr1+/-</italic>; <italic>Casp3+/-</italic> and <italic>Cx3cr1+/-</italic>; <italic>Casp3-/-</italic> animals. Therefore, the impact of Cx3cr1 heterozygosity is controlled for in our experiment, and the observed difference in engulfed synaptic material in microglia is an effect specific to caspase-3 deficiency. However, we acknowledge that this difference could be quantitatively affected by Cx3cr1 heterozygosity.</p><p>It is important to note that we did not perform all microglia engulfment analyses using Cx3cr1<sup>+/-</sup> mice. We have edited the manuscript to make this more clear. In the activity-dependent microglia engulfment analysis performed in Figure 6, we used <italic>Casp3+/+</italic> and <italic>Casp3-/-</italic> animals and detected microglia with anti-Iba1 immunostaining. Therefore, the impact of Cx3cr1 heterozygosity is not a problem for this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor:</p><p>(1) Figures are presented out of order, which makes the manuscript difficult to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised text regarding the segregation analysis to align with the order of figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure S3 is very confusing- the terms &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; are used in three or four partly overlapping contexts (which eye, which injection, which panel or subpanel of the figure is being referred to).

We used multiple separate t-tests because we wanted to show how genotype effects change with increasing thresholds, whereas two-way ANOVA only provides one overall p-value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Could the authors clarify why the percentage overlap (in the controls) is so different between Figure 3C and Figure S3C, and why different thresholds are applied?</p></disp-quote><p>This difference is primary due to difference in age. Figure 3 and Figure S5 are acquired at age of P10, while Figure S3 is acquired at P8. While the segregation process is largely complete by P8, the segregation continues from P8 to P10. Therefore, overlap measured at P10 will be lower than that measured at P8. If we compare overlap at the same threshold (e.g., 10%) and at the same age in Figure 3 and S5, the overlap is very similar.</p><p>The choice of threshold is related to the methods of labeling. In Figure 3, RGC terminals are labeled with AlexaFlour conjugated cholera toxin subunit-beta (CTB). In Figure S3 and S5, RGC axons are labeled by expression of fluorescent proteins. Labeling with CTB only labels membrane surfaces but yields stronger and slightly different signals at fine scales than labeling with fluorescent protein which are cell fillers. For Figure S3 and S5 (which use fluorescent protein labeling), higher thresholds such as those used in Figure 3 (which use CTB labeling) can be applied and the same trend still holds, but the data will be noisier. Regardless of the small difference in thresholds used, the important observation is that the defects in TeTxLC-injected or caspase-3 deficient animals are clear across multiple thresholds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Many describe the eye-specific segregation process as being complete &quot;between P8-10&quot;. Other studies have quantified ESS at P10 (Stevens 2007). The authors state they did all quantifications at P8 (l. 82) and refer to Figure 3, but Figure 3 shows images from P10, whereas Figure S3 shows data from P8.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not say we performed all quantification at P8. In line 85, we said “To validate the efficacy of our synapse inactivation method, we injected AAV-hSyn-TeTxLC into the right eye of wildtype E15 embryos and analyzed the segregation of eye-specific territories at postnatal day 8 (P8), when the segregation process is largely complete”. The age of postnatal day 8 in this context is specifically referring to the experiment shown in Figure S3. For the segregation analysis in Figure 3, we specifically stated that the experiment was conducted at P10 (line 277).</p><p>Although the experiment in Figure S3 is conducted at P8, and Figure S5 and Figure 3 show results at P10, each dataset always included appropriate age-matched controls. P8 is generally considered an age where segregation is mostly complete and sufficient for us to assess the potency of TeTxLC-delivered AAV on eye segregation. We don’t think performing the experiment shown in Figure S3 at P8 impacts the interpretation of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Is Figure 6 also using Cx3cr1 GFP to label microglia? This is not clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight. In Figure 6 microglia are labeled by anti-Iba1 immunostaining. We have clarified this in figure legends and text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors quantified the caspase-3 activity using immunostaining and confocal microscopy (Figures 1B-E). They may need to verify the result (increased level of activated caspase-3 upon synapse inactivation) using alternative methods, such as western blotting.</p></disp-quote><p>Both western blot and immunostaining are based on antibody-antigen interaction. These two methods are not likely sufficiently independent. Additionally, to perform a western blot, we would need to surgically collect the TeTxLC-inactivated dLGN to avoid sample contamination from other brain regions. Such collection at the age we are interested in (P5) is very challenging. We have tested the anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody using caspase-3 deficient mice and we can confirm it is a highly specific antibody that doesn’t generate signal in the caspase-3 deficient tissue samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Does caspase-3 deficiency alter the density of microglia or astrocytes in dLGN?</p></disp-quote><p>No. Neither the density of microglia nor astrocytes changed with caspase-3 deficiency. In the case of microglia, we find that the mean density of microglia per unit area of dLGN is virtually the same in wild type and caspase-3 deficient mice (two-tailed t test P = 0.8556, 6 wild type and 5 Casp3<sup>-/-</sup> mice). Some overviews showing microglia in dLGNs of wildtype and caspase-3 deficient mice can be found in Figure S10. Similarly for astrocytes, we did not observe overt changes in astrocytes dLGN density linked to caspase-3 deficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) During dLGN eye-specific segregation in normal developing animals, did the authors observe different levels of activated caspase-3 in different regions (territories)?</p></disp-quote><p>For normal developing animals, the activated caspase-3 signal is generally sparse, and it is difficult to distinguish whether the signal is related to synapse elimination. For animals receiving TeTxLC-injection, we did notice that in the dLGN contralateral to the injection, where most inactivated synapses are located, the punctate caspase-3 signal tends to concentrate on the ventral-medial side of the dLGN (Figure 1B), which is the region preferentially innervated by the contralateral eye.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Recording of NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents may not be necessary for demonstrating that caspase 3 is essential for dLGN circuit refinement. In addition, the PPR may not necessarily reflect the number of innervations that a dLGN neuron receives. Instead, showing the changes in the frequency of mEPSCs (or synapse/spine density) may be more supportive.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We have performed the suggested mEPSC measurements and reported the results in revised Figure 4D-F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Why is caspase 3 activation enhanced (compared to control) only at 4 months of age, when A-beta deposition has not formed yet, but not at later time points in AD mice (Figure S17)?</p></disp-quote><p>A prevailing hypothesis in the field is that the form of A-beta that is most neurotoxic is the soluble oligomeric form, not the fibril form that leads to plaque deposition. As the oligomeric form appears before plaque deposition, the enhanced caspase-3 activation we observed at 4-month may reflect an increase in oligomeric A-beta, which occurs before any visible A-beta plaque formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The manuscript can be made more concise, and the figures more organized.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed superfluous details and corrected text-figure mismatches in the revised manuscript to improve readability.</p></body></sub-article></article>
