osteoarthritis (OA) progression. However, the relationship between pain and OA progression remains largely unknown. Here we report osteoblast secret prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) during aberrant subchondral bone remodeling induces pain and OA progression in mice. Specific deletion of the major PGE2 producing enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) in osteoblasts or PGE2 receptor EP4 in peripheral nerve markedly ameliorates OA symptoms. Mechanistically, PGE2 sensitizes dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by modifying the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, evidenced by that genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 in DRG neurons can substantially attenuate OA. Moreover, drugs targeting aberrant subchondral bone remodeling also attenuates OA through rebalancing PGE2 production and Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 modification. Thus, aberrant subchondral remodeling induced Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 neuronal modification is an important player in OA and is a potential therapeutic target in multiple skeletal degenerative diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many people will suffer from joint pain as they age, particularly in their knees. The most common cause of this pain is osteoarthritis, a disease that affects a tissue inside joints called cartilage. In a healthy knee, cartilage acts as a shock absorber. It cushions the ends of bones and enables them to move smoothly against one another. But in osteoarthritis, cartilage gradually wears away. As a result, the bones within a joint rub against each other whenever a person moves. This makes activities such as running or climbing stairs painful.</p><p>But how does this pain arise? Previous work has implicated cells called osteoblasts. Osteoblasts are found in the area of the bone just below the cartilage. They produce new bone tissue throughout our lives, enabling our bones to regenerate and repair. Each time we move, forces acting on the knee joint activate osteoblasts. The cells respond by releasing a key molecule called PGE2, which is a factor in pain pathways. The joints of people with osteoarthritis produce too much PGE2. But exactly how this leads to increased pain sensation has been unclear.</p><p>Zhu et al. now complete this story by working out how PGE2 triggers pain. Experiments in mice reveal that PGE2 irritates the nerve fibers that carry pain signals from the knee joint to the brain. It does this by activating a channel protein called Na<sub>v</sub>1.8, which allows sodium ions through the membranes of those nerve fibers. Zhu et al. show that, in a mouse model of osteoarthritis, Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 opens too widely in response to binding of PGE2, so the nerve cells become overactive and transmit a stronger pain sensation. This means that even small movements cause intense pain signals to travel from the joints to the brain.</p><p>Building on their findings, Zhu et al. developed a drug that acts directly on bone to reduce PGE2 production, and show that this drug reduces pain in mice with osteoarthritis. At present, there are no treatments that reverse the damage that occurs during osteoarthritis, but further testing will determine whether this new drug could one day relieve joint pain in patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>osteoblast</kwd><kwd>PGE2</kwd><kwd>Nav1.8</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR071432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR063943</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Osteoblastic PGE2 induces pain and OA progression by Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 modification and serves as a potential target multiple skeletal pain and degenerations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Subchondral bone is an integral component of the joint, absorbing compressive forces during movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martel-Pelletier et al., 2016</xref>). Physiological subchondral bone remodeling maintains its structural integrity and supports the overlying articular cartilage. Age or trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayami et al., 2004</xref>) related alteration of subchondral bone is a principal risk factor of osteoarthritis (OA), the most common joint disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berenbaum et al., 2018</xref>) characterized by cartilage destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glasson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2014a</xref>), subchondral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suri et al., 2007</xref>) and synovitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benito et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sellam and Berenbaum, 2010</xref>). Pain, as the major symptom for OA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lane et al., 2010</xref>), often leads to physical disability and mortality in senior patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Although the major local source is not clearly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malfait and Schnitzer, 2013</xref>), there is evidence showing that synovitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sellam and Berenbaum, 2010</xref>) and subchondral bone marrow lesion (BML) are highly relevant to OA pain. BML is a fluid enriched area under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is characterized as bone marrow edema, fibrosis, microfractures or trabecular pattern alterations in pathological examinations, with high relevance to abnormal bone remodeling. However, how subchondral BML induces OA pain, still remains largely unknown. We previously showed that aberrant subchondral bone remodeling in response to altered mechanical loading patterns in OA was initiated by over-activation of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). High levels of subchondral TGF-β1 signaling induces mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) clustering and leads to the uncoupling of osteoblastic bone formation, osteoclastic bone resorption and angiogenesis. Moreover, we found overactivated osteoclasts in BML aggravated OA pain by secreting the axon guidance molecule Netrin-1 to induce subchondral sensory innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). The increased sensory innervation provides a structural base for the transmission of nociceptive signals from the subchondral bone to the central nervous system. However, how these nerve fibers are activated and sensitized during OA progression remains to be elucidated.</p><p>The persistent low grade of local inflammation is another hallmark of OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Midwood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tu et al., 2019</xref>). During the uncoupled bone remodeling in OA progression, a series of pro-inflammatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kapoor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sellam and Berenbaum, 2010</xref>) like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) are released into the subchondral bone area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Massicotte et al., 2002</xref>). We previously showed that PGE2 was a crucial factor in both pain sensation and bone metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tu et al., 2019</xref>). However, the main source remains largely unknown. We newly discovered a feedback mechanism on sensory nerve regulation of bone mass. PGE2 concentration is inversely related to bone mass and sensory nerves monitors bone density by responding to the concentration of PGE2 in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). We found that when bone mass is decreased, the enzymatic activity of cyclooxygenase 2 (<italic>Cox2</italic>) in osteoblastic lineage cells was significantly increased and thus catalyzes more arachidonic acid into PGE2. At the early stage of OA, the bone density is temporarily decreased, which resembles the low bone density as seen in osteoporosis. Currently, there is still lack of information whether the increased PGE2 in OA subchondral bone is also attributed to the increased <italic>Cox2</italic> activity in osteoblastic cells in response to low bone mass.</p><p>PGE2 functions as an inflammatory mediator and a neuromodulator that alters neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Samad et al., 2001</xref>). In the four types of G-protein-coupled EP receptors (EP1-EP4) that mediate the functions of PGE2, EP4 receptor is considered as the primary mediator of PGE2- evoked inflammatory pain hypersensitivity and sensitization of sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyd et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McCoy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Southall and Vasko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor-Clark et al., 2008</xref>), as evidenced by that the specific EP4 receptor antagonists could reduce acute and chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakao et al., 2007</xref>), including OA pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Magid, 2014</xref>). Increased neuronal excitability contributes to the generation of hypersensitivity in various types of chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malfait and Schnitzer, 2013</xref>). PGE2 has been shown to potentiate several ion channels in neurons to enhance neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Funk, 2001</xref>). Voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<sub>V</sub>), a member of the tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channel (TTX-R), is mainly expressed in small- and medium-sized Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and their fibers. The Na<sub>V</sub> is responsible for initiating and propagating electrical signal transmission by inducing Na<sup>+</sup> influx to start action potential firing. PGE2 has been shown to modulate the sodium current of the TTX-R in DRG neurons and promote Nav1.8 trafficking to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">England et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the PGE2 induced neuronal hypersensitivity is likely to be mediated by the Nav 1.8 during OA progression.</p><p>Among the 9 subtypes of Na<sub>V</sub>s (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1–1.9), Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akopian et al., 1996</xref>) is the main drug target due to its highly relevant to pain signal transmission, and restricted distribution in primary nociceptive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akopian et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Julius and Basbaum, 2001</xref>). Gain of function mutations in human in the promoter region of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 directly induces pain hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duan et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, animals lacking Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 display significant lower mechanical pain sensitivity with modest changes in heat or innocuous touch sensitivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akopian et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basbaum et al., 2009</xref>). This specificity of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 in transducing mechanical pain signals makes it highly possible in the participation of mechanical allodynia in OA. Moreover, post-transcriptional modifications of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 including phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gold et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hudmon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2012</xref>) and methylglyoxalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bierhaus et al., 2012</xref>) further regulate its activity. A recent study demonstrated that inhibition of the expression of Na<sub>V</sub>s in nociceptive neurons was effective in OA pain alleviation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miller et al., 2017</xref>), with the detailed molecular mechanism remained to be clarified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Strickland et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we take the initiative to show that aberrant subchondral bone remodeling contributes to neuronal hypersensitivity during OA progression. Excessive PGE2 is synthesized by osteoblastic lineage cells in response to the low bone density at the early stage of OA. Excessive PGE2 sensitize sensory fibers innervates subchondral bone by upregulating the expression of sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 in both subchondral bone nerve fibers and DRG neuron body, which contributes to peripheral mechanical allodynia during OA progression. Therefore, we developed a small molecule conjugate by linking the TGFβ type receptor 1 (Tβ1R) inhibitor (LY-2109761) and alendronate (Aln) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayami et al., 2004</xref>) to achieve bone-targeted delivery. We used this conjugate (Aln-Ly) as a proof of concept drug to test whether reversing the aberrant bone remodeling by synergistically inhibiting osteoclast bone resorption and the excessive TGF-β activity can substantially reduce the PGE2 production and subsequent mechanical hypersensitivity that generated in OA subchondral bone.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 was modified in the subchondral bone and mediate OA progression</title><p>To identify the primary voltage-gated sodium channel in subchondral sensory fibers that responsible for mechanical hypersensitivity during OA progression, we tested the expression levels of different sensory related sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>s in OA mice post anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT). The transcription levels of mRNAs that encode Na<sub>V</sub>s in DRG including Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 were measured by qPCR using mRNA isolated from mouse ipsilateral L3-5 DRGs one month post-ACLT or sham surgery. Compares to the sham-operated group, the expression of mRNA encoding Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 increased 2.5 folds in the ACLT group as the highest upregulation among all the Na<sub>V</sub>s. The mRNAs encoding Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 showed moderate upregulation in the ACLT group relative to that of the Sham group while the changes of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 or Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 were not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Therefore, we further investigated Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 protein expression in the immune-histological analysis of OA subchondral bone. The intensity of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 immunofluorescence in subchondral bone was also elevated about 2 to 3 folds in OA mice compared to sham- operated mice one- or two-months post-surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). To examine whether the increase of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 expression is limited to in a certain subtype(s) of the DRG neuron that innervates subchondral bone in OA mice, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 was co-stained with different markers for sensory nerve subtypes based on the current classification of DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>). The expression rate of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 in total nerve fibers (labeled by pan neuron marker PGP9.5) innervated in subchondral bone significantly increased post-ACLT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,f</xref>). Moreover, the elevated Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 expression was highly co-localized with the peptidergic nociceptor marked by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brain et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b,f</xref>) and mechanosensitive low-threshold mechanoceptors (labeled by PIEZO2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eijkelkamp et al., 2013</xref>). The expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 was also slightly elevated in the synovium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref> 1 hr, j). Both western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) and immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref> 1 g, i) of ipsilateral lumbar 3–5 DRG confirmed the upregulation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 expression at the DRG level. We then further validated whether DRG neurons with upregulated Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 expression directly innervates fibers in the subchondral bone. We injected a neurophilic fluorescent dye (DiI) into the subchondral bone to label the distal nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferreira-Gomes et al., 2010</xref>). We found that the Na<sub>V</sub>1.8<sup>+</sup> neurons labeled by DiI significantly increased in the DRG neurons of OA rats relative to sham-operated rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g,h</xref>), indicating that DiI was transported into DRG neurons by the sensory fibers innervated subchondral bone in a retrograde manner. These results suggest that the expression of pain-related sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 is upregulated in DRG neurons and their axons that innervate subchondral bone during progression. We then examined the association between Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 neuronal activity and OA pain. Von Frey test showed that the hind paw withdrawal threshold (HPWT) dropped nearly 60% and maintained at this level throughout the two month-period post ACLT relative to the sham-operated group, suggesting that development of mechanical allodynia in OA mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). To assess the potential role of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 in DRG neuronal excitability, we used an in vivo DRG imaging in Pirt<sup>GCaMP3fl/-</sup>mice that we recently developed. In this genetically targeted mice, genetic-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP3 is specifically expressed in &gt;95% of all DRG neurons under the control of the Pirt promoter. In the Pirt<sup>GCaMP3fl/-</sup>mice, the excitability of the nociceptive neurons in DRG can be visualized by fluorescence signals of calcium influx.

To date, the major local source and pathophysiological mechanisms of OA pain remain poorly understood, impeding the development of mechanism based strategies for OA pain attenuation. Based on clinical observations, in this study, we hypothesized that aberrant subchondral bone remodeling could be highly responsible for OA pain. Aberrant bone remodeling significantly stimulates the PGE2 production in subchondral bone, with the osteoblastic cell being the major source of production. Accordingly, OA pain alleviation can be achieved by specifically knocking out the PGE2 producing enzyme Cox2 in osteoblast or its receptor EP4 in peripheral sensory nerve, likely through reducing the expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8. In particular, the direct ablation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8<sup>+</sup> DRG neurons demonstrates that Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 overexpression at least partially mediates neuronal hypersensitivity in OA progression. Importantly, we demonstrated that pharmacologically inhibition of aberrant bone remodeling has superior treatment effect than purely blocking pain transduction pathway as evidenced by that conjugate improved subchondral bone structure, attenuated cartilage degeneration and ameliorated OA pain simultaneously while deleting Na<sub>V</sub>1.8<sup>+</sup> neurons only alleviated OA pain without disease-modifying effect in OA pathologies.</p><p>Generally, central (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuner, 2010</xref>) and peripheral sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miller et al., 2017</xref>) are two principal components for OA pain. Since surgical removal of a part of arthritic knee joint in total knee replacement can immediately relieve OA pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Skou et al., 2015</xref>), it is believed that peripheral input is indispensable in OA pain sensitization. Several joint structures are plausible sources of OA pain (e.g., the synovium, tendons), but clinical tests do not reliably attribute the pain to those structures. Synovium, because of its dense innervation of sensory nerves, is thought to be one of the important sources of OA pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kc et al., 2016</xref>). Low grade of synovitis in OA could also be able to stimulate sensory nerve endings. However, human studies showed that synovial sensory nerve declined in some of the degenerative OA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dominique Muschter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sellam and Berenbaum, 2010</xref>), making this hypothesis inconclusive. Similarly, the increase of vascular and nerve growth in meniscus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashraf et al., 2011</xref>) and fat pad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bohnsack et al., 2005</xref>) suggests that they might also be a source of pain. Several lines of clinical evidence point to the potential role of subchondral bone in the mechanical allodynia during OA progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwoh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). This is clinically supported by the immediate pain relief in OA patient after removal of degraded cartilage and underlying subchondral bone in joint surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mittag et al., 2016</xref>). Since articular cartilage is not innervated by sensory nerve, therefore, the densely innervated subchondral bone could be an essential local source for clinical OA pain. Identifying the main source of pain and related mechanisms is essential for the treatment of OA pain. The subchondral bone transmits mechanical loads produced by body weight and muscle activity. It is highly adaptable, with the ability to model and remodel in response to loading stresses. During OA development, the subchondral bone undergoes aberrant remodeling, leading to pathologic lesions. MRI studies have shown lower bone mineral density, also known as bone marrow lesions (BML), and more severe disruption of subchondral bone architecture in patients with OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Majumdar et al., 2004</xref>). Subchondral BML is the first sign of OA in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Libicher et al., 2005</xref>) and strongly correlate with knee pain in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davies-Tuck et al., 2009</xref>). We previously have demonstrated aberrant bone remodeling of subchondral bone at the onset and pathological development of OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>). Studies have showed perivascular sensory and sympathetic nerve fibers breach the subchondral bone in OA compared to normal joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mapp and Walsh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walsh et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, we found that excessive Netrin-1 secreted by osteoclasts in subchondral bone induces sensory nerve axonal growth in OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). We also found that during bone remodeling, PGE2, produced from arachidonic acid by the enzymatic activity of Cox2, activates EP4 in sensory nerves. In the present study, we found that the abnormal bone remodeling and temporary decrease of bone density in subchondral bone at the early stage of OA resembles the pathological changes as seen in osteoporosis. This explains why Cox2 activity and subsequent PGE2 production increased in response to the structural changes in OA subchondral bone. The increased nociceptive innervation to OA subchondral bone secondary to excessive netrin-1 secretion by the osteoclasts therefore favors the PGE2 induced neuronal excitations. Taken together, we believe that the development of OA pain is a synergistic result involving central sensitization in spinal cord in conjunction with peripheral input from subchondral bone, synovium, meniscus and fat pad etc.</p><p>The molecular mechanism of neuronal sensitization remains a poorly understood facet of OA pathophysiology. It is widely accepted that neuronal plasticity including activation, transcriptional modification and post-transcriptional of ion channels related to electrical excitability could contribute to the generation of chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Woolf and Salter, 2000</xref>). Giving the essential role of action potential firing in peripheral nerve input, the possible involvement of ion channels was investigated in recent studies. Our findings suggest that Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 is the most upregulated Na<sub>V</sub> channel with a restricted localization in DRG. We therefore focused on Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 to the possible molecular events based on the extensive over-activation of subchondral bone remodeling in OA progression. We found the expression rate of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 was significantly elevated in subchondral bone marrow, sciatic nerve and ipsilateral lumbar DRG levels. And the further screening analysis showed the expression rate of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 mainly elevated in CGRP<sup>+</sup> nociceptive fiber and piezo2<sup>+</sup> low threshold mechanoceptive fibers. This pattern of modification of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 expression in sensory neurons could explain the high sensitivity in polymodal nociception and mechanoception after ACLT. Functionally, this upregulation of expression led to larger Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 currents and higher excitability of DRG neurons after ACLT. The Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 currents are thought to be essential for action potential firing at the initial state. Being activated by PGE2, the lager Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 currents could make the DRGs easier for action potential firing, thus transmitting the pain signals into higher centers for mechanical allodynia. In the short term, phosphorylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 by PGE2 may increase the inward currents by opening the Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 ion gating mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hudmon et al., 2008</xref>). Also, PGE2 increases the expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 in a relatively long term of stimulation by PKA signaling. However, the role of other modalities of modulations like phosphorylation, methylglyoxalation need to be investigated in future studies. Nevertheless, future studies should be conducted to explain how this elevation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 could be integrated and translated into the central nervous system as pain signals.</p><p>Pain sensation and OA progression are often dissociated. Late stage of radiographic OA patients with extensive subchondral bone sclerosis may result in less pain sensation and early stage patients with significant subchondral BML can be very painful. Moreover, the anti-nerve growth factor (NGF) tanezumab administration to OA patients relief pain with no significant attenuation on OA cartilage protection or subchondral bone sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lane and Corr, 2017</xref>). Consistently, although pain relief can be achieved to some extent by targeting Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, the cartilage or subchondral bone was not significantly protected in OA progression after ACLT in our study. These results indicate a comprehensive therapy for OA should target upstream events that cause OA progression and pain. Here, we provide a proof of principle for the potential of small molecule drug balancing aberrant bone remodeling to attenuate mechanical allodynia and OA progression in general. We achieved the bone-targeted TGF-β inhibition by conjugating the TGF-β type I receptor inhibitor (LY-2109761 with an osteoclast targeting drug alendronate. Consistent with our previous findings, the conjugate rebalanced the uncoupled subchondral bone remodeling and reduced over-activated osteoblastic bone formation through targeting aberrant TGF-β signaling in ACLT mice model. This rebalance was effective in pain alleviation through a reduction of excessive PGE2 released into subchondral bone marrow and down-regulation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 expression and electric property to reduce mechanical allodynia in OA. Meanwhile, the reconstruction of subchondral bone architecture protected the overlying cartilage destruction and delayed the progression of the overall OA process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We believe this mechanism based management of OA pain may shed light on the strategy of various musculoskeletal disorders with chronic pain symptom. Nevertheless, because the pharmacological or toxicological aspect of the conjugate in vivo are largely unknown, further enhancement of therapeutic effect may be achieved with optimization of dosing and delivery strategies.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The working model of osteoblastic PGE2 induces OA progression by Na<sub>V</sub>1.8

Four-micrometer sagittal oriented sections of the medial compartment of left knees were processed for hematoxylin and eosin, safranin orange and fast green and Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining (Sigma). For immunohistology and immunofluorescence, slides (4 μm for immunohistology, 20 μm for DRG, 60 μm for knee immunofluorescence) were incubated with antigen retrieval buffer (Dako, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.chem.agilent.com/store/productDetail.jsp?catalogId=S169984-2">S169984-2</ext-link>) at 96°C for 15 min, gradually cooled to room temperature and washed with tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST). After blocking, the slides were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibody (1:200) was used to incubate the samples for 1 hr at room temperature. For immunohistochemical staining, a horseradish peroxidase–streptavidin detection system (Dako) was used to detect immunoactivity, followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). For immunofluorescence, the fluorescent conjugated secondary antibody (1:200) was applied.

Briefly, after neuron seeding for 24 hr, media were replaced for the cells to be prepared for transfection. Lipofectamine RNAi MAX (13778100, Invitrogen) was diluted in OptiMEM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/31985062">31985062</ext-link>, Thermal Fisher) and incubated for 5 min, then mixed with siRNAs or scramble control RNAs for five mins. Diluted DNA and Lipofectamine RNAi MAX were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then used to transfect the DRG neurons. The medium was replaced 10 hr following transfection and neurons were harvested 24 hr after transfection. Similarly, the human GFP labeled MSC was purchased from Cyagen and is cultured in MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1X penicillin and streptomycin solution (Gibco).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vivo Pirt-GCaMP3 DRG imaging</title><p>We used Pirt-GCaMP3<sup>f/-</sup> mice in DRG imaging.

The threshold force required to elicit withdrawal of the paw was determined three times on each hind paw and averaged.</p><p>Gait analysis was performed on mice 4 weeks after ACLT by the CatWalk system (Noldus) according to our previous protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, each mouse was placed walkway and allowed to allow the free movement from one side to the other side for at least three times. Mice were trained previously in the formal experiment. After the recording of mouse gait, several parameters were generated, and 5 of the most relevant parameters to OA pain were analyzed. (1) stands, (2) maximal contact at. (3) maximal (4) swing and (5) single stance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Western blotting and ELISA</title><p>Western blotting was performed on the lysates of DRG neuron culture and tibial subchondral bone marrow. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories). After incubation with specific primary and secondary antibodies, signals were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies used are as follow rabbit anti-Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 (1:500, ASC-016, Alomone), rabbit anti-CREB (1:2000, #9179, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-pCREB (1:1000, 9198, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-PKA c- <bold>c-α</bold> (1:1000, 4782, Cell Signaling Technology) and rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:1000, 5174, Cell Signaling Technology). The experiments were repeated three times and a representative film was selected.</p><p>To measure the concentration of PGE2 in the subchondral bone marrow of mice tibiae, a PGE2 ELISA kit (514010, Cayman) was used according to the manufacturer’s manual. Briefly, we harvest the subchondral bone and then homogenized by ultrasound. The supernatant was aspired after high-speed centrifugation (13,200 g) for 10 mins. The concentration of PGE2 was normalized by total protein concentration using the BCA assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>ChIP assay</title><p>The ChIP assay was carried out using the epiquik ChIP Kit (Epigentek catalog number: P-2002–1). Briefly, the cultured lumbar DRG cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde at for 10 min. After the collection of the cell, the sonication was performed until the DNA was broken into fragments with a mean length of 200 bps – 500 bps. The samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 2 mg of rabbit antibodies against pCreb1 (CST, 1:50) for 90 min at room temperature and 10% of the sample for immunoprecipitation was used as an input (a positive control). After purification, the DNA fragments were amplified using qRT-PCR with the primers for Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 promoter listed in Supplementary Table 2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Retrograde tracing</title><p>Retrograde tracing was performed at 3-month-old male SD rats (Charles River Laboratories) (300–400 g, n = 6 per group) 2 months after ACLT. According to the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferreira-Gomes et al., 2010</xref>), a 20 mm parapatellar incision was made over the medial side of the left knee. Ipsilateral femoral and tibial subchondral bone were subject to retrograde labeling. We injected 2 μl DiI (Molecular Probes; with 5 mg/ml in N, N dimethylformamide) into the femoral and tibial subchondral bone areas using a Hamilton syringe with a 27-gauge needle. Immediately after injection, bone wax was used to seal the drilling holes to prevent tracer leakage. Animals were euthanized 2 weeks after retrograde injection and the left lumbar DRGs (L3-5) were isolated for fluorescence detection. Twenty sections from each DRG were used for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented as means ± standard deviations. Error bars represent standard deviations. We used unpaired or paired two-tailed Student’s t-tests for comparisons between two groups, and one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test for multiple comparisons, in comparison between three or more groups, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test were used. All data demonstrated a normal distribution and similar variation between groups. For all experiments, p&lt;0.05 was considered to be significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank David D Ginty (Harvard Medical School) for Cox-2<italic> <sup>floxed</sup></italic> mice and Jenni Weems and Rachel Box in the editorial office at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Johns Hopkins University for manuscript editing.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Software, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Validation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Supervision, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: human study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Boards.

This is seen as a very active area of investigation with strong clinical relevance.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Aberrant subchondral osteoblastic metabolism modifies Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 for osteoarthritis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and we have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus, the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers believe that the study is well done with appropriate controls and provides a clear conclusion consistent with the data. The implications extend beyond bone pathophysiology into the interaction between nervous system and bone metabolism in general terms and could initiate novel therapeutic approaches. Nevertheless, several issues need to be addressed to further strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that osteoblast are central to inducing OA pain by secreting excessive PGE2, which is clearly novel and interesting. A question remains whether osteoclasts are also involved in inducing OA pain and, if so, what might be the mechanism?</p><p>2) Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 is an important ion channel for chronic pain sensation. Could a Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 inhibitor be effective for OA pain treatment and disease progression? Please expound on this concept.</p><p>3) The authors developed a bone targeting conjugate drug for OA disease control based on the aberrant osteoblastic function in OA. How is this conjugate linked to osteoblast metabolism and Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 function? Please describe the drug target and working mechanistic hypothesis.</p><p>4) The relationship between OA pain and disease progression remains unclear, as noted by the authors. The anti-NGF antibody tanezumab shows efficacy in OA pain, even while certain patients suffer a rapid progression of joint degeneration after tanezumab therapy. The authors are encouraged to offer plausible explanations regarding this apparent clinical dissociation.</p><p>5) The authors stated: &quot;Human genetic mutations of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 directly induce pain hypersensitivity&quot;. The authors should make clear that the mutation identified in the promoter region of the human <italic>Scn10a</italic> gene (encoding for Na<sub>v</sub>1.8) is the gain-of-function mutation.</p><p>6) The authors need to justify why they chose ACLT OA model, instead of DMM OA model.</p><p>7) In figure legends, the authors need to disclose if one-way or two-way ANOVA was used followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. Some of the data involving two parameters need to use two-way ANOVA for statistical analysis. For example, Figure 1G involves different time points and different animal models, two-way ANOVA should be used.</p><p>8) The authors do need to describe which statistical method was used following ANOVA in the figure legends.</p><p>9) The authors need to provide more information on <italic>Pirt-GCaMP3<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>10) The authors have used the electronic Von Frey method to test behavior. Is there any evidence to support the choice of electronic Von Frey over manual Von Frey? Please specify if manual Von Frey was also used, and if any adjustments were made to distinguish true pain responses from &quot;touch-on&quot; responses and ambulation.</p><p>11) The author developed a small molecule conjugate (Aln-Ly) but did not mention the injection method in the animal study – please address this and expand on how the appropriate regime and dosage was planned since the toxicology of this conjugate is unknown.</p><p>12) Please indicate how many graders evaluated the OA score in the Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57656.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that osteoblast are central to inducing OA pain by secreting excessive PGE2, which is clearly novel and interesting. A question remains whether osteoclasts are also involved in inducing OA pain and, if so, what might be the mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>We highly appreciate the positive comments from the reviewers. We agree that osteoblastic PGE2 plays a central role in inducing chronic OA pain during disease progression. Nevertheless, osteoclast also actively participate in OA progression and chronic hypersensitivity induction. As we know that osteoclasts and osteoblasts cooperate in bone metabolism. Our previous work demonstrated that subchondral osteoclasts induce OA progression through TGF-β pathway<sup>[1]</sup>. Moreover, osteoclasts secret axon guidance molecule Netrin-1 to induce sensory nerve innervation in subchondral bone area to induce OA pain hypersensitivity<sup>[2]</sup>. Collectively, we believe that osteoclast and osteoblast cooperatively participate in OA pain induction during aberrant subchondral bone metabolism through secreting a cascade of biologically active molecules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 is an important ion channel for chronic pain sensation. Could a Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 inhibitor be effective for OA pain treatment and disease progression? Please expound on this concept.</p></disp-quote><p>Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 is the most important voltage gated sodium channel in mechanical pain sensation. As OA pain is mainly mechanical hypersensitivity, we believe that the effectiveness of Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 inhibitor could be at least in two parts: the short term and long term. In the short term, Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 inhibitors could directly block action potential initiation in peripheral sensory nerve endings in subchondral bone area. In the long term, Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 inhibitors attenuate the chronic hypersensitivity which in turn could tunedown the local inflammatory environment as a feedback. In this sense, Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 inhibitors could be highly effective in OA pain management.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors developed a bone targeting conjugate drug for OA disease control based on the aberrant osteoblastic function in OA. How is this conjugate linked to osteoblast metabolism and Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 function? Please describe the drug target and working mechanistic hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>The conjugate consists of two basic elements: the bone targeting alendronate and the TGF-β inhibitor. We link these two elements through hydroxyl group bond which could break as the conjugate reaches the bone surface. Since TGF-β is the upstream of aberrant bone metabolism in OA subchondral bone<sup>[1]</sup>, this conjugate could effectively rebalance the overactivated osteoblastic bone metabolism in subchondral bone area. As overactivated osteoblastic metabolism is blocked in subchondral bone, the local PGE2 level is reduced and Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 modification could be halted. Thus, the alendronate TGF-β conjugate could be therapeutically effective for OA pain management and disease progression by targeting the most upstream signals in bone metabolism.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57656-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>4) The relationship between OA pain and disease progression remains unclear, as noted by the authors. The anti-NGF antibody tanezumab shows efficacy in OA pain, even while certain patients suffer a rapid progression of joint degeneration after tanezumab therapy. The authors are encouraged to offer plausible explanations regarding this apparent clinical dissociation.We are also highly interested in the side effect of this anti-NGF antibody tanezumab<sup>[3]</sup>. The most up to date clinical outcome of tanezumab shows that certain percentage of the patients suffered a rapid progression of the disease after drug administration. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the incidence of advanced arthropathies in this setting, the most common being that improved analgesia leads to increased loading of a diseased joint, resulting in disease progression. This phenomenon could be similar to neuropathic arthropathy (Charcot joint), which occurs secondary to loss of sensation in an extremity and can result in joint dislocations, fractures and fragmentation. However, there might be another biological explanation. NGF levels are high in inflammatory tissues, and these tissues have a high number of monocytes. NGF is reportedly part of an important regulatory pathway in monocytes and other cell types. Inflammatory stimuli activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on monocytes, which increases expression of the NGF receptor TrkA. Monocyte could also increase NGF production, and NGF signaling might abate TLR2-mediated cell death, broadening the beneficial effects ofNGF. In summary, NGF inhibitors can markedly reduce chronic musculoskeletal pain, but enthusiasm for these compounds has been dampened by a small number of cases of advanced arthropathy in OA joints. In this sense, novel drug targets of upstream signals in OA pain pathways are needed for a more comprehensive therapeutic approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors stated: &quot;Human genetic mutations of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 directly induce pain hypersensitivity&quot;.

We have changed the word “mutation” to “gain of function mutation in the promoter region” in main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors need to justify why they chose ACLT OA model, instead of DMM OA model.</p></disp-quote><p>ACLT and DMM are the common surgical OA models and they are applicable in some different scenarios. In ACLT models, disease progression is more rapidly with relatively high pain sensitivity which gives us a good opportunity to investigate pain mechanisms and therapies. Subchondral bone erosion of the posterior tibial plateau (in some cases reaching the growth plate) was demonstrated in histologic photomicrographs from the ACLT with more severe subchondral bone metabolism changes. Meanwhile, DMM model was commonly used in slowly progressing studies like cartilage destructions. In our previous study<sup>[2]</sup>, we compared this two models in OA pain induction and found no significant differences between this two models. As a result, we continue to use ACLT model in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In figure legends, the authors need to disclose if one-way or two-way ANOVA was used followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. Some of the data involving two parameters need to use two-way ANOVA for statistical analysis. For example, Figure 1G involves different time points and different animal models, two-way ANOVA should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer’s comment on statistical analysis. We added the 2-way ANOVA statistical analysis in the Materials and method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors do need to describe which statistical method was used following ANOVA in the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the advice on statistical methods. We added ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test in all the figure legends as the Materials and methods section mentioned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors need to provide more information on Pirt-GCaMP3<sup>fl/-</sup> mice.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Pirt-GCaMP3<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice was developed in Dr Xinzhong Dong’s lab<sup>[4-6]</sup>. In order to monitor the activity of large populations of DRG neurons in intact live animals, they developed an in vivo imaging technique using Pirt-GCaMP3 mice, in which the genetic-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup>indicator GCaMP3 is specifically expressed in &gt;95% of all DRG neurons under the control of the Pirt promoter. We added the genetic background and functions of this mice in Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors have used the electronic Von Frey method to test behavior. Is there any evidence to support the choice of electronic Von Frey over manual Von Frey? Please specify if manual Von Frey was also used, and if any adjustments were made to distinguish true pain responses from &quot;touch-on&quot; responses and ambulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer’s interests on the electronic Von Frey test. We highly agree that considerable variance exits between groups in Von Frey tests. For this reason, we take the average numbers by two independent technicians and repeated the experiment by 3 times by the same standards. True response is more like a rapid withdrawal of the paw instantaneously after stimulation which could be differentiated from touch on and ambulation response. The reasons why we think electronic Von Frey may be more applicable are as follows:</p><p>1) The direct force is used, and we do not need to calculate the paw withdrawal threshold.</p><p>2) The force is more accurate than manual Von Frey meter.</p><p>3) Electronic Von Frey could be easy to adjust the force. But manual Von Frey meters are very easy to be bend and not accurate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The author developed a small molecule conjugate (Aln-Ly) but did not mention the injection method in the animal study – please address this and expand on how the appropriate regime and dosage was planned since the toxicology of this conjugate is unknown.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer’s concern on injection method. For conjugate injections, we used intraperitoneal injection method and 1mg/kg per week dosage according to previous toxicological experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Please indicate how many graders evaluated the OA score in the Materials and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>The OARSI scores were evaluated by two independent graders and the averages were taken. We added this information in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>References:</p><p>1.
