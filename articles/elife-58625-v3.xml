Historically, epidermal-innervating sensory neurons were thought to be the exclusive detectors and transmitters of environmental stimuli. However, recent work from our lab (Moehring et al., 2018) and others (Baumbauer et al., 2015) has demonstrated that keratinocytes are also critical for normal mechanotransduction and mechanically-evoked behavioral responses in mice. Here, we asked whether keratinocyte activity is also required for normal cold and heat sensation. Using calcium imaging, we determined that keratinocyte cold activity is conserved across mammalian species and requires the release of intracellular calcium through one or more unknown cold-sensitive proteins. Both epidermal cell optogenetic inhibition and interruption of ATP-P2X4 signaling reduced reflexive behavioral responses to cold and heat stimuli.

As the most superficial layer of the skin, the epidermis is the primary tissue that interfaces with environmental stimuli. Specialized structures within the epidermis including Meissner corpuscles and Merkel cells couple with Aβ low-threshold sensory afferents to encode unique qualities of mechanical force to the central nervous system. These specialized epidermal cells have received significantly more attention in somatosensory research than keratinocytes, the so-called ‘barrier cells’ that constitute 95% of the epidermis. Recently however, we and the team of Baumbauer, DeBerry, and Adelman et al. reported that keratinocytes are required for normal innocuous and noxious mechanosensation; optogenetic inhibition of keratin14-expressing cells decreases mechanically-induced firing in Aβ, Aδ, and C fiber afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumbauer et al., 2015</xref>) and behavioral responses to hindpaw mechanical stimulation in naïve mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is still unclear if keratinocyte activity is also required for normal cold and heat sensation.</p><p>Very little is known about the molecular basis or functional importance of keratinocytes in cold transduction and sensation, despite regular epidermal exposure to decreasing environmental temperatures. Primary keratinocytes from both mouse and human exhibit cold-induced calcium transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bidaux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsutsumi et al., 2010</xref>), but a direct comparison of these responses has not yet been performed. In this report, we measured cold-induced calcium transients in keratinocytes isolated from mouse, rat, hibernating 13-lined ground squirrel, and human tissue donors to determine whether keratinocyte cold sensitivity is conserved between mammalian species with different thermostatic regulation mechanisms, and to assess the translatability of findings obtained in these model organisms. We also utilized a variety of chemical tools and transgenic animal lines to characterize the molecular cold transducer in mouse keratinocytes. Finally, we employed global inhibitory optogenetic approaches to assess if keratinocyte activity is required for in vivo cold and heat sensation; optogenetic inhibition of keratin14-expressing cells increased withdrawal latencies to both cold and heat stimuli. Similar to our previous mechanosensation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>), we also observed decreased cold and heat sensitivity in wildtype mice after intraplantar injections of apyrase, an enzyme that catalyzes ATP hydrolysis, and in sensory-neuron specific P2X4 receptor knockout mice (P2X4<sup>cKO</sup>). Collectively, these experiments are the first to demonstrate an in vivo requirement of keratinocyte activity for normal cold and heat sensation. Based on these and our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>), we conclude that purinergic keratinocyte-to-sensory neuron signaling is a modality-conserved mechanism that serves as a critical amplifier for mechanical, cold, and heat sensation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mammalian keratinocyte cold responses differ between species</title><p>Temperature detection is critical for all species’ survival. In conventional theories of somatosensation, primary sensory afferents are the initial detectors of environmental stimuli; increases and decreases in temperature are primarily detected by subclasses of polymodal C and Aδ fibers. This theory, which differs from the requirement of non-neuronal cells in other sensory transduction circuits (e.g. taste cells in gustation, hair cells in auditory and vestibular senses, photoreceptors in vision), is not supported by mechanotransduction studies from our group and others; keratinocytes are not only capable of responding to mechanical force, but are required for normal mechanosensation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumbauer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>). To determine if keratinocytes are required for cold sensation, we first examined the inherent cold sensitivity of these cells from multiple rodent model organisms and humans. Calcium transients were compared in keratinocytes isolated from mouse, rat, and hibernating 13-lined ground squirrel glabrous hindpaw skin and human hairy skin while external buffer temperature was decreased (~24°C to 12°C over 1 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All cold-responsive keratinocytes exhibited sustained calcium transients that began during the initial dynamic phase of the cold ramp and ended during the static cold hold phase. Cytosolic calcium levels began to decrease during the static phase of the temperature ramp, and a second increase in cytosolic calcium was not observed during re-warming. This could be because the keratinocytes did not establish a new thermostatic set-point during the 2 min static cold hold. If keratinocytes quickly reset their set-point at the temperature nadir (~12°C), we would have expected warming responses to occur during the second dynamic phase of the ramp. However, we observed such a warming response in &lt;1% of mouse keratinocytes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mammalian keratinocytes respond to temperature decreases.</title><p>In vitro calcium imaging was performed on primary cultured keratinocytes from the glabrous hindpaw skin of C57BL/6 mice, Sprague Dawley rats, and 13-lined ground squirrels and human breast skin.

Over 92% of mouse keratinocytes responded to decreasing temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On average, the magnitude of the peak cold response was a 56% increase from baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and cold-induced transients were initiated when the buffer temperature dropped below 20.9°C (a 3°C drop from the starting temperature; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Rat keratinocytes were significantly less responsive to cold. Only 47% of rat keratinocytes exhibited cold-induced calcium transients, the peak magnitudes and temperature thresholds of which were lower than mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The biological relevance of this species differences is unclear. <italic>Mus musculus</italic> and <italic>Rattus novegicus</italic> are members of the <italic>Muridae</italic> family that inhabit similar climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng and Himsworth, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Latham and Mason, 2004</xref>) and maintain similar core and skin temperatures. Both species exhibit similar reflexive and thermotactic behaviors when exposed to cold stimuli or environments, and ex vivo skin-nerve recordings have identified spontaneously active, low-threshold cool fibers and quiescent, high-threshold cold fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leem et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Koltzenburg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paricio-Montesinos et al., 2020</xref>) in both species. To our knowledge, direct comparisons of behavioral and physiological cold responses between mouse and rat do not exist, but if completed, may reveal nuanced species differences that could be keratinocyte-mediated.</p><p>Cold responses were also assessed in keratinocytes isolated from 13-lined ground squirrels (<italic>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus)</italic> in hibernation. Over 96% of squirrel keratinocytes responded to decreasing temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Cold-induced calcium transients in squirrel keratinocytes were larger than those observed in mouse or rat and were initiated at a threshold of ~19°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). 13-lined ground squirrels are obligate hibernators indigenous to midwestern North America. In laboratory behavioral studies, these rodents are less sensitive to innocuous and noxious cold than mice as a result of amino acid substitutions in the TRPM8 channel and decreased cold-sensitivity of dorsal root ganglia neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matos-Cruz et al., 2017</xref>). Suppressed cold sensation is proposed to be metabolically advantageous for species that spend extended periods of time in hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matos-Cruz et al., 2017</xref>). We were therefore very surprised to observe cold responses in 728 of the 755 keratinocytes isolated from hibernating squirrels (4°C core body temperature). Upon warming, keratinocytes release ATP that subsequently activates nearby keratinocytes and/or sensory neurons via P2X receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mandadi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>). If the same signaling is initiated by cooling, this high level of keratinocyte activity could lead to depolarization events in all sensory afferent terminals that express purinergic receptors, including those that co-express TRPM8. These depolarization events may lead to subthreshold membrane potential oscillations that encode temperature fluctuations over time. Alternatively, this cold-induced keratinocyte activity, and subsequent release of chemical mediators, could be a novel non-neuronal mechanism that allows hibernating animals to detect changes in environmental temperature, a process that seems critical to the initiation and maintenance of hibernation.</p><p>In the ultimate translational test, cold responses were compared between keratinocytes isolated from glabrous rodent skin and hairy human skin. Over 67% of human keratinocytes responded to decreasing temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>);&gt;50% of the keratinocytes from each of the five tissue donors were cold sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results are similar to a previous report in which 60% of undifferentiated human keratinocytes responded to cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsutsumi et al., 2010</xref>) (~24–12°C ramp). When compared to all of the rodent species, human keratinocyte cold responses were most similar to those observed in mouse. Human keratinocytes were more responsive to cold than rat keratinocytes, exhibiting larger cold-induced calcium transients that were initiated at higher temperatures. Similarly, human keratinocytes were less responsive to cold than squirrel keratinocytes; a higher percentage of squirrel keratinocytes responded to cold with larger calcium transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Inter-sample variability in cold-response magnitude and temperature threshold were noted in the human samples, despite all keratinocytes being harvested from female breast skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The average cold threshold in our human samples was ~19°C; in previous studies, cold thresholds were not reported, but peak cold responses were observed between 16–18°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsutsumi et al., 2010</xref>). The rate of cooling, dictated by buffer flow rates and speed of heat exchange within the cooling device, or culturing conditions may explain these differences. Unfortunately, we do not understand the perceptual consequences of these species differences at this time since keratinocyte-specific manipulations are difficult to perform in any species besides mouse. However, the robust, conserved activity across all species tested suggests that mammalian keratinocytes play a larger functional role in thermosensation than simply buffering cold temperatures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cold responses in mouse keratinocytes require release of intracellular calcium stores</title><p>We know very little about the molecular basis of keratinocyte cold transduction. To characterize the molecular cold transducers in mouse tissue, we performed calcium imaging on primary mouse keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Cold-induced calcium responses were first measured in keratinocytes incubated with 20 µM EGTA and 0 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to determine if extracellular calcium influx is required. Under these conditions, only 36% of keratinocytes responded to cold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); cells that did respond exhibited smaller calcium transients (25% decrease from vehicle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and responded at lower temperatures (0.6°C decrease from vehicle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) than vehicle-exposed cells. Removal of extracellular sodium (equimolar NMDG substitution) had no additional effect on keratinocyte cold responses, therefore arguing against cold-sensitive sodium channels (e.g. epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Askwith et al., 2001</xref>]) being the primary cold detectors. Keratinocyte cold responses were only completely eliminated when the extracellular buffer included 20 µM EGTA and 0 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and intracellular calcium stores were depleted with 1 µM thapsigargin immediately prior to the cold ramp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterizing murine cold sensor(s) in keratinocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).) In order to characterize the proteins involved in cold transduction, cold-induced calcium transients were measured in keratinocytes exposed to extracellular buffer containing different ionic concentrations or pharmacological agents, or in keratinocytes from transgenic mice. (<bold>B</bold>).) Extracellular calcium chelation (EGTA, 0 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>) decreases the proportion of keratinocytes that respond to cold; substituting NMDG for extracellular sodium did not further decrease the percentage of cold-responsive cells. Cold responses were only abolished when endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores were depleted and unable to be refilled with extracellular sources (EGTA, 0 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, thapsigargin). CRAC channel inhibition (5J4) did not decrease the percentage of cold-responsive cells, and similar proportions of keratinocytes from C57BL/6, global TRPA1, and global TRPC5 knockout mice responded to decreasing buffer temperature (Chi square p&lt;0.0001; Fisher’s Exact tests ***p&lt;0.001 vs. vehicle; n ≥ 4). (<bold>C</bold>).) Peak calcium responses to cold were lower in the absence of extracellular calcium; responses were unaltered in other conditions (1-way ANOVA p&lt;0.0001; Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons: ****p&lt;0.0001 vs. vehicle, #### p&lt;0.0001 vs. EGTA, 0 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; p&lt;0.0001 vs. EGTA, 0 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, NMDG).

To address the former, keratinocytes were incubated with 5J4, a CRAC channel blocker. While not a member of the TRP superfamily, the STIM/Orai CRAC channels are required for normal warming and ‘heat-off’ responses in human and mouse keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). This ‘heat-off’ response (i.e. decrease in temperature following removal of a heat stimulus) could be classified as cooling, and while not explicitly related to discrete ‘cold’ temperatures, may suggest a role for STIM/Orai signaling in keratinocyte cold responses. However, incubation with 5J4 did not change the percentage of keratinocytes responding to cold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) or the magnitude of the peak cold response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Extracellular application of 5J4 did lower the average cold threshold by 0.4°C, but the biological significance of this decreases is unclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Bidaux et al. identified a novel epidermal isoform of the cold and menthol-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKemy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peier et al., 2002a</xref>) channel TRPM8 (eTRPM8) in the endoplasmic reticulum of human keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bidaux et al., 2015</xref>). Based on expression patterns, this channel could be the intracellular sensor that is mediating cold responses in calcium-free buffer. However unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bidaux et al., 2015</xref>, we did not observe menthol-induced calcium transients in mouse keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Given that Biduax et al. performed their experiments in conditions that reduced capacitive calcium flux (i.e. reduced CRAC channel activity), we expected to observe even larger menthol responses in our experiments, but only 1 of the 460 mouse keratinocytes tested responded to menthol; Biduax et al. did not report the percentage of menthol-sensitive keratinocytes in their studies. Regardless of these discrepancies in menthol-sensitivity, there is essentially no published evidence to support that eTRPM8 is the primary keratinocyte cold sensor. The original eTRPM8 publication did not determine whether keratinocytes from TRPM8 knockout mice exhibited regular responses to buffer cooling, or if a mutation in this channel altered cold-induced activity in human keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bidaux et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, heterologous cells expressing eTRPM8 did not exhibit whole-cell currents during extracellular menthol application or temperature decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bidaux et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these data and our current experiments, we do not believe that eTRPM8 is the primary intracellular cold sensor in mouse keratinocytes.</p><p>To characterize potential plasma membrane cold sensors, keratinocytes were isolated from global TRPA1 and TRPC5 knockout mice. TRPA1 is a member of the TRP ion channel superfamily involved in detection of noxious cold (&lt;17°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Story et al., 2003</xref>). In human keratinocyte studies, extracellular application of the TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031 partially decreases cold-induced calcium transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tsutsumi et al., 2011</xref>). In mouse, the percentage of cold-sensitive cells and peak cold responses in TRPA1 knockout keratinocytes were similar to those observed in wildtype keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). On average, TRPA1 knockout keratinocytes exhibited cold-induced calcium transients at warmer temperatures than wildtype keratinocytes (21.5°C vs. 20.9°C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This lack of TRPA1 involvement was not surprising as we and others have not been able to verify TRPA1 expression or function in mouse epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouvier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zappia et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, global TRPA1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bautista et al., 2006</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reese et al., 2020</xref>) exhibit normal cold-induced reflexive behaviors, further suggesting that this channel is not a conserved noxious cold transducer in mammalian skin cells. TRPC5 is another cold-sensitive TRP channel family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zimmermann et al., 2011</xref>) expressed in keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2006</xref>) that could be a plasma membrane-expressed cold sensor. TRPC5 knockout keratinocyte cold responses were identical to those observed in wildtype tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This result may be related to the temperatures used in this experiment; when expressed in heterologous cells, TRPC5 currents peak around 25°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zimmermann et al., 2011</xref>), the starting temperature of our experiments. Alternatively, TRPC5 activity may not be required for normal cold sensation; global TRPC5 knockout mice exhibit normal cold behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zimmermann et al., 2011</xref>). Identification and validation of <italic>novel</italic> cold-sensing proteins is a time-intensive process that is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Based on our characterization studies however, there is at least one intracellular cold-sensitive protein that is required for keratinocyte cold activity. Clues from similar characterization studies and comparative genomics could be used to identify putative cold sensors that are differentially expressed in keratinocytes from the species tested above.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Optogenetic inhibition of keratinocytes decreases behavioral cold sensitivity</title><p>After successfully demonstrating that mammalian keratinocytes are cold-responsive, we used the same global inhibitory optogenetic approach from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>) to determine whether keratinocytes are required for normal cold sensation. We generated transgenic mice expressing Archaerhodopsin, a light-sensitive proton pump, in keratin14-positive cells (keratinocytes and Merkel cells; Krt14:Arch Cre+) and Cre- littermate controls (Krt14:Arch Cre-). To determine if optogenetic inhibition of keratinocytes affects in vivo cold sensitivity, the cold plantar assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner et al., 2012</xref>) was performed in Krt14:Arch Cre+ and Krt14:Arch Cre- mice. The cold plantar assay is our preferred measure of cold sensitivity since behavioral responses are highly reproducible and easy to quantify. The nature of the dry ice stimulus elicits anticipatory cold-related behaviors rather than pain-related behaviors elicited by discrete noxious cold temperatures. On average, animals respond when the paw temperature has dropped by ~2°C, a change that is well within the innocuous cool range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner et al., 2012</xref>). Krt14:Arch Cre+ mice exhibited longer withdrawal latencies to the dry ice stimulus when 590 nm light was applied to the stimulated hindpaw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We and others have shown that keratinocytes release ATP when mechanically stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klusch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koizumi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>). This ATP can subsequently bind to members of the P2Y receptor family or, as demonstrated in our previous publication, P2X4 receptors expressed in Aβ, Aδ, and C fiber afferents, effectively depolarizing neuronal membranes and increasing the likelihood of fiber firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koizumi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>). To determine if epidermal purinergic signaling is similarly required for cold sensation, we performed the cold plantar assay on wildtype mice following intraplantar injection of apyrase, an enzyme that catalyzes ATP hydrolysis. Apyrase-injected animals exhibited longer withdrawal latencies to the dry ice stimulus than vehicle-injected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also tested the cold sensitivity of sensory neuron-specific P2X4 knockout mice (P2X4<sup>cKO</sup>; <italic>Advil</italic><sup>Cre</sup>::<italic>P2rX4</italic> fl/fl). P2X4<sup>cKO</sup> mice exhibited longer withdrawal latencies to dry ice stimulation than control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To complement this reflexive cold behavioral measure, thermotactic behaviors were assessed in P2X4<sup>cKO</sup> mice using a two-temperature preference test. In this assay, animals choose to spend time on a floor held at 30°C or a floor that is held at a colder temperature. Control mice displayed a place preference for the 30°C floor when it was paired with floors held at 23, 20, and 17°C; P2X4<sup>cKO</sup> mice spent more time on these colder floors than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Collectively, these findings are similar to those observed in mechanosensory tests and suggest that ATP-P2X4 signaling also mediates normal cold sensation in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Purinergic keratinocyte signaling contributes to normal heat sensation</title><p>Since the noxious heat receptor TRPV1 was visualized in human keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denda et al., 2001</xref>), many have hypothesized that these non-neuronal cells are involved in thermosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhaka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee and Caterina, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moqrich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peier et al., 2002b</xref>). Primary human and mouse keratinocytes exhibit heat-evoked currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tsutsumi et al., 2011</xref>) and release ATP upon warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mandadi et al., 2009</xref>). These heat responses are reportedly mediated by TRPV3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moqrich, 2005</xref>), TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2004</xref>), and STIM1/Orai channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), but global TPRV3/TRPV4 double knockout mice exhibit normal behavioral responses to innocuous and noxious heat stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2011</xref>), and keratinocytes isolated from these animals exhibit heat responses identical to those observed in wildtype tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, we and others have not observed capsaicin responses in primary mouse keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that there may be species-specific differences in TRPV1 keratinocyte expression, similar to TRPA1. Regardless, it is highly unlikely that knockdown of one or more temperature-sensitive channels will reveal the full extent to which keratinocytes are required for heat sensation. Similar to sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vandewauw et al., 2018</xref>), keratinocytes may express a complement of functionally redundant proteins that compensate for reduced activity of related temperature-sensitive channels. Therefore, in order to determine how this heterogeneous cell population contributes to naïve heat sensation, global inhibitory approaches are required. Baumbauer, DeBerry, and Adelman et al. previously demonstrated that keratinocyte activity contributes to ex vivo peripheral thermal transduction processes; optogenetic inhibition of keratin14-expressing cells decreased activity in heat-sensitive polymodal C and Aδ nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumbauer et al., 2015</xref>). To determine if keratinocyte inhibition affects in vivo heat sensitivity, we performed the Hargreaves radiant heat assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hargreaves et al., 1988</xref>) on Krt14:Arch Cre+ and Krt14:Arch Cre- mice. Krt14:Arch Cre+ mice exhibited longer withdrawal latencies to the heat stimulus when 590 nm light was applied to the stimulated hindpaw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Wildtype animals injected with apyrase and P2X4<sup>cKO</sup> mice also exhibited longer withdrawal latencies to the heat stimulus when compared to the appropriate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Collectively, these and our previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>) are the first to demonstrate the conserved requirement of keratinocyte activity for normal mechanical, cold, and heat sensation in vivo. While it is true that primary sensory neurons are capable of detecting and encoding environmental stimuli without accessory cells, our work suggests that proper somatosensation also requires critical stimulus amplification at the level of the keratinocyte. Keratinocyte population activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koizumi et al., 2004</xref>) could also explain the extreme variability observed in DRG cold responses in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luiz et al., 2019</xref>; individual sensory neuron activity could be directly influenced by the non-neuronal cells in the local peripheral terminal environment. Before our work, global chemo- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pang et al., 2015</xref>) and optogenetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumbauer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>) approaches had been used to illustrate the importance of keratinocyte-to-sensory neuron signaling in somatosensation. However, these non-specific activation methods did not allow for the interrogation of specific sensory modalities as generic keratinocyte activation quickly induced nocifensive and paresthesia-like behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumbauer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pang et al., 2015</xref>). These and our former studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>) also position epidermal purinergic signaling as a ubiquitous but critical mechanism that amplifies many modalities of somatosensory stimuli. Additional studies are required to identify modality-specific signaling pathways and keratinocyte-secreted factors that can be exploited for topical therapeutic development for pain and itch conditions.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Keratinocyte-to-sensory neuron signaling is required for normal heat sensation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 590 nm light exposure increases the withdrawal latency of Krt14:Arch Cre+ mice during plantar radiant heat stimulation (2-way ANOVA main effects of light, genotype, and light x genotype interaction p&lt;0.0001; Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons: ****p&lt;0.0001 Krt14:Arch Cre+ 490 vs. 590 nm, 590 nm Krt14:Arch Cre+ vs. Cre-; n = 17–20).

After addition of heat-inactivated FBS (15%), epidermal sheets were rubbed vigorously (&gt;1 min) against the bottom of the Petri dish using a disposable pipette tip to dissociate the tissue. Following this step, the buffer was always quite cloudy and contained ‘sticky’ strings of tissue (i.e. dissociated keratinocytes); cloudiness depended on starting material volume and dissociation times. The buffer was transferred to a clean tube and centrifuged, after which the supernatant was removed. The keratinocyte-containing pellet was re-suspended and grown in EpiLife medium supplemented with 1% human keratinocyte growth supplement, 0.2% Gibco Amphotericin B, and 0.25% penicillin-streptomycin.

Coverslips were mounted onto an inverted fluorescence microscope and perfused with room temperature (~24°C) extracellular buffer at a rate of 6 mL/min.

To generate a cold ramp, extracellular buffer was cooled in real time through an in-line cooler (water jacket perfused with antifreeze chilled via refrigerated circulator); temperatures dropped to ~12°C over 2 min. Fluorescence images were captured at 340 and 380 nm.

Powdered dry ice was packed into a 10 mL syringe, then applied to the glass beneath the plantar surface of the hindpaw. Withdrawal latencies were measured three times for each paw and then averaged. For optogenetic manipulation, a 590 nm LED or 490 nm control LED was placed ~3 cm below the glass surface for 1 min prior to and during stimulus application. At this distance, the power of the 590 nm LED was 17.5 mW and the power of the 490 nm LED was 21.6 mW. The two-temperature preference test was used to measure thermotactic behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moqrich, 2005</xref>). Each side of the testing apparatus contains a thermally regulated metal plate that was set to a specific temperature. Animals were habituated to the apparatus (both floors set to 30°C) for 15 min prior to the testing day. On testing day, both floors were set to 30°C for 5 min baseline test. After baseline testing, the temperature of one floor was dropped to 26°C, 23°C, 20°C, or 17°C and animal place preferences were recorded for 5 min. No more than three temperature tests were performed per animal per day. To control for inherent preference of the sides, we randomly altered both the plate where the animals were introduced and the temperatures on each plate. The percent time spent on the colder plate was calculated. The Hargreaves assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hargreaves et al., 1988</xref>) was used as a reflexive measure of heat sensitivity.

Withdrawal latencies were measured three times for each paw then averaged. For optogenetic manipulation, a 590 nm LED or 490 nm control LED was placed ~3 cm below the glass surface for 1 min prior to and during stimulus application. Apyrase treatment (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>) occurred 45 min prior to cold or heat testing.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kathryn M Albers (Reviewer #2); Derek Moliver (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript extends a previous paper by the authors demonstrating that keratinocytes are mechanically sensitive and contribute to somatosensory mechanical transduction. Here, the authors make extensive use of pharmacological, knockout and optogenetic approaches to demonstrate keratinocyte responsiveness to cold, and contributions of keratinocytes to behavioral responses to heat and cold stimuli. Well-designed experiments include an interesting comparative analysis of cold responses across species, although the physiological significance of species differences remains to be resolved. Sex differences were evaluated and not observed. Several candidate transducers from the literature were tested for contributions to the keratinocyte cold responses and excluded (eTRPM8, TRPA1, TRPC5). Generation of cold-induced calcium transients required release of calcium from intracellular stores, leading the authors to conclude that there may be an intracellular cold transducer. Purinergic communication from keratinocytes to sensory axons was proposed based on attenuated behavioral responses with intradermal ATP depletion and sensory neuron-specific knockout of P2X4, following up on results from the previous study that identified a role for P2X4-mediated purinergic transmission between keratinocytes and sensory neurons in mechanical transduction. The manuscript extends our understanding of keratinocyte contributions to somatosensory transduction and is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The following items should be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the voltage clamp experiments shown in Figure 3, keratinocytes showed an outward current following cold stimulation. This is counterintuitive, since an outward current may not &quot;activate&quot; the cell, which conflicts with other findings in the study. This issue should be addressed (and the composition of internal solution used for patch clamp recordings should be described).</p><p>Related to this, the basis of optogenetic &quot;inhibition&quot; comes from the finding that expressing archaerhodopsin in keratinocytes reduces the outward current density, so there would be less hyperpolarization upon illumination with 590 nm light. This is also counterintuitive and needs further clarification.</p><p>Although the findings argue that intracellular calcium stores contribute to the calcium signal upon cold stimulation, the functional experiments rely on manipulating membrane currents for optogenetic inhibition, which as mentioned wasn't well resolved by the voltage-clamp experiments. Also, as far as I know, a rise in intracellular calcium doesn't usually occur with plasma membrane hyperpolarization, as indicated by the outward currents. This seems difficult to explain unless there are calcium-activated potassium channels or chloride channels at play here.</p><p>Therefore, with regards to the patch clamp experiments and membrane current measurements, there is some confusion. In order to clarify, we suggest the following experiments:</p><p>a) For voltage clamp measurements, hold cells at the resting potential during cold stimulation and assess the response.</p><p>b) Current-clamp measurements would help determine how cold temperatures and optogenetic inhibition during cold stimulation lead to a change in membrane voltage.</p><p>2) The title of this submission, 'Keratinocytes are required for normal cold and heat sensation' is overstating the findings. A possible revision is 'Keratinocytes contribute to normal cold and heat sensation'. The only evidence that supports a requirement for keratinocytes is from the behavioral measures of cold responses in the presence of Arch activation where a slight increase in latency to cold is measured (Figure 3). Although supportive, until it is shown that alteration (inhibition) of keratinocytes elicits a change in response properties of cutaneous (cold sensing) neurons, the actual impact of keratinocytes on neural transmission of cold stimuli can be debated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58625.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the voltage clamp experiments shown in Figure 3, keratinocytes showed an outward current following cold stimulation.

To better understand what could be happening in these recordings, we consulted with Dr. Jon Sack, a biophysicist with over 20 years of experience in patch clamp electrophysiology. We provided Dr. Sack with our original patch clamp files and he found several issues. Similar to the reviewers, Dr. Sack noted that our holding membrane potential was incorrect; many cells were being held at a value that was too negative. Culture variability or repeated buffer cooling (i.e. cells on a single cover slip were exposed to multiple cold ramps) may have altered these parameters from our previous study. Dr. Sack also observed high variability in our leak currents, and mismatching between series and pipette resistance values. Leak current variability may have resulted from multiple cooling events; repeated direct exposure to 12°C buffer may have destabilized cell membranes to the point of cells taking on an “injured” phenotype. Based on these observations, we no longer feel comfortable including these experiments in our manuscript. Therefore, the updated version of the manuscript does not include any patch clamping data. We would like to repeat these experiments and add in those suggested by the reviewers, but, in complete transparency, are unable to do so at this time since none of our current trainees can proficiently patch clamp keratinocytes. The COVID-19 pandemic and continued institutional access restrictions make the timeline for training and successful experimental completion even more uncertain. We hope that the reviewers understand this predicament and still deem the calcium imaging and in vivo experiments worthwhile to publish as a Research Advance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The title of this submission, 'Keratinocytes are required for normal cold and heat sensation' is overstating the findings. A possible revision is 'Keratinocytes contribute to normal cold and heat sensation'. The only evidence that supports a requirement for keratinocytes is from the behavioral measures of cold responses in the presence of Arch activation where a slight increase in latency to cold is measured (Figure 3). Although supportive, until it is shown that alteration (inhibition) of keratinocytes elicits a change in response properties of cutaneous (cold sensing) neurons, the actual impact of keratinocytes on neural transmission of cold stimuli can be debated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that in our original title was an overstatement in the absence of any sensory neuron electrophysiology. We have updated our title to that suggested by the reviewers “Keratinocytes contribute to normal cold and heat sensation”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
