Few have pursued this question, and an evolutionarily conserved strategy has yet to emerge. This study reports a strategy for inducing regenerative response in appendages, which works across three species that span the animal phylogeny. In Cnidaria, the frequency of appendage regeneration in the moon jellyfish <italic>Aurelia</italic> was increased by feeding with the amino acid L-leucine and the growth hormone insulin. In insects, the same strategy induced tibia regeneration in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Finally, in mammals, L-leucine and sucrose administration induced digit regeneration in adult mice, including dramatically from mid-phalangeal amputation. The conserved effect of L-leucine and insulin/sugar suggests a key role for energetic parameters in regeneration induction. The simplicity by which nutrient supplementation can induce appendage regeneration provides a testable hypothesis across animals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The ability of animals to replace damaged or lost tissue (or ‘regenerate’) is a sliding scale, with some animals able to regenerate whole limbs, while others can only scar. But why some animals can regenerate while others have more limited capabilities has puzzled the scientific community for many years. The likes of Charles Darwin and August Weismann suggested regeneration only evolves in a particular organ. In contrast, Thomas Morgan suggested that all animals are equipped with the tools to regenerate but differ in whether they are able to activate these processes. If the latter were true, it could be possible to ‘switch on’ regeneration.</p><p>Animals that keep growing throughout their life and do not regulate their body temperatures are more likely to be able to regenerate. But what do growth and temperature regulation have in common? Both are highly energy-intensive, with temperature regulation potentially diverting energy from other processes. A question therefore presents itself: could limb regeneration be switched on by supplying animals with more energy, either in the form of nutrients like sugars or amino acids, or by giving them growth hormones such as insulin?</p><p>Abrams, Tan, Li et al. tested this hypothesis by amputating the limbs of jellyfish, flies and mice, and then supplementing their diet with sucrose (a sugar), leucine (an amino acid) and/or insulin for eight weeks while they healed. Typically, jellyfish rearrange their remaining arms when one is lost, while fruit flies are not known to regenerate limbs. House mice are usually only able to regenerate the very tip of an amputated digit. But in Abrams, Tan, Li et al.’s experiments, leucine and insulin supplements stimulated limb regeneration in jellyfish and adult fruit flies, and leucine and sucrose supplements allowed mice to regenerate digits from below the second knuckle. Although regeneration was not observed in all animals, these results demonstrate that regeneration can be induced, and that it can be done relatively easily, by feeding animals extra sugar and amino acids.</p><p>These findings highlight increasing the energy supplies of different animals by manipulating their diets while they are healing from an amputated limb can aid in regeneration. This could in the future pave the way for new therapeutic approaches to tissue and organ regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>appendage regeneration</kwd><kwd>limb regeneration</kwd><kwd>leucine</kwd><kwd>insulin</kwd><kwd>sucrose</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Moon jellyfish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000913</institution-id><institution>James S.

Two views have historically prevailed as to why some animals regenerate better than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goss, 1992</xref>). Some biologists, including Charles Darwin and August Weismann, hold that regeneration is an adaptive property of a specific organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Polezhaev, 1972</xref>). For instance, some lobsters may evolve the ability to regenerate claws because they often lose them in fights and food foraging. Other biologists, including Thomas Morgan, hold that regeneration is not an evolved trait of a particular organ, but inherent in all organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morgan, 1901</xref>). Regeneration evolving for a particular organ versus regeneration being organismally inherent is an important distinction, as the latter suggests that the lack of regeneration is not due to the trait never having evolved, but rather due to inactivation—and may therefore be induced. In support of Morgan’s view, studies in past decades have converged on one striking insight: many animal phyla have at least one or more species that regenerate body parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bely and Nyberg, 2010</xref>). Further, even in poorly regenerative lineages, many embryonic and larval stages can regenerate. In regenerating animals, conserved molecular events (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cary et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawakami et al., 2006</xref>) and regeneration-responsive enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) were identified. Although the hypothesis of convergent evolution cannot be fully excluded (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lai and Aboobaker, 2018</xref>), these findings begin to build the case that the ability to regenerate may be ancestral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bely and Nyberg, 2010</xref>). Regeneration being possibly ancestral begs the question: is there a conserved mechanism to activate regenerative state?</p><p>This study explored how, and whether, limbs can be made to regenerate in animals that do not normally show limb regeneration. In adult frogs, studies from the early 20th century and few recent ones have induced various degrees of outgrowth in the limb using strategies including repeated trauma, electrical stimulation, local progesterone delivery, progenitor cell implantation, and Wnt activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawakami et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herrera-Rincon et al., 2018</xref>). Wnt activation restored limb development in chick embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawakami et al., 2006</xref>), but there are no reports of postnatal regeneration induction. In salamanders, a wound site that normally just heals can be induced to grow a limb by supplying nerve connection and skin graft from the contralateral limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Endo et al., 2004</xref>), or by delivery of Fgf2, 8, and Bmp2 to the wound site followed by retinoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vieira et al., 2019</xref>). In neonatal and adult mouse digits, a model for exploring limb regeneration in mammals, bone outgrowth, or joint-like structure can be induced via local implantation of Bmp2 (bone) or Bmp9 (joint; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Thus far, different strategies gain tractions in different species, and a common denominator appears elusive.</p><p>However, across animal phylogeny, some physiological features show interesting correlation with regenerative ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hariharan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vivien et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sousounis et al., 2014</xref>). First, regeneration especially in vertebrates tends to decrease with age, with juveniles and larvae more likely to regenerate than adults. For instance, the mammalian heart rapidly loses the ability to regenerate after birth and anurans cease to regenerate limbs upon metamorphosis. Second, animals that continue to grow throughout life tend to also regenerate. For instance, most annelids continue adding body segments and regenerate well, a striking exception of which is leeches that make exactly 32 segments and one of the few annelids that do not regenerate body segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rouse, 1998</xref>). Consistent with the notion of regeneration as ancestral, indeterminate growth is thought of as the ancestral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hariharan et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, a broad correlate of regenerative ability across animal phylogeny is thermal regulation. Poikilotherms, which include most invertebrates, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, tend to have greater regenerative abilities than homeotherms—birds and mammals are animal lineages with poorest regeneration. These physiological correlates, taken together, are united by the notion of energy expenditure. The transition from juvenile to adult is a period of intense energy usage, continued growth is generally underlined by sustained anabolic processes, and regulating body temperature is energetically expensive compared to allowing for fluctuation. Regeneration itself entails activation of anabolic processes to rebuild lost tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Naviaux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malandraki-Miller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takayama et al., 2018</xref>). These physiological correlates thus raise the notion of a key role of energetics in the evolution of regeneration in animals. Specifically, we wondered whether energy inputs can promote regenerative state. In this study, we demonstrate that nutrient supplementation can induce regenerative response in appendage and limb across three vastly divergent species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Leucine and insulin promote appendage regeneration in the moon jelly <italic>Aurelia</italic></title><p>We reasoned that if there was an ancestral mechanism to promote regeneration, it would likely remain intact in early branching lineages with prevalent regeneration across the species. In Cnidaria, the ability to regenerate is established in polyps, for example, hydras and sea anemones. Some cnidarians, notably jellyfish, not only exist as sessile polyps, but also as free-swimming ephyrae and medusae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast to the polyps’ ability to regenerate, regeneration in ephyrae and medusae appears more restricted in some species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sinigaglia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmid and Alder, 1984</xref>). We focused on the moon jellyfish <italic>Aurelia coerulea</italic> (formerly <italic>A. aurita</italic> sp. 1 strain), specifically on the ephyra, whose eight arms facilitate morphological tracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). About 3 mm in diameter, <italic>Aurelia</italic> ephyrae regenerate the tips of arms and the distal sensory organ rhopalium, but upon more dramatic amputations such as removing a whole arm or halving the body, rapidly reorganize existing body parts and regain radial symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Observed across four scyphozoan species, symmetrization occurs rapidly within 1–3 days and robustly across conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2015</xref>). Ephyrae that symmetrized matured into medusae, whereas ephyrae that failed to symmetrize and simply healed the wound grew abnormally.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Aurelia as a system to identify factors that promote appendage regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The moon jellyfish <italic>Aurelia aurita</italic> has a dimorphic life cycle, existing as sessile polyps or free-swimming medusae and ephyrae. Ephyra is the juvenile stage of medusa, a robust stage that can withstand months of starvation. In lab conditions, ephyrae mature into medusae, growing bell tissue, and reproductive organs, in 1–2 months. (<bold>b</bold>) Ephyrae have eight arms, which are swimming appendages that contract synchronously to generate axisymmetric fluid flow, which facilitates propulsion and filter feeding. The eight arms are symmetrically positioned around the stomach and the feeding organ manubrium. Extending into each arm is radial muscle (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and a circulatory canal that transports nutrients. At the end of each arm is the light- and gravity-sensing organ rhopalium. (<bold>c</bold>) In response to injury, the majority of ephyrae rapidly reorganize existing body parts and regain radial symmetry. However, performing the experiment in the natural habitat, a few ephyrae (2 out of 18) regenerated a small arm (arrow).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65092-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Intriguingly, in the course of our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2015</xref>), we observed in a few symmetrizing ephyrae, a small bud at the amputation site. To follow this hunch, we repeated the experiment in the original habitat of our lab’s polyp population, off the coast of Long Beach, CA (Materials and methods). Two weeks after amputation, most ephyrae indeed symmetrized, but in 2 out of 18 animals a small arm grew (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This observation suggests that, despite symmetrization being the more robust response to injury, an inherent ability to regenerate arm is present and can be naturally manifest. The inherent arm regeneration presents an opportunity: Can arm regeneration be reproduced in the lab, as a way to identify factors that promote regenerative state?</p><p>To answer this question, we screened various molecular and physical factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Molecularly, we tested modulators of developmental signaling pathways as well as physiological pathways such as metabolism, stress response, immune, and inflammatory response. Physically, we explored environmental parameters, such as temperature, oxygen level, and water current. Amputation was performed across the central body removing three arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Parameter changes were implemented or molecular modulators (e.g., peptides and small molecules) were introduced into the water immediately after amputation. Regenerative response was assessed for 1–2 weeks until the onset of bell growth, which hindered the scoring of arm regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Arm regeneration in <italic>Aurelia</italic> ephyra can be induced using exogenous factors.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Ephyrae were amputated (red line) across the body to remove three arms, and then let recover in various conditions. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> tabulates the factors tested in the screen.

Arm regeneration can be unambiguously scored in ephyrae before the bell has significantly grown.

The variation manifested even within individuals: a single ephyra could grow differently sized arms. Of the three arms removed, if regeneration occurred, generally one arm regenerated (67%), occasionally two arms (32%), and rarely three arms (1%, of the 4270 total ephyrae quantified in this study). Finally, the frequency of regeneration varied across clutches, that is, strobilation cohorts. Some variability may be due to technical factors, for example, varying feed culture conditions; however, variability persisted even with the same feed batch. We verified that the variability was not entirely due to genetic differences, as it manifested across clonal populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, there appears to be stochasticity in the occurrence of arm regeneration in <italic>Aurelia</italic> and the extent to which regeneration proceeds.</p><p>What are the factors that promote arm regeneration? Notably, modulation of developmental pathways often implicated in regeneration literature (e.g., Wnt, Bmp, and Tgfß) did not produce effect in the screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>)—although we do not rule out their involvement in other capacity, for example, in downstream patterning. We first identified a necessary condition: water current. The requirement for current for promoting regeneration is interesting because ephyrae can recover from injury by symmetrizing in stagnant water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Thus, a specific physiological state is required for enabling regenerative response. Behaviorally, the presence of current promotes more swimming, while in stagnant water ephyrae tend to rest at the bottom and pulse stationarily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref> show the aquarium setup used to implement current). In this permissive condition, the first factor that promotes regeneration is the nutrient level: increasing food amount increases the frequency of arm regeneration. To measure the regeneration frequency, we scored any regenerates with lengths greater than 15% of that of an uncut arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This threshold was chosen to predominantly exclude non-specific growths or buds that show no morphological structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) while including small arm regenerates that show clear morphological features, that is, lappets, radial canal, and radial muscle sometimes showing growing ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Given the clutch-to-clutch variability, control and treatment were always performed side by side using ephyrae from the same clutch. The effect size of a treatment was assessed by computing the change in regeneration frequency relative to the internal control. Statistical significance of a treatment was assessed by evaluating the reproducibility of its effect size across independent experiments (Materials and methods). With these measurement and statistical methodologies, we found that although the baseline regeneration frequency varied across clutches, higher food amounts reproducibly increased regeneration frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The magnitude of the increase varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>, 95% confidence interval [CI] [4.7, 12.1-fold]), but the increase was reproducible (95% CI excludes 1) and statistically significant (p&lt;10<sup>–4</sup>).</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-65092-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Experimental setup in <italic>Aurelia</italic>.</title><p>See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for more details.</p></caption></media><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Nutrient level, insulin, hypoxia, and leucine increased regeneration frequency in <italic>Aurelia</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) An ephyra is regenerating if it has at least one growth from the cut site with a length greater than 0.15 of the uncut arm length.

(<bold>b</bold>) The threshold 0.15 was chosen to balance excluding non-specific growths that show no morphological structures (e.g., as shown, lack of phalloidin-stained structures) and retaining rudimentary arms that show morphological structures, including radial muscle sometime with growing ends (shown, phalloidin stained).

First, regeneration frequency in LF is comparable to that observed in the natural habitat experiment. Second, in many of the wild populations studied, ephyrae mature to medusae over 1–3 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lucas, 2001</xref>), comparable to the growth rate in LF (by contrast, ephyrae in HF mature to medusae over 3–4 weeks).

The insulin effect was unlikely to be due to non-specific addition of proteins, since bovine serum albumin (BSA) at the same molarity showed no statistically significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Finally, the third promoter of regeneration is hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). We verified that the ancient oxygen sensor HIFα is present in <italic>Aurelia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To reduce oxygen, nitrogen was flown into the seawater, achieving ~50% reduction in dissolved oxygen level (Materials and methods). We verified that the effect was due to reduced oxygen rather than increased nitrogen, since reducing oxygen using argon flow similarly increased regeneration frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The factors can act synergistically (e.g., insulin and high nutrient level), but the effect appears to eventually saturate (e.g., hypoxia and high nutrient level).</p><p>In addition to quantifying the number of ephyrae that regenerate, we further quantified the regeneration phenotypes in each ephyra, that is, the number of arms regenerating, the length of arm regenerates, and the formation of rhopalia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>). Nutrient level strikingly improved all phenotypic metrics: not only more ephyrae regenerated in higher nutrients, more ephyrae regenerated multiple arms, longer arms, and arms with rhopalia. Insulin and hypoxia, interestingly, show differential phenotypes. Most strikingly, while insulin induced more ephyrae to regenerate multiple arms, hypoxia induced largely single-arm regenerates, for example, hypoxia experiments 3 and 5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5c</xref>. Thus, while all factors increased the probability to regenerate, they had differential effects on the regeneration phenotypes, suggesting a decoupling to a certain extent between the regulation of the decision to regenerate and the regulation of the subsequent morphogenesis.</p><p>Of the three factors identified in the screen, nutrient input is the broadest, and prompted us to search if a more specific nutritional component could capture the effects of full nutrients in promoting regeneration. Jellyfish are carnivorous and eat protein-rich diets of zooplanktons and other smaller jellyfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham, 2001</xref>). Notably, all three factors induced growth: treated ephyrae are larger than control ephyrae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). The growth effect is interesting because of essential amino acids that must be obtained from food, branched amino acids supplementation correlates positively with protein synthesis and growth, and in particular, L-leucine appears to recapitulate most of the anabolic effects of high amino acid diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lynch and Adams, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stipanuk, 2008</xref>). Motivated by the correlation between growth and increased regeneration frequency, we wondered if leucine administration could promote regeneration. Animals typically have a poor ability to metabolize leucine, such that the extracellular concentrations of leucine fluctuate with dietary consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wolfson et al., 2016</xref>). As a consequence, dietary leucine directly influences cellular metabolism. Feeding amputated ephyrae with leucine indeed led to increased growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Assessing arm regeneration in the leucine-supplemented ephyrae, we observed a significant increase in the regeneration frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f–g</xref>, 95% CI [2.5, 6.6-fold], p&lt;10<sup>–4</sup>). Furthermore, leucine treatment phenocopies the effect of high nutrients, improving all measured phenotypic metrics: increasing multi-arm regeneration, the length of arm regenerate, and the frequency of rhopalia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>).</p><p>These experiments demonstrate that abundant nutrients, the growth factor insulin, reduced oxygen level, and the amino acid L-leucine promote appendage regeneration in <italic>Aurelia</italic> ephyra.

However, we also observed patterned responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Skeletal staining of the portion removed from this digit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j</xref>) shows that it was amputated at the proximal P3 transecting the os hole. By 7 weeks, skeletal staining of the regrown digit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j</xref>) shows that the P3 bone was almost completely regrown. The regrown P3 shows trabecular appearance that is similar in general structure but not identical to the original P3. Another dramatic response was observed from another digit, which began reforming the nail by 7 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>). Skeletal staining of the portion removed from this digit shows that it was amputated across the P2 bone, removing the entire epiphyseal cap along with the sesamoid bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k</xref>). Skeletal staining of the regenerating digit shows that the epiphyseal cap was regrown, along with its associated sesamoid bone. Moreover, articulating from the regenerated P2 appears to be the beginning of the two supplements: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref> next phalangeal bone (arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k</xref>). To our knowledge, the regenerative response observed in these digits represents the most dramatic extent of self-organized mammalian digit regeneration reported thus far. Distal phalange regeneration in adults has not been reported, while interphalangeal joint formation from a P2 amputation has been achieved only through sequential Bmp administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu et al., 2019</xref>) and there has been no documentation of the regrowth of the sesamoid bone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, amputations were performed on <italic>Aurelia</italic> appendage, <italic>Drosophila</italic> limb, and mouse digit. None of these animals are known to regenerate robustly (<italic>Aurelia</italic>) if at all (<italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse) from these amputations. Upon administration of L-leucine and sugar/insulin, dramatic regenerative response was observed in all systems. The conserved effect of nutrient supplementation across three species that span more than 500 million years of evolutionary divergence suggests energetic parameters as ancestral regulators of regeneration activation in animals.</p><p>While we did not test the regenerative effect of hypoxia beyond <italic>Aurelia</italic>, it is notable that in mice hypoxia coaxes cardiomyocytes to re-enter cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimura et al., 2015</xref>) and activate HIF1α promotes healing of ear hole punch injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Notably in <italic>Aurelia</italic>, the amputation bisected through the body, and more than appendage was in fact regenerated, for example, circular muscle in the body is regrown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Thus, nutrient supplementation may have regenerative effect in body parts beyond appendage.</p><p>The diverse physiologies of animals across phylogeny may seem difficult to reconcile with a conserved regulation of regeneration activation, especially in the view of regeneration as recapitulation of development. Growing a jellyfish appendage is different from building a fly leg or making a mouse digit. However, there is another way of looking at regeneration as a part of tissue plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galliot and Ghila, 2010</xref>). In this view of regeneration, upstream from tissue-specific morphogenesis is a conserved regulation of cell growth and proliferation. In support of this idea, early steps in regeneration across species and organs rely one way or another on proliferation by stem cells or differentiated cells re-entering cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox et al., 2019</xref>). We propose that in animals that poorly regenerate, high nutrient input turns on growth and anabolic states that promote tissue rebuilding upon injury.</p><p>That regenerative response can be induced seemingly blurs the boundary between regenerating versus non-regenerating animals, because the factors identified in the study are not exotic. Variations in amino acids, carbohydrates, and oxygen levels are conditions that the animals can plausibly encounter in nature. These observations highlight two potential insights into regeneration. First, regeneration is environmentally dependent. An animal would stop at wound healing under low-energy conditions and regenerate in energy-replete conditions. In this view, for the animals examined in this study, the typical laboratory conditions may simply not be conducive to regeneration. Alternatively, the interpretation we favor, what we observed is inherent regeneration, which can be activated with broad environmental factors. We favor this interpretation because the regenerative response was unusually variable. The variability stands in stark contrast to the robust regeneration in, for example, axolotl, planaria, or hydra. Whereas wild-type processes tend to be robust, mutations produce phenotypes that are sensitive to variations in physiological parameters. Thus, just like mutant phenotypes show varying penetrance and expressivity, the variable regenerative response speaks to us as a fundamental consequence of activating a latent biological module. In this interpretation, the ordinariness of the activators suggests ancestral regeneration as part of a response to broad environmental stimuli. It would be interesting next to identify individual differences that contribute to varying propensities to mount regenerative response.</p><p>In particular, the conserved effects of nutrient supplementation suggest that regeneration might have originally been a part of growth response to abundant environments. No nutrient dependence has been observed in highly regenerating animal models such as planaria, hydra, and axolotl. Environment-dependent plasticity, however, is pervasive in development, physiology, behavior, and phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">West-Eberhard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moczek et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore conjecture that environment-dependent plasticity may have characterized the ancestral form of regeneration. In this conjecture, present regenerating lineages might have decoupled the linkage with environmental input and genetically assimilated regenerative response—because regeneration is adaptive or coupled to a strongly selected process, for example, reproduction. In parallel, non- or poorly regenerating animals might have also weakened the linkage with environmental input, but to silence the regenerative response. This predicts an ancient form of a robustly regenerative animal (like planaria, hydra, and axolotl) that tunes its regeneration frequency to nutrient abundance. Such plasticity has been reported in the basal lineage Ctenophora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bading et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this study suggests that an inherent ability for appendage regeneration is retained in non-regenerating animals and can be unlocked with a conserved strategy. The treatments across species were not exactly identical, and correspondingly there might be differences in the precise molecular mechanisms—in spite of which they could be applied across species in a predictive manner. In line with our findings, the role of nutrients in promoting regeneration was reported in yet another species (in the <italic>Xenopus tadpoles</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2021</xref>). While the observed regenerative response is not perfect, this motivates further investigation into potentially more promoting factors or the possibility of combining broad promoting factors with species- or tissue-specific morphogenetic regulators. Reiterating Spallanzani’s hope, Marcus Singer supposed half a century ago that ‘... every organ has the power to regrow lying latent within it, needing only the appropriate “useful dispositions” to bring it out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singer, 1958</xref>).’ The surprise, in hindsight, is the simplicity by which the regenerative state can be promoted with ad libitum amino acid and sugar supplementation. This simplicity demonstrates a much broader possibility of organismal regeneration, and can help accelerate progress in regeneration induction across animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

alternatively named <italic>A. coerulea</italic> based on recent molecular classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scorrano et al., 2016</xref>). Polyps were reared at 68°F, in 32 ppt artificial seawater (ASW, Instant Ocean), and fed daily with brine shrimps (<italic>Artemia nauplii</italic>) enriched with <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> algae (both from Brine Shrimp Direct). To induce strobilation, polyps were incubated in 25 M 5-methoxy-2-methyl-indole (Sigma-Aldrich M15451) at 68°F for an hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuchs et al., 2014</xref>). Ephyrae typically began to strobilate within a week. Strobilated ephyrae were fed daily with high amount of rotifers (<italic>Brachionus plicatilis</italic>, Reed Mariculture) until amputation time.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experiment in the original habitat</title><p>The polyp population in the study arose from parental polyps collected off the coast of Long Beach, CA (33°46′04.2″N 118°07′44.2″W, GPS: 33.7678376–118.1289559). Ephyrae were amputated in location and immediately after submersed in the ocean. For submerging the amputated ephyrae in the ocean, a two-layered aquarium was custom-built. Ephyrae were placed in plastic canisters with a 7-cm diameter hole cut in the lid and covered with a 250-μm plastic screen. The canisters were then placed in a thick plastic tank fitted with a 500-μm plastic screen on top. This design offers protection to the ephyrae against predators and strong waves, while at the same time allowing exchange of water, zooplanktons, and other particulates. Ephyrae were collected after 2 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Regeneration experiments</title><p>All experiments were performed at 68°F. Two to three days old ephyrae were anesthetized in 400 μM menthol and amputated using a razor blade mounted on an x-acto knife handle. Amputated ephyrae were let to recover in 1 L sand settling cones (Nalgene Imhoff, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In each experiment, ~90 animals were amputated for each condition (e.g., 90 animals for control and 90 animals for treated). Because of the varying baseline across strobilation batches, each experiment was repeated across 2–5 strobilation batches (biological replicates). These sample sizes were chosen to obtain a 95% confidence level on the treatment effect (statistical analysis described below). Hundreds of experimental animals were first amputated, mixed together in a beaker, and then randomly allocated to the control or treatment groups. Regeneration was assessed at various times for 1–2 weeks after amputation, before onset of maturation to medusa. All data were included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Rationale for the amputation scheme</title><p>Among the possible amputation schemes, 3-arm amputation was chosen because it could be performed fastest. Removing one arm requires carefully cutting across the base of the arm while avoiding injuring the surrounding body. Removing two arms is less hard but still requires awkward positioning of the knife. Removing four arms again takes more time because it requires cutting through the large protruding manubrium, which also affects the animal’s feeding ability. The fast 3-arm amputation facilitates testing hundreds of ephyrae per experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Nutrients</title><p>Amputated ephyrae were fed daily with rotifers. The number of rotifers was estimated using a six-well plate fitted with STEMgrid (the same principle as using a hemocytometer). In this study, low food was ~10–20 rotifers/ephyra and high food was ~40 rotifers/ephyra. To replicate the study, these numbers should only be used as initial estimates, as what is ‘low’ or ‘high’ food amount may easily vary across lab cultures (e.g., rotifer culture, differences across <italic>Aurelia</italic> strains, etc.). Most if not all rotifers were typically consumed within an hour (determined by measuring the rotifers in the water).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Insulin</title><p>Immediately after amputation, ephyrae were placed in ASW supplemented with 500 nM human recombinant insulin (Sigma-Aldrich I0908). Insulin was refreshed weekly. To determine the concentration used, a range of concentrations, 10 nM to 3 mM, were tested. The concentration 500 nM was chosen as it maximized regeneration frequency while avoiding solubility problems. To control that the effect of insulin was not due to non-specific additions of proteins, BSA at 500 nM was tested.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Hypoxia</title><p>Immediately after amputation, ephyrae were placed in hypoxic ASW. To create a hypoxic environment, nitrogen or argon, instead of ambient air, was pumped into the bubbler cone, beginning from the day before the experiment and maintained throughout the duration of the experiment. The bubbler cone was sealed with parafilm to maintain the lowered oxygen level. The nitrogen/argon flow was adjusted to achieve 50% reduction in the dissolved oxygen level. Dissolved oxygen level was measured using a Clark-type electrode Unisense OX-500 microsensor. The measurement was normalized to oxygen level in control ASW bubbled normally with ambient air. Oxygen measurement was performed prior to the experiment and subsequently every 3 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>L-leucine</title><p>Immediately after amputation, ephyrae were placed in ASW supplemented with 100 μM L-leucine (Sigma-Aldrich L1002, the cell-permeable methyl ester hydrochloride form). L-leucine was refreshed weekly. To determine the concentration used, a range of concentrations from one to hundreds of mM was tested. The concentration of 100 mM was chosen as it maximized the regeneration frequency without non-specific, negative effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To assess the statistical significance of the treatments, meta-analysis of effect size was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borenstein et al., 2009</xref>).

Treated flies, but not control flies, were sometime continued on yeast supplementation. Flies were imaged immediately after amputation and 1–3 additional times over the course of 2–4 weeks. As anesthetized flies jitter, images were taken in a video format, and single frames were then selected for analysis in which the leg stump was in focus.

Mice were anesthetized with 1–5% isoflurane (in oxygen) in an induction chamber, followed by maintenance on a nosecone. The mouse was positioned on its belly with its hind paws outstretched and the ventral side of the paw facing upwards. Sustained-Release Buprenorphine was administered (Buprenorphine SR LAB) at 0.5 mg/kg subcutaneously as an analgesic. Blood flow to the hindlimb was stemmed by tying a rubber band around the ankle and clamping it with a hemostat. All surgical procedures were carried out under a Zeiss Stemi 305 dissection microscope. An initial incision, parallel to the position of foot, was made through the ventral fat pad using Vannas spring scissors (World Precision Instruments, 14003). The length of this incision was determined by the amount of ventral skin needed to seal the digit amputation wound completely. The ventral skin freed in the initial incision was peeled back using surgical forceps, and a no. 10 scalpel (Sklar, 06-3110) was used to amputate and bisect the digit completely through the second or third phalange. Digits 2 and 4 on the right hind paw were operated on in this fashion, while digit three remained unamputated as an internal control. The amputation wound was immediately closed with the ventral skin flap and sealed with GLUture (Zoetis, Kalamazoo, MI). Amputated portions were immediately fixed as control for skeletal staining.

Tissue was cleared in 2 % potassium hydroxide at room temperature for 1 day, 1% potassium hydroxide for 1 day, and then taken through an increasing glycerol series (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%). The stained samples were imaged on Zeiss AxioZoom.V16 stereo zoom microscope with a Zeiss AxioCam 503 color camera or a Zeiss Stemi 305 dissection microscope with an iPhone six camera.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>Inventor in patent rights application for findings in the manuscript</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All studies comply with relevant ethical regulations for animal testing and research, and received ethical approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at the California Institute of Technology.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Virginie Courtier-Orgogozo as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Eve Gazave (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Prior to this study, <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult legs were not thought to be capable of any regeneration. Given the low number of legs on which observations were made (apparently only 7 legs) and the authors' mention of removing contaminating flies with 'uncut tibias or wrong cuts', better documentation is needed to be fully convinced that these few cases represent genuine instances of regeneration. See detailed comment of Reviewer #2 below regarding this important point.</p><p>If such data are impossible for you to obtain at this point, then we would suggest to remove the part on <italic>Drosophila</italic> from your paper and focus your manuscript on Aurelia and mice only. Removing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> analysis would significantly reduce the broadness of your study, but it would still be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. We would much prefer that you include additional data and confirm your <italic>Drosophila</italic> results, as this would have much more impact in the field. Furthermore, we greatly acknowledge the original approach of the authors to use three different models to deal with a biological question in a comparative manner. Removing one of the three models would greatly diminish this aspect.</p><p>(2) Currently figure 6 presents a few selected examples which are not easy to compare between treated mice and control groups because they have variable or unspecified sites of amputation (except panels 6i and k, which are comparable). It would be good to compare more carefully the treated animals and controls with respect to the precise position of the amputation site.</p><p>(3) The claim that treatments 'induce' regeneration seems exaggerated, given that appendage regeneration in Aurelia and in mouse digits can occur to a variable extent in untreated animals. These treatments appear to increase the frequency and extent of regeneration in the context of a limited and variable regenerative response. This should be rephrased in the text.</p><p>(4) Please justify why in Aurelia you performed an amputation that remove almost the half body of the ephyra and not just one arm.</p><p>(5) Can you please also comment on the high variability observed in Aurelia, including the regenerative response in the controls.</p><p>(6) Please take into account the various comments below regarding the description of the methods and the presentation of the results.</p><p>(7) An interesting paper (Williams et al. 2021 Dev biol, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160621000166) was published recently about nutrient availability and regeneration ability in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. <italic>Xenopus</italic> usually lose regenerative competence at a certain stage and the authors were able to restore this regenerative competence by abundant feeding. This study reinforces the idea of the present paper, so maybe it could be mentioned.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 3c-f: explain in the legend what &quot;Exp&quot;, &quot;N&quot; and the various numbers mean.</p><p>Line 187: &quot;bovine serum albumin at the same molarity showed no effect&quot;.

Where is this data shown?</p><p>Figure 3-Figure supplement 1. &quot;Various physical environments for the ephyrae recovering from injury were tested, e.g., shallow vs deep water, seawater with varying salinity, cold vs warm temperature, light versus dark, stagnant water vs current, generating water current through various means, including shaking or rotating to generate turbulent mixing and as shown here air bubbling a conical tube to generate vertical current&quot;. Where is this data shown?</p><p>Figure 3-Figure supplement 2. The colors black/red of the legend box should be inverted.</p><p>Figure 3-Figure supplement 2 legend: typo in &quot;These trees verify the he simple trees are&quot;.</p><p>Figure 4C. What is the black line on the femur after amputation? Is it an artefact/dust? If so, it would be better to show another leg.</p><p>Line 302: among the 925 control flies raised in normal food what was the percentage of white-tip tibia? This is not clear from the text. Also, it would be good to mention which strain(s) was used for normal food conditions.</p><p>In Aurelia and mice several organs in the same animal were amputated and examined a few days later. Is there a correlation within a given animal, i.e. is it more likely to find a regenerated organ when the next one is regenerated in the high-leucine-high-sugar/insulin condition?</p><p>Was leg amputation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> performed on males or females or on a mix of both sexes?</p><p>It is very nice that raw image data of ephyrae and mouse digits were deposited in the open repository CaltechDATA. Could the authors also deposit their raw images of <italic>Drosophila</italic> legs?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Under specific conditions the frequency and extent of arm regeneration in Aurelia increases compared to control conditions. The data on Aurelia are convincing but we would urge the authors to be more explicit about arm regeneration in control conditions. The data presented in figure 3c-f and in the supplementary materials suggest that the frequency of arm regeneration is highly variable in control conditions (ranging from 0 to 85%). While the conclusion that high-nutrient, insulin, hypoxia and leucine treatments increase the frequency or extent of regeneration seems justified, the suggestion that these treatments 'induce' regeneration is somewhat misleading. The data suggest that these treatments increase the frequency and extent of regeneration in the context of a limited and variable regenerative response.</p><p>As a side point, it would be interesting to hear if the authors have any ideas on the source of this variability. Could it be explained by stochastic differences in nutrition, under the nutrient-limiting conditions in the control treatment?</p><p>2) The observation of leg regeneration in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> is, to our knowledge, unprecedented and very intriguing. Given the low number of legs on which these observations were made (apparently only 7 legs), we would need better documentation to be fully convinced that these represent genuine instances of regeneration. In particular:</p><p>a) The amputation site on the tibia is indicated in figure 4c, but it is unclear how rigorously the cuts were made and tracked during these experiments (the authors mention removing contaminating flies with 'uncut tibias or wrong cuts', suggesting that amputation errors and contamination did occur). We would recommend marking the amputation site (e.g. using a permanent dye) to make sure that the extent of new growth from the cut site can be properly assessed in each individual. In the current data it is not possible to verify which was the site of amputation in each of the regenerated limbs.</p><p>b) In order to understand how a patterned leg can re-grow and emerge with a normal cuticle in the absence of molting, it will be necessary to document the process of growth, rather than just the final outcome. For example, it is currently not clear to what extent the images shown in figure 5e might represent different stages of regeneration, rather than variable endpoints. Documenting the timecourse of regeneration on individual limbs would confirm regrowth from the amputated limb stump and show how patterned leg tissue can emerge in the absence of molting. This should be straightforward to do by anaesthetising the flies and imaging the legs at regular intervals under a stereoscope.</p><p>c) A variety of genetically-encoded fluorescent markers widely available in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (e.g. markers for nuclei, epithelial cell outlines, cell proliferation) could be used to describe further this process of growth and regeneration.</p><p>3) The experiments on mouse digits suggest that combined supplementation of leucine, glutamine and sucrose influence the likelihood of digit regeneration, when amputations are performed near a critical boundary at the base of the nail. As shown in figure 6d, the sites of amputation varied, within a region that is known to contain a critical boundary for the ability to regenerate digits (distal cuts regenerate, proximal cuts do not). To be confident of this effect, we feel that the treated animals and controls should be compared more carefully with respect to the precise position of the amputation site. Currently figure 6 presents a few selected examples which are not easy to compare between treated and control groups because they have variable or unspecified sites of amputation (except panels 6i and k, which are comparable). The tables presented in supplementary figure 6 make a useful distinction between amputations in P2 or P3, but the images are not easy to relate to the data presented on that table. The authors also make a useful distinction between patterned and unpatterned responses, but again, it is unclear how these responses relate to the site of amputation and the data presented on the table (it seems there were only 2 cases of patterned regeneration).</p><p>Given that digit regeneration is possible when digits are amputated in a distal location, we think it is somewhat misleading to regard the nutritional treatment as an 'inducer' in a system that is normally incapable of regeneration. Rather, we suggest regarding the treatment as a condition that modulates the frequency and extent of regeneration in a system that has a limited capacity to regenerate. In this respect, the nutritional effects uncovered by this study are interesting variables to consider along with other factors, such as amputation site, age and mouse strain.</p><p>4) We would urge the authors to be more cautious and nuanced on some of the conclusions drawn from these results. Specifically:</p><p>The authors suggest that the effects of these nutritional interventions 'blur the boundary between regenerating versus non-regenerating animals' and suggest that evolutionarily dormant modules for regeneration could be activated in non-regenerating animals (e.g. lines 457-458 and 469). As discussed earlier, it seems that the arm regeneration in Aurelia and mice extends an existing, limited regenerative capacity; no 'evolutionary dormant' modules need to be invoked, as they are already (conditionally) active in these species. The case of <italic>Drosophila</italic> is more relevant for this argument, but should be documented more firmly before such conclusions can be drawn.</p><p>The authors suggest that the same factors promote regeneration in diverse species, but the actual treatments applied in each species differ: in Aurelia high-nutrient, insulin and leucine treatments are tested separately, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leucine and insulin are combined (with the addition of glutamine), in the mouse leucine and sucrose were combined (with glutamine). The authors explain some of these differences in experimental design, but these explanations are not all entirely convincing (e.g. insulin does not need to be administered orally to the mice). More importantly, the effects of these treatments are not identical as the authors suggest. Sucrose metabolism and insulin are linked, but one provides a caloric input while the other elicits a hormonal response. Human insulin fed to <italic>Drosophila</italic> will not have identical effects to the addition of sugar (insulin-like peptides are known to mediate feeding preferences and growth control in <italic>Drosophila</italic>). We accept the suggestion that these interventions could have similar effects on metabolism, but we would urge the authors to be more cautious in their interpretation and more explicit on the potential differences of the treatments they applied in different species.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Please provide references, related to the old studies you mentioned (lines 32 and so on).</p><p>In addition to the conserved regeneration-responsive enhancers identified recently, other studies support the idea of some molecular conservation in regeneration (ex Cary et al. 2019).

Given the low number of legs on which observations were made (apparently only 7 legs) and the authors' mention of removing contaminating flies with 'uncut tibias or wrong cuts', better documentation is needed to be fully convinced that these few cases represent genuine instances of regeneration. See detailed comment of Reviewer #2 below regarding this important point.</p><p>If such data are impossible for you to obtain at this point, then we would suggest to remove the part on Drosophila from your paper and focus your manuscript on Aurelia and mice only. Removing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> analysis would significantly reduce the broadness of your study, but it would still be considered for publication in eLife. We would much prefer that you include additional data and confirm your Drosophila results, as this would have much more impact in the field. Furthermore, we greatly acknowledge the original approach of the authors to use three different models to deal with a biological question in a comparative manner. Removing one of the three models would greatly diminish this aspect.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the Editor and Reviewers for their suggestions, which we believe have strengthened the manuscript. The revised manuscript now includes quantitative single-fly tracking experiments that rigorously document the regenerative response in individual flies. The new results are included in the main text (lines 333-361 and revised Figure 5). The original fly section (lines 287-332 and Figure 4) has been made more concise to accommodate the new results.</p><p>To track regenerative response in individual flies, we housed in each vial a small number of flies that were amputated in different limbs (Figure 5a). The amputated limb position, combined with sex, enabled unique identification of each fly within a vial. Each fly was imaged immediately after amputation and 1-3 additional times over the course of 2-4 weeks. The imaging frequency balanced obtaining time-lapse information with minimizing stress from repeated anesthesia.</p><p>While the previous bulk experiments captured the dramatic phenotype (i.e., a completed leg segment), the quantitative single-fly tracking enabled capturing various extents of leg growth. Time-lapse pictures of control and treated flies are shown in Figure 5b-d. Control tibia stumps showed near-zero percent change in length (Figure 5d; mean -0.3%, 95% CI [-3.8, 3.2%], N=116). By contrast, 49% of treated flies showed growth beyond the 95% confidence intervals of the control distribution (Figure 5f; N=150). The single-fly tracking also enabled capturing intermediate morphologies. For instance, some new growths are pigmented differently and have no sensory bristles (Figure 5g); showed white tissues protruding from the end (Figure 5—figure supplement 1c), which in some stumps is remodeled over time (Figure 5—figure supplement 1d). We believe that results from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> experiments now demonstrate that patterned regrowth can be induced from adult fly limb. The source file “<italic>Drosophila</italic> data.xls” contains the raw data for generating Figure 5e-f. Raw image files are being deposited in the open repository CaltechDATA, doi.org/10.22002/D1.2157.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Currently figure 6 presents a few selected examples which are not easy to compare between treated mice and control groups because they have variable or unspecified sites of amputation (except panels 6i and k, which are comparable). It would be good to compare more carefully the treated animals and controls with respect to the precise position of the amputation site.</p></disp-quote><p>We presented the direct comparison of amputation sites in the tables in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. To follow the reviewers’ suggestion and make the information more visual, we revised Figure 6 to include P3 amputation control. The different lighting was due to the different microscopes accessible during the pandemic, but the morphologies are clearly comparable across all images. Finally, we added for the revision a source file “Mouse data.xls” spreadsheet which lists for each digit analyzed the amputation type, the phenotype score, and the corresponding raw image filename of the bone staining. The raw image files have been deposited to CaltechDATA, doi.org/10.22002/D1.1790.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The claim that treatments 'induce' regeneration seems exaggerated, given that appendage regeneration in Aurelia and in mouse digits can occur to a variable extent in untreated animals. These treatments appear to increase the frequency and extent of regeneration in the context of a limited and variable regenerative response. This should be rephrased in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>Aurelia</italic> where partial regeneration variably occurs in the natural habitat, we agree with the Reviewer and have systematically gone through the <italic>Aurelia</italic> section to ensure the findings are described as “increasing the frequency of regeneration” or “promote regeneration”.</p><p>In mice, however, proximal mouse digits do not regenerate—not at any age and not in any wild strains. Our wording is in accordance to the literature in the field (e.g., PMID 23760480, PMID 20110320, PMID 30723209, PMID 33937937, PMID 29291973). We believe therefore in this case, our choice of wording is validated by the scientific context and precedents in the mouse digit field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Please justify why in Aurelia you performed an amputation that remove almost the half body of the ephyra and not just one arm.</p></disp-quote><p>We have explored various amputations schemes, e.g., removing 1, 2, 3, and 4 arms (PMID: 26080418). The amputation scheme used was chosen because it could be performed with the most ease, hence facilitating screening thousands of ephyrae. We added this rationale in Methods (lines 614-620). With the amputation scheme chosen, Reviewer 3 is correct that although arm regeneration is the most obvious outcome, body parts are also regenerated<bold>—</bold>thus broadening the possible implications of the study. We added this point in Discussion (lines 502-505):</p><p>“Notably in <italic>Aurelia</italic>, the amputation bisected through the body, and more than appendage was in fact regenerated, e.g., circular muscle in the body is regrown (Figure 2e). Thus, nutrient supplementation may have regenerative effect in body parts beyond appendage.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Can you please also comment on the high variability observed in Aurelia, including the regenerative response in the controls.</p></disp-quote><p>The variable regeneration is intriguing to us too, and we are actively probing for individual differences that correlate with regenerative response. We think the variability is a feature of triggering a latent process, which because it has been latent might have lost some robust connectivities and therefore surfaces in a way that is sensitive to environmental and physiological parameters (Discussion, lines 527-536, included below). It is interesting to us that <italic>Aurelia</italic> spontaneously show variable and incomplete regeneration in the natural habitat, suggesting to us leakiness in the linkage.</p><p>“… the regenerative response was unusually variable. The variability stands in stark contrast to the robust regeneration in e.g., axolotl, planaria, or hydra.

The data on Aurelia are convincing but we would urge the authors to be more explicit about arm regeneration in control conditions. The data presented in figure 3c-f and in the supplementary materials suggest that the frequency of arm regeneration is highly variable in control conditions (ranging from 0 to 85%). While the conclusion that high-nutrient, insulin, hypoxia and leucine treatments increase the frequency or extent of regeneration seems justified, the suggestion that these treatments 'induce' regeneration is somewhat misleading. The data suggest that these treatments increase the frequency and extent of regeneration in the context of a limited and variable regenerative response.</p></disp-quote><p>Previously with the bulk experiment, imaging was not performed for every fly.

Could it be explained by stochastic differences in nutrition, under the nutrient-limiting conditions in the control treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>Nutrient availability is not likely to be a major source of the variability as the low food condition is not close to a stochastic regime, at 100-200 rotifers/ephyra. Moreover, the variability was observed in both low and high food conditions. We find the variability intriguing too, and are actively probing for individual differences that correlate with regenerative response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The observation of leg regeneration in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> is, to our knowledge, unprecedented and very intriguing. Given the low number of legs on which these observations were made (apparently only 7 legs), we would need better documentation to be fully convinced that these represent genuine instances of regeneration. In particular:</p><p>a) The amputation site on the tibia is indicated in figure 4c, but it is unclear how rigorously the cuts were made and tracked during these experiments (the authors mention removing contaminating flies with 'uncut tibias or wrong cuts', suggesting that amputation errors and contamination did occur). We would recommend marking the amputation site (e.g. using a permanent dye) to make sure that the extent of new growth from the cut site can be properly assessed in each individual. In the current data it is not possible to verify which was the site of amputation in each of the regenerated limbs.</p><p>b) In order to understand how a patterned leg can re-grow and emerge with a normal cuticle in the absence of molting, it will be necessary to document the process of growth, rather than just the final outcome. For example, it is currently not clear to what extent the images shown in figure 5e might represent different stages of regeneration, rather than variable endpoints. Documenting the timecourse of regeneration on individual limbs would confirm regrowth from the amputated limb stump and show how patterned leg tissue can emerge in the absence of molting. This should be straightforward to do by anaesthetising the flies and imaging the legs at regular intervals under a stereoscope.</p><p>c) A variety of genetically-encoded fluorescent markers widely available in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (e.g. markers for nuclei, epithelial cell outlines, cell proliferation) could be used to describe further this process of growth and regeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the suggestions. We tested them, and marking the leg has not worked because the flies groom away the marking, while staining the fly legs is currently hampered by the high autofluorescence and low penetration of the cuticle. However, the single-fly tracking worked better than expected. The challenges to doing single-fly tracking were two-fold: (i) imaging the sub-millimeter-scale tibias in live flies is not straightforward as anesthetized flies jitter; (ii) stress due to repeated handling and anesthesia appears to reduce regenerative response. We systematically worked out these technical problems over these past months.</p><p>To track single flies, we housed in each vial a small number of flies that were amputated in different limbs (Figure 5a). The limb position combined with sex enabled unique identification of each fly in a vial. Each fly was videotaped immediately upon amputation, and subsequently 1-3 additional times over 2-4 weeks of the experiments. The imaging frequency balanced obtaining time-lapse information and minimizing stress from repeated anesthesia.</p><p>While the previous bulk experiments captured the dramatic phenotype with a completed leg segment, the single-fly tracking enabled capturing flies showing various extents of leg growth. Time-lapse pictures of control and treated flies are shown in Figure 5b-d. Control tibia stumps showed near-zero percent change in length (Figure 5d; mean -0.3%, 95% CI [-3.8, 3.2%], N=116). By contrast, 49% of treated flies showed growth beyond the 95% confidence intervals of the control distribution (Figure 5f; N=150). Moreover, as the Reviewer suggested, the single-fly tracking enabled capturing intermediate morphologies. For instance, some new growths are pigmented differently and have no sensory bristles (Figure 5g); showed white tissues protruding from the end (e.g., Figure 5—figure supplement 1c), which in some stumps is remodeled over time (e.g., Figure 5—figure supplement 1d).</p><p>The new results are included in the main text (lines 333-361 and revised Figure 5). The original fly section (lines 287-332 and Figure 4) has been made more concise to accommodate the new results. We believe that altogether, results from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> experiments now rigorously demonstrate that patterned regrowth can be induced from adult fly limb.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The experiments on mouse digits suggest that combined supplementation of leucine, glutamine and sucrose influence the likelihood of digit regeneration, when amputations are performed near a critical boundary at the base of the nail. As shown in figure 6d, the sites of amputation varied, within a region that is known to contain a critical boundary for the ability to regenerate digits (distal cuts regenerate, proximal cuts do not).</p></disp-quote><p>The boundary of the regenerating vs non-regenerating regions is well established (e.g., PMID: 28493324, PMID: 7100922, PMID: 18234177, PMID: 17147657). The regenerating tip is the third distal part <italic>within</italic> the nail organ. In our experiments, we amputated far from the regenerating region, <italic>below</italic> the base of the nail. Further, for each digit stump, the amputation plane was precisely determined by histological analysis of the digit part removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To be confident of this effect, we feel that the treated animals and controls should be compared more carefully with respect to the precise position of the amputation site. Currently figure 6 presents a few selected examples which are not easy to compare between treated and control groups because they have variable or unspecified sites of amputation (except panels 6i and k, which are comparable). The tables presented in supplementary figure 6 make a useful distinction between amputations in P2 or P3, but the images are not easy to relate to the data presented on that table. The authors also make a useful distinction between patterned and unpatterned responses, but again, it is unclear how these responses relate to the site of amputation and the data presented on the table (it seems there were only 2 cases of patterned regeneration).</p></disp-quote><p>The precise comparison was presented in Table in the supplementary figure 6. Six digits (12.5%) showed patterned regenerative response. To clarify the definition of amputation, revised Figure 6 now includes additional control images to clearly define P3 versus P2 amputations. The different lighting was due to the different microscopes we could access during the pandemic, but the morphologies can be clearly compared. Finally, we added for the revision a source spreadsheet file “Mouse data.xls” which lists for each digit analyzed the amputation type, the phenotype scoring, and the corresponding raw image file name. The raw image data have been deposited to CaltechDATA, doi.org/10.22002/D1.1790.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that digit regeneration is possible when digits are amputated in a distal location, we think it is somewhat misleading to regard the nutritional treatment as an 'inducer' in a system that is normally incapable of regeneration. Rather, we suggest regarding the treatment as a condition that modulates the frequency and extent of regeneration in a system that has a limited capacity to regenerate. In this respect, the nutritional effects uncovered by this study are interesting variables to consider along with other factors, such as amputation site, age and mouse strain.</p></disp-quote><p>Our choice of wording is in accordance to the literature in the mouse digit field (e.g., PMID: 23760480, PMID 20110320, PMID 30723209, PMID 33937937, PMID 29291973). To our knowledge, proximal mouse digits do not regenerate—not at any age and not in any wild strains; therefore there is no context here to say “modulating frequency”. It is also not necessarily correct or the convention to say that observing proximal response “extends” tip regeneration, because it is unclear the extent to which tip regeneration, which requires signals from the nail epithelium, involves different mechanisms (e.g., PMID: 23760480, PMID: 20110320). Thus, we believe therefore in this case, our choice of wording is validated by the scientific context and precedents in the mouse digit field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) We would urge the authors to be more cautious and nuanced on some of the conclusions drawn from these results. Specifically:</p><p>The authors suggest that the effects of these nutritional interventions 'blur the boundary between regenerating versus non-regenerating animals' and suggest that evolutionarily dormant modules for regeneration could be activated in non-regenerating animals (e.g. lines 457-458 and 469). As discussed earlier, it seems that the arm regeneration in Aurelia and mice extends an existing, limited regenerative capacity; no 'evolutionary dormant' modules need to be invoked, as they are already (conditionally) active in these species. The case of <italic>Drosophila</italic> is more relevant for this argument, but should be documented more firmly before such conclusions can be drawn.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that it’s important to be cautious. The full version of the paragraph the Reviewer is referring to (now lines 518-536) explicitly lays out possible different interpretations of the data. Not all readers have to agree with the interpretation we favor, and we word our conclusion to provide space for differing ideas. We revise the paragraph to further clarify that we are describing interpretations:</p><p>“That regenerative response can be induced seemingly blurs the boundary between regenerating versus non-regenerating animals, because the factors identified in the study are not exotic: variations in amino acids, carbohydrates, and oxygen levels are conditions that the animals can plausibly encounter in nature. […] Alternatively, the interpretation we favor, what we observed is latent regeneration, which can be activated with broad environmental factors. … ”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest that the same factors promote regeneration in diverse species, but the actual treatments applied in each species differ: in Aurelia high-nutrient, insulin and leucine treatments are tested separately, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leucine and insulin are combined (with the addition of glutamine), in the mouse leucine and sucrose were combined (with glutamine). The authors explain some of these differences in experimental design, but these explanations are not all entirely convincing (e.g. insulin does not need to be administered orally to the mice). More importantly, the effects of these treatments are not identical as the authors suggest. Sucrose metabolism and insulin are linked, but one provides a caloric input while the other elicits a hormonal response. Human insulin fed to Drosophila will not have identical effects to the addition of sugar (insulin-like peptides are known to mediate feeding preferences and growth control in Drosophila). We accept the suggestion that these interventions could have similar effects on metabolism, but we would urge the authors to be more cautious in their interpretation and more explicit on the potential differences of the treatments they applied in different species.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have included explicit discussion on the differences in the Discussion (lines 551-554):</p><p>“In conclusion, this study suggests that an inherent ability for appendage regeneration is retained in non-regenerating animals and can be unlocked with a conserved strategy.

Are you still in the context of appendage regeneration when removing half of the body?</p></disp-quote><p>We tested various amputation schemes, and chose the amputation scheme that was the fastest to do and facilitated consistency, enabling testing thousands of ephyrae. Removing 1 arm takes quite a bit more time as one has to cut specifically across the arm base while avoiding injuring the surrounding arms. Removing 2 arms is less hard but still requires awkward positioning of the knife. Removing 4 arms again takes more time because one has to cut through the large protruding manubrium, and this way of amputation also affects the animal’s feeding ability. This rationale is now added in Methods (L614-6120).</p><p>With the amputation scheme chosen, arm regeneration is the most obvious outcome. However, the reviewer is correct that the body is also partially regenerated. We include this point in the discussion (L502-505):</p><p>“Notably in <italic>Aurelia</italic>, the amputation bisected through the body, and more than appendage was in fact regenerated, e.g., circular muscle in the body is regrown (Figure 2e). Thus, nutrient supplementation may have regenerative effect in body parts beyond appendage..… ”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L121 and so on: How did you chose your &quot;various molecular and physical factors&quot;?</p><p>L163: no effects observed by using modulators of developmental pathways.

No, if one thinks that ephyrae, being planktonic, should naturally experience water current. Yes, because from other experiments in the lab, we knew that ephyrae are perfectly fine, can recover from injury through symmetrization, and can even develop into medusae in stagnant water. Therefore, the requirement for current may be more subtle than simply for ensuring general health. We added a sentence to highlight this point in the revised manuscript (now L175):</p><p>“We first identified a necessary condition: water current.

Regulations of stem-ness and differentiation are tightly linked to regulation of proliferation, which is highly conserved across metazoan cells. We revised the sentences to hopefully better explain this idea (L510-515):</p><p>“… In this view of regeneration, upstream from tissue-specific morphogenesis is a conserved regulation of cell growth and proliferation. […] We propose that in animals that poorly regenerate, high nutrient input turns on growth and anabolic states that promote tissue rebuilding upon injury.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L456: Is there any previous study showing the importance of nutrient for regeneration?</p></disp-quote><p>There are very few, to our knowledge, and we have cited the most relevant ones in the mansucript: The ctenophore study (Bading et al. 2017, line 549) and, as suggested by the Reviewers, the recent <italic>Xenopus</italic> study (Williams et al. 2021, line 555).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L457: Do we have insight about the importance of environment for regeneration in some model species?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of studies showing that the model species do not regenerate in some environments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L465 to 470: I am not sure to follow this part of the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>What we have in mind is to contrast the variable regenerative response with how wild-type traits tend to show robustness (e.g, Waddington, 1942 https://doi.org/10.1038/150563a0; Andreas Wagner, 2007 ISBN 9780691134048). Wild-type phenotypes can of course vary too, but the variation that we observed does not resemble stable polymorphisms. Rather, it is reminiscent to variation exhibited by a mutant phenotype, which by virtue of moving out of the wild-type optimum, is sensitive to physiological parameters. We revised the sentences to better clarify this point (L528-532):</p><p>“… The variability stands in stark contrast to the robust regeneration in e.g., axolotl, planaria, or hydra. […] Thus, just like mutant phenotypes show varying penetrance and expressivity, the variable regenerative response speaks to us as a fundamental consequence of activating a latent biological module. …”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L472: Importance of food availability and so nutrient dependence have been described for ctenophore a highly regenerating model. see Bading et al. 2017.

No studies that we know of has implicated nutrient/energy specifically. However, the roles of metabolic parameters are increasingly being implicated in some systems, e.g., in tissue repair (doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.059), in heart regeneration (doi: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.50163) and more recently in zebrafish tail regeneration (doi: 10.1101/2020.03.03.975318). We find these studies tantalizing. However since we do not have specific molecular mechanisms and because these studies are in different organs, we refrain for now from citing them and making generalization. We are open to suggestion if the Reviewer thinks it would benefit the mansucript to cite these studies.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We appreciate that you increased the sample size for experiments involving <italic>Drosophila</italic>.
