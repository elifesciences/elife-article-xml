associated with human breast cancer metastasis. Endosomal FAK signalling is critical for cancer cell migration. Here we identified the pivotal roles of PRMT7 in promoting endosomal FAK signalling activation during breast cancer metastasis. PRMT7 exerted its functions through binding to scaffold protein SHANK2 and catalyzing di-methylation of SHANK2 at R240. SHANK2 R240 methylation exposed ANK domain by disrupting its SPN-ANK domain blockade, promoting in co-accumulation of dynamin2, talin, FAK, cortactin with SHANK2 on endosomes. In addition, SHANK2 R240 methylation activated endosomal FAK/cortactin signals in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, all the levels of PRMT7, methylated SHANK2, FAK Y397 phosphorylation and cortactin Y421 phosphorylation were correlated with aggressive clinical breast cancer tissues. These findings characterize the PRMT7-dependent SHANK2 methylation as a key player in mediating endosomal FAK signals activation, also point to the value of SHANK2 R240 methylation as a target for breast cancer metastasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) catalyze mono-methylation and symmetric or asymmetric di-methylation of arginine residues on both histone and non-histone substrates to modulate diverse biological processes, including transcription, cell signalling, mRNA translation, DNA damage repair signalling, receptor trafficking, protein stability and pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jelinic et al., 2006</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bedford and Clarke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dhar et al.,

Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) was reported as a type III PRMT to catalyze mono-methylation of arginine residues on both histone and non-histone substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bedford and Clarke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karkhanis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanc and Richard, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jain and Clarke, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haghandish et al., 2019</xref>). Recent studies also reported that PRMT7 can symmetrically di-methylate proteins such as p38 and GLI2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vuong et al., 2020</xref>). Others and our previous studies have linked PRMT7 to breast cancer progression. Specifically, our previous work reported that PRMT7 promoted metastasis of breast carcinoma cells by triggering EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). PRMT7 can also upregulate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase nine to promote metastasis of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldwin et al., 2015</xref>). We also found that PRMT7 was automethylated at residue R531, which potentiated the PRMT7-induced EMT program and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geng et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Endocytosis of migrating cells is a fundamental process which is required for adhesion formation and efficient cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scita and Di Fiore, 2010</xref>). Increasing evidence indicates that deregulated endocytosis is a relapse mechanism that contributes to the acquisition of malignant characteristics in tumour cells, including enhanced cell migration, invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamidi and Ivaska, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>). During invasive cell migration, receptors are internalized through the cyclic trafficking of endosome and transported to early endosome before recycling back to the plasma membrane, consequently the cytoskeleton is polarized by actin polymerization via scaffold proteins, and forming a leading protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trusolino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Verma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamidi and Ivaska, 2018</xref>). The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase and plays a pivotal role in many cellular processes such as cell adhesion, survival and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murphy and Courtneidge, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alanko and Ivaska, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schoenherr et al., 2018</xref>). During endocytosis, integrin or talin engages with FAK to co-localize on endosome. FAK undergos autophosphorylation on Y397, which results in cell dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alanko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nader et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiuping et al., 2018</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamidi and Ivaska, 2018</xref>). Additionally, Y397 phosphorylation of FAK facilitates the association of FAK with actin-binding protein cortactin, which renders cortactin function in formation of lamellipodia and filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tomar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Although increased endosome recycling to the plasma membrane contributes to enhanced cell migration, the mechanism of endosomal assembly and signals activation is largely unknown. Recent reports also uncovered the connection between arginine methylation and phosphorylation with endocytic trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albrecht et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether PRMT7 promotes breast cancer metastasis through regulating endocytic traffic remains unclear.</p><p>Scaffolding proteins SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 2 (SHANK2) localizes in cytoplasm and plays important roles in regulating synapse plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Naisbitt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sala et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sheng and Kim, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tu et al., 1999</xref>). The SHANK family of master scaffolding proteins include three members, thatÂ is SHANK1, 2 and 3. SHANK family proteins have been linked to Autistic Spectrum Disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Monteiro and Feng, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>). Mutations in genes encoding SHANK family proteins (SHANK1, 2 and 3) often result in marked behavioural phenotypes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mameza et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schmeisser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Won et al., 2012</xref>), such as an increase in repetitive routines, altered social behaviour and anxiety-like phenotypes. Recent studies also linked SHANK family proteins to cancer cell invasion. SHANK1 and SHANK3 were reported to inhibit cell spreading, migration and invasion in cancer cells through sequestering active Rap1 and R-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lilja et al., 2017</xref>). However, the precise roles of SHANK2 in tumour progression have not been investigated.</p><p>In this study, we identified that SHANK2 was a new substrate of PRMT7. Methylation of SHANK2 at R240 by PRMT7 exposed ANK domain by disrupting its SPN-ANK domain blockade. Further, SHANK2 R240 methylation reinforced breast cancer cell migration through activating endosome FAK signalling. Collectively, these findings represent one mechanistic explanation for how PRMT7 regulating breast cancer cell metastasis by mediating endosome formation, and may provide potential clues for tumour metastasis treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SHANK2 interacts with PRMT7 and is a substrate for PRMT7-mediated arginine methylation</title><p>To explore the mechanism of PRMT7 action in tumour metastatic progression, we used the Flag-tagged PRMT7 fusion protein as bait in mass spectrometry to pick up the possible regulatory factors, which might be directly regulated by PRMT7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The results revealed that PRMT7 is associated with multiple proteins including SHANK2, MRPS23, Plectin1, SNRPB and ARHGAP32. Among the PRMT7-interacting proteins, we chose SHANK2 as a target for a more detailed study. Although SHANK1 and SHANK3 have been reported to inhibit cancer cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lilja et al., 2017</xref>), whether SHANK2 plays a role in cancer progression is unknown. To determine whether PRMT7 methylates SHANK2, we first conducted a CoIP assay to confirm the binding between PRMT7 and SHANK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). We then incubated the purified GST-tagged PRMT7 with SHANK2 protein, and the results showed that they could interact with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To map the SHANK2 regions that bind PRMT7, we expressed a series of truncated GST- SHANK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and found that the SHANK2 ANK, PDZ and SAM domains were responsible for the interaction between PRMT7 and SHANK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The interaction between PRMT7 and SHANK2 indicated that SHANK2 might be a new substrate of PRMT7.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PRMT7 methylated SHANK2.</title><p>Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyzes were performed with the indicated antibodies.Â (<bold>A</bold>) PRMT7 associated proteins from MCF7 cells expressing stable FLAG-PRMT7 were immunopurified with anti-FLAG (Î±-FLAG) affinity resins.

SHANK2 di-methylation level was reduced upon PRMT7 depletion, and the reduced di-methylation of SHANK2 was restored by the reconstituted expression of WT PRMT7 (PRMT7 WT) but not by mutant PRMT7 at its enzymatic domain (PRMT7 Mut) in MDA-MB-231 cells (high level of PRMT7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). Meanwhile, SHANK2 di-methylation level was attenuated by the reconstituted expression of WT PRMT7 (PRMT7 WT) but not of mutant PRMT7 at its auto-methylation residue (PRMT7 R531 mutant) in PRMT7 depleted MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To further confirm PRMT7 directly methylated SHANK2, we used purified GST-PRMT7 and HA-SHANK2 for in vitro methylation assay followed by incubation with SAM (the methyl donor). Apparently, incubation of recombinant PRMT7 and SHANK2 gave rise to a remarkable increase in methylation of SHANK2 in the presence of SAM, while SHANK2 methylation was undetectable in the absence of SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These results suggest that PRMT7 physically interacts with and methylates SHANK2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PRMT7 methylates SHANK2 at R240 residue</title><p>To further identify the methylation site of SHANK2, we performed mass spectrometric analysis using malignant breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 lysate with overexpressed Rat HA-SHANK2 (a gift from Dr. Min Goo Lee). We identified that the arginine 240 residue (R240) of SHANK2 was di-methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Using sequence homology comparison, we found that the R240 residue of SHANK2 is evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To determine whether SHANK2 R240 residue was methylated by PRMT7, we constructed lentiviral vectors containing shRNAs targeting the 3âUTR of SHANK2 to knock down the endogenous SHANK2 of MDA-MB-231 cells. Then, we transfected SHANK2 wild-type or SHANK2 mutation with R240 residue replaced by lysine (SHANK2 R240K) into endogenous SHANK2 depleted MDA-MB-231 cells. We found that di-methylation level of SHANK2 R240K was lower when compared to SHANK2 WT in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). We then overexpressed increasing doses of PRMT7 in HEK293T cells, and we found that SHANK2 R240 di-methylation level was increased accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). PRMT5 has been reported to interact with PRMT7. We then examined the effect of PRMT5 overexpression on SHANK2 R240 di-methylation in HEK293T cells. We found that dosage dependent expression of PRMT5 did not increase the di-methylation at SHANK2 R240 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Furthermore, we examined the effect of PRMT5 inhibitors (GSK591) on SHANK2 di-methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fedoriw et al., 2019</xref>). We found that even when PRMT5 activity was inhibited, overexpression of PRMT7 could still increase the SHANK2 di-methylation level both in HEK293T and MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Thus, although PRMT5 and PRMT7 existed in the same complex, our data indicated that di-methylation of SHANK2 R240 was mainly mediated by PRMT7. Taken together, these results indicate that PRMT7 physically interacts with SHANK2 to methylate R240 residue of SHANK2.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>PRMT7 methylated SHANK2 at R240.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The purified SHANK2 from MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with HA-SHANK2 was analyzed for methylation by mass spectrometry.

To further investigate the clinical relevance of SHANK2 methylation with breast cancer, a direct western blot analysis of several subtypes of human breast cancer tumours was performed. The results demonstrated that SHANK2 methylation level was significantly higher in luminal B Her2<sup>(+)</sup> and Triple-negative breast cancer samples, than that in normal, luminal A and luminal B Her2<sup>(-)</sup> samples, which implicated a positive correlation between SHANK2 methylation and high metastatic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâE</xref>). In addition, to determine the relationship between PRMT7-mediated SHANK2 R240 methylation and metastasis, we analyzed the correlation between PRMT7 and the stage of breast cancer patients through TCGA Breast (BRCA) database. Among 1075 breast cancer patients, 89 out of 847 PRMT7 low-expression breast cancer patients were stage III or IV (10.5%), while 63 out of 228 PRMT7 high-expression breast cancer patients were stage III or IV (27.6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These data indicated that the expression of PRMT7 was positively correlated with the proportion of patients with stage III or IV breast cancer, which predicted poor prognosis. Next, we intended to study the effects of SHANK2 di-methylation on breast cancer cells. Out of 6 cell lines analyzed, high metastatic potential breast cancer cells (BT549 and MDA-MB-231) exhibited high SHANK2 di-methylation levels, whereas normal mammary epithelial cell (MCF10A), low metastatic potential breast cancer cell (MCF7, BT474 and T47D) showed relatively low SHANK2 di-methylation level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Furthermore, we analyzed the expression profile of EMT-associated markers, and found that the epithelial marker ZO-1 was increased, while the mesenchymal markers Fibronectin and N-cadherin were decreased upon SHANK2 depletion; meanwhile, ZO-1 expression was decreased while Fibronectin and N-cadherin expressions were restored by reconstituted expression of SHANK2 WT but not of SHANK2 R240K in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>).

In addition, MMP2/MMP9 activation was inhibited by SHANK2 depletion, while the inhibition was abrogated by reconstituted expression of SHANK2 WT but not of SHANK2 R240K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), and the migration/invasion capabilities of MDA-MB-231 cells were also inhibited by SHANK2 depletion, and in both cases the inhibition was abrogated by reconstituted expression of SHANK2 WT but not of SHANK2 R240K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and K</xref>).

To further investigate how the dimethylated R240 affects the conformational changes between SPN and ANK domains, the trajectory for the window with the global minimum free energy (the distance between SPN and ANK is 31.5 Ã, the SPN and ANK domains were represented in different colours in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) in WT, the one (the distance between SPN and ANK is 32 Ã) in Dimethyl R240 and the one (the distance between SPN and ANK is 30 Ã) in R240K were analysed. R240 can form hydrogen bonds with its neighbouring residue H236 and by this R240 remotely influences the interactions between SPN and ANK via hydrogen bond network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). It indicates that R240 methylation dramatically decreased interactions between R240 and H236. It further weakened the stability of the closed state of SHANK2.

To further figure out which SHANK2-bound proteins might be affected by SHANK2 R240 methylation induced structural changes, we used mass spectrometry to find the possible regulatory factors. The mass spectrometric data showed that SHANK2 could interact with numerous endosome associate proteins, including Î²1-integrin, talin, FAK, EEA1, dynamin2, clathrin, AP2 and cortactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that methylated SHANK2 might contribute to endosome formation. To test this hypothesis, we first verified the mass spec data by using CoIP assays and we confirmed that talin, FAK, dynamin2, cortactin and SHANK2 were in the same complex in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To determine whether PRMT7-mediated SHANK2 methylation is involved in regulation of endocytosis, we overexpressed PRMT7 in MCF7 cells (low level of PRMT7). We found that overexpression of PRMT7 promoted the co-precipitation of dynamin2/talin/FAK/SHANK2 with cortactin in MCF7 cells, and the interaction was reduced in PRMT7 depleted MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>). Meanwhile, the PRMT7 enzymatic activity mutation (PRMT7 Mut) and PRMT7 R531 mutant attenuated the formation of dynamin2/talin/FAK/SHANK2/cortactin complex in PRMT7 depleted MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Additionally, overexpression of PRMT7 triggered an accumulation in the number of EEA1-positive endosomes with more talin, FAK, EEA1 and dynamin2 colocalization in MCF7 cells, and the colocalization was attenuated in PRMT7 depleted MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and G</xref>). Consistently, the formation of dynamin2/talin/FAK/SHANK2/cortactin was significantly increased by reconstituted expression of SHANK2 WT but not of SHANK2 R240K in SHANK2 depleted MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Meanwhile, SHANK2 WT promoted the recruitment of EEA1-positive endosomes and the majority of SHANK2 was associated with endosome associate proteins, which was significantly reduced by SHANK2 R240K in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).

Indeed, treatment with dynasore decreased PRMT7 induced-EMT program and migration/invasion capabilities of MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7AâC</xref>).

Recent reports showed that endocytosis activity required methionine and PRMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albrecht et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, the roles and mechanisms of arginine methylation in regulation of cell endocytosis remain poorly defined. In this study, we report a new substrate of PRMT7, the scaffold protein SHANK2, which is di-methylated at arginine 240 residue to maintain endocytic activity. In particular, SHANK2 R240K methylation disturbs SPN-ANK domain blockade of SHANK2, thereby resulting in the accumulation of dynamin2, talin, FAK and cortactin on the endosome. SHANK2 R240 methylation further activates endosomal FAK/cortactin signals, which increases the migration of SHANK2-dependent breast cancer metastasis.

Our mass spectrometry results suggested that methylated SHANK2 not only interacted with talin, FAK and cortactin, but also with endosome associate proteins such as clatharin, AP-2 and dynamin2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). It is implicated that the methylated SHANK2 might be involved in clatharin-mediated endocytosis. Dynamin is best known for its role in catalyzing membrane scission at late stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis to release clathrin-coated vesicles into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that dynamin can also regulate earlier stages of endosome maturation through binding the scaffold protein EEA1, in turn regulate the recruitment of other factors to the membrane that control endosomal sorting and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamidi and Ivaska, 2018</xref>). Our results demonstrated that PRMT7 promoted dynamin2 interaction with methylated SHANK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Moreover, the PRMT7-mediated SHANK2 methylation rendered EEA1 to co-localize with SHANK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). These results indicate that methylated SHANK2 might enhance the activity of dynamin2 and thus regulate the formation of endosome.</p><p>Scaffold proteins SHANK1, 2, three are able to bind and interact with a wide range of proteins including actin binding proteins and actin modulators, such as dynamin2, cortactin, RICH2, and PIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sheng and Kim, 2000</xref>). SHANK1, 2, three have been reported to affect the structure and function of the neural circuits and to regulate autism spectrum disorders; but their roles in tumourigenesis are far from illuminated. Recent studies reported that SHANK1 and SHANK3 acted as negative regulators of integrin activity by binding R-Ras, thereby inhibiting migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lilja et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast to SHANK1 and SHANK3, the present study revealed that SHANK2, especially the methylated SHANK2, was correlated with high level of incidence of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Our data demonstrated that methylated SHANK2 promoted breast cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Like SHANK3, our mass spectrometry results demonstrated that methylated SHANK2 could bind to receptor proteins, not only integrin but also Met, NRP1 and EGFR, which indicated that PRMT7-SHANK2 might be involved in receptor mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Although several studies reported that SHANK2 and SHANK3 could form heterodimers, our mass spectrometry results did not found SHANK1 or SHANK3 interacting with SHANK2. Moreover, by comparing SHANK3 protein sequence with SHANK2, we did not find the conservative RXR motif that was a potential methylation sequence by PRMT7. Therefore, whether SHANK3 and SHANK2 have crosstalk still needs further study.</p><p>The intracellular trafficking of endosome must be tightly controlled in space and time to enable effective cell adhesion and microenvironmental sensing and compartmentalize it from other cellular processes. Organelles of these intracellular trafficking pathwaysâincluding endosomes, lysosomes, exosome, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Golgi apparatus, and the plasma membrane are coupled by clatharin-dependent membrane vesicles delivery. In our study, we also demonstrated that methylated SHANK2 could interact with relative endomembrane organelles marker, such as EEA1, LAMP1, Calnexin, GOLM1, Ninein, CD63, TOM70 and LanminA/C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). These results indicated that SHANK2 could localize not only on endosomes but also on lysosome, mitochondria, ER, Golgi, centrosome, exosome and nuclear. Exosomes are key mediators of intercellular communication and can be detected in the tumour microenvironment. Although a small amount of the cell surface SHANK2 was detected, it was barely detected on plasma membrane by immunofluorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). These data suggested that SHANK2 was rapidly internalized after recycling back to the cell surface and/or they might transport to the extracellular space by secreted exosomes. Exosomes are vesicles derived from late endosomes, also known as multivesicular bodies, and can be secreted to the extracellular environments by most cell types. Indeed, we found that the methylated SHANK2 was co-localized with several common exosome marker proteins, including CD63 and CD81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). Meanwhile, SHANK2 WT promoted recruitment of EEA1-positive endosomes and co-localized more CD63 and CD81 than that of SHANK2 R240K in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3B</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the PRMT7-SHANK2 might be secreted by exosomes and continuously internalized and sustained the active talin/FAK/cortactin complexes on endosomes, and thereby provided persistent endosomal signals for tumour progression.</p><p>In conclusion, data presented in this report outlines a working model in which PRMT7 regulates breast tumour metastasis by methylating SHANK2, a new substrate of PRMT7. Specifically, SHANK2 methylation enforces tumour metastasis, while it simultaneously promotes breast cancer cell migration and invasion via triggering endosomal FAK signal activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). As a key player in breast cancer development, methylated SHANK2 might be a potential therapeutic target.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and reagents</title><p>MCF10A, MCF7, T47D, BT474, MDA-MB-231, BT549 and HEK293T cell lines were purchased from ATCC, where all the cell lines were characterized by DNA finger printing and isozyme detection.

Specifically, the authors show that the scaffolding protein SHANK2 is methylated by PRMT7 in breast cancer cells and that this promotes FAK-induced invasive pathways. Finally, it appears as though these associations between PRMT7 and SHANK2 correlate with metastatic potential in breast cancers. Hence, SHANK2 methylation may be a target for the prevention of breast cancer metastasis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;The PRMT7-dependent methylation of shank2 modulates invasion-proliferation switching during breast cancer metastasis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Lynne-Marie Postovit as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Fred Mallette (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While all reviewers agree that this is an interesting and novel finding, worth further investigation, major issues related to a lack of controls in many areas as well as an over interpretation of the results were raised. The experiments needed to address these concerns would exceed those needed for a revision. We generally require that all revision experiments would have to be done with a given timeframe, and it is the feeling from all of the reviewers that the issues they have raised would not allow this to occur. For these reasons, we will not proceed with publishing the work, so that you may move on to other journals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The current manuscript by Liu et al., attempts to link PRMT7 activity concomitant with Shank2 di-methylation, to the regulation of migration (through FAK signaling) and proliferation (through the regulation of H-Ras ubiquitylation).The biochemical data connecting SHANK2 di-methylation to the association with cytoskeletal elements (FAK/cortactin) and H-RAS is extensive but in certain areas lacks critical controls. Overall, the data support the notion that methylation of Shank2 is important and that this modification may be mediated by PRMT7. In this way, the study very much mirrors other published papers wherein PRMT7 has been shown to methylate a protein (like eIF2alpha for example) leading to phenotypic alterations. The functional assays suggesting that SHANK2 methylation may mediate a switch between invasion and proliferation are however very weak and contradictory in some ways. The clinical correlations are also likely underpowered, making it difficult to make conclusions. Very little is known about Shank2 and the idea that methylation (by PRMT7) could refine its binding partners and function is novel. However, further experimentation is needed to further establish functional links as described.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) All proteomics data sets must be shown in order to ascertain how robust and specific the interactions chosen actually are.</p><p>2) The studies outlined in Figure 3 did not actually test whether Shank2 R240 methylation promotes cell migration through activating FAK/cortactin signaling. Similarly, the results presented for proliferation in in Figure 6 did not link the interaction of Shank2 with HRas to its regulation of proliferation. As it stands, the results are purely correlative; such that migration or proliferation assays would need to be designed to test the consequences of these interactions specifically. Indeed, it is likely that Shank2 R240 affects many factors, which may contribute to migration and proliferation.</p><p>3) The statement in subsection âThe PRMT7-mediated shank2 R240 methylation inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation by enhancing H-Ras mono-ubiquitinationâ &quot;As expected, the basal and EGF-induced H-Ras activity was largely increased by reconstituted expression of R240K Shank2 but not of Shank2 WT&quot; is not supported by the data presented in Figure 6.</p><p>4) In Figure 2, all of the samples have methylated Shank2, despite varying levels of Prmt7. Moreover, some samples have very little Shank2. Hence, it is unclear whether the methylated levels would be biologically significant. Indeed, the percentage of methylated protein was not estimated in any assay and probably should be. The protein atlas is not a fantastic way to analyze this type of thing and patient tissues should instead be analyzed. Finally, the RT-PCR analysis should be expanded to include details regarding expression levels in patients with different types of breast cancer and/or differing outcomes. Overall, as it stands the clinical correlations are relatively weak.</p><p>5) Throughout the study, critical controls are missing. For example, in Figure 3, the non-treated controls are needed and in Figure 7, all treatments need to be compared to shShank alone as well as the untreated cells.</p><p>6) The mechanisms by which demethylation of Shnk2 affects function were not sufficiently explored and yet were extrapolated with the data presented in Figure 4. The authors should specifically interrogate how the two methyl groups at R270 affect binding to the chosen proteins. Which parts of Shank2 are binding to the other proteins and how or why is this altered upon di-methylation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors identify the scaffolding protein, shank2 as a substrate of PRMT7 and determine that PRMT7 methylates shank2 on R240. They further show that increased methylation of shank2 is observed in a panel of breast tumour samples and that methylation of shank2 on R240 promotes migration and invasive capacity in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, the authors show that PRMT7 methylation of shank2 promotes activation of the FAK/talin/cortactin pathways leading to increased invasive potential. Conversely, shank2 methylation promotes Ras ubiquitination inhibiting cell proliferation. Lastly, the authors recapitulate these results in in vivo mouse experiments.</p><p>This manuscript builds on the author's previously published works and provides a novel mechanistic understanding of the nexus between tumour growth and invasion potential in breast cancer demonstrating a novel role for PRMT7 and shank2 in these pathways. The novelty of these findings merits publication, however there are issues with the manuscript that should be addressed:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the experiments performed are vaguely described, if they are described at all. This is accentuated with the supplemental figures where they are referred to but not described at all. The authors use different cell lines for their experiments. However, very seldom are the cell lines used indicated in the text.</p><p>2) In many experiments, shank2 siRNAs are used (ex. Figure 3C, Figure 5D, etc.), however a control siRNA is not shown to compare that shank2 is in fact knocked down. There are other instances when shank2 siRNAs are used and there is no shank2 Western blot shown (ex. Figure 3G, Figure 5K etc.)</p><p>3) In some figures, the authors indicate the p-Value for their results (ex. Figure 2C), In other figures, asterisks (***) are used (ex. Figure 3J, 3K, etc.), however, in the figure legend it is not denoted what three asterisks signifies.</p><p>4) On two occasions, mass spectrometry data was not shown (1) Identification of shank2 as a PRMT7 interactor; (2) Identification of shank2 interactors).

The authors report increased symmetric di-methylation of SHANK2 in human breast cancer tissues. Methylated R240 appears to modulate SHANK2 functions of cell migration and invasiveness in breast cancer cells, notably through binding to the Talin/FAK/cortactin integrin signalling pathway. This methylation also inhibits cell proliferation through downregulation of the RAS-MAPK pathway, as a consequence of increased mono-ubiquitinated RAS. Finally, blockade of SHANK2 R240 methylation abolishes the invasive and metastatic phenotype of breast cancer cells, but promotes tumor growth in xenograft experiments. While the overall findings are interesting, the manuscript suffers from over-interpretation, lack of appropriate controls and missing key experiments confirming the role of PRMT7 in the cellular processes involved.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>1) The overall quality of the data is inadequate. There is a general lack of controls for the Western blots, e.g. no blot confirming knock-down, overexpression, IP input, etcâ¦ Immunoblots are also saturated and there are duplicated figures of WB (see minor comments list).</p><p>2) Although the role for SHANK2 R240 methylation and its involvement in cell growth and invasiveness is acceptably characterized, there are almost no genetic studies involving depletion of PRMT7 or its function. In this sense, it is premature to state with confidence that it is the R240 methyl mark that regulates SHANK2-dependent functions in breast cancer. If modulation of the RAS-MAPK and Talin/FAK/cortactin pathways were indeed affected by PRMT7-dependent methylation at R240, then depletion or overexpression of PRMT7 in breast cancer cell lines having high or low PRMT7 levels (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, respectively) would resolve this issue.</p><p>3) It is unclear whether the phenotype of increased tumor growth is dependent on activated RAS-MAPK pathway. The author should have conducted similar experiment using MEK/ERK inhibitor in vivo, for example.</p><p>4) The authors rely on their mass spectrometry analysis for identification of SHANK2 interacting proteins, but there is only little description of this experiment, i.e. no list of genes, no details about the analysis platform/methodology (see Subsection âShank2 R240 methylation promotes cancer cell migration through activating FAK/cortactin signallingâ, subsection âThe PRMT7-mediated shank2 R240 methylation inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation by enhancing H-Ras mono-ubiquitinationâ). Mass spec data should be shown. How many peptides for Shank2 were recovered?

However, structurally it has been shown that PRMT7 is only capable of catalyzing MMA (summarized in Jain and Clarke, 2019). Furthermore, PRMT5, the main PRMT responsible for SDMA is a common contaminant in Flag IPs (Nishioka et al., 2003).

Were appropriate controls with Mock flag-purification performed? If yes, the peptide counts in control conditions should also be provided. Knowing that PRMT5 interacts with PRMT7 (Gonsalvez et al., 2007), that both enzymes generate symmetric di-methylation, and that PRMT5 binds to FLAG peptide (Mellacheruvu et al., 2013), the use of FLAG-tagged PRMT7 as a bait appears as an unsound strategy.

What follows is the authorsâ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The current manuscript by Liu et al., attempts to link PRMT7 activity concomitant with Shank2 di-methylation, to the regulation of migration (through FAK signaling) and proliferation (through the regulation of H-Ras ubiquitylation).The biochemical data connecting SHANK2 di-methylation to the association with cytoskeletal elements (FAK/cortactin) and H-RAS is extensive but in certain areas lacks critical controls. Overall, the data support the notion that methylation of Shank2 is important and that this modification may be mediated by PRMT7. In this way, the study very much mirrors other published papers wherein PRMT7 has been shown to methylate a protein (like eIF2alpha for example) leading to phenotypic alterations. The functional assays suggesting that SHANK2 methylation may mediate a switch between invasion and proliferation are however very weak and contradictory in some ways. The clinical correlations are also likely underpowered, making it difficult to make conclusions. Very little is known about Shank2 and the idea that methylation (by PRMT7) could refine its binding partners and function is novel. However, further experimentation is needed to further establish functional links as described.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Reviewer #1 and 2âs major concern: All proteomics data sets must be shown in order to ascertain how robust and specific the interactions chosen actually are.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for pointing this out. As shown in the Figure 1A and Figure 5B, we added the results of FlagPRMT7 and HA-shank2 mass spectrometry respectively, which included PRMT7 associated proteins/peptides and shank2 associated proteins/peptides.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewer #1 and 3âs major concern: The studies outlined in Figure 3 did not actually test whether Shank2 R240 methylation promotes cell migration through activating FAK/cortactin signaling. Similarly, the results presented for proliferation in in Figure 6 did not link the interaction of Shank2 with HRas to its regulation of proliferation. As it stands, the results are purely correlative; such that migration or proliferation assays would need to be designed to test the consequences of these interactions specifically. Indeed, it is likely that Shank2 R240 affects many factors, which may contribute to migration and proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for the suggestion and performed a series of new experiments in MDA-MB-231 cells and Balb/c nude mice to address this issue. In brief, we used FAK inhibitor GSK2256 to analyze if shank2 R240 methylation promoted cell migration through activating FAK/cortactin signaling (Figure 7FJ-L). Furthermore, we also tested whether shank2 R240 methylation promoted tumour metastasis through triggering FAK/cortactin signalling activation by using FAK inhibitor (Figure 8A). All the results suggested that shank2 R240 methylation promoted tumour metastasis by activating FAK/cortactin signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Reviewer #1âs major concern: In Figure 2, all of the samples have methylated Shank2, despite varying levels of Prmt7. Moreover, some samples have very little Shank2. Hence, it is unclear whether the methylated levels would be biologically significant. Indeed, the percentage of methylated protein was not estimated in any assay and probably should be. The protein atlas is not a fantastic way to analyze this type of thing and patient tissues should instead be analyzed. Finally, the RT-PCR analysis should be expanded to include details regarding expression levels in patients with different types of breast cancer and/or differing outcomes. Overall, as it stands the clinical correlations are relatively weak.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer for raising the critical question about the clinical correlations between shank2 R240 methylation and patients with different types of breast cancer. We re-analyzed the methylation level of shank2 in different types of breast cancer tissues. In the Figure 3A-D and supplement table, we tested the paracancer and cancer tissues of 27 patients and found that the level of PRMT7 and methylation of shank2 was higher in luminal B Her2<sup>(+)</sup> and Triple-negative breast cancer samples than that in normal, luminal A and luminal B Her2<sup>(-)</sup> samples, which implicated a positive correlation between shank2 methylation and high metastatic potential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Reviewer #1 and 3âs major concern: Throughout the study, critical controls are missing. For example, in Figure 3, the non-treated controls are needed and in Figure 7, all treatments need to be compared to shShank alone as well as the untreated cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We have supplemented the control and shshank2 group in full text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Reviewer #1âs major concern: The mechanisms by which demethylation of Shnk2 affects function were not sufficiently explored and yet were extrapolated with the data presented in Figure 4. The authors should specifically interrogate how the two methyl groups at R270 affect binding to the chosen proteins. Which parts of Shank2 are binding to the other proteins and how or why is this altered upon di-methylation?</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion. We presented two methyl groups at shank2 R240 data to analyze the closed/open conformation of the SPN domain and ANK domain. Structural analyze indicated that shank2 R240 methylation disrupted SPN-ANK domain blockade to âopenâ shank2, providing more chances for insertion of partner proteins (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Reviewer #1 and 3âs major concern: The functional assays suggesting that SHANK2 methylation may mediate a switch between invasion and proliferation are however very weak and contradictory in some ways. It is unclear whether the phenotype of increased tumor growth is dependent on activated RAS-MAPK pathway. The author should have conducted similar experiment using MEK/ERK inhibitor in vivo, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewers for raising the issue about shank2 R240 methylation mediated proliferation and invasion switching. Itâs true that proliferation and invasion are two complicated process. In the present manuscript, we just focused on the role of PRMT7 mediated shank2 R240 methylation in promoting invasion and metastasis of breast cancer.</p><p>Due to some studies have shown that RAS activation can activate FAK, and FAK activation can also activate RAS. To simplify the complex problems, we decided to remove the results that shank2 R240 methylation inhibited tumour growth by mono-ubiquitinating RAS, which we are stilling tracing.</p><p>In addition, we performed new experiments in endocytosis and FAK activation to address the mechanism of shank2 methylation triggered breast cancer metastasis. According to the results of shank2 affinity mass spectrometry, we found that methylated shank2 can interact with a kind of endocytosis associated protein, such as clathrin, AP2, dynamin2 and EEA1 etc. Indeed, PRMT7 mediated shank2 methylation reinforced tumour metastasis through activating endosomal FAK signaling (Figure 7D and Figure 8A). Taken together, the results presented indicated that shank2 R240 methylation promoted breast cancer metastasis through activating endosomal FAK signalling.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what follows is the authorsâ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please carefully edit both the Introduction and the Discussion section.

Please use ANOVA to analyse data in Figures 3A and 3B. Also, please include an analysis of a larger data set (ie TCGA) for overall and progression free survival. If there are no correlations, then it may just be that this factor in increased in cancer in general, which would be fine.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable and constructive suggestion. According to Figure 3B, we conducted an optical density analysis of the bands. Through the optical density values, we calculated the ratios of PRMT7 to Î²-actin and di-methylated SHANK2 to SHANK2. We found that the level of PRMT7 and PRMT7 mediated-SHANK2 di-methylation is higher in Luminal B, HER2<sup>+</sup> and triple-negative breast cancer compared with normal breast tissue or Luminal A breast cancer (Figure 3B, C). Therefore, our data implicate a positive correlation between PRMT7 expression and high metastatic potential.</p><p>To further demonstrate the relationship between PRMT7 and metastasis, we analyzed the correlation between PRMT7 and the stage of breast cancer patients through TCGA Breast (BRCA) database. Among 1075 breast cancer patients, 847 had low PRMT7 expression (79%) and 228 had high PRMT7 expression (21%). In addition, we found that 89 out of 847 PRMT7 low-expression breast cancer patients were stage III or IV (10.5%), while 63 out of 228 PRMT7 high-expression breast cancer patients were stage III or IV (27.6%) (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1). These data indicate that the expression of PRMT7 is positively correlated with the proportion of patients with stage III or IV breast cancer, which predicts poor prognosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The IF images in Figure 5 are not ideal, and not the best way to conclude co-localisation. Please comment on weaknesses in discussion, noting that other more precise assays (like PLA) may be warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this issue. Our IF images showed that SHANK2, Talin, FAK, cortactin, EEA1 and Rab5 were localized at the same location in the cells. Consistently, our IP assays also showed that SHANK2, Talin, FAK and cortactin were in the same complex. We agree that PLA is important for analyzing the precise interaction between SHANK2 and endosomal proteins. However, PLA experiment is suitable for proving the binding between two proteins, while our results showed that SHANK2 methylation affected the combination of SHANK2 protein complex. It is not clear which of the two proteins directly bind to each other. Therefore, we did not carry out related work for the time being, and the follow-up work will continue to be studied.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please use ANOVA to analyse Figures 8B and 8D.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.

Please discuss the limitations of this assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Because we found that MDA-MB-231 cells have a higher level of methylation of SHANK2 compared with normal mammary epithelial cell (MCF10A) or low metastatic potential breast cancer cells (MCF7, BT474 and T47D), we examined the effect of SHANK2 methylation on migration/invasion ability and lung metastasis using MDA-MB-231 cells.</p><p>Given that breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells have a lower ability of lung metastasis after tumour formation in situ of nude mice (Raquel et al., 2006); we have to choose tail vein injection to detect the effect of SHANK2 methylation on lung metastasis. Meanwhile, many studies also used mouse tail vein injection to detect lung metastasis using MDA-MB-231 cells (Xiaolong et al., 2017; Kyoungwha et al., 2019; Mark et al., 2019). Consistently, our lung colony assay results indicate that SHANK2 R240 methylation promotes lung metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Introduction â The authors state that PRMT7 is capable of producing SDMA and give two references to support this assertion.

Additionally, alteration of PRMT7 expression can also affect cellular SDMA levels (summarized in Jain and Clarke, 2019), thus making the use of SDMA antibodies tricky when determining and analyzing PRMT7 and its substrates.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer asking a critical question about PRMT7 mediated SDMA. Studies reported that PRMT7 catalyzed histone H4 mono-methylation in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (Wang et al., 2014; Tamar et al., 2018). On the other hand, previous studies also showed that PRMT7 mediated p38 and <italic>GLI2</italic> di-methylation, but did not mediate mono-methylation in skeletal muscle cells (Jeong et al., 2020; Vuong et al., 2020). Similarly, PRMT7 also affected sm di-methylation but not mono-methylation in HeLa cells (Graydon et al., 2007). Our mass spectrometry results indicated that SHANK2 only occurred SDMA in MDA-MB-231 cells with high level of PRMT7. Meanwhile, our results demonstrated that overexpression of PRMT7 resulted in increased symmetric arginine di-methylation of SHANK2 in HEK293T cells (low level of PRMT7), while SHANK2 di-methylation level was reduced upon PRMT7 depletion (Figure 1G-I). Meanwhile, when increasing doses of PRMT7 in HEK293T cells were overexpressed, SHANK2 R240 di-methylation level was increased accordingly (Figure 2E). To further confirm PRMT7 directly methylated SHANK2, we used purified GST-PRMT7 and HA-SHANK2 for in vitro methylation assay followed by incubation with SAM (the methyl donor). Apparently, incubation of recombinant PRMT7 and SHANK2 gave rise to a remarkable increase in methylation of SHANK2 in the presence of SAM (Figure 1J). Data obtained indicate that PRMT7 is required for SHANK2 di-methylation.</p><p>Previously studies reported that PRMT5 and PRMT7 were in the same complex (Gonsalvez et al., 2007). Our mass spectrometry results also showed that PRMT5 and PRMT7 were in the same complex. To determine the role of PRMT5 in PRMT7-mediated SHANK2 R240 di-methylation, we examined the effect of PRMT5 overexpression on SHANK2 R240 di-methylation in HEK293T cells. We found that dosage dependent expression of PRMT5 did not increase the di-methylation of SHANK2 R240 (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A, B). Furthermore, we examined the effect of PRMT5 inhibitors (GSK591) on SHANK2 di-methylation. We found that even inhibiting PRMT5 activity, overexpression of PRMT7 could still increase the SHANK2 di-methylation level both in HEK293T and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C, D). Thus, although PRMT5 and PRMT7 exist in the same complex, our data indicate that the di-methylation of SHANK2 R240 is mainly mediated by PRMT7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 1E â The molecular of each construct should be included in the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added molecular tags of each construct in Figure 1E in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 1G â Can the specificity of the SDMA band corresponding to shank2 be confirmed?

According to Figure 1J and H, we found that SHANK2 only occurred as SDMA but not MMA and ADMA in the presence of PRMT7. Meanwhile, our mass spectrometry results also indicated that SHANK2 only occurred as SDMA in MDA-MB-231 cells. Together, we speculate that PRMT7 may regulate its spatial conformation by combining with other cofactors, resulting in di-methylation of its substrate instead of mono-methylation modification.</p><p>In addition, we analyzed the SDMA of SHANK2 in full uncropped SDMA blot in shCtrl or shPRMT7 MDA-MB-231 cells in the revised manuscript as shown below, indicating that PRMT7 di-methylated the R240 residue of SHANK2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 1J â In text and figure, the authors state that a HA-tagged shank construct was used, however in figure legend and Materials and methods section, it is stated that a Flag-tagged shank construct was used.

Indeed, peptides shown in Figure 1A are part of peptides we selected. Most of our mass spectrometry results are proteins in the cytoplasm (Figure 1A). Consistently, the previous studies proved that PRMT7 was mainly existed in cytoplasm (Ferreira et al., 2020). Therefore, we selected the relevant proteins in the cytoplasm for further research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Performing FLAG-purification to study PRMT7 might generate important contaminations from PRMT5 (and probably PRMT5-associated proteins) since 146 out of 156 (94%) reported experiments in the CRAPome (crapome.org; Mellacheruvu et al., (2013)). Were appropriate controls with Mock flag-purification performed? If yes, the peptide counts in control conditions should also be provided. Knowing that PRMT5 interacts with PRMT7 (Gonsalvez et al., 2007), that both enzymes generate symmetric di-methylation, and that PRMT5 binds to FLAG peptide (Mellacheruvu et al., 2013), the use of FLAG-tagged PRMT7 as a bait appears as an unsound strategy. Please discuss caveats.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer for asking a critical question about the interaction between PRMT7 and PRMT5. To determine how PRMT7 orchestrated the metastasis of breast cancer, we performed FLAG protein purification and mass spectrometry identification in PRMT7-MCF7 cells. Indeed, our mass spectrometry results found that PRMT5 and PRMT7 were in the same complex. According to the results in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1, although PRMT5 and PRMT7 may exist in the same complex and work together, the di-methylation of SHANK2 R240 is mainly mediated by PRMT7.</p><p>On the other hand, we did compare the purification results of FLAG group and FLAG-PRMT7 group by silver staining before performing mass spectrometry on the purified FLAG-PRMT7. However, we only compared the differences in protein bands between the two groups, and did not perform mass spectrometry analysis on the control bands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) In Figure 2C, all the conditions should be shown in the Shank2 IP section (not only in the input). Furthermore, this approach is rather unspecific using anti-SHANK2 instead of tagging the mutant and wt protein. Difficult to assess whether the exogenous protein of endogenous is IPed in this Figure (although SHANK2 levels are restored in depleted cells).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We re-performed the methylation modification of HA-tag SHANK2 in the revised manuscript. indicating that PRMT7 di-methylated the R240 residue of SHANK2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) In Figure 5B, SHANK2 was not identified in anti-SHANK2-immunoprecipitated material. This suggests the lack of enrichment of SHANK2 in the IPed material and probably the non-sepcific purification of PRMT7 and other proteins in the process. Please address this. Furthermore, please include mock anti-HA purified controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. In fact, our mass spectrometry results were also enriched with peptides containing SHANK2, and we added the information about SHANK2 peptides in the revised manuscript. Together, our data indicated that SHANK2 R240 di-methylation catalyzed by PRMT7 was in favour of the assembly of a multi-protein complex to facilitate endosome formation.</p><p>Furthermore, we included the mock anti-HA purified controls in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) SHANK2 protein is referred as &quot;shank2&quot;? Please use standard gene/protein nomenclature.</p></disp-quote><p>We adjusted the SHANK2 gene to â<italic>SHANK2</italic>â and SHANK2 protein to âSHANK2â in the revise manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) The size of some figures is inappropriate (Figure 3G and H (inlays), immunofluorescence images in Figure 5; inlays in Figure 7; Figure 8A. Please increase sizes.</p></disp-quote><p>We adjusted the size of the images in these figures in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23) The Abstract should be improved. The authors should provide introductory sentences leading to a clear rationale before describing results.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion.
