To test this, we generated knock in mice carrying a mutation (<italic>Bmp7<sup>R-GFlag</sup></italic>) that prevents proteolytic activation of the dimerized BMP7 precursor protein. This mutation eliminates the function of BMP7 homodimers and all other BMPs that normally heterodimerize with BMP7. While <italic>Bmp7</italic> null homozygotes are live born, <italic>Bmp7<sup>R-GFlag</sup></italic> homozygotes are embryonic lethal and have broadly reduced BMP activity. Furthermore, compound heterozygotes carrying the <italic>Bmp7<sup>R-G</sup></italic> allele together with a null allele of <italic>Bmp2</italic> or <italic>Bmp4</italic> die during embryogenesis with defects in ventral body wall closure and/or the heart. Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirm that endogenous BMP4/7 heterodimers exist. Thus, BMP7 functions predominantly as a heterodimer with BMP2 or BMP4 during mammalian development, which may explain why mutations in either <italic>Bmp4</italic> or <italic>Bmp7</italic> lead to a similar spectrum of congenital defects in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BMP7</kwd><kwd>BMP4</kwd><kwd>BMP2</kwd><kwd>heterodimer</kwd><kwd>heart</kwd><kwd>embryogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1HD037976</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christian</surname><given-names>Jan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32DK007115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neugebauer</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HD007491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKnite</surname><given-names>Autumn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD067473</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christian</surname><given-names>Jan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endogenous BMP2/7 and BMP4/7 heterodimers form in vivo, and are the predominant functional ligand in many, if not all, tissues of developing mouse embryos.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are secreted molecules that were initially discovered as bone inducing factors and were subsequently shown to play numerous critical roles during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bragdon et al., 2011</xref>). Recombinant BMPs are used clinically to treat bone loss caused by trauma or disease, but their usefulness as osteoinductive agents is limited by a short half-life when implanted in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khan et al., 2012</xref>). Understanding how BMP dosage is regulated in vivo is important to prevent congenital birth defects, and to aid in the development of more effective therapeutics to promote bone healing.</p><p>BMPs are grouped into subfamilies based on sequence similarity, and can signal as either homodimers or as heterodimers. The class I BMPs, BMP2 and BMP4, can heterodimerize with class II BMPs, consisting of BMPs 5–8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo and Wu, 2012</xref>). Heterodimers composed of class I and class II BMPs show a higher specific activity than do homodimers. For example, homodimers of BMP2, −4, or-7 can all induce bone formation, but BMP2/7 or BMP4/7 heterodimers are significantly more potent than any homodimer in osteogenic differentiation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aono et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaito et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, BMP2/6 heterodimers show enhanced ability to activate downstream signaling in embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Valera et al., 2010</xref>). BMP2/7 and BMP4/7 heterodimers also show enhanced ability to induce ventral fate in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimatsu and Thomsen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmid et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>While it is widely accepted that recombinant class I/II BMP heterodimers have higher specific activity than homodimers, whether endogenous BMPs function primarily as homodimers or heterodimers in vivo remains controversial. Mutations in either <italic>Bmp2b</italic> or <italic>Bmp7</italic> lead to a complete loss of signaling in zebrafish embryos and this can be rescued by recombinant heterodimers, but not by either homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Little and Mullins, 2009</xref>). In addition, an ectopically expressed epitope-tagged form of BMP2b pulls down endogenous BMP7 and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Little and Mullins, 2009</xref>). Thus, BMP2/7 heterodimers are essential to establish the dorsoventral axis in fish. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> DPP (the fly homolog of BMP2/4) is not properly localized to the embryonic midline in the absence of SCREW (a BMP7 homolog) and this is proposed to be due to preferential transport of DPP/SCREW heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shimmi et al., 2005</xref>). However, expression of DPP and SCREW homodimers in distinct regions of the embryo can activate BMP signaling at levels equivalent to the heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nguyen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang and Ferguson, 2005</xref>), suggesting that homodimers are sufficient for development.</p><p>Evidence that class I/II BMP heterodimers exist or are required for mammalian development is lacking. <italic>Bmp4</italic> or <italic>Bmp2</italic> null homozygotes die during early development with defects in multiple tissues that correlate well with their respective expression domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Winnier et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang and Bradley, 1996</xref>). Among Class II BMPs, <italic>Bmp8</italic> is restricted to the developing testes and placenta while <italic>Bmp5, Bmp6</italic> and <italic>Bmp7</italic> are broadly expressed throughout embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao, 2003</xref>). Mice homozygous for null mutations in any single Class II <italic>Bmp</italic> gene survive embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">King et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dudley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Solloway et al., 1998</xref>). By contrast, <italic>Bmp5;Bmp7</italic> or <italic>Bmp6;Bmp7</italic> double mutants are embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Solloway and Robertson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2001</xref>), demonstrating functional redundancy. <italic>Bmp2/7</italic> and <italic>Bmp4/7</italic> double heterozygotes present with no abnormalities or minor skeletal abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katagiri et al., 1998</xref>), raising the possibility that heterodimers are not required for early mammalian development.</p><p>The choice of whether a given BMP will form a homodimer or a heterodimer is made within the biosynthetic pathway. All BMPs are generated as inactive precursor proteins that dimerize and fold within the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bragdon et al., 2011</xref>). The precursor protein is then cleaved by members of the proprotein convertase (PC) family to generate the active, disulfide bonded ligand along with two prodomain fragments. We have shown that BMP4 and BMP7 preferentially form heterodimers rather than either homodimer when ectopically coexpressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neugebauer et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Bmp4 and Bmp7</italic> show overlapping patterns of expression in many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Danesh et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that they may form heterodimers in some contexts. In humans, heterozygous mutations in either <italic>Bmp4</italic> or <italic>Bmp7</italic> are associated with a similar spectrum of ocular, brain and palate abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakrania et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wyatt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reis et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with the possibility that mutations in either gene lead to reduced BMP4/7 heterodimer activity.</p><p>BMPs carrying mutations in the PC cleavage motif form inactive dimers with wild type proteins. For example, cleavage mutant forms of BMP7 dominantly interfere with both BMP7 and BMP4 signaling when overexpressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hawley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimatsu and Thomsen, 1998</xref>). These studies demonstrate that BMPs can heterodimerize when overexpressed, but do not address whether endogenous BMPs heterodimerize. A mouse carrying a point mutation in the cleavage site of the type II BMP, BMP5, has more severe skeletal abnormalities than <italic>Bmp5</italic> homozygous null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ho et al., 2008</xref>), consistent with the possibility that it interferes with Class I heterodimeric partners, but this has not been explored.</p><p>In the current studies, we used genetic and biochemical analysis to test the hypothesis that endogenous heterodimers containing BMP7 exist in vivo. We show that endogenous heterodimers do form in vivo, and are the predominant functional ligand in many if not all tissues of developing mouse embryos. These findings have relevance to understanding the impact of mutations in <italic>Bmp4</italic> or <italic>Bmp7</italic> in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Bmp7<sup>R-GFlag</sup></italic> homozygotes show earlier lethality and more severe phenotypic defects than <italic>Bmp7</italic> null homozygotes</title><p>The phenotypes observed in mice mutant for class I and/or class II <italic>Bmps</italic> can be explained if BMPs function either as homodimers, or as heterodimers (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the hypothetical homodimer model (top), all BMP activity within a given cell type is generated by homodimers of class I (BMP2 or 4) and class II BMPs (BMP5, 6 or 7) that are broadly expressed in development. In the competing heterodimer model (bottom), all of the available class I molecules are covalently dimerized with a class II molecule, and these heterodimers generate the majority of BMP activity within a specific cell type. In addition, a small pool of ‘excess’ class II BMPs is hypothesized to form homodimers under wild type conditions, but is available to form heterodimers to compensate for loss of any single class II BMP. This hypothetical model is consistent with our finding that BMPs preferentially form heterodimers in some contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neugebauer et al., 2015</xref>), and with the genetic redundancy observed among class II BMPs.

An assumption of this model is that the BMP7R-GFlag precursor protein forms covalent heterodimers with class I BMP precursor proteins inside of cells in which they are co-expressed (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), thus sequestering heterodimers in non-functional complexes that are unable to activate their receptors. An alternate possibility is that BMP7R-GFlag precursor forms uncleavable homodimers that are secreted and form non-functional complexes with BMP receptors on the cell surface, thereby blocking the ability of class I BMP homodimers to activate their cognate receptors. To test this possibility, we expressed BMP7R-GFlag or BMP4 in HEK293T cells, and collected BMP7R-GFlag precursor protein or mature BMP4 that was secreted into the culture medium. Non-transfected HEK293T cells were then exposed to equivalent amounts of mature BMP4 alone, BMP7R-GFlag precursor alone, or both together for one hour prior to analyzing levels of pSmad1/5/8 by immunoblot (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Levels of pSmad1/5/8 were elevated to the same extent in cells incubated with BMP4 alone, or with BMP4 and BMP7R-GFlag together (compare lane 2 and 4).

When BMP4 and BM7R-GFlag were co-expressed, relatively equivalent amounts of cleaved, mature BMP4 were detected in Flag immunoprecipitates and in input samples, suggesting that most BMP4 was heterodimerized with BMP7R-GFlag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 6). Steady state levels of mature BMP4 protein were much higher in the media of cells cotransfected with BMP4 and BMP7R-GFlag DNA than in an equivalent volume of media from cells transfected with the same amount of BMP4 DNA alone (compare lanes 2 and 3). The finding that BMP4/BMP7R-GFlag heterodimers accumulate to much higher levels than do BMP4 homodimers is consistent with an inability of the heterodimer to bind to, and induce internalization and degradation of the ligand/receptor complex, a process that is critical for normal embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoyama et al., 2012</xref>). When untransfected HEK293T cells were exposed to media containing BMP4 homodimers, pSmad1 levels were increased 10-fold over basal levels (compare lanes 1 and 2). By contrast, exposure to the same volume of media from cells co-transfected with BMP4 and BMP7R-GFlag led to a 3.4-fold elevation of pSmad1 levels (compare lane 1 and 3), despite the fact that this media contains very high levels of cleaved BMP4 heterodimerized with BMP7R-GFlag. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the BMP4 precursor protein is cleaved and secreted when heterodimerized with the uncleavable BMP7R-GFlag precursor. However, this cleavage product is less able, or unable to bind and/or activate BMP receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Analysis of compound heterozygotes demonstrates that BMP2/7 and BMP4/7 heterodimers are functionally important during early development</title><p>To further test the idea that heterodimers of BMP7 together with BMP2 and/or BMP4 are essential for embryogenesis, and to ask which class I ligand(s) contribute to distinct developmental processes, we generated compound heterozygous mutants that carry one copy of the <italic>Bmp7<sup>R-GFlag</sup></italic> allele in combination with a null allele of <italic>Bmp2</italic> or <italic>Bmp4</italic>.

We have shown that the prodomain of BMP4 is both necessary and sufficient to generate heterodimeric BMP4/7 ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neugebauer et al., 2015</xref>), raising the possibility that the amino acid substitutions interfere with heterodimer formation.</p><p>The heart defects observed in <italic>Bmp7<sup>R-GFlag</sup></italic> homozygotes appear earlier (by E9.5) but otherwise phenocopy those in <italic>Bmp7<sup>R-GFlag/+</sup>;Bmp4<sup>-/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Bmp7<sup>R-GFlag/-</sup></italic> mutants. This suggests that BMP4/7 heterodimers play essential roles in early stages of heart development that cannot be compensated for by other BMP family members.

BMP7 homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones et al., 1994</xref>) and BMP4/7 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neugebauer et al., 2015</xref>) are secreted as a stable complex consisting of the cleaved mature ligand noncovalently associated with both propeptides. Structural studies have shown that homodimeric precursors of ActivinA and TGFß adopt a crossed-arm, domain-swapped configuration in which the amino-terminal part of the prodomain is in close contact with the ligand domain derived from the same precursor monomer but the bulk of the prodomain crosses over to interact with the mature domain derived from the second monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). If this structural paradigm holds for heterodimers as well, then the BMP7 prodomain interacts with the BMP4 mature domain. Previous studies have shown that the BMP7 prodomain remains non-covalently associated with mature BMP7 homodimers, and that Type II BMP receptors must displace the cleaved BMP7 prodomain to initiate signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sengle et al., 2008</xref>). Because the uncleaved BMP7R-GFlag prodomain cannot be displaced from the ligand by the Type II receptors, the heterodimeric ligand is most likely unable to assemble an active receptor complex.</p><p>BMP4 and BMP7 preferentially form heterodimers rather than either homodimer when the two molecules are co-expressed in the same cell in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neugebauer et al., 2015</xref>). The current results suggest that this is a common theme for class I and class II BMPs that are expressed in overlapping patterns. However, BMP2 and BMP7 form equivalent amounts of heterodimer and each homodimer when expressed in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Little and Mullins, 2009</xref>) suggesting that the relative abundance of heterodimers and homodimers may differ depending on tissue and organism. Thus, the functional importance of heterodimers versus homodimers is likely to vary widely among different tissues and developmental stages. Additional biochemical and phenotypic analysis will be required to sort out which ligands are used in which tissues. </p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus)</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>Bmp4-/+</italic></td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10049358">10049358</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:2664348">MGI:2664348</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Dr. Brigid Hogan (Duke University)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus)</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>BRE-LacZ</italic></td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15331632">15331632</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Dr. Christine Mummery (Leiden University)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus)</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>Bmp2-/+</italic></td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8898212">8898212</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:2658703">MGI:2658703</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Dr. Yuji Mishina (University of Michigan)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus)</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>Bmp7-/+</italic></td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9693150">9693150</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_EM:02513">IMSR_EM:02513</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Dr. Elizabeth Robertson (University of Oxford)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus)</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>Bmp7flox/flox</italic></td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22219353">22219353</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5312875">MGI:5312875</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Dr. James Martin (Baylor University)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus)</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>CMV-CRE</italic></td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8559668">8559668</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:006054">IMSR_JAX:006054</ext-link></td><td valign="top">University of Utah, Transgenic Mouse Facility</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus)</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>Bmp7R-GFlag</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Generated using gene targeting technology</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus)</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>Bmp7Flag</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Generated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (Synthesized)</td><td valign="top">CS2+BMP4</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15356272">15356272</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Catherine Degnin (Oregon Health and Science University)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (Synthesized)</td><td valign="top">CS2+BMP7R-GFlag</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">PCR used to insert Flag tag in cDNA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-pSmad1/5/8</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling</td><td valign="top">Cat. #9511S</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000), IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-Alexa Fluor 488</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat. #11008</td><td valign="top">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-BMP4</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz</td><td valign="top">Cat. #

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper addresses whether TGF-β/BMP fligands function predominantly as homodimers or heterodimers in the mouse. To this end, they generate mouse knockin for a mutation in BMP7 that prevents furin-dependent cleavage of the pro-domain from the mature domain during the secretion process, thus abolishing function of all BMP7 homodimers, plus any heterodimers that it forms. The authors convincingly show that BMP7 heterodimerizes with BMP2 and BMP4 and that these heterodimers are responsible for signaling in a wide variety of tissues. The data are of high quality and the paper will make an important contribution to the literature once appropriately revised in accordance with the reviewers' comments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors should work out better what the mechanism is by which the non-cleavable BMP is functioning and determine the class I and class II BMPs with which BMP7 is heterodimerizing. They also need to rule out a general dominant negative effect that goes beyond BMP7. In addition, comparing their results with other class I BMP null mutants will be informative. Finally, it is important to replace Figure 6 for the reasons described in the full reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The paper &quot;BMP7 functions predominantly as a heterodimer with BMP2 and BMP4 during mammalian embryogenesis&quot; is of high quality, with the experiments well thought out and the data strongly supporting the conclusions. The paper is also very well written and the figures are well designed (with exceptions below). The authors mention in the Discussion that the BMP7R-Gflag ligand causes defects in the roof plate patterning, and as BMP5 and BMP6 are not expressed in this tissue during this stage, BMP7 containing heterodimers must be the main ligand. However, the authors mention that Bmp7 null, Bmp5;6, and Bmp5;7 mutants all have normally patterned neural tubes. Thus, this suggests that BMP7R-Gflag is disrupting processes that do not necessarily require endogenous BMP7, or BMP7R-Gflag is inherently dominant negative. But I may be missing something here. Also, the authors imply that the class I ligand functions mainly as heterodimers with the class II ligands, but they make few direct comparisons between the phenotypes of the non-cleavable BMP7R-Gflag and the type I ligand mutants, which could provide additional evidence consistent with heterodimers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper addresses an important issue in the TGF-β/BMP field, which is whether these ligands function predominantly as homodimers, or as heterodimers. In fish, it is clear that BMP2 and BMP7 function as obligate heterodimers, at least at early stages of development, but this issue has not been rigorously addressed in mammals. The authors have addressed this issue in mouse, by generating a mouse knockin for a mutation in BMP7 that would prevent furin-dependent cleavage of the pro-domain from the mature domain during the secretion process. This mutation would be expected to abolish function of all BMP7 homodimers, plus any heterodimers that it forms. The authors show clearly that this mutant has a stronger phenotype than a BMP7 null. They rationalize this by assuming that in the case of the BMP7 null, other class II BMPs would be able to compensate as both homodimers and heterodimers, whilst in the case of the non-cleavable BMP7 mutant, it would essentially act as a dominant negative and bind BMP2 and BMP4, locking them into inactive complexes, as well as abolishing all function of BMP7.</p><p>I think the quality of the data is high and the mouse results are very clear. I think that the authors have convincingly shown that BMP7 heterodimerizes with BMP2 and BMP4 and that these heterodimers are responsible for signaling in a wide variety of tissues.</p><p>The only weakness of the paper is in understanding how the BMP7 R-G mutation is functioning. This is important, as it influences the interpretation of the data. One possible concern is that it could be having a dominant negative effect on furin activity per se, and thus affecting the cleavage of multiple ligands, beyond BMP7. The experiment that would apparently rule this out is the one in Figure 6, where they show that BMP4 is cleaved normally. However, the authors should provide proof that the band they detect, immunoprecipitating with the uncleaved BMP7 really is mature BMP4.</p><p>In addition, I think the authors need to nail down the mechanism whereby the uncleavable BMP7 is inhibiting function. This could be easily be done in a tissue culture system, with overexpressed ligands if necessary. I also think it is important to understand the entire range of BMPs that BMP7 is heterodimerizing with in vivo, as this affects the data interpretation. Is this exclusively class I, or can BMP7 also dimerize with other class II BMPs? This should be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses the important question of the extent to which different members of the BMP family form heterodimers with each other in vivo and whether such heterodimeric forms deliver unique functions or are potentially more potent in particular biological contexts than homodimeric BMPs. This manuscript nicely demonstrates that heterodimeric BMPs are indeed generated in vivo in developing mouse embryos. Because of the general importance of the question, I am overall supportive of publication of the manuscript. However, the current paper has several issues that need to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>1) Figure 6B should be replaced with a better figure. Why is the middle portion of the control western blot using anti-Flag antibody missing? Why are there three heavy and light chain bands in panel B? There should be only two bands. What are the additional non-specific bands marked by asterisks? Also, panels A and B need to be referred to in the figure legend.</p><p>2) Because the result in Figure 5 indicates that BMP7 and BMP2 form heterodimers, it would be useful to also show evidence of BMP7/BMP2 heterodimers in developing embryos by western blot, as was done in Figure 6 for BMP4/BMP7 heterodimers. Is there a reason why this cannot be easily accomplished?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48872.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper &quot;BMP7 functions predominantly as a heterodimer with BMP2 and BMP4 during mammalian embryogenesis&quot; is of high quality, with the experiments well thought out and the data strongly supporting the conclusions.

We tested two different commercially available BMP5 antibodies and two different BMP6 antibodies on whole embryo lysates collected at different stages and dissected organs from E13.5 embryos. We used HEK cells transfected with BMP5 or BMP6 as a positive control. While the antibodies could (in some cases) detect ectopically expressed protein, they did not detect endogenous precursor or ligand bands for BMP5 or BMP6 on immunoblots of embryo lysates or BMP7Flag immunoprecipitates. Because we cannot demonstrate that these antibodies recognize endogenous proteins, we do not want to claim that there is no interaction. We note this attempt in the Results (subsection “Biochemical analysis reveals the existence of BMP4/BMP7 heterodimers in early embryos”, last paragraph) and our inability to rule out heterodimerization between class II BMPs is described in the Discussion (Discussion, seventh paragraph.

The middle portion of the blot is deleted because it requires a very long exposure to detect cleaved mature BMP7Flag and the longer exposure blows out the signal for the precursor band. Thus, the two panels represent two different exposures of the same blot. We now indicate this in the Results (subsection “Biochemical analysis reveals the existence of BMP4/BMP7 heterodimers in early embryos”) and in the figure legend and have added a new supplementary figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 5) that includes the short and long exposure of the blot. The bands indicated by asterisks in the BMP4 input blot are non-specific background bands that are detected by this antibody in embryo lysates. Whereas the signal for the precursor band and ligand bands show reduced intensity in lysates from BMP4 null heterozygotes, the “non-specific” bands do not.

Commercially available BMP2 antibodies do not reproducibly recognize endogenous BMP2, based on comparison of signal in lysates from wild type and BMP2 null embryos. Although we have seen what appears to be mature BMP2 immunoprecipitating with BMP7 Flag on a few occasions, this result was not reproducible in all experiments, and/or we could not detect endogenous BMP2 in lysates in the same experiment.
