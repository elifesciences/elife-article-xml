However the spatial aspects of transcription have dominated the study of developmental gene expression, with the role of temporal processes in shaping patterns receiving comparably little attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bothma and Levine, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Gene expression patterns are dynamic on many levels. They form, change and disappear over time, often as cells, tissues, and organs are forming and moving in the developing embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lawrence, 1992</xref>). Furthermore the transcriptional process that creates these patterns is itself highly dynamic. The classical view of transcription as a switch or a tunable rheostat has been replaced in recent years by the recognition that mRNA synthesis occurs in bursts, with promoters switching stochastically between an ON state where polymerases are loaded and begin elongating, and an OFF state where few or no new transcripts are initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Golding et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blake et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janicki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chubb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yunger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raj et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lionnet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Muramoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Little et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lenstra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fukaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desponds et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hendy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammers et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Visualizing live transcription from the seven stripes of <italic>D. melanogaster even-skipped</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simple model of transcriptional bursting by promoter switching between ON and OFF states.

Changing the duration or bursts, the separation between bursts, or the rate at which polymerases are loaded during a burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) will affect mRNA production, and modulating any or all of these parameters over space and time could, in principle, produce arbitrarily complex output patterns. However, it remains unclear how diverse the kinetic strategies employed by different regulatory sequences actually are, and what, if anything, constrains how these different kinetic parameters are used by evolution to shape patterns of expression.</p><p>In this paper, we set out to compare the ways in which different enhancers that drive similar types of spatiotemporal patterns during animal development deploy transcriptional bursting to produce their outputs by examining transcription at the single-cell level in living embryos.

These enhancers respond in different ways to canonical maternal factors Bicoid (Bcd) and Caudal (Cad), and gap genes Hunchback (Hb), Giant (Gt), Krüppel (Kr), Knirps (Kni) and Sloppy Paired 1 (Slp1), among others, balancing activating and repressive inputs to generate novel output patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mannervik, 2014</xref>). For example, the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 enhancer is activated in the anterior by Bcd and Hb, and repressed by Gt and Kr, ultimately expressing in a stripe of nuclei that fall between the domains occupied by these two repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frasch and Levine, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Small et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Transcriptional bursting is widespread during <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Little et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bothma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fukaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boettiger and Levine, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holloway and Spirov, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zoller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Paré et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammers et al., 2020</xref>).

They showed that the stripe is generated by bursts of transcriptional activity in the nuclei that form it, and that the aggregate pattern is highly dynamic, forming and dissipating rapidly during nc14.</p><p>Our objective in carrying out this work was twofold: first, to characterize the detailed dynamics of this classical and well-studied pattern as a means to reveal how multiple enhancers dictate potentially distinct bursting dynamics to shape a gene expression in the embryo, and second, to establish a rigorous systematic framework for analyzing such data, and conceptual paradigms for characterizing what we observe from this new type of experiment. Indeed, the advent of live imaging in the context of development calls for the establishment of a new language and new metrics for characterizing the formation of gene expression patterns in space and time.</p><p>We use a variety of new analyses to generate a kinetic fingerprint of <italic>eve</italic> transcription during stripe formation - a record of temporal and spatial variation in the bursting state of the promoters of ~3000 nuclei covering all seven stripes throughout nc14 - and to visualize different aspects of <italic>eve</italic> regulation. We find that all seven <italic>eve</italic> stripes are sculpted by the same regulatory strategies: the elimination of new bursts between stripes; the enhancement of bursting across stripes through a coupled increase in <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> and <italic>r</italic>; and the refinement and movement of stripe positions by the addition of bursting nuclei along the anterior edge of the stripes and the loss of bursting along their posterior edge.</p><p>Thus, in this experiment and with our new set of analytical tools, we capture not only how single cell transcriptional activity encodes the formation of the stripes, but also how this activity is modulated in space and time in order to create and displace a complex pattern of gene activity across the embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Live imaging of <italic>eve</italic> expression</title><p>We used recombineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Warming et al., 2005</xref>) to modify a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Venken et al., 2006</xref>) containing the <italic>D. melanogaster eve</italic> gene and all of its enhancers and regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Venken et al., 2009</xref>), replacing the coding region with an array of MS2 stem loops followed by the <italic>D. melanogaster yellow</italic> (<italic>y</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bothma et al., 2014</xref>).

The initial transcription covers a broad swath of the embryo, from around 25 to 75% egg-length, with the highest activity in two domains roughly centered in the anterior and posterior halves of the embryo, respectively.

Stripe 5 appears as a distinct stripe last, emerging in an area of low transcriptional activity left behind following the splitting of stripes 4 and 6.

Stripe 7 makes a more dramatic movement towards the anterior, moving approximately 8% of egg-length, or around 40 μm from its initial location. The quantitative characterization of this stripe movement, the decoupling between stripes and nuclei, and the quantification of transcriptional bursting dynamics in each nucleus necessitated the development of a method, described below, to dynamically define the position of stripes throughout each movie.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Modeling and inference of promoter state</title><p>As expected, the fluorescence traces from individual nuclei show clear hallmarks of transcriptional bursting, with apparent stochastic fluctuations between states with low and high fluorescence output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Building off of the method presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammers et al., 2020</xref>, we estimated this polymerase transit time as the displacement that gives the minimum value in the autocorrelation of the single frame differences in the fluorescent signal (see Materials and methods). The rationale for this approach was that every increase in signal due to polymerase loading at time <italic>t</italic> should be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in signal at time <italic>t+t<sub>elong</sub></italic> due to the completion of a transcriptional elongation cycle with a delay equal to the elongation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coulon and Larson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desponds et al., 2016</xref>). We arrived at an estimate of 140 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), consistent with a direct measurement of the rate of polymerase elongation of ~2700 bp/min from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukaya et al., 2017</xref> and the length of the construct (6,563 bp).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Modeling bursting in individual nuclei.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A key parameter in relating fluorescence output to the bursting state of a promoter is the time it takes for a polymerase to transit the gene, which we determined as approximately 140 s by examining the autocorrelation (red line) of the change in fluorescence.

(<bold>B</bold>) Three state model accounting for post-replication presence of sister chromatids. When either promoter is ON for a short time period ∆t, it loads polymerases at a constant rate contributing a pulse of polymerase that persists for 140 s.

Under our model, in each time window a promoter is either OFF and not loading polymerases, or ON and loading polymerases at a fixed rate. A promoter that is in the ON state loads <italic>Δt</italic> x <italic>r</italic> polymerases, producing a single pulse of fluorescence proportional to <italic>Δt</italic> x <italic>r</italic> (with the proportionality factor determined by the fluorescence of GFP and the fraction of MS2 loops bound by MCP-GFP). This pulse lasts at the locus for 140 s, at which point all polymerase molecules loaded during the original time window have terminated transcribing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Since we do not calibrate the fluorescence signal to the number of polymerase molecules for this construct, in practice we fold the proportionality factor into <italic>r</italic> altering its units from polymerases loaded per unit time to fluorescence signal produced per unit time. Since many transcriptional bursts last for longer than 20 s, the fluorescence output of a single burst is a sum of the pulses generated during each time window.</p><p>In the embryos we imaged here, the MS2 BAC is heterozygous, contributed only by the father, while the mother contributes the MCP-GFP. However, DNA replication occurs within an average of 10 min for loci in nc14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McKnight and Miller, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rabinowitz, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shermoen et al., 2010</xref>), meaning that there are actually two sister chromatids with the MS2-containing transgene in every nucleus. Because of sister chromatid cohesion, we cannot, in general, discriminate both copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fung et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilkie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Little et al., 2013</xref>). Thus we model the locus as having two promoters, which implies that the system can be in one of three distinct states: OFF, one promoter ON, and two promoters ON. For ease of exposition, however, we will frame our discussion in terms of an effective 2-state model in which the locus is ON so long as <italic>at least </italic>one promoter is in the ON state. As it is still unclear how the sister chromatids influence each other’s transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McKnight and Miller, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zoller et al., 2018</xref>), we make no prior assumptions about the nature or degree of correlations between sister chromatids (though, for illustration purposes, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> we entertain the case where sister chromatids transcribe independently).</p><p>As Illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> for the case of independent sister chromatids, if we know the state of the promoter over time, we can reconstruct its expected fluorescence output by summing 140 s pulses beginning at each point where the promoter is ON and having height <italic>r</italic> if one promoter is ON or height <italic>2</italic> x <italic>r</italic> if two promoters are ON. Traces modeled from hypothetical promoter state sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) have the features of the observed fluorescence signal: linear increases in intensity (corresponding to periods when the promoter is ON); plateaus (corresponding to periods when transcriptional initiation is matched with previously initiated polymerases completing their transit of the gene); and linear signal decays (corresponding to periods when the promoter is OFF but previously initiated polymerases are still transiting the gene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bothma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, when given a fluorescence trace, it is not trivial to infer the promoter state sequence that generated it, owing to the time convolution between promoter state and fluorescence output. To solve this problem, we developed a compound-state hidden Markov Model (cpHMM, described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammers et al., 2020</xref>) that estimates global parameters <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic>, <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>, and <italic>r</italic> for a set of traces, and allows us to identify the maximum-likelihood promoter state sequence under these parameters for every trace via the Viterbi algorithm.</p><p>The cpHMM thus accomplishes two aims central to treating these data in a more rigorous and biologically meaningful manner.

Across all seven stripes, the model infers approximate <italic>k<sub>on</sub> k<sub>off</sub></italic> values of 0.60 events per minute and an <italic>r</italic> of 67 AU per minute. And second, by providing a means to fit a sequence of ON and OFF states to the data from each nucleus, the cpHMM allows us to shift the focus in the analysis of individual traces from fluorescence, which only indirectly reflects the temporal behavior of a promoter, to the instantaneous promoter state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> which the inferred promoter state for each nucleus at every time point and the corresponding modeled fluorescence intensity, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video13">Videos 13</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Dynamic determination of stripe positions</title><p>Before analyzing the data further we had to solve two practical problems.

In order to reveal the source of this reduced number of never-ON nuclei in posterior interstripes, we analyzed their bursting history. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> shows the AP positions of the nuclei in one movie covering stripe seven as a function of time, with the period in which they are part of the stripe highlighted. Although the stripe is clearly present throughout this period, no nuclei remain a part of the stripe for the entirety of this 25 min period. As time progresses, nuclei at the posterior edge of stripe seven shift from an active state, in which the promoter stochastically alternates between the ON and OFF transcriptional states, to a quiescent state in which we observe no appreciable bursting. In contrast, nuclei just off the anterior edge of the stripe switch from a quiescent to an active state at roughly the same rate. This leads to a net overall anterior movement of the stripe, akin to treadmilling, at a velocity of approximately one percent of embryo length every three minutes.</p><p>Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lim et al., 2018</xref>, the other stripes exhibit smaller and varied anterior shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), but in every case the shift is associated with a similar coupled gain of active nuclei along the anterior edge and loss along the posterior edge. This effect is most clearly seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, which shows, for each time point where a nucleus initiates a new burst, the difference in activity (defined as the difference between the fraction of the time the nucleus is in the ON state in the subsequent 10 min minus the fraction of the time the nucleus is in the ON state in the preceding 10 min). For all seven stripes there is a clear spatial pattern, with nuclei along the anterior edge of the stripe entering a bursting state and nuclei along the posterior edge becoming quiescent, indicating a movement of stripes relative to nuclei. Hence, stripe movement is associated with the dynamic switching of nuclei between active and quiescent states, and not just with the movement of nuclei themselves.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>All seven <italic>eve</italic> stripes are created by the same regulation of bursting kinetics</title><p>We next turned to the questions of how the spatial pattern of nuclear transcriptional activity described above is produced by regulating bursting kinetics, and whether this regulation differs among the seven <italic>eve</italic> stripes. In principle, any pattern of transcriptional activity could be achieved by modulating the duration, separation and/or amplitude of bursts across space and time. For example, a stripe could be created by varying burst separation along the anterior-posterior axis, with nuclei in the stripe center having lower burst separation, and those outside the stripe having long periods without bursts, or no bursts at all. Alternatively, the same stripe could be created with uniform burst separation across nuclei, but elevated burst duration or amplitude within the stripe, or by modulating multiple parameters simultaneously.</p><p>Ideally, we would like to have a measure of the bursting parameters governing the behavior of every nucleus.

We have now shown that the connection between the stripe enhancers is more than just that they produce the same kind of pattern: they realize these patterns through the same control of transcriptional bursting.</p><p>Although, in principle, complex patterns of transcription could be generated by the independent regulation of <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic>, <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> or <italic>r</italic>, many of the key features of <italic>eve</italic> stripe regulation we observe here involve the modulation of <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> and <italic>r</italic> in concert. The most straightforward explanation for this shared mode of bursting control is that there is a single molecular pathway via which <italic>eve</italic> transcriptional bursting is regulated, with enhancers essentially having access to only a single tunable parameter. Whether this parameter is determined by the gene through, for example, the promoter sequence, or whether this single molecular pathway reflects some broad common property of gene regulation, such as constraints on the general transcriptional machinery, remains an open question. The limited data on bursting control available for other genes in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Falo-Sanjuan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fukaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zoller et al., 2018</xref>) suggests that control mechanisms are not ubiquitously the same and that they might be unique to different classes of genes.</p><p>An alternative explanation for the observed commonalities in the control of bursting is that there is a functional reason to use this strategy. Namely, that this is not the result of a common molecular mechanism, but rather of common selective pressures acting on the five enhancers independently. The particular bursting control strategy uncovered here might, for example, be more robust to fluctuations in transcription factor concentrations or temperature, or provide more precise spatiotemporal gene expression control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shelansky and Boeger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grah et al., 2020</xref>). New experiments and theoretical work will be necessary in order to uncover the specific molecular pathways by which bursting is controlled and to understand the functional consequences of different bursting strategies that create the same mRNA levels.</p><p>In addition to this modulation of bursting, the fraction of nuclei that engage in transcription at any point in the nuclear cycle is higher in stripe centers than in interstripes. This regulation of the fraction of active nuclei, also seen in other genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>), seems to reside outside of the bursting framework. Such regulation, as well as the spatial modulation of the window of time over which bursting ensues, suggests the presence of multiple and overlapping modes of regulation that go beyond the control of bursting parameters and that can be as relevant for pattern formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammers et al., 2020</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Stripe movement is driven primarily by expression flow</title><p>Just as gene expression patterns are dynamic in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bothma et al., 2014</xref>), they are dynamic in space, resulting in the movement of expression domains throughout the embryo during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jaeger et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keränen et al., 2006</xref>).

While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keränen et al., 2006</xref> concluded that the relative contributions of these two forces were roughly equal, our data suggest that, especially in the posterior, expression flow dominates the anterior shift of the <italic>eve</italic> stripes.</p><p>A typical nucleus in stripe seven moves around one percent of embryo length in the final 25 min of nc14. The stripe, however, moves around five percent of embryo length during that time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Because we are tracking both the position and activity of individual nuclei, we can visualize expression flow in action. We see nuclei transition from low activity in the anterior interstripe to high activity in the stripe, from high activity in the stripe to low activity off the posterior flank of <italic>eve</italic> expression, and in some cases both.</p><p>This effect is most pronounced for the posterior stripes, but is observed for the more anterior stripes as well, although the magnitude of the shift decreases for more anterior stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The difference in the amount of the effect we and Keränen et al. attribute to expression flow is likely an effect of differences in the data used.

Our choice of reporter construct structure strikes a balance between these two limitations and is ideally suited for inferring bursting parameters in the time range where <italic>eve</italic> resides, as well as for boosting the signal-to-noise ratio. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammers et al., 2020</xref> for a more detailed discussion of reporter length-related tradeoffs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Specifics of recombineering</title><p>We modified a CHORI BAC CH322-103K22 derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Venken et al., 2009</xref>, which contained the entire <italic>eve</italic> locus and a GFP reporter instead of the <italic>eve</italic> coding sequence (CH322-103K22-GFP). We replaced the GFP reporter with MS2::<italic>yellow</italic> (total insert size, 6665 bp) through a two step, scarless, <italic>galK</italic> cassette-mediated bacterial recombineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Warming et al., 2005</xref>). Briefly, we transformed our starting CH322-103K22-GFP BAC into <italic>E. coli</italic> recombineering strain SW102. We then electroporated the strain with a <italic>galK</italic> cassette flanked by 50bp-long DNA homology arms homologous to the MS2::<italic>yellow</italic> (6665 bp) reporter. Upon electroporation, we selected transformants on M63 minimal media plates with galactose as a single carbon source. We achieved a correct replacement of GFP sequence by <italic>galK</italic> cassette in the BAC context (CH322-103K22-galK), validated by observing the digestion patterns produced by ApaLI restriction enzyme.</p><p>We next purified the CH322-103K22-galK BAC and transformed it into fresh <italic>E. coli</italic> SW102 cells. We electroporated these cells with the purified MS2::<italic>yellow</italic> insert and used M63 minimal media plates with 2-deoxy-galactose to select against bacteria with a functional <italic>galK</italic> gene. We used colony PCR to screen for colonies with a correct MS2::<italic>yellow</italic> insertion (CH322-103K22-MS2) replacing the <italic>galK</italic> cassette. We validated this insertion by observing ApaLI, XhoI, SmaI, and EcoRI restriction digestion patterns and through PCR and Sanger sequencing of the insertion junctions. We transformed our CH322-103K22-MS2 BAC in <italic>E.coli</italic> EPI300 cells to induce high copy numbers and purified it with a Qiagen plasmid Midiprep kit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Generation of fly lines</title><p>We sent a sample of our purified CH322-103K22-MS2 BAC to Rainbow Transgenic Flies, Inc for injection in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos bearing a ΦC31 AttP insertion site in chromosome 3L (Bloomington stock #24871; landing site VK00033; cytological location 65B2). We received the flies that resulted from that injection and used a balancer fly line (w-; +; +/TM3sb) to obtain a viable MS2 homozygous line (w-; +; MS2::<italic>yellow</italic>). We used line (yw; His::RFP; MCP::GFP) as the maternal source of Histone-RFP and MCP-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Embryo collection and mounting</title><p>Embryo collection and mounting was done as specified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garcia and Gregor, 2018</xref>. In short, we set fly crosses between ~30 males (w-; +; eve::MS2::yellow) and ~80 females (yw; His::RFP; MCP::GFP) in a plastic cage capped with a grape juice agar plate. We collected embryos from cages two to ten days old by adding a fresh plate for 30 min and aging for 60 min to target embryos 90 min or younger.</p><p>Embryos were mounted on a gas-permeable Lumox Film (Sarstedt - Catalog # 94.6077.317) embedded on a microscope slide hollowed on the center. Then, we coated the hydrophobic side of the Lumox film with heptane glue and let it dry. The film allows for the oxygenation of embryos during the 2–3 hr long imaging sessions while heptane immobilizes them.</p><p>We soaked an agar plate with Halocarbon 27 oil, picked embryos with forceps, and laid them down on a 3 × 3 cm piece of paper tissue. We dechorionated embryos by adding 2 drops of bleach diluted in water (5.25%) on the paper tissue and incubating for 1.5 min. We removed bleach with a clean tissue and rinsed with ~4 drops of distilled water. We then placed the tissue paper with dechorionated embryos in water, and picked buoyant embryos with a brush.</p><p>We lined ~ 30 apparently healthy embryos on the Lumox film slide and added 2–3 drops of Halocarbon 27 oil to avoid desiccation, and covered the embryos with a cover slip (Corning Cover Glass, No. 1, 18 × 18 mm) for live imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Imaging and optimization of data collection</title><p>Movies of embryonic development were recorded on a Zeiss-800 confocal laser-scanning microscope in two channels, (EGFP: 488 nm; TagRFP: 561 nm). We imaged embryos on a wide field of view, along their anterior-posterior axis, of 1024 × 256 pixels (202.8 x 50.7 µm), encompassing 3–5 stripes per movie. We tuned laser power, scanning parameters, master gain, pinhole size and laser power to optimize signal-to-noise ratio without significant photobleaching and phototoxicity.</p><p>For imaging, the following microscope settings were used: 63x oil-objective, scan mode ‘frame’, pixel size of 0.2 µm, 16 bits per pixel, bidirectional scanning at a speed of 7, line step of 1, laser scanner dwelling per pixel of 1.03 µs, laser scanner averaging of 2, averaging method Mean, averaging mode Line, 488 nm laser power of 30 µW (EGFP), 561 nm laser power of 7.5µW (TagRFP) (both powers were measured with a 10x air-objective), Master Gain in EGFP detector of 550V, Master Gain in TagRFP detector of 650V, Digital Offset in both detectors of 0, Digital Gain in both detectors of 1.0, and a pinhole size of 1 airy unit under the imaging conditions mentioned above (44, 0.7 µm/section), laser filters EGFP:SP545 and TagRFP:LBF640. This resulted in an imaging time of 633 ms per frame and a full Z-stack of 21 frames in intervals of 0.5 µm every 16.8 s. Following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bothma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bothma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bothma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammers et al., 2020</xref>), the imaging conditions were determined not to affect normal development as reported by the timing of the nuclear cycles in early development. We stopped imaging after 50 min into nuclear cycle 14, and took mid-sagittal and surface pictures of the whole embryo for localization of the recorded field of view along the embryo’s AP axis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image processing</title><p>We used a Matlab computational pipeline based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammers et al., 2020</xref> to segment and extract numeric data from our raw movies. Briefly, this software segments and processes the images from the two channels (channel 1: MCP::GFP, channel 2: Histone::RFP) on which we collected our data. For segmentation of channel 1, we used Fiji-Weka Segmentation 3D software; this machine-learning-based method relies on the manual segmentation of a variety of MCP::GFP labeled transcriptional foci in a given 21 frame Z-stack from a single dataset (EVE_D11) to produce a model for the segmentation of all datasets recorded under the same imaging conditions. Next, we segmented and tracked the Histone::RFP-labeled nuclei on channel 2. Subsequently, we assigned MCP::GFP labeled transcriptional foci to their corresponding Histone::RFP-labeled nuclei. Since we collected whole embryo pictures of each of our datasets, we were able to match and locate the recorded fields of view to their right position along the body of their corresponding embryos. Finally, we extracted position and fluorescence values over time of all transcriptional foci to generate data structures ready to use in further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Estimation of polymerase transit time</title><p>To estimate the transit time of the polymerase along the construct (which is used to determine the persistence of the fluorescence signal from a single transcript at the locus) we first calculated, for each nucleus, the difference in fluorescence signal between adjacent timepoints D<sub>n,t</sub> = F<sub>n,t+1</sub> - F<sub>n,t</sub> where F<sub>n,t</sub> is the fluorescence signal for nucleus <italic>n</italic> at time point <italic>t</italic> and then calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient of the vectors [..., D<sub>n,t</sub>, D<sub>n,t+1</sub>, D<sub>n,t+2</sub>,. ..] and [..., D<sub>n,t+d</sub>, D<sub>n</sub>,<sub>t+d+1</sub>, D<sub>n,t+d+2</sub>,. ..] over values of d from 1 to 20 representing time displacements of 20 to 400 s. The minimum correlation occurred at 140 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Compound-state hidden Markov Model</title><p>For this work we employed a statistical method that utilizes a compound-state hidden Markov Model to infer bursting parameters from experimental fluorescence traces. The theory and implementation of this method are described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammers et al., 2020</xref>. Briefly, parameters were inferred using a standard version of the Expectation Maximization Algorithm implemented using custom-written scripts in Matlab. Our inference is carried over the full duration of activity of each active nucleus during nuclear cycle 14. Bootstrap sampling was used to estimate the standard error in our parameter estimates. Subsets of 3000 data points were used to generate time-averaged parameter estimates. Inference was not conducted for groups for which fewer than 1000 time points were available.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis and figures</title><p>All data were analyzed in Python using a Jupyter notebook with custom code to process raw data and generate figures.

This left 430,073 observations from 2959 nuclei.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Stripe assignment and registration</title><p>We used the Gaussian mixture model module of the Python library scikit-learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>) to cluster all nuclei time points in each movie in each of a series of overlapping 428 s time windows beginning at 25 min in nc14, specifying the number of components equal to the number of stripes captured in the movie and using the setting <italic>covariance_type='tied'.</italic> We preliminarily assigned nuclei time points to a stripe if they were consistently clustered in that stripe in the relevant time windows. We then pooled all nuclei time points assigned to the same stripe and fit a line to the median x and y positions in the bottom (y &lt; 128) and top (y &gt; 128) halves of the image. We considered the slope of this line to represent the orientation of the stripe to the image x-axis. We then went back to each time window and fit the nuclei assigned to the stripe with a line with the previously computed slope fixed. This produced an association of time with stripe position, from which we derived a linear model that describes the position of each stripe in each movie at every time point.</p><p>We assigned all nuclei time points (not just bursting ones) to stripes by identifying the stripe whose predicted position at the relevant time was closest (along the x-axis) to the nucleus being analyzed, and assigned a nucleus to the most common stripe assignment for its individual time points. We then corrected the reorientation of the stripe at each time point to be perpendicular to the image x-axis (to enable projection along the AP axis) by setting its new image x-axis position to be the x position of the stripe in the middle of the y-axis (y = 128) plus the offset of the nucleus to the unoriented stripe along the x-axis. Finally, we used the positions of the anterior and posterior poles of the embryo to map image x coordinates to AP position. We then adjusted the AP position of each stripe in each movie such that the center of the stripe at 35 min in nc14 had the same AP position.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by an HHMI Investigator award to MBE.

stripe formation.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Kinetic sculpting of the seven stripes of the <italic>Drosophila even-skipped</italic> gene&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers felt the work has merit but have some concerns that are expressed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>You will need to address the question about whether the reporter genes disrupt or recapitulate the endogenous genes. It seems some experimentation might be done here to resolve this-perhaps a FISH experiment. Ideally the endogenous gene could be tagged. Data may exist for this point that is not in the manuscript.</p><p>The second reviewer has issues with the analysis at several points. These need to be addressed.</p><p>The third reviewer has points that need to be addressed that mainly involve further clarifications in the text and focusing the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a companion manuscript to Lammers, et al. It increases the number of stripes analysed for the even skipped gene, assessed using the method of modeling using a modified HMM analysis to provide a memory of the transcriptional bursting, and to include the duration of this bursting in defining the sharp boundaries of the stripes. The technical advance in this work is to insert the entire even skipped set of enhancers and regulatory elements on a BAC so that the ontogeny of all seven stripes can be observed at high time resolution (20 second intervals).</p><p>This is an elegant piece of work, although with some of the same caveats that are relevant for the Lammers manuscript. One concern is whether the embryos would develop past gastrulation, given the light dosage (Sedat has made a big point about this). It would be useful to know this, although it may not influence conclusions about the early events. As with the Lammers manuscript, the observations are by their nature descriptive, but provide a basis for evaluations of various mechanisms; these are spelled out well in the Discussion, with appropriate cautionary caveats. One of the more interesting observations is that the stripes seem to be similarly regulated in kinetics and duration of the transcription despite the variety of factors regulating them. This commonality of mechanism requires some new thinking about the role of these various elements.</p><p>Some quibbles about the writing style: the concept of a &quot;transcriptional desert&quot; seems a bit melodramatic (as does the repetitive &quot;stripe is a stripe...&quot; line) and obscures the mechanistic implications. Presumably the &quot;desert&quot; is just the closing of the transcriptional window, as described more precisely in the accompanying manuscript. To further impinge on the author's expository flair here, the concept of &quot;sculpting&quot; is too anthropomorphic, as one needs a sculptor to sculpt and this is conceptually confusing since these events are stochastically driven. Is the sculptor a facilitator of &quot;intelligent design&quot;? Do you want to go there?</p><p>Some of my concerns about the Lammers manuscript can be reiterated briefly. The inserted <italic>eve</italic> reporter system is now sucking up factors and presumably competing with the endogenous gene possibly causing a &quot;transcriptional haploinsufficiency&quot; (my own terminological flair in this case) wherein the effective local concentrations are now half what they should be, and this may have the effect of changing the bursting and duration kinetics. Furthermore, the local environment of the endogenous gene may contain more regulatory chromatin not dreamt of in your philosophy, that would rule the expression of <italic>eve</italic> with a firmer hand (using the anthropomorphizing theme). Hence the assertion that the inserted gene &quot;is phenotypically neutral&quot; seems glib and may not be technically correct, at least until tested. Assuming that the function of <italic>eve</italic> is not compromised by some of the modifications used for the reporter gene, why not tag the endogenous gene? (I may be unaware of literature that relates to this experiment, but I don't think that complementation in a mutant strain reproduces the robustness of the endogenous gene).</p><p>All told, I feel that these considerations could be dealt with in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this work by Berrocal et al., the authors provide a quantitative treatment of the enduring developmental problem of how the combinatorial inputs into an enhancer drive spatial patterns in the blastoderm. Work in recent years indicates these developmental genes are also stochastic and exhibit bursting transcription, making the emergence of these ordered patterns even more difficult to explain. This manuscript is decidedly observational yet also highly quantitative. No molecular mechanisms are elucidated, but the underlying spatiotemporal transcription phenomena are characterized with experimental rigor. The authors seem to believe they have uncovered some universal behaviors but they stop short of making any strong claims, making it hard for this reviewer to come away with a digestible conclusion. Overall, I found the paper to be scholarly and well-written. I think it could be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> with some revisions.</p><p>1) I found the paper to be somewhat off balance in the presentation. Some of the concepts and data analyses are covered in a cursory manner, even for specialists, but the Discussion goes on at length. For example, I am confused by Figure 4A. Why does the autocorrelation go negative? What does the autocorrelation of the first derivative even mean? Is this experimental data?</p><p>2) There is a tremendous amount of live-cell data, and I appreciate the scale of that analysis effort. The two major inference problems in this data analysis are the following: 1) promoter activity must be inferred through direct analysis of the transcription time traces, and 2) burst kinetics have to be assigned to a particular stripe. I would like to see some straightforward analysis or metric of how good these inferences are. Error bars or confidence analysis is noticeably absent throughout the manuscript.</p><p>3) Related to this second inference, I found the exceptional behavior of the 5 – 6 interstripe to be important. Is this looser regulation also observed by smFISH? Such an analysis would also indicate how well the stripe assignment works in live blastoderms. Is there any biological functionality to the 5-6 interstripe bursting?</p><p>4) In Figure 8, is there some sort of reduced parameterization which captures the essential behavior, rather than an empirical tabulation of on and off rates? The results in Figure 10 argue for such a reduced parameterization, and the comparison is made to the Zoller paper in the Discussion, but I don't see where they actually test a reduced model for fitting the data.</p><p>5) Related to this last point, when I look at Figure 8 , I see a lot of variability at the low ON rates. This variability could result in an apparent trend which is artefactual. At some point, there is a noise floor where the mHMM might be picking up single infrequent bursts that could therefore be spurious. I find the treatment of this key point unsatisfactory, both because there is not an in depth statistical analysis, and also because the authors use sentences such as &quot;To investigate whether this result is an artifact of the mHMM, we implemented an orthogonal method that uses integer programming to infer promoter states from traces based on a direct fit of 140s fluorescence pulses.&quot; This one-sentence description is obtuse, even for specialists. I think there needs to be greater effort here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this work, Berrocal and Lammers et al. propose a conceptual, theoretical and computational framework for dissecting gap genes pattern formation in space and time in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. The framework is showcased in the analysis of the dynamics of the even-skipped gene, monitored at the single-cell and high temporal resolution.</p><p>This is an ambitious and much-needed work targeting the transcription dynamics in mid and late nuclear cycle 14. Here, the MS2-GFP system is employed to simultaneously monitor the transcription dynamics of the even-skipped gene in seven stripes, each controlled by the independent activity of a specific enhancer: whereas stripe 1, 2 and 5 are each controlled by a different enhancer, stripes 3 and 7 and stripes 4 and 6 are controlled by a common enhancer. This provides the basis for the analysis of the transcription kinetics, as demonstrated here with the memory-adjusted Hidden Markov Model. In this last long nuclear cycle before gastrulation, the transcription factor gradients are transient. Thus, traditional analyses are hindered due to the movement of both the nuclei and transcription factors distributions. From the videos, the paper presents a protocol to classify and track the stripes position over time, and attributing nuclei to the corresponding stripes.</p><p>The main conclusion is that despite being created by the activity of independent enhancers, even-skipped stripes emerged from globally similar kinetic phenomena over time which combine an increase of transcription burst frequency and duration within the stripes and a progressive reduction of bursting between stripes. Interestingly, the dynamics and the timing of stripe formation appears quite different among stripes but does not correlate with the enhancer regulating the stripe formation (for example, the kinetics features of stripes 4 and 6 and of stripe 3 and 7 are not more similar to each other than they are to the five other stripes). Thus, despite being created by the independent activity of different enhancers, even-skipped stripes exhibit similar kinetic phenomena over time. This is a very interesting observation, suggesting the co-evolution of enhancers to ensure the robustness of the downstream processes.</p><p>1) The five even-skipped enhancers have been identified using transgenic reporters and mostly experiments on fixed embryos (ISH or FISH) that did not capture the fast dynamics uncovered with the MS2 system and live imaging. It is thus not clear how these five enhancers might recapitulate the different dynamics observed here for the seven stripes with the MS2 system. Although it is beyond the scope of this manuscript, it is important to mention in the manuscript potential discrepancies between the two experimental approaches.</p><p>2) It has been shown recently that the MS2 cassette itself might influence the regulation of the target promoter (Lucas et al., 2018, bioRxiv). It is thus important to mention in the manuscript the possibility that the common regulatory properties observed for the seven stripes could be driven by the MS2 cassette. Could the authors confront the dynamics of expression of the seven stripes that they uncover with the MS2 system from FISH data on precisely staged cycle 14 embryos?</p><p>3) As mentioned by the authors, the length of the construct is very long (6, 5 kb) and carry the MS2 cassette in 5' of the transcribed sequence. This was done on purpose to increase the fluorescent signal but also impairs the sensitivity in detection fluctuations. A good example of this is shown in Figure 4C where a small activity of the promoter provides a very strong fluorescent signal. Can the authors comment on this and indicate the range of kinetics parameters that this construct allows to capture?</p><p>4) Most of the works' results and conclusions are based on the temporal k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub>, which can be extracted directly for each nucleus. This is very likely to be confused with k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> inferred from the mHMM approach. Please discuss how the temporal k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> are calculated when they are first mentioned (we only find out about this until the very end of the manuscript) and use a different annotation (or markers) to avoid confusion with mHMM's.</p><p>5) Given the ON and OFF rate changing over time as pointed out above, one should question the validity of the mHMM here. Can the authors clarify on this point?</p><p>6) In the Materials and methods section, how is the time window for each nucleus selected for mHMM inference? Is it the time window when the nucleus is in the temporal stripe region?</p><p>7) Given the movement of the transcription stripes over time, protein stripes which are translated over a range of AP position should be wider as mRNAs stripes. Can the authors show how the integrated transcription stripes look like over time, or at the end of the cycles?</p><p>8) The Discussion of the manuscript is too long and would benefit of being more focused.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61635.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] This is an elegant piece of work, although with some of the same caveats that are relevant for the Lammers manuscript. One concern is whether the embryos would develop past gastrulation, given the light dosage (Sedat has made a big point about this). It would be useful to know this, although it may not influence conclusions about the early events.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: The imaging conditions are identical to those used repeatedly in various previous experiments (e.g., Bothma et al.​​, 2014, Bothma et al.​​, 2015; Bothma et​ al.​, 2018; Lammers et al.​, 2020). Here, the light dose was determined to be appropriate so as not to affect development as reported by the timing of the nuclear cycles in early development. We have now made this point explicitly in the Materials and methods section under “Imaging and Optimization of Data Collection”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As with the Lammers manuscript, the observations are by their nature descriptive, but provide a basis for evaluations of various mechanisms; these are spelled out well in the Discussion, with appropriate cautionary caveats. One of the more interesting observations is that the stripes seem to be similarly regulated in kinetics and duration of the transcription despite the variety of factors regulating them. This commonality of mechanism requires some new thinking about the role of these various elements.</p><p>Some quibbles about the writing style: the concept of a &quot;transcriptional desert&quot; seems a bit melodramatic (as does the repetitive &quot;stripe is a stripe...&quot; line) and obscures the mechanistic implications. Presumably the &quot;desert&quot; is just the closing of the transcriptional window, as described more precisely in the accompanying manuscript. To further impinge on the author's expository flair here, the concept of &quot;sculpting&quot; is too anthropomorphic, as one needs a sculptor to sculpt and this is conceptually confusing since these events are stochastically driven. Is the sculptor a facilitator of &quot;intelligent design&quot;? Do you want to go there?</p></disp-quote><p>While we were simply trying to add a little rhetorical color to the manuscript, we accept the reviewer’s admonition that they are distracting and perhaps misleading and have adjusted our language accordingly. For example, in the new version of the manuscript, we have eliminated all reference to transcriptional deserts. The one area where we disagree is with the term “sculpting”. While we recognize that it has some anthropomorphic character, here it was meant as a metaphor to emphasize that, by adjusting the kinetics of bursting in individual nuclei, a complex pattern emerges from an initially unfinished and unfeatured mass. It is not a hill on which we would die, but we hope the reviewers will allow us this flourish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of my concerns about the Lammers manuscript can be reiterated briefly. The inserted eve reporter system is now sucking up factors and presumably competing with the endogenous gene possibly causing a &quot;transcriptional haploinsufficiency&quot; (my own terminological flair in this case) wherein the effective local concentrations are now half what they should be, and this may have the effect of changing the bursting and duration kinetics. Furthermore, the local environment of the endogenous gene may contain more regulatory chromatin not dreamt of in your philosophy, that would rule the expression of eve with a firmer hand (using the anthropomorphizing theme). Hence the assertion that the inserted gene &quot;is phenotypically neutral&quot; seems glib and may not be technically correct, at least until tested. Assuming that the function of eve is not compromised by some of the modifications used for the reporter gene, why not tag the endogenous gene? (I may be unaware of literature that relates to this experiment, but I don't think that complementation in a mutant strain reproduces the robustness of the endogenous gene).</p></disp-quote><p>There are two separate concerns being addressed here. First, that the regulation of a BAC may not be the same as the endogenous locus, and second that the BAC itself might be disrupting its own regulation by adding an extra locus to the system.</p><p>In our accompanying paper (Supplementary Figure 9 in Lammers et al.​, 2020) we have actually shown that, given reasonable values for the <italic>eve</italic>​​ mRNA degradation rate, the profile resulting from our BAC is quantitatively comparable to that of the endogenous <italic>eve</italic> ​​locus as measured by mRNA FISH. We now mention this control in the section “Live imaging of <italic>eve</italic> expression”. Further, while CRISPR insertions of MS2 (or PP7) to the <italic>eve</italic> ​​locus exist, these either don’t rescue (Chen et al.​ ​, Nat Genet​​, 2018) or are located on the 3’ end of the gene (Lim et al.​, 2018) such that the fluorescence signal is significantly reduced (as described in Garcia et al.​, 2013 and Ferraro et al.​​, ​WIREs Dev Biol,​ 2016).</p><p>The second concern, that the addition of an extra copy of a locus might affect gene regulation by diluting the concentration of regulators is interesting, but we think this phenomenon is highly unlikely to have a measurable effect here. First, all of the well-characterized regulators of <italic>eve</italic>​ (Bcd, Hb, Gt, Kr, Kni, Slp1) have many targets throughout the genome, and bind to thousands of sites in the blastoderm (see Li et al., PLoS Biology​, 2008). Thus the addition or removal of a single locus to the system would change the effective concentration of the factors by one percent at most – far less than the natural nucleus to nucleus noise in transcription factor levels (see Gregor et al.​​, Cell​, 2007) or variation in the size of nuclei within an embryo. Indeed it would be truly remarkable to have a regulatory system that could respond to such a small change in factor concentration. Furthermore, we expect selection to strongly disfavor such sensitivity, as it runs counter to the need to maintain robustness in gene expression outputs during development. We hope the reviewer will agree with us that this “transcriptional haploinsufficiency” is probably a small effect and that it is not worth mentioning explicitly in the manuscript so as not to dilute its message.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All told, I feel that these considerations could be dealt with in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the reviewer’s concerns throughout the text. In addition, the Discussion section has been significantly modified to better focus on the insights about the molecular control of transcriptional bursting resulting from our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this work by Berrocal et al., the authors provide a quantitative treatment of the enduring developmental problem of how the combinatorial inputs into an enhancer drive spatial patterns in the blastoderm. Work in recent years indicates these developmental genes are also stochastic and exhibit bursting transcription, making the emergence of these ordered patterns even more difficult to explain. This manuscript is decidedly observational yet also highly quantitative. No molecular mechanisms are elucidated, but the underlying spatiotemporal transcription phenomena are characterized with experimental rigor. The authors seem to believe they have uncovered some universal behaviors but they stop short of making any strong claims, making it hard for this reviewer to come away with a digestible conclusion. Overall, I found the paper to be scholarly and well-written. I think it could be appropriate for eLife with some revisions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for carefully assessing our manuscript. We appreciate the feedback, both specific and general, and have tried to address it in the revised manuscript. Specifically to the reviewer's point, we have revised the Discussion section to more focus on the potential underpinnings of the control mechanisms for bursting uncovered by our work. Having said that, we have also added a call for new experiments that utilize the methods developed here to further probe into how transcription factors actually realize the control of bursting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) I found the paper to be somewhat off balance in the presentation. Some of the concepts and data analyses are covered in a cursory manner, even for specialists, but the Discussion goes on at length.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above we have significantly edited the Discussion section to make it more focused. In addition, we have expanded the description of how our analyses are done, and removed superfluous analyses that might have added more confusion than clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, I am confused by Figure 4A. Why does the autocorrelation go negative? What does the autocorrelation of the first derivative even mean? Is this experimental data?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our lack of clarity. We have now revised the description of the autocorrelation approach in section “Modeling and inference of promoter state” and in the Materials and methods section under “Estimation of polymerase transit time”. The idea is that every loaded polymerase induces a fluorescence signal for essentially the entire time it is transiting the locus: a pulse of fluorescence of width equal to the transit time. Thus the increase in signal associated with a polymerase loaded at time t should be coupled to a decrease in signal at t + transit time. We reveal this lag by looking at the autocorrelation of the vector of the timepoint by timepoint change in fluorescence signal, which has a minimum at 140s (we did 100 bootstraps over randomly chosen sets of 80% of all nuclei, which give almost identical results that are now shown in Figure 4A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is a tremendous amount of live-cell data, and I appreciate the scale of that analysis effort. The two major inference problems in this data analysis are the following: 1) promoter activity must be inferred through direct analysis of the transcription time traces, and 2) burst kinetics have to be assigned to a particular stripe. I would like to see some straightforward analysis or metric of how good these inferences are. Error bars or confidence analysis is noticeably absent throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The challenge here is that we lack the means of knowing the actual state of the promoter (this is something we are working on but it is a long-term challenge that is beyond the scope of this work). In Lammers et al., 2020, we describe the effectiveness of our inference to recover model parameters from simulated data. However, this is under the still unproven assumption that the base model implicit in the cpHMM is correct. All of these points are made explicitly in the Lammers et al​​. work, but we are happy to repeat them in this manuscript if the reviewer deems it necessary.</p><p>We do apologize for the lack of error bars throughout the paper. Where possible, we have now added error bars generated by, for example, bootstrapping over the nuclei in our data set. Specifically, we have added error bars to the single-cell fluorescence traces shown in Figure 3A, to the inference of the RNAP dwell time stemming from the autocorrelation analysis (Figure 4A), and to our inferred bursting parameters (Figures 8A-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to this second inference, I found the exceptional behavior of the 5 – 6 interstripe to be important. Is this looser regulation also observed by smFISH? Such an analysis would also indicate how well the stripe assignment works in live blastoderms. Is there any biological functionality to the 5-6 interstripe bursting?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a very interesting question (though outside of the scope of the current work). Given the fast pace of the pattern as reported by our data and the low temporal resolution attainable by smFISH, however, we doubt that the latter technique can shed light on the detailed behavior of the 5-6 interstripe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 8, is there some sort of reduced parameterization which captures the essential behavior, rather than an empirical tabulation of on and off rates? The results in Figure 10 argue for such a reduced parameterization, and the comparison is made to the Zoller paper in the Discussion, but I don't see where they actually test a reduced model for fitting the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Note that, in Figure 8, we have now performed inference by binning our nuclei according to their average fluorescence values (which reports on the average transcriptional activity of each nucleus) rather than grouping them by their position along the embryo. In doing so, the correlations between <italic>k</italic>​<italic><sub>on</sub></italic> ​and <italic>k</italic>​​<italic><sub>off</sub></italic> vanished (Figure 8A and B). We believe that this is due, in part, to the large nucleus-to-nucleus variation in average fluorescence values at a given AP position (Figure 8D). Instead, when binning by fluorescence, we find that <italic>k</italic>​​<italic><sub>on</sub></italic> increases with fluorescence while <italic>k</italic>​<italic><sub>off</sub></italic> remains constant. Further, we find that <italic>r</italic>​​ also increases with fluorescence (Figure 8C).</p><p>Based on these results, we could have performed an inference with a model where <italic>k</italic>​​<italic><sub>on</sub></italic> and <italic>r</italic>​​ are coupled. We hope the reviewer will agree with us that such exploration of a model that goes beyond the widespread two-state model of bursting calls for a solid theoretical footing that goes beyond the scope of the current work, but that we are very excited to pursue in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Related to this last point, when I look at Figure 8 , I see a lot of variability at the low ON rates. This variability could result in an apparent trend which is artefactual. At some point, there is a noise floor where the mHMM might be picking up single infrequent bursts that could therefore be spurious. I find the treatment of this key point unsatisfactory, both because there is not an in depth statistical analysis, and also because the authors use sentences such as &quot;To investigate whether this result is an artifact of the mHMM, we implemented an orthogonal method that uses integer programming to infer promoter states from traces based on a direct fit of 140s fluorescence pulses.&quot; This one-sentence description is obtuse, even for specialists. I think there needs to be greater effort here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are many potential artifacts clouding out inference. As a result, we have removed any analyses that rely on inferences in regimes such as the low ON-rate one described by the reviewer. Further, we have performed a systematic analysis of the limitations of the cpHMM method using synthetic data in Lammers et al.​ ​ which we would be happy to reproduce here if the reviewer deems it necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) The five even-skipped enhancers have been identified using transgenic reporters and mostly experiments on fixed embryos (ISH or FISH) that did not capture the fast dynamics uncovered with the MS2 system and live imaging.

However, given the direct comparison between the BAC and the endogenous <italic>eve</italic> ​​patterns (Supplementary Figure 9 in Lammers et al.​​, 2020) mentioned in the previous point, we believe that, unlike in the case reported by Lucas et al.​​, the MS2 stem loops do not significantly affect <italic>eve</italic>​​ regulation. The reasons for this remain unclear, but could be related to different amounts of Zelda present at both loci. For example, if Zelda binding is already saturated at <italic>eve</italic>​​, we would not expect the presence of more Zelda sites in the MS2 loops to have a significant effect. Further, the distance between the loops and the enhancers might also make a difference. While the <italic>hunchback</italic> ​​P2 promoter and enhancer are essentially one contiguous unit on the DNA, the <italic>eve</italic> ​​enhancers are separated from the promoter and distributed throughout the locus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As mentioned by the authors, the length of the construct is very long (6, 5 kb) and carry the MS2 cassette in 5' of the transcribed sequence.

We have now referred the reader to this work when we introduce the reporter construct in the section titled “Reporter Design” within the Materials and methods. In principle the length of the reporter should not limit our ability to estimate burst parameters; however, in practice a construct that is too short will have insufficient signal and one that is too long will require too many computational resources. Our choice of reporter construct structure strikes a balance between these two limitations and is ideally suited for inferring bursting parameters in the time range where <italic>eve</italic>​ resides, as well as for boosting the signal-to-noise ratio.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Most of the works' results and conclusions are based on the temporal k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub>, which can be extracted directly for each nucleus.

We have clarified this point in the Materials and methods, section “Compound-state Hidden Markov Model”.</p><p>Further, to simplify our paper, we have decided to exclude the inference of the temporal dependence of bursting parameters in favor of focusing on the commonalities of bursting parameters between different stripes (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Given the movement of the transcription stripes over time, protein stripes which are translated over a range of AP position should be wider as mRNAs stripes.
