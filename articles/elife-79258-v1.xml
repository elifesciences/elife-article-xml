Mechanisms controlling gene dosage have been extensively studied in animals, however it is unknown how generalizable these mechanisms are to diverse eukaryotes. Here, we use the haploid plant <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> to assess gene dosage control in its short-lived diploid embryo. We show that throughout embryogenesis, paternal chromosomes are repressed resulting in functional haploidy. The paternal genome is targeted for genomic imprinting by the Polycomb mark H3K27me3 starting at fertilization, rendering the maternal genome in control of embryogenesis. Maintaining haploid gene dosage by this new form of imprinting is essential for embryonic development. Our findings illustrate how haploid-dominant species can regulate gene dosage through paternal chromosome inactivation and initiates the exploration of the link between life cycle history and gene dosage in a broader range of organisms.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The reproductive cells of organisms that reproduce sexually – the egg and the sperm – each contain one copy of the organism’s genome. An embryo forms upon fertilization of an egg by a sperm cell. This embryo contains two copies of the genome, one from each parent. Under most circumstances, it does not matter which parent a gene copy came from: both gene copies are expressed. However, in some species genes coming from only one of the parents are switched on. This unusual mode of gene expression is called genomic imprinting. The best-known example of this occurs in female mammals, which repress the genes on the paternal X chromosome. Genomic imprinting also exists in flowering plants.</p><p>Both mammals and flowering plants evolved tissues that channel nutrients from the mother to the embryo during development; the placenta and the endosperm, respectively. Genomic imprinting had, until now, only been described in these two types of organisms. It was unknown whether imprinting also happens in other organisms, and specifically those in which embryos develop inside the mother but without the help of a placenta or endosperm.</p><p>Here Montgomery et al. addressed this question by studying the liverwort, <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic>, a moss-like plant. Initial experiments showed that cells in the liverwort embryo mostly expressed the genes coming from the egg, and not the sperm. All the genetic material coming from the sperm had a molecular marker or tag called H3K27me3. This mark, which also appears on the paternal X chromosome in female mammals, switches off the genes it tags. <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> embryos thus suppress gene expression from all of the genetic material from the father, relying only on maternal genetic material for development. When Montgomery et al. deleted the maternal genes necessary for making the H3K27me3 mark, the paternal genes switched on, and this led to the death of the embryos. The survival of <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> embryos therefore depended on keeping only one set of genes active.</p><p>Taken together these experiments indicate that genomic imprinting evolved about 480 million years ago, about 320 million years earlier than previously thought, in organisms for which embryo development depended only on one parent. This means there are likely many more organisms that control gene expression in this way, opening up opportunities for further research. Understanding imprinting in more detail will also shed light on how sexual reproduction evolved.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic></kwd><kwd>genomic imprinting</kwd><kwd>gene dosage</kwd><kwd>Polycomb</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>embryogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P26887</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P28320</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P32054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P33380</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W1238</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montgomery</surname><given-names>Sean Akira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>757600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Chang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>847548</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hisanaga</surname><given-names>Tetsuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I4258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genomic imprinting in the bryophyte <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> by Polycomb results in maternal dominance of embryonic gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maintaining proper gene dosage is a challenge for eukaryotic organisms. For instance, multi-subunit protein complexes require balanced production of each component, lest incomplete, non-functional complexes are produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birchler and Veitia, 2010</xref>). Misregulation of gene dosage can lead to developmental defects, sterility, and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loda et al., 2022</xref>). Dramatic changes in gene dosage notably occur during the process of diploidization after whole genome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edger and Pires, 2009</xref>) and sex chromosome evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mank, 2013</xref>). Sex chromosome dosage compensation is best understood mechanistically in mammalian female X chromosome inactivation (XCI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Żylicz and Heard, 2020</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> male X chromosome upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Samata and Akhtar, 2018</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms are not conserved across the many diploid-dominant species in which sex chromosome dosage compensation has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gu and Walters, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lau and Csankovszki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lucchesi and Kuroda, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muyle et al., 2012</xref>) potentially due to the repeated innovation of sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachtrog et al., 2014</xref>). Gene dosage also changes regularly during cell cycles and life cycles as ploidy levels change. Therefore, a large variety of gene dosage regulatory mechanisms remain to be discovered in eukaryotes.</p><p>All sexually reproducing eukaryotes have diploid and haploid life cycle stages, but the duration of each stage varies greatly amongst species. The alternation between ploidy must be programmed because unscheduled change in ploidy leads to genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davoli and de Lange, 2011</xref>). Despite the short haploid stage of gametes in mammals, gene dosage is managed by meiotic sex chromosome inactivation and post-meiotic silencing in male gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee and Bartolomei, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Namekawa et al., 2006</xref>). This is continued as imprinted XCI in early female embryos, wherein the male X chromosome is selectively repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Takagi and Sasaki, 1975</xref>). The disruption of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation results in meiotic arrest, illustrating its essentiality for sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Turner, 2007</xref>). However, the mechanisms of gene dosage control throughout the mammalian life cycle are not conserved amongst animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vibranovski, 2014</xref>), reflective of the diversity of sex chromosome dosage compensation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gu and Walters, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lau and Csankovszki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lucchesi and Kuroda, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muyle et al., 2012</xref>). Most eukaryotic life cycles differ from that of animals, with a predominance of haploid life stages, suggesting that there may be extensive diversity yet uncovered. Haploid and haploid-dominant species present an intriguing and understudied corollary to understand gene dosage control throughout life cycles. Strictly haploid species such as yeast show limited evidence for gene dosage control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Springer et al., 2010</xref>). Haploid-dominant species with a short diploid phase of development are of particular interest because of the stark contrast of life cycles with diploid-dominant species and their prevalence across various branches of eukaryotic life. How, or even if, haploid-dominant species balance gene dosage during the diploid phase is not known.</p><p>Here, we identified a control of gene dosage by selective repression of alleles of paternal origin in the diploid embryonic stage of the model haploid-dominant bryophyte <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>Marchantia</italic>). We show that <italic>Marchantia</italic> represses paternal chromosomes by genomic imprinting via the Polycomb mark H3K27me3. This unique form of genomic imprinting, which we term ‘paternal chromosome repression’ (PCR), is the first description of imprinting in the bryophyte lineage since its theoretical prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haig, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haig and Wilczek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Montgomery and Berger, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shaw et al., 2011</xref>). Disruption of PCR results in derepression of the paternal genome and lethality. Furthermore, we show that the imprinting mark is deposited at the pronuclear stage and initiates PCR that persists until the end of embryogenesis. Therefore, <italic>Marchantia</italic> manages gene dosage by effectively maintaining a functionally haploid state in diploid embryos under the control of the maternal genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Embryonic transcription is maternally biased</title><p>To explore <italic>Marchantia</italic> gene dosage control, we performed crosses between two wild-type natural accessions, Cam-2 as the mother and Tak-1 as the father, and obtained transcriptomes from embryos 13 days after fertilization (daf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The published transcriptomes were generated from samples collected by laser-capture microdissection, an orthogonal sample collection method that offered equally high sample purity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schon and Nodine, 2017</xref>). A similarly strong maternal bias in transcription was observed, with 99% of genes maternally biased or expressed only from maternal alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). Thus, these data ruled out that the observed allele-specific gene expression originated from natural variation amongst wild-type parents or from maternal contamination during sample collection. Additionally, we tested whether the genes resolved by our analyses formed a sample representative of all genes. We found no correlation between the maternal ratio and expression level of a gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), nor did the transcription maternal ratio vary significantly along the length of each autosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, we inferred that the genes we were able to resolve with SNPs were representative of a genome-wide maternal bias in transcription. Overall, the lack of paternal allele expression suggests the presence of a repressive chromatin modification specifically on the paternal genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Levels of H3K27me3 enrichment are paternally biased</title><p>To better understand what chromatin-related mechanisms may be driving the maternal bias in embryonic transcription, we examined differentially expressed genes between vegetative parents and embryos.

Male and female pronuclei remain separate until 4 daf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hisanaga et al., 2021</xref>), thus we examined if H3K27me3 was deposited before pronuclear fusion.

The delay between the detection of H3 and H3K27me3 suggests that the mark is deposited after nucleosomes are assembled, but we cannot exclude that a level of H3K27me3 below the limit of detection is present at 2 daf. The timing of H3K27me3 deposition is not unique, as low levels of H3K9me1 also appear in paternal pronuclei at 3 daf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We do not make any comparisons to the maternal pronucleus as its large size made it difficult to capture in a single paraffin slice.

To test this idea, we generated transcriptomes from mutant embryos and examined maternal ratios of gene expression. Overall, transcription became more biallelic in mutants than in wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, Wilcoxon signed-rank test p &lt; 0.0001, effect size = –1.03). Only 47% of genes were maternally biased (0.65 ≤ <italic>p<sub>m</sub></italic> &lt; 0.95) and 15% of genes completely expressed from maternal alleles (<italic>p<sub>m</sub></italic> ≥ 0.95), a stark deviation from wild-type values of 73% and 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref> and compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Comparing both mutant maternal ratios of transcription with patterns of H3K27me3, we observed that the H3K27me3 maternal ratio negatively correlated with the maternal ratio of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>) and that H3K27me3 enrichment positively correlated with the maternal ratio of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, D</xref>), indicating that loci with less paternal H3K27me3 in mutants were more transcribed from paternal alleles. High paternal H3K27me3 and maternal transcription did not correlate with the level of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, E-G</xref>), suggesting that absolute gene expression levels did not influence paternal allele repression. Therefore, paternal alleles regain expression in the absence of maternal PRC2 and upon the loss of paternal H3K27me3. A differential gene expression analysis found 3824 and 2003 genes were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in mutant embryos. There was a significant overlap between downregulated genes and genes overlapping a peak of H3K27me3 in mutant embryos (χ<sup>2</sup> test, p-value = 3.616e-15, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), suggesting that downregulated genes were repressed by residual PRC2 activity. Yet the large majority of misregulated genes were upregulated and we conclude that H3K27me3 deposited by embryo-specific PRC2 subunits is required for the collective repression of paternal alleles, resulting in PCR.</p><p>To assess the physiological relevance of the loss of paternal allele repression, we quantified the growth and survival of mutant embryos. Embryonic growth was significantly slower in mutants than in wild type, as measured by total size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2H</xref>). Only 20% of mutant embryos survived to maturity versus 95% of wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2I</xref>), and only 5% of all mutant embryos produced spore-bearing structures, compared to 77% of wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2J</xref>). Of those mutants that produced spores, none produced viable spores, thus rendering all mutants unable to continue their life cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Although it is not possible to exclude that ectopic expression of genes due to the loss of PRC2 activity but not the loss of imprinting is the direct cause of the loss of viability, our results are also consistent with the model that PRC2-mediated PCR is essential for viability and fecundity in <italic>Marchantia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of genomic imprinting in <italic>Marchantia</italic>.</title><p>Model of H3K27me3 deposition in wild-type (WT) paternal pronuclei and subsequent propagation throughout embryogenesis.

While diploid-dominant species often balance gene dosage between autosomes and sex chromosomes throughout their life cycles, haploid-dominant species must manage gene dosage only during embryonic development. The model bryophyte <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> achieves gene dosage control during embryonic development via genomic imprinting and subsequent repression of the paternal genome. The repressive mark H3K27me3 is first deposited over the whole paternal pronucleus, in contrast to mammals where H3K27me3-mediated imprinting impacts only a handful of loci and is deposited in the female gamete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Inoue et al., 2017</xref>). Interference of maternal PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 deposition ultimately halts embryonic development. Thus, PRC2 initiates and maintains silencing of the entire paternal genome, which might be essential for the development of the diploid embryo of <italic>Marchantia</italic>.</p><p>The bryophyte life cycle marks the transition between the haploid life cycle of their aquatic ancestors and the diploid life cycle of vascular plants. Our results suggest that maintaining the dominant haploid dosage of gene expression was selected in the diploid embryo of bryophytes. In response to whole genome duplications, plant and animal genomes modulate gene expression to pre-duplication levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McElroy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pala et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Song et al., 2020</xref>), though the mechanisms underlying such gene dosage control are poorly understood. Why gene dosage control in <italic>Marchantia</italic> was achieved through imprinting might be explained by the fact that ancestor of bryophytes had separate sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iwasaki et al., 2021</xref>) and embryos developed on mothers. It is thus likely that viviparity, the development of embryos within mothers, and its collateral maternal support of embryo development, favoured the evolution of imprinting as a way to impose maternal control, as proposed by a body of theoretical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haig, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haig and Wilczek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Montgomery and Berger, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shaw et al., 2011</xref>). Imprinting has not been discovered in viviparous non-therian animals, but only orthologous loci imprinted in mammals were investigated, thus a genome-wide search may yield new insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lawton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Renfree et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings support the idea that viviparity is sufficient for the evolution of imprinting and provide a new framework to explore the evolution of imprinting in a much more diverse range of organisms than previously considered across eukaryotes.</p><p>We believe that PCR represents a new form of imprinting. It is distinct from parental genomic imprinting described in flowering plants and therian mammals for three main reasons: the epigenetic mark is deposited after fertilization; all chromosomes of one parent are silenced by the epigenetic mark; and imprinting imposes a global maternal control of embryogenesis. The outcome of imprinting in <italic>Marchantia</italic> also differs from the elimination of the paternal genome following heterochromatin formation in several insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crouse, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de la Filia et al., 2021</xref>). In insects, heterochromatinized paternal chromosomes are eliminated by still unknown mechanisms, though the timing of elimination varies amongst species leading to pseudohaploidy in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Morse and Normark, 2005</xref>). In contrast, the paternal genome in <italic>Marchantia</italic> embryos subjected to PCR is reactivated and still passed on to the next generation. While it is possible the phenomenon we observed is due to Tak-1-specific repression, our crosses with a different male accession, Cam-1, displayed similar H3K27me3 heterochromatic domains, thus we believe PCR is parent-of-origin dependent.</p><p>PCR in <italic>Marchantia</italic> differs from XCI in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heard et al., 2001</xref>) because all paternal chromosomes are compacted and repressed and H3K9me is not involved. The formation of heterochromatic foci associated with H3K27me3 is reminiscent of the compaction and compartmentalization of the X chromosome during XCI in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galupa and Heard, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nozawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Plath et al., 2003</xref>) or meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee and Bartolomei, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Namekawa et al., 2006</xref>). However, since half of the genome is marked exclusively by H3K27me3, its partition results in large compartments, the compaction of which depends on PRC2 activity. Similar mechanisms may be at play in mediating whole-chromosome compaction and repression in mammals, insects, and <italic>Marchantia</italic>. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment and abolition of PCR are not addressed by our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), however their elucidation will be of interest to make cross-kingdom comparisons with other instances of imprinted dosage compensation mechanisms.</p><p>Overall, we have uncovered a distinct mechanism that controls gene dosage in a haploid-dominant species. We anticipate similar controls for all bryophytes as well as other groups of organisms that alternate long-lived haploid and diploid phases. Remnants of such a control might exist in flowering plants, as suggested by maternally dominant expression in the rice zygote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, both parental genomes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are equally expressed after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schon and Nodine, 2017</xref>), but whether the total dosage of expression is the same as in haploid progenitors of gametes remains unknown. Various forms of alternation between multicellular haploid and diploid life phases are also widespread in brown and red algae. Brown algae show changes in epigenetic marks and transcription between haploid and diploid generations, despite the absence of Polycomb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourdareau et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it would be of interest to determine the mechanisms of gene dosage control in these species as it would be distinct from PCR in <italic>Marchantia</italic>. Broadly, we propose that although sex chromosomes provide an important paradigm to understand gene dosage control, this phenomenon evolved several times as life cycles alternating between ploidy levels diversified, suggesting that there is an expanse of gene dosage regulatory mechanisms that remains to be explored across the broad assortment of eukaryotic life cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant lines and growth conditions</title><p>Wild-type male Tak-1, male Cam-1, female Cam-2, and female Tak-2 accessions of <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> ssp. <italic>ruderalis</italic> were used in this study.

Typically, starting from the lowest threshold, such sequence first decreased rapidly, followed by a wide plateau, and ending by a decreasing tail near the highest threshold value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The nearly constant plateau was detected by thresholding absolute value of neighbour size differences. Again, a sequence of thresholds was used, starting from a minimum equal to 1/10 of average of the differences, until the length of such plateau was larger than 6. Finally, the segmentation in the middle of the plateau was taken as the final one. In the last step eventual holes in the three-dimensional mask were filled by a hole-filling operation and eventual thin gaps in the mask were filled by binary closing.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Immunofluorescence image analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nucleus segmentation.

Except for a few cases, the nuclei were labeled correctly. The incorrect ones were manually adjusted by means of drawing functions in FIJI v2.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Interphase nuclei image foci segmentation</title><p>Foci within the nucleus area were detected separately for the DAPI and the immunofluorescence channels by <italic>k</italic>-means classification in 2, 3, and 4 classes, which in our case of single-valued data specified one, two, or three threshold values. The foci mask was then computed by thresholding the input data using the highest of these thresholds. The results were visually inspected and classification in three classes was then taken for further processing and evaluation. Only the largest foci with size bigger than 20% of the nucleus size were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>In a limited number of cases, one or two foci were missing, or foci were too large. In the first case there were two possibilities of how to identify more foci: either by decreasing the expected foci size or by decreasing the threshold value. Thus, in a loop we multiplied both these values by a coefficient until the desired number of foci was reached. In the second case with too large foci, classification in four classes was used, which increased the highest threshold and simultaneously decreased the size of the foci.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical comparisons means of FISH immunostaining images and mutant growth analyses were performed with Wilcoxon tests in R v3.5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">R Development Core Team, 2018</xref>) with the ggpubr v0.4.0 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kassambara, 2020</xref>).

This article describes an epigenetic mechanism used to modulate paternal chromosome gene dosage during the transient diploid state of the primarily haploid plant, Marchantia polymorpha. This fascinating case of genome-wide genomic imprinting will be of broad interest to scientists studying gene expression, early development, and especially those focused on understanding the diversity of gene dosage control mechanisms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79258.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Levine</surname><given-names>Mia T</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00b30xv10</institution-id><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.04.477531">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.04.477531v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Polycomb-mediated repression of paternal chromosomes maintains haploid dosage in diploid embryos of Marchantia&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given that Tak-1 is the male in both the Cam-2 x Tak-1 and the Tak-2 x Tak-1 experiments, one can't rule out the possibility that the paternal chromosome silencing, H3K27me enrichment, etc. is specific to Tak-1. Under this alternative model, Tak-1 chromosomes are silenced in combination with either Cam-2 or Tak-2 – a phenomenon more akin to nucleolar dominance – i.e. genotype-dependent rather than parent-of-origin dependent. Assessing biased expression of diploid embryos from a cross using a different male genotype would blunt this concern. If such a cross is not possible, then addressing this alternative model in the Discussion is warranted.</p><p>2) Please include statistical tests for deviations from the expected 1:1 maternal:paternal ratio (see various imprinting studies).</p><p>3) The authors show that e(z) mutant embryos grow more slowly and that most do not survive. They also show that mutants have reduced maternal allele bias. In terms of linking the phenotype to the gene expression change, it would be important to show that the total expression level of individual genes was altered in the mutants (for example, increased paternal allele expression might be compensated for by decreased maternal allele expression, in which case it would harder to connect the mutant phenotype to PCI). The authors should evaluate how many genes are differentially expressed between wild-type and mutant embryos.</p><p>4) The proposed post-fertilization mechanism of imprinting is exciting, but this part of the manuscript seems somewhat underdeveloped. Figure 4 shows the enrichment of H3K27Me3 in paternal pronuclei at the daf 3 stage, but it would help to see 1) the earlier stages at which this signal is missing; and 2) staining for other histone modifications, to verify that the enrichment is really specific to H3K27Me3.</p><p>Additional revisions requested:</p><p>5) It's satisfying that when ez2 and ez3 are disrupted (Figure 5, Figure 5-Figure supp 1D), that the IF for mutant embryos looks like H3K27me3 in vegetative nuclei (Figure 3A). But the paternal bias of H3K27me3 is still quite prevalent (Figure 5-Figure supp1F) as is the maternal bias in transcription – the transcriptional ratio is not close to 50:50 (Figure 5B). The authors should comment or speculate on how paternal bias of H3K27me3 persists in this mutant, given their model. Perhaps the remaining H3K27me3 is from paternally supplied E(z). Since the paternal and maternal pronuclei are segregated for quite some time, a paternally supplied factor could also specifically mark one chromosome set (although it is less clear why this would be so from an evolutionary perspective). Generating paternal E(z) mutants would be interesting, but is likely beyond the current scope.</p><p>6) From the genetic results, one can conclude that E(z)2 and E(z)3 are essential for viability and fecundity. But it is not yet clear, as claimed on line 339, that PCI is essential for viability and fecundity, as E(z)2 and E(z)3 may also have roles beyond or in addition to PCI. I suggest dividing this sentence into what one can conclude from the genetics, and what this suggests about the possible importance of PCI.</p><p>7) Paternal chromosome inactivation is perhaps too strong of a phrase to describe this very interesting phenomenon. There are thousands of genes for which expression is biased toward the maternal allele, but detectable paternal allele transcript is present in the embryos. It is important to get the name right now, because it may influence the field for a long time (consider the many caveats now required for the term &quot;inactive X&quot;) The reviewers came up with some alternative terms, &quot;PCR&quot; (Paternal Chromosome Repression) or &quot;PCS&quot; (Paternal Chromosome Suppression/Silencing). This change is up to the author's discretion.</p><p>8) At 3 days after fertilization both H3 and H3K27me3 are present, but since histones replaced protamines, the critical events of histone deposition and Polycomb marking might have occurred simultaneously or more likely successively. Can the authors distinguish these possibilities?</p><p>9) Comparisons are made to X-chromosome inactivation in mammals and male X upregulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as silencing phenomena that are not conserved in evolution, but there are others that might be more relevant, such as paternal genome elimination in mealybugs, which is a spermatocyte-specific event that follows whole genome silencing during embryogenesis. Another is Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation, a conserved phenomenon in animals that targets unpaired chromosomes.</p><p>10) Low outliers in Figure 1-Figure suppl 1F (maternal transcription bias) and high outliers in Figure 2 suppl 1E (paternal H3K27me3 bias). Are they the same? Are they escapers?</p><p>11) Can the authors provide additional evidence that the large heterochromatic H3K27Me3-stained foci (Figure 3) do represent or at least contain paternal chromosomes? Although it's certainly suggested by the images of mitotic chromosomes in Figure 3B, more direct evidence would strengthen this point. Ideally, DNA FISH for a region that can distinguish between the strains can be used. But if no such region is available, DNA FISH against common loci or chromosomal regions would be expected to show a spot within the heterochromatic foci (paternal) and a spot outside of them (maternal), which would corroborate the idea that paternal chromosomes are contained within the visible foci. Combining or supplementing this with RNA FISH would be even better, but could be technically challenging.</p><p>Related to the point above, it would further strengthen the proposed model if the authors could demonstrate the localization of the embryo-specific E(z) homologues to the daf3 paternal pronucleus and their absence from the maternal pronucleus. If this experiment is not possible, addressing this limitation in the Discussion is warranted.</p><p>12) Figure 4 – supplement 1 shows many images of what appears to be the same type of staining, and the purpose behind this is unclear. Are these all the images used in quantification, are they just representative images or are they supposed to display certain variations within this IF?</p><p>13) Please define &quot;viviparity&quot; and its relevance for the broader audience.</p><p>14) The font size on graphs within main figures should be made uniform and probably increased too.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79258.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given that Tak-1 is the male in both the Cam-2 x Tak-1 and the Tak-2 x Tak-1 experiments, one can't rule out the possibility that the paternal chromosome silencing, H3K27me enrichment, etc. is specific to Tak-1.

The only male Marchantia accession with a sequenced genome is Tak-1 so we opted not to sequence and assemble the genome of another male accession. However, we were able to perform a cross between Tak-2 and a different male accession, Cam-1, and observed immunostaining of embryonic nuclei. We observe the same condensed heterochromatic domains tightly associated with H3K27me3 in Tak-2 x Cam-1 crosses and suggest that is it likely that the same phenomenon is at play. These data have been incorporated into Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and comments lines 204-207. In the Discussion we have included the alternative hypothesis the reviewer proposed at lines 425-427.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please include statistical tests for deviations from the expected 1:1 maternal:paternal ratio (see various imprinting studies).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have performed statistical tests for maternal bias for transcription and H3K27me3 in WT and mutant and indicated the number of genes that are significant in each of our five categories of parental bias (Paternal, Paternal bias, No bias, Maternal bias, Maternal) in Figures 1 and 2 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and 2 and lines 166-168.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors show that e(z) mutant embryos grow more slowly and that most do not survive.

We have now included H3K27me3 immunofluorescence experiments at 2 daf to show a lack of this mark at this stage in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 (line 269-271). We have also included H3K9me1 IF experiments at 2 daf and 3 daf and show that a weak signal of H3K9me1 also appears in the paternal pronucleus at 3 daf (line 276-277). We do not make comparisons to the presence or absence of histone modifications in the maternal pronucleus because its large size hampers capturing images from the entire maternal pronucleus within a single paraffin slice (line 277-279, 1249-1255).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional revisions requested:</p><p>5) It's satisfying that when ez2 and ez3 are disrupted (Figure 5, Figure 5-Figure supp 1D), that the IF for mutant embryos looks like H3K27me3 in vegetative nuclei (Figure 3A).

We state on line 315-317 that maternal E(z)1 is expressed in embryos and may account for the remaining H3K27me3.

We have now included immunostaining images at 2 days after fertilization and show that H3 is present whereas H3K27me3 is absent in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 (line 269-271). This suggests that H3K27me3 deposition occurs after histone deposition, but cannot exclude an earlier deposition of low levels of H3K27me3 (275-276).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Comparisons are made to X-chromosome inactivation in mammals and male X upregulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as silencing phenomena that are not conserved in evolution, but there are others that might be more relevant, such as paternal genome elimination in mealybugs, which is a spermatocyte-specific event that follows whole genome silencing during embryogenesis.

Are they the same? Are they escapers?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. In Figure 2D, we plot transcription bias against H3K27me3 bias, and no genes are present in the lower right quadrant, which would represent the low outliers in Figure 1-Figure suppl 1F and high outliers in Figure 2 suppl 1E. Therefore, they are not the same, but could potentially be escapers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Can the authors provide additional evidence that the large heterochromatic H3K27Me3-stained foci (Figure 3) do represent or at least contain paternal chromosomes?

This would be an article in its own self and therefore beyond the scope of revision. The fact that exactly 8 autosomes out of 16 are covered by H3K27me3 and that the ChIP-seq data shows that H3K27me3 covers thousands of paternal alleles scattered along all autosomes demonstrate that the eight chromosomes covered with H3K27me3 in metaphase plates are the paternal chromosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the point above, it would further strengthen the proposed model if the authors could demonstrate the localization of the embryo-specific E(z) homologues to the daf3 paternal pronucleus and their absence from the maternal pronucleus. If this experiment is not possible, addressing this limitation in the Discussion is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>This would be an interesting point but it would require the development of several new transgenic lines and is the departure point of another story about the mechanism that targets the PRC2 complex to the male pronucleus. Adding such a piece of information would not add to the main conclusion of this manuscript dedicated entirely to document the extraordinary fact that the paternal chromosomes are imprinted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 4 – supplement 1 shows many images of what appears to be the same type of staining, and the purpose behind this is unclear.

The number of images has been reduced to illustrate representative images and this has been noted in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Please define &quot;viviparity&quot; and its relevance for the broader audience.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected on lines 405-406.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The font size on graphs within main figures should be made uniform and probably increased too.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
