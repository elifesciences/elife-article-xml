by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Up to now the two hexahelical transmembrane domains of mACs were considered to fix the enzyme to membranes. Here, we show that the transmembrane domains serve in addition as signal receptors and transmitters of lipid signals that control Gsα-stimulated mAC activities. We identify aliphatic fatty acids and anandamide as receptor ligands of mAC isoforms 1–7 and 9. The ligands enhance (mAC isoforms 2, 3, 7, and 9) or attenuate (isoforms 1, 4, 5, and 6) Gsα-stimulated mAC activities in vitro and in vivo. Substitution of the stimulatory membrane receptor of mAC3 by the inhibitory receptor of mAC5 results in a ligand inhibited mAC5–mAC3 chimera. Thus, we discovered a new class of membrane receptors in which two signaling modalities are at a crossing, direct tonic lipid and indirect phasic GPCR–Gsα signaling regulating the biosynthesis of cAMP.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adenylyl cyclase</kwd><kwd>receptors</kwd><kwd>fatty acids</kwd><kwd>cyclic AMP</kwd><kwd>anandamide</kwd><kwd>GPCR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Schu275/45-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schultz</surname><given-names>Joachim E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>institutional funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>Adrian CD</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dodecahelical membrane anchors of mammalian adenylyl cyclase isoforms are receptors for unsaturated free fatty acids and, as a tonic signal, enhance or attenuate GPCR/Gsα-stimulated cyclic AMP formation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The structure of the first second messenger, cyclic 3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), was reported in 1958 by Sutherland and Rall. It was generated by incubation of a liver extract with the first messengers adrenaline or glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sutherland and Rall, 1958</xref>). Since then, cAMP has been demonstrated to be an almost universal second messenger used to translate various extracellular stimuli into a uniform intracellular chemical signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dessauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ostrom et al., 2022</xref>). The biosynthetic enzymes for cAMP from ATP, adenylyl cyclases (ACs), have been biochemically investigated in bacteria and eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khandelwal and Hamilton, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Linder and Schultz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linder and Schultz, 2008</xref>). Finally in 1989, the first mammalian AC was sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krupinski et al., 1989</xref>). The protein displayed two catalytic domains (C1 and C2) which are highly similar in all isoforms. The two hexahelical membrane anchors (TM1 and TM2) are dissimilar and isoform specifically conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassler et al., 2018</xref>). The latter were proposed to possess a channel or transporter-like function, properties, which were never confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krupinski et al., 1989</xref>). The domain architecture of mammalian ACs, TM1–C1–TM2–C2, clearly indicated a pseudoheterodimeric protein composed of two concatenated monomeric bacterial precursor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2001</xref>). To date, sequencing has identified nine mammalian membrane-delimited AC isoforms (mACs) with identical domain architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dessauer et al., 2017</xref>). In all nine isoforms the catalytic domains are conserved and share extensive sequence and structural similarities which indicate a similar biosynthetic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Linder and Schultz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linder and Schultz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tesmer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sinha and Sprang, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, the associated two membrane domains differ substantially within each isoform and between all nine mAC isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schultz, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang and Gilman, 1995</xref>). Bioinformatic studies, however, revealed that the membrane domains, TM1 as well as TM2, are highly conserved in an isoform-specific manner for about 0.5 billion years of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schultz, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Extensive studies on the regulation of the nine mAC isoforms revealed that the Gsα subunit of the trimeric G proteins activate cAMP formation. Gsα is released intracellularly upon stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), i.e., the receptor function for mAC regulation was assigned to the diversity of GPCRs, which presently are most prominent drug targets. In 1995 Tang and Gilman reported that Gsα regulation of mammalian mACs does not require the presence of the membrane anchors. A soluble C1–C2 dimer devoid of the membrane domains was fully activated by Gsα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang and Gilman, 1995</xref>). This reinforced the view that the mAC membrane anchors which comprise up to 40% of the protein were just that and otherwise functionally inert. The theoretical possibility of mACs to be regulated directly, bypassing the GPCRs, was dismissed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schuster et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>We were intrigued by the exceptional evolutionary conservation of the mAC membrane anchors for 0.5 billion years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schultz, 2022</xref>). In addition, we identified a cyclase-transducing element that connects the TM1 and TM2 domains to the attached C1 or C2 catalytic domains. These transducer elements are similarly conserved in a strictly isoform-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schultz, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ziegler, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, cryo-EM structures of mAC holoenzymes clearly revealed that the two membrane domains, TM1 and TM2, collapse into a tight dodecahelical complex resembling membrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gu et al., 2001</xref>). Lastly, we created a chimeric model involving the hexahelical quorum-sensing receptor from <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> which has a known aliphatic lipid ligand and the mAC 2 isoform. We observed that the ligand directly affected, i.e., attenuated the Gsα activation of mAC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seth et al., 2020</xref>). As a proof-of-concept this demonstrated that the cytosolic catalytic AC dimer serves as a receiver for extracellular signals transmitted through the dyad-related membrane anchor. Accordingly, we proposed a general model of mAC regulation in which the extent of the indirect mAC activation via the GPCR/Gsα axis is under direct ligand control via the mAC membrane anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seth et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the results of a rigorous search for potential ligands of the mAC membrane domains. We identified aliphatic lipids as ligands for mAC isoforms 1–7 and 9. Isoform dependently, the ligands either attenuate or enhance Gsα activation in vitro and in vivo demonstrating a receptor function of the mAC proteins. The receptor properties are transferable as demonstrated by interchanging the membrane anchors between mAC3 and 5. Thus, the results define a new class of membrane receptors and establish a completely new level of regulation of cAMP biosynthesis in mammals in which tonic and phasic signaling processes intersect in a central signaling system, which is the target of frequently used drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Oleic acid enhances Gsα-stimulated mAC3, but not mAC5 activity</title><p>In earlier experiments, we demonstrated regulation of the mycobacterial AC Rv2212 by lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel Motaal et al., 2006</xref>), the presence of oleic acid in the mycobacterial AC Rv1264 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Findeisen et al., 2007</xref>), and regulation of a chimera consisting of the quorum-sensing receptor from <italic>Vibrio</italic> and the mAC2 catalytic dimer by the aliphatic lipid 3-hydroxytridecan-4-one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beltz et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we searched for lipids as ligands. Here, we used bovine lung as a starting material because lipids are important for lung development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Änggård and Samuelsson, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dautel et al., 2017</xref>).

The dried organic phase was chromatographed on silica gel (employing vacuum liquid chromatography; Si-VLC) and fractions A to Q were assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Fraction E enhanced mAC3 activity stimulated by 300 nM Gsα fourfold, whereas mAC5 activity was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The non-maximal concentration of 300 nM Gsα was used because it enabled us to observe stimulatory as well as inhibitory effects.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of mAC3 activating fatty acids.</title><p>Effect of 1 µg/assay of fractions E from vacuum liquid chromatography (<bold>A</bold>) and E2 from reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (<bold>B</bold>) on 300 nM Gsα-stimulated mAC isoforms 3 and 5.

Surprisingly, cAMP formation in HEK-mAC1 cells stimulated by 10 µM isoproterenol was attenuated by arachidonic acid with high potency (IC<sub>50</sub> = 250 pM), i.e., with higher potency compared to data with membranes prepared from the same cell line. In contrast, mAC4 activity examined under identical conditions was not attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Currently, we are unable to rationalize these discrepancies. Possibly, mAC4 has another, more specific lipid ligand which is needed in in vivo. In general, the enhancing and attenuating effects bolster the hypothesis of specific receptor-ligand interactions and divergent intrinsic activities for different ligands. Of note, it was reported that arachidonic acid at concentrations up to 1 mM inhibits AC activity in brain membrane fractions and that essential fatty acid deficiency effects AC activity in rat heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>At this point we were lacking ligands for mACs 5, 6, and 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref> and Figure 8). Possibly, the negative charge of the fatty acid headgroups might impair receptor interactions. A neutral lipid neurotransmitter closely related to arachidonic acid is arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mock et al., 2023</xref>). Indeed, anandamide attenuated 300 nM Gsα stimulation of mAC5 and 6 with IC<sub>50</sub> of 42 and 23 µM, respectively, i.e., comparable to the effect of arachidonic acid on mACs 1 and 4, and distinctly less potently than the ligands for mAC 2, 3, 7, and 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). mACs 5 and 6 may thus represent new targets for anandamide which is part of a widespread neuromodulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu and Mackie, 2016</xref>). The concentrations of arachidonic acid and anandamide required may be achieved in vivo by local biosynthesis and degradation. An interfacial membrane-embedded phosphodiesterase cleaves the phosphodiester bond of the membrane lipid <italic>N-</italic>arachidonoyl-ethanolamine-glycerophosphate releasing anandamide into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mock et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Simon and Cravatt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). The lipophilicity and lack of charge should enable it to diffuse readily. Whether the mACs and this biosynthetic phosphodiesterase colocalize or associate with its target mACs is unknown. Degradation of anandamide is by a membrane-bound amidase, generating arachidonic acid and ethanolamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McKinney and Cravatt, 2005</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether anandamide at higher concentrations might also affect mAC1 and 4. In fact, anandamide significantly attenuated Gsα-stimulated mAC1, but distinctly not mAC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> of anandamide for mAC1 was 29 µM.

The theoretical possibility of a receptor function of these large hexahelical anchor domains, each comprising 150–170 amino acids, was considered unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schuster et al., 2024</xref>). Our data are a transformative step toward resolving this issue and introduce lipids as critical participants in regulating cAMP biosynthesis in mammals. The first salient discovery is the identification of the membrane domains of mACs as a new class of receptors for chemically defined ligands which set the level of stimulation by the GPCR/Gsα system. This conclusion is based on (1) the dodecahelical membrane domains of the nine mAC receptors have distinct, conserved isoform-specific sequences for the TM1 and TM2 domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schultz, 2022</xref>; (2) the receptors have distinct ligand specificities and affinities in the lower micromolar range; (3) isoform dependently ligands either enhance or attenuate Gsα-stimulated mAC activities; (4) receptor properties are transferable between isoforms by interchanging membrane domains; (5) isoproterenol-stimulated formation of cAMP in vivo is affected by addition of extracellular ligands; (6) Gsα-stimulated cAMP formation in mouse cortical membranes is enhanced by oleic acid. Therefore, the results establish a new class of receptors, the membrane domains of mACs, with lipids as ligands. The data question the utility of the currently used mAC sub-classification, which groups mAC1, 3, 8, mAC2, 4, 7, mACs 5, 6, and mAC9 together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dessauer et al., 2017</xref>). At this point, mAC 1, 4, 5, and 6, which are ligand-attenuated, may be grouped together and a second group may consist of isoforms 2, 3, 7, and 9 which are ligand-enhanced. Our data do not contradict earlier findings concerning regulation of mACs via GPCRs, cellular localization of mAC isoforms or regional cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dessauer et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, the data reveal a completely new level of regulation of cAMP biosynthesis in which two independent modalities of signaling, i.e., direct, tonic lipid signaling and indirect phasic signaling via the GPCR/Gsα circuits intersect at the crucial biosynthetic step mediated by the nine mAC isoforms.</p><p>The second important finding is the observation that the extent of enhancement of mAC3 activity by 20 µM oleic acid is uniform up to 1000 nM Gsα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, right). We suppose that in mAC3 the equilibrium of two differing ground states favors a Gsα unresponsive state and the effector oleic acid concentration dependently shifts this equilibrium to a Gsα responsive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seth et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, the equilibrium of ground states of mAC5 probably is opposite, i.e., the one accessible to Gsα stimulation predominates and stimulation by Gsα is maximal. In addition, oleic acid has little effect because the mAC5 receptor domain does not bind oleic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, center). A ligand for mAC5, e.g., anandamide or arachidonic acid, likely shifts the equilibrium of ground states to a Gsα unresponsive state and inhibits stimulation. The biological balance of ground states appears to be an intrinsic property which is isoform specifically imprinted in mACs. Probably, it defines a major element of regulation and enables distinct inhibitory or stimulatory inputs by extracellular lipid ligands. The ground states probably are separated by a low transition energy and are stabilized by receptor occupancy. Hitherto available structures required Gsα and/or forskolin for stabilization and probably did not capture different ground states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schuster et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sunahara et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tesmer and Sprang, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vercellino et al., 2017</xref>). Mechanistically, tonic levels of lipid ligands affect the ground states and thus set the bounds of cAMP formation elicited by phasic GPCR/Gsα stimulation. As such lipid signaling through the mAC membrane receptors appears to represent a higher level of a systemic regulatory input based on constant monitoring the physiological and nutritional status of an organism.</p><p>Lipid signaling is much less characterized than solute signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eyster, 2007</xref>). Most of the highly functionalized ligands for GPCRs are storable in vesicles and the release, inactivation and removal are strictly controlled. On the other hand, the very nature of lipids, i.e., high flexibility of aliphatic chains, low water solubility, propensity for nonspecific protein binding, membrane permeability and potential effects on membrane fluidity complicate discrimination between extra- and intracellular lipid actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Samovski et al., 2023</xref>). Yet, viewed from an evolutionary perspective, lipids possibly are ideal primordial signaling molecules because for the emergence of the first cell lipids were required to separate an intra- and extracellular space. Conceivably, lipids derived from membrane lipids were used for regulatory purposes early-on. In association with the evolution of bacterial mAC progenitors lipid ligands may have persisted in evolution and regulation by GPCR/Gsα in metazoans was acquired and expanded later.</p><p>The concentrations of free fatty acids in serum or interstitial fluid usually are rather low, mostly below the EC<sub>50</sub> concentrations determined in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grundmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ulven and Christiansen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huber and Kleinfeld, 2017</xref>). This raises the question of the origin of lipid ligands under physiological conditions. It is well known that cell membranes are highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McMahon and Gallop, 2005</xref>). Within limits, cell morphology and lipid composition are in constant flux to accommodate diverse functional requirements. Remodeling of cell membranes is accomplished by targeted phospholipid biosynthesis and by regulated lipolysis of membrane lipids, e.g., by phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>, mono- and diacylglycerol lipases or lipoprotein lipases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, a speculative possibility is that lipid ligands are acutely and locally generated directly from membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Muccioli, 2010</xref>). Such regulation probably happens at the level of individual cells, cellular networks, complex tissues, and whole organs. Additional potential lipid sources available for ligand generation may be, among others, lipids in nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 1995</xref>), exosomes present in blood, serum lipids, chylomicrons, blood triglycerides, and lipids originating from the microbiome. On the one hand, the discovery of lipids as ligands for the mAC receptors broadens the basis of regulation of cAMP biosynthesis with potentially wide-ranging consequences in health and disease. On the other hand, the data pose the challenge to identify how the tonic signal is generated and regulated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and materials</title><p>ATP, creatine kinase, and creatine phosphate were from Merck.

Enhanced Gαs-stimulated activities of isoforms 2, 7, and 9, while mAC1 was slightly attenuated, but isoforms 4, 5, 6, and 8 were unaffected. Certain other unsaturated octadecanoic FAs act similarly. FA effects were not observed in AC catalytic domain constructs in which TM domains are not present. Oleic acid also enhances the AC activity of isoproterenol-stimulated HEK293 cells stably transfected with mAC3, although with lower efficacy but much higher potency. Gαs-stimulated mAC1 and 4 cyclase activity were significantly attenuated in the 20-40 micromolar by arachidonic acid, with similar effects in transfected HEK cells, again with higher potency but lower efficacy. While activity mAC5 was not affected by unsaturated FAs, neutral anandamide attenuated Gαs-stimulation of mAC5 and 6 by about 50%. In HEK cells, inhibition by anandamide is low in potency and efficacy. To demonstrate isoform specificity, the authors were able to show that membrane preparations of a domain-swapped AC bearing the catalytic domains of mAC3 and the TM regions of mAC5 are unaffected by oleic acid but inhibited by anandamide.

They show that certain aliphatic lipids activate adenylyl cyclases in the absence of stimulatory G proteins and that lipids can modulate activation by G proteins. Adding lipids to cells expressing specific isoforms of adenylyl cyclases could regulate cAMP production, suggesting that adenylyl cyclases could serve as 'receptors'.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is the first report of lipids regulating mammalian adenylyl cyclases directly. The evidence is based on biochemical assays with purified proteins, or in cells expressing specific isoforms of adenylyl cyclases.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It is not clear if the concentrations of lipids used in assays are physiologically relevant. Nor is there evidence to show that the specific lipids that activate or inhibit adenylyl cyclases are present at the concentrations required in cell membranes. Nor is there any evidence to indicate that this method of regulation is seen in cells under relevant stimuli.</p></disp-quote><p>Although this question is not the subject of this ms., we will address this question in more detail in the discussion of the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Landau et al. have submitted a manuscript describing for the first time that mammalian adenylyl cyclases can serve as membrane receptors.

They have used a large array of techniques with a paper having clear conceptual story and several strong lines of evidence.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) At the beginning of the results section, the authors say &quot;We have expected lipids as ligands&quot;. It is not quite clear why these could not have been other substances. It is because they were expected to bind in the lipophilic membrane anchors? Various lipophilic and hydrophilic ligands are known for GPCR which also have transmembrane domains. Maybe 1-2 additional sentences could be helpful here.</p></disp-quote><p>Will be done as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In stably transfected HEK cells expressing mAC3 or mAC5, they have used only one dose of isoproterenol (2.5 uM) for submaximal AC activation. The reference 28 provided here (PMID: 33208818) did not specifically look at Iso and endogenous beta2 adrenergic receptors expressed in HEK cells. As far as I remember from the old pharmacological literature, this concentration is indeed submaximal in receptor binding assays but regarding AC activity and cAMP generation (which happen after signal amplification with a so-called receptor reserve), lower Iso amounts would be submaximal. When we measure cAMP, these are rather 10 to 100 nM but no more than 1 uM at which concentration response dependencies usually saturate. Have the authors tried lower Iso concentrations to prestimulate intracellular cAMP formation? I am asking this because, with lower Iso prestimulation, the subsequent stimulatory effects of AC ligands could be even greater.</p></disp-quote><p>The best way to address this issue is to establish a concentration-response curve for Iso-stimulated cAMP formation using the permanently transfected cells. We note that in the past isoproterenol concentrations used in biochemical or electrophysiological experiments differed substantially.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors refer to HEK cell models as &quot;in vivo&quot;. I agree that these are intact cells and an important model to start with. It would be very nice to see the effects of the new ligands in other physiologically relevant types of cells, and how they modulate cAMP production under even more physiological conditions. Probably, this is a topic for follow-up studies.</p></disp-quote><p>The last sentence is correct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims, and whether the results support their conclusions:</p><p>The authors have achieved their aims to a very high degree, their results do nicely support their conclusions. There is only one point (various classical GPCR concentrations, please see above) that would be beneficial to address.</p><p>Without any doubt, this is a groundbreaking study that will have profound implications in the field for the next years/decades. Since it is now clear that mammalian adenylyl cyclases are receptors for aliphatic fatty acids and anandamide, this will change our view on the whole signaling pathway and initiate many new studies looking at the biological function and pathophysiological implications of this mechanism.

The data are presented in Fig. 3 and in the appendix Fig.’s 8, 9, 14; structural formulas in appendix 2 Fig. 4 were updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does the quantity plotted on the vertical axis of Figure 1, right panel represent &quot;Fractional Stimulation by Oleic acid&quot; rather than simply &quot;Fold Stimulation&quot;? Clearly, as shown in the two left-most panels, Gαs stimulates both mAC and mAC5. Rather it seems that the ratio (oleic acid stimulation) / (Gαs stimulation) remains constant. This observation supports the statement in the discussion that &quot;We suppose that in mAC3 the equilibrium of two differing ground states favors a Gαs-unresponsive state and the effector oleic acid concentration-dependently shifts this equilibrium to a Gαs-responsive state&quot;. It could also be said that the effect of oleic acid is additive, and in constant proportion to that of Gαs.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment certainly is related to Fig. 2:</p><p>The ratio would be (Gsα + oleic acid stimulation) / (Gsα-stimulation), i.e., fractional stimulation by addition of oleic acid is identical to fold stimulation.</p><p>We have amended the legend to fig. 2C for clarification.</p><p>The last sentence is wrong because oleic acid alone does not stimulate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is stated on page 3, 2nd to last line that &quot;The action of oleic acid on mAC3 was instantaneous...&quot;. Since the earliest time point is taken at 5 minutes, the claim that the action of the lipid is instantaneous cannot be made. Information about kinetics would be useful to have, since it is possible that the lipid must be released from a micelle and be incorporated into the AC membrane fraction before it is active.</p></disp-quote><p>The first point is 3 min.</p><p>We deleted the word “instantaneous” and added the correlation coefficients for both conditions in the legend to appendix 2; fig. 1 for clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data spread in Figure 4 and other figures showing similar data is significant, to the extent that the computed value for EC50 may not be of high precision.

There is no direct evidence that the lipids bind to the enzymes, and the affinities can only be surmised from the EC50 graphs. To call a protein a receptor requires evidence to show that the binding is specific by showing that binding can be inhibited by a large excess of 'unlabelled' ligand. This could have been done by procuring labelled lipids for experimental verification.</p></disp-quote><p>As is well known, lipids easily bind to proteins. In this study no purified proteins were used. Therefore, binding assays most likely would result in unreliable data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper would have benefitted from showing sequence alignments in the TM domains of the ACs discussed in the paper. Further, a phylogenetic tree of mammalian ACs would also reveal which enzymes from other species may be regulated similarly to those described in the paper. This would be important for researchers who use other model organisms to study cAMP signalling.</p></disp-quote><p>Such data are in multiple papers accessible in the literature. Where deemed appropriate we inserted references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 1A and 1B show data from only two experiments. A third experiment would have been useful in order to show the statistical significance of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>At this stage more experiments would not have affected further experimental plans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statements made in the text (for example, the last paragraph on page 6) state only the mean value and not the SDs. This would have been important to include even if the data is shown in the appendix. The same is true in the Legend of Figure 2. Why have the authors decided to use SEM and not SDs?</p></disp-quote><p>The reason is specified in M&amp;M.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concentrations of lipids used in biochemical assays are in the micromolar range. This suggests that we have moderate affinity binding, more in the range of an enzyme for a substrate rather than a receptor-ligand interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We happen to disagree. Clearly, the differential activities, enhancing or attenuating Gsα-stimulated mAC activities is most plausibly explained by mAC receptor properties. mACs have enzyme activities using fatty acids as substrates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors add lipids to cells and show changes in cAMP levels in their presence and absence. They also discuss how these extracellular lipids could be produced. Do you think this is necessary in vivo, though? Could the lipids present in membranes naturally act as regulators? Do specific lipid concentrations differ in different cell types, suggesting tissue-specific regulation of these mammalian Acs?</p><p>These are things that could be discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The last paragraph of the discussion deals with these questions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
