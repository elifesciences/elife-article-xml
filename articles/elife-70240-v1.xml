The currently used P2Y12 receptor inhibitors are clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. Moreover, clopidogrel and prasugrel require metabolic activation and irreversibly bind to the P2Y12 receptor, causing prolonged recovery of platelet function. In addition, the efficacy of clopidogrel is reduced in patients with certain genotypes. Ticagrelor is a new oral antiplatelet agent of the cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine class which acts through the P2Y12 receptor. In contrast to clopidogrel and prasugrel, ticagrelor does not require metabolic activation and binds rapidly and reversibly to the P2Y12 receptor.</p><p>However, it undergoes cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism to produce the active metabolite AR-C124910XX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yandrapalli et al., 2019</xref>). AR-C124910XX, the main known active metabolite, has approximately 30% activation of the parent drug to exhibit antiplatelet activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mehta et al., 2010</xref>). As it quickly and strongly came into effect compared to the conventional drug clopidogrel, the latest American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association guidelines recommend ticagrelor as a first-line drug for the treatment of acute STEMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Levine et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>However, some STEMI patients respond poorly to ticagrelor, exhibiting a delayed response in the early phase of treatment even when a loading dose of 180 mg was employed. There is a crucial time window after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) that cannot be protected by ticagrelor, in which some STEMI patients are at a high risk of stent thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexopoulos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Franchi et al., 2015</xref>). The mechanism of high platelet reactivity (HPR) in ticagrelor remains elusive. Genetic and non-genetic factors have been reported to contribute to its HPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Siller-Matula et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbieri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Verdoia et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Ticagrelor requires absorption in the intestine combined with the P2Y12 receptor of platelets without metabolic activation in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Weeks et al., 2015</xref>). Transporters are transport proteins that mediate transmembrane drug transport in the intestine. P-glycoprotein is encoded by ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (<italic>ABCB1</italic>) gene. As an important transporter, it affects the absorption and metabolism of ticagrelor in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Varenhorst et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Notarangelo et al., 2018</xref>). P-glycoprotein, also known as ABCB1 protein, is one of the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette genes that mostly exist in the apical membrane of the intestinal mucosa, liver, and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">von Richter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fromm and Kim, 2011</xref>). It encodes transporters and channel proteins, acts as an efflux pump, and is responsible for intracellular homeostasis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marsousi et al., 2016</xref>, revealed a significant inhibitory effect of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor valspodar on the efflux of ticagrelor, suggesting that P-glycoprotein is involved in the oral disposal of ticagrelor. A large genetic substudy of the PLATO trial showed that <italic>CYP2C19</italic> and <italic>ABCB1</italic> polymorphisms were independent of the lower rates of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke observed in patients treated with ticagrelor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Varenhorst et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nardin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wallentin et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, a genome-wide association study of patients from the PLATO study identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (<italic>SLCO1B1</italic>) gene that leads to decreased organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) activity. Plasma ticagrelor levels were associated with two independent SNPs in the <italic>CYP3A4</italic> region and an SNP in the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (<italic>UGT2B7</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Varenhorst et al., 2015</xref>). However, the detailed mechanism remains unclear.</p><p>There is growing awareness that alterations of the gut microbiome and its products may affect the progress and state of cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhernakova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jie et al., 2017</xref>). The association between gut microbiota and ticagrelor has not been reported previously, and the specific components of microbiota that influence the effect of drugs leading to the occurrence of HPR remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and drug absorption and a certain genus of gut microbiota that might be the cause of delayed absorption of ticagrelor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study cohort and patient characteristics</title><p>All patients with STEMI were enrolled in the Department of Cardiology of the General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region between April 2016 and March 2018. All patients (the onset time for STEMI is ≤12 hr) received ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose followed by two 90 mg maintenance doses) and aspirin (300 mg loading dose followed by a 100 mg maintenance dose) before PCI. Briefly, STEMI patients were clinically diagnosed using a combination of the following criteria: (1) acute ischemic-type chest pain in the last 24 hr; (2) electrocardiogram change (pathological Q wave, ST segment elevation, or depression); (3) elevated plasma hscTnT (0.05 ng/mL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ibanez et al., 2018</xref>). The exclusion criteria were as follows: allergy/intolerance to aspirin or ticagrelor; use of oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents other than aspirin and ticagrelor; recent treatment with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist; use of proton pump inhibitors; end-stage renal or hepatic disease; treatment with fibrin-specific fibrinolytic therapy &lt;24 hr or non-fibrin-specific fibrinolytic therapy &lt;48 hr prior to randomization; presence of active internal bleeding or history of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke in 6 months; platelet count &lt;100 × 10<sup>9</sup> /L; hematocrit &lt;25%; creatinine levels &lt; 2.5 mg/dL; hepatic disease (hepatic enzymes twice the upper normal limit).

Peripheral venous blood samples were collected with a loose tourniquet through a short catheter inserted into the forearm vein. The first 2–4 mL of blood was discarded to avoid spontaneous platelet activation, and the rest was collected in 3.2% trisodium citrate for PA measurement. The upper platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The remaining blood was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to obtain platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Twenty-five microliters of ADP (20 µM) was used as a platelet inducer. Following addition of PPP into the platelet reaction cup, the PA rate was measured at a speed of 1000 rpm. The PA rate was measured at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hr after administration of the 180 mg ticagrelor. According to the rate of PA at 2 hr, patients were divided into two groups: HPR group (PA ≥59%) and normal platelet reactivity (NPR) group (PA &lt;59%).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pharmacokinetic assessment</title><p>Blood samples for the determination of plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were collected at 0 hr (pre-dose) and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hr after ticagrelor administration.

Fecal samples were stored at 4°C immediately after defecation, brought to the laboratory within 4 hr, and stored at –80°C before DNA extraction. The containers were transferred on ice and stored at –80°C prior to processing. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from fecal samples using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, GmbH, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA purity was measured using a Thermo NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). All DNA extraction procedures were prepared under a Class II biological safety cabinet. The concentration of genomic DNA in each fecal sample was quantified using the NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer. DNA integrity and size were assessed using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.

Microbiota-depleted mice were randomly divided into two groups. The fecal supernatant (200 µL) was orally administered to patients in the NPR or HPR group twice weekly. Recipient mice carrying microorganisms were placed in different cages. Drinking water and animal feed were strictly sterilized and replaced daily. The squirrel cage and padding were sterilized with high-pressure steam before use. Padding was changed every 2 days to strictly control bacterial pollution.

Within 24 hr after the administration of 180 mg ticagrelor, the blood concentration of ticagrelor in the HPR group was significantly lower than that in the NPR group, especially during 2, 4, and 6 hr (all p &lt; 0.0001). The plasma concentration of ticagrelor increased rapidly in the NPR group after administration of the loading dose, and reached its peak at 4 hr. The maximal plasma concentration of ticagrelor was 478.1 ± 430.4 ng/mL. After that the plasma concentration of ticagrelor decreased gradually and tended to balance. The plasma concentration of ticagrelor in the HPR group increased gradually within 24 hr and reached its maximum (233.7 ± 195.1 ng/mL) at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

The trend of its change was consistent with that of ticagrelor blood concentration. The effect of ticagrelor on pharmacokinetics mainly occurs in four steps: absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. In our study, we found that the PA rate in the HPR group was higher than that in the NPR group, which was associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budzyński et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capkin and Altinok, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kang et al., 2019</xref>). We speculate that the change in platelet reactivity may be related to the change in gut flora with the use of pro/antibiotics. Fecal transplantation is a direct experimental method to verify the influence of gut flora. Therefore, in this study, fecal bacteria from HPR and NPR patients were transplanted into microbiota-depleted mice. Plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were measured at different time points after ticagrelor administration in the HPR and NPR groups 8 weeks after transplantation. As expected, the plasma concentration of ticagrelor in the HPR group was lower than that in the NPR group at all time points within 24 hr after ticagrelor administration, and there were significant differences between the two groups at 1, 2, and 6 hr. The plasma concentration of ticagrelor in HPR increased gradually within 24 hr, and the overall concentration was lower than that in the NPR group. The overall change trend of AR-C124910XX in 24 hr was the same as that of the prototype drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Therefore, the change in platelet reactivity may be the mechanism by which antibiotics and probiotics regulate platelet performance.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Post-transplanted pharmacokinetic assessment of ticagrelor in recipient mice of normal platelet reactivity (NPR) and high platelet reactivity (HPR) groups.</title><p>The plasma concentration of ticagrelor (<bold>A</bold>) and its major active metabolite AR-C124910XX (<bold>B</bold>) during the 24 hr following administration of ticagrelor loading dose in fecal microbiota transplantation mice. n = 6; values are expressed as the mean.

The genetic determinants of the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor and gut microbiota have not been previously reported. Therefore, we performed genetic polymorphism analysis and found that there was no difference in ABCB1 gene expression between the NPR and HPR groups. Subsequently, we applied a strategy based on metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to identify the microbial profiles of HPR populations in clinical trials, metabolite signature profiles, and microbial biomarkers for early detection of abnormal platelet responses. Finally, we used fecal transplantation to verify that the manipulation of gut microbiota was sufficient to induce HPR after ticagrelor administration.</p><p>Platelet hyperactivity plays an important role in the occurrence and development of cardiovascular diseases. In the past decade, researchers have realized that gut microbiota are involved in the formation of many cardiac metabolic phenotypes and promote the development of atherosclerosis and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duttaroy, 2021</xref>). It has been found that platelets of sterile mice show reduced ADP-dependent PA, indicating that the presence of symbionts sensitizes ADP-induced platelet activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kiouptsi et al., 2020</xref>). The underlying mechanism of these findings may be related to the activation of the innate immune pathway triggered by TLR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jäckel et al., 2017</xref>) or activation of integrin αIIbβ3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kiouptsi et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the level of functional choline utilization C (cut C) in the gut microbiota can be transmitted through fecal transplantation, thereby enhancing platelet reactivity and thrombosis potential in the recipient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Skye et al., 2018</xref>). TMAO, an intestinal bacterial by-product, can regulate the high reactivity and clot formation rate of platelets in vivo and increase the risk of thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Presently, the standard of treatment in STEMI patients includes dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin plus a P2Y12 receptor antagonist. The currently used P2Y12 receptor inhibitors are clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. Moreover, clopidogrel and prasugrel require metabolic activation and irreversibly bind to the P2Y12 receptor, causing prolonged recovery of platelet function. In addition, the efficacy of clopidogrel is reduced in patients with certain genotypes. Ticagrelor is a new oral antiplatelet agent of the cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine class which acts through the P2Y12 receptor. In contrast to clopidogrel and prasugrel, ticagrelor does not require metabolic activation and binds rapidly and reversibly to the P2Y12 receptor.</p><p>Intestinal microbiota is one of the determinants of pharmacokinetics that has been underestimated. When oral drugs enter the digestive tract, they are first exposed to a large number of bacteria and active enzymes secreted by these bacteria, including oxidoreductase and transferase, among others. Therefore, the intestinal biotransformation of drugs may occur before the first-pass effect, affecting the bioavailability and efficacy of drugs. In recent years, the human gut has been found to be closely associated with cardiovascular diseases. Animal experiments have shown that the decrease in left ventricular function and intestinal blood supply caused by myocardial infarction leads to the inhibition of intestinal epithelial tight junction protein and the injury of intestinal mucosa, thereby increasing intestinal permeability. It has been reported that, compared with healthy individuals, the gut microbiota of STEMI patients has higher richness and diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we analyzed the microbial diversity in fecal samples from the NPR and HPR groups and found that the number of gut microbiota species in the HPR group was significantly higher than that in the NPR group. From species composition analysis, we determined that the concentrations of <italic>Deinococcus</italic> and <italic>Proteus</italic> in the HPR group were significantly higher than those in the NPR group, suggesting that the increase in intestinal harmful bacteria may affect the PA rate. In terms of species abundance, the number of Proteobacteria increased significantly in the NPR group compared with that in the HPR group. Proteobacteria adhere to a large area of gut lining, secreting a large number of enzymatic complexes, such as polysaccharides and fibrin. Moreover, fibrin decomposes fibrinogen in the blood clot and reduces the concentration of plasmin inhibitor in plasma, thus inhibiting platelet activity. This may be another reason for the difference in PA between the HPR and NPR groups.</p><p>Next, this study further revealed the relationship between specific metabolite changes and gut bacterial changes. For example, we found that the content of salicylate in the serum of NPR patients increased significantly. In addition, salicylate was negatively correlated with the abundance of <italic>Methylbacillus</italic>, <italic>Sphingomonas,</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>. It has long been reported that salicylate inhibits the growth of many bacteria, the production of bacterial virulence factors, and affects the sensitivity of bacteria to drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sox and Olson, 1989</xref>). Kazama et al. found that salicylate can induce immune thrombocytopenia and inhibit platelet production in megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kazama et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of drugs are key problems in clinical treatment. Studies have shown that intestinal flora plays an important role in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kashyap et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, human intestinal flora may provide a reasonable explanation for individual differences in specific drug reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vázquez-Baeza et al., 2018</xref>). For example, intestinal microorganisms can affect the metabolism and efficacy of digoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>) and alter the absorption of vitamin K2, which affects the absorption of warfarin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 2014</xref>). Our results suggest that 16S analysis of STEMI patients may help identify patients who benefit more from ticagrelor than from clopidogrel treatment. Accurate consideration of the use of pharmaceutical microbiology to reduce drug side effects and improve efficacy by modifying the microbiota would be beneficial in clinical practice. This also reflects the concept of precision medicine, a new method of disease prevention and treatment that takes into account individual genetic differences, living environment, and habits. Although it is challenging to alter human genes, it is relatively easy to modify the human microbiota. The combination of intestinal microbiology, epidemiology, rapid analysis of metabolites and molecular signals, and genetic engineering are expected to aid in the development of a new treatment strategy for STEMI. In the future, it will be necessary to evaluate the specific functions and potential mechanisms of microbiota, such as platelet reactivity, and to consider microbiota as a potential therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>This study had certain limitations. First, the number of fecal samples selected in this study was small but statistically significant, which can be further confirmed by expanding clinical sample size. Second, the population used in this study represents a certain region and cannot represent the entire Chinese Han population. Third, the 16S method adopted in this study can only detect microorganisms at the genus level. Metagenome analysis was required to identify specific species. Thus, our results need to be verified with a larger sample size and in different populations. Fourth, owing to the small sample size, the incidence of clinically major adverse cardiac events did not increase in the ticagrelor high-response group.</p><p>Finally, by establishing a human gut microflora into microbiota-depleted mouse model, the direct effect of gut microbiota components on the regulation of ticagrelor plasma concentration was evaluated to explore the exact mechanism of gut microbiota in platelet response regulation. Our work provides the first direct evidence highlighting the key role of gut microbiota as an important pathogenic factor in high platelet response. Therefore, regulation of gut microbiota should be considered in antiplatelet therapy. Our findings point to a new strategy aimed at preventing the development of high platelet response and reducing cardiovascular risk by restoring the dynamic balance of genetically modified organisms, diet and lifestyle improvements, and early intervention with drugs or probiotics.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The use of human sample complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of the General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region (2013, No.46: A multicenter, single treatment group, open phase IV study was conducted to evaluate the safety of ticagrelor and describe the incidence of major cardiovascular events in Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome), and written informed consent was obtained from each subject.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal experiments complied with the &quot;Guiding Principles for the Care of Experimental Animals&quot; and &quot;Guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals&quot; (NIH publication 86-23, revised 1985).

Our study was a prospective before-and-after controlled study. In this study, we used multiple factor correction analysis of patient baseline data to correct the error caused by the concentration differences between the samples. We obtained 90 HPR and 65 NPR patients for an in-depth analysis. Furthermore, we used total area/intensity normalization to measure the platelet aggregation rate (PA) of the two groups at different time points. The advantage of this method is that it can eliminate the influence of dilution factors, overcome the problem of different sample concentrations, to make samples comparable, and improve the repeatability and reliability of the experimental results.<sup>1, 2</sup></p><p>I agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that ticagrelor acts on a new class of P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, which is distinct from clopidogrel and prasugrel with respect to its unique mode of inhibitory mechanism. Therefore, we discussed the mechanism of interaction of ticagrelor with P-glycoprotein (MDR1) and other potential regulators of ticagrelor availability.</p><p>“Presently, the standard of treatment in STEMI patients includes dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin plus a P2Y12 receptor antagonist. The currently used P2Y12 receptor inhibitors are clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. Moreover, clopidogrel and prasugrel require metabolic activation and irreversibly bind to the P2Y12 receptor, causing prolonged recovery of platelet function. In addition, the efficacy of clopidogrel is reduced in patients with certain genotypes. Ticagrelor is a new oral antiplatelet agent of the cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine class which acts through the P2Y12 receptor. In contrast to clopidogrel and prasugrel, ticagrelor does not require metabolic activation and binds rapidly and reversibly to the P2Y12 receptor. “(Page 2 line 70-78)</p><p>“The effect of ticagrelor on pharmacokinetics mainly occurs in four steps: absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. In our study, we found that the platelet aggregation rate (PA) in the HPR group was higher than that in the NPR group, which was associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX. This suggests that the pharmacokinetic abnormality of ticagrelor mainly occurs in the absorption stage of the drug.” (Page 10 line 285-291)</p><p>“P-glycoprotein, also known as ABCB1 protein, is one of the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette genes that mostly exist in the apical membrane of the intestinal mucosa, liver, and kidney<sup>3, 4</sup>. It encodes transporters and channel proteins, acts as an efflux pump, and is responsible for intracellular homeostasis. Marsousi N et al<sup>5</sup>., revealed a significant inhibitory effect of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor valspodar on the efflux of ticagrelor, suggesting that P-glycoprotein is involved in the oral disposal of ticagrelor.” (Page 3 line 96-102)</p><p>“A large genetic substudy of the PLATO trial showed that CYP2C19 and ABCB1 polymorphisms were independent of the lower rates of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke observed in patients treated with ticagrelor<sup>6-8</sup>. In addition, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of patients from the PLATO study identified an SNP associated with the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) gene that leads to decreased organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) activity. Plasma ticagrelor levels were associated with two independent SNPs in the CYP3A4 region and an SNP in the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT2B7) gene<sup>6</sup>. However, the detailed mechanism remains unclear.” (Page 3 line 104-113)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Studies have shown that intestinal flora plays an important role in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs<sup>9</sup>.

Accurate consideration of the use of pharmaceutical microbiology to reduce drug side effects and improve efficacy by modifying the microbiota would be beneficial in clinical practice. This also reflects the concept of precision medicine, a new method of disease prevention and treatment that takes into account individual genetic differences, living environment, and habits.

The combination of intestinal microbiology, epidemiology, rapid analysis of metabolites and molecular signals, and genetic engineering are expected to aid in the development of a new treatment strategy for STEMI.

The genetic determinants of the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor and gut microbiota have not been previously reported.

Subsequently, we applied a strategy based on metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to identify the microbial profiles of HPR populations in clinical trials, metabolite signature profiles, and microbial biomarkers for early detection of abnormal platelet responses.

When oral drugs enter the digestive tract, they are first exposed to a large number of bacteria and active enzymes secreted by these bacteria, including oxidoreductase and transferase, among others. Therefore, the intestinal biotransformation of drugs may occur before the first-pass effect, affecting the bioavailability and efficacy of drugs. In recent years, the human gut has been found to be closely associated with cardiovascular diseases. Animal experiments have shown that the decrease in left ventricular function and intestinal blood supply caused by myocardial infarction leads to the inhibition of intestinal epithelial tight junction protein and the injury of intestinal mucosa, thereby increasing intestinal permeability. It has been reported that, compared with healthy individuals, the gut microbiota of STEMI patients has higher richness and diversity<sup>18</sup> In this study, we analyzed the microbial diversity in fecal samples from the NPR and HPR groups and found that the number of gut microbiota species in the HPR group was significantly higher than that in the NPR group. From species composition analysis, we determined that the concentrations of <italic>Deinococcus</italic> and <italic>Proteus</italic> in the HPR group was significantly higher than those in the NPR group, suggesting that the increase in intestinal harmful bacteria may affect the platelet aggregation rate. In terms of species abundance, the number of <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> increased significantly in the NPR group compared with that in the HPR group. <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> adhere to a large area of gut lining, secreting a large number of enzymatic complexes, such as polysaccharides and fibrin. Moreover, fibrin decomposes fibrinogen in the blood clot and reduces the concentration of plasmin inhibitor in plasma, thus inhibiting platelet activity. This may be another reason for the difference in platelet aggregation between the HPR and NPR groups.</p><p>Next, this study further revealed the relationship between specific metabolite changes and gut bacterial changes. For example, we found that the content of salicylate in the serum of NPR patients increased significantly. In addition, salicylate was negatively correlated with the abundance of <italic>Methylobacillum</italic>, <italic>Sphingomonas</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>. It has long been reported that salicylate inhibits the growth of many bacteria, the production of bacterial virulence factors, and affects the sensitivity of bacteria to drugs<sup>19</sup>.

First, the number of fecal samples selected in this study was small but statistically significant, which can be further confirmed by expanding clinical sample size. Second, the population used in this study represents a certain region and cannot represent the entire Chinese Han population. Third, the 16S method adopted in this study can only detect microorganisms at the genus level. Metagenome analysis was required to identify specific species. Thus, our results need to be verified with a larger sample size and in different populations. Fourth, owing to the small sample size, the incidence of clinically major adverse cardiac events did not increase in the ticagrelor high-response group.</p><p>Finally, by establishing a human gut microflora in GF mouse model, the direct effect of GM components on the regulation of ticagrelor plasma concentration was evaluated to explore the exact mechanism of gut microbiota in platelet response regulation. Our work provides the first direct evidence highlighting the key role of gut microbiota as an important pathogenic factor in high platelet response. Therefore, regulation of gut microbiota should be considered in antiplatelet therapy. Our findings point to a new strategy aimed at preventing the development of high platelet response and reducing cardiovascular risk by restoring the dynamic balance of genetically modified organisms, diet and lifestyle improvements, and early intervention with drugs or probiotics.”</p><p>References</p><p>1.
