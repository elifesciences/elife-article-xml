Parameter values obtained from the fits of the TMAO-induced folding data for the constructs shown in Figure 2a. See previous publication (Li et al., 2012) for details. Because the thermodynamic analyses report on the free energy differences and not the mechanistic bases of the energy differences, the reported free energies of folding (ΔG0F−UΔGF−U0) may not necessarily reflect the stability of unique conformations. Instead, they may be reporting on the stability of a conformationally heterogeneous ensemble. Toward this end, it has been reported that ID proteins may adopt poly-beta sheet formations (Han et al., 2012) as part of their functional states. As the effect of TMAO on structure is almost entirely defined by the influence on backbone atoms (i.e. excluding backbone hydrogen bond donors and acceptors from solvent) (Auton and Bolen, 2005), any state or ensemble of states that facilitates removal of backbone atoms from solvent will be stabilized by TMAO. As such, the current analysis provides evidence that a functional state exists whose probability is proportional to transcriptional activation.
