Frequently reported for transcriptional regulators, negative feedback control relies on binding of a transcription factor to its own promoter. Here, we report a novel mechanism for gene autoregulation in bacteria relying on small regulatory RNA (sRNA) and the major endoribonuclease, RNase E. TIER-seq analysis (transiently-inactivating-an-endoribonuclease-followed-by-RNA-seq) revealed ~25,000 RNase E-dependent cleavage sites in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, several of which resulted in the accumulation of stable sRNAs. Focusing on two examples, OppZ and CarZ, we discovered that these sRNAs are processed from the 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR) of the <italic>oppABCDF</italic> and <italic>carAB</italic> operons, respectively, and base-pair with their own transcripts to inhibit translation. For OppZ, this process also triggers Rho-dependent transcription termination. Our data show that sRNAs from 3’ UTRs serve as autoregulatory elements allowing negative feedback control at the post-transcriptional level.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>small RNA</kwd><kwd>RNase E</kwd><kwd>Hfq</kwd><kwd>autoregulation</kwd><kwd><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK2062/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoyos</surname><given-names>Mona</given-names></name><name><surname>Papenfort</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007204</institution-id><institution>Vallee Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vallee Scholars program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Papenfort</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>StG-758212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huber</surname><given-names>Michaela</given-names></name><name><surname>Papenfort</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDA00024/2016-C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoyos</surname><given-names>Mona</given-names></name><name><surname>Huber</surname><given-names>Michaela</given-names></name><name><surname>Papenfort</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 2051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoyos</surname><given-names>Mona</given-names></name><name><surname>Papenfort</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>390713860</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoyos</surname><given-names>Mona</given-names></name><name><surname>Papenfort</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bacterial small RNAs derived from the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA can serve as autoregulatory elements.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biological systems function on a mechanism of inputs and outputs, each triggered by and triggering a specific response. Feedback control (a.k.a. autoregulation) is a regulatory principle wherein the output of a system amplifies (positive feedback) or reduces (negative feedback) its own production. Negative feedback regulation is ubiquitous among biological systems and belongs to the most thoroughly characterized network motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nitzan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shen-Orr et al., 2002</xref>). At the gene regulatory level, negative feedback control has been qualitatively and quantitatively studied. Most commonly, a transcription factor acts to repress its own transcription by blocking access of RNA polymerase to the promoter region. This canonical mode of negative autoregulation is universally present in living systems and in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> more than 40% of the known transcription factors are controlled by this type of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rosenfeld et al., 2002</xref>). Several characteristics have been attributed to negative autoregulatory circuits including an altered response time and improved robustness towards fluctuations in transcript production rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alon, 2007</xref>).</p><p>More recently, the mechanisms underlying RNA-based gene regulation have also been investigated for their regulatory principles and network functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nitzan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pu et al., 2019</xref>). In bacteria, small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) constitute the largest class of RNA regulators and frequently bind to one of the major RNA-binding proteins, Hfq or ProQ. Hfq- and ProQ-associated sRNAs usually act by base-pairing with <italic>trans</italic>-encoded target mRNAs affecting translation initiation and transcript stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Holmqvist and Vogel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kavita et al., 2018</xref>). The sRNAs frequently target multiple transcripts and given that regulation can involve target repression or activation, it has become ever more clear that sRNAs can rival transcription factors with respect to their regulatory scope and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hör et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Another key factor involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation is ribonuclease E (RNase E), an essential enzyme in <italic>E. coli</italic> and related bacteria required for ribosome biogenesis and tRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mackie, 2013</xref>). RNase E’s role in sRNA-mediated expression control is manifold and includes the processing of sRNAs into functional regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dar and Sorek, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Papenfort et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Updegrove et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chao et al., 2012</xref>) as well as the degradation of target transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Massé et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morita et al., 2005</xref>). Inhibition of RNase E-mediated cleavage through sRNAs can stabilize the target transcript and activate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fröhlich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Papenfort et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Richards and Belasco, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Global transcriptome analyses have revealed the presence of numerous sRNAs produced from 3’ UTRs (untranslated regions) of mRNAs, a significant subset of which requires RNase E for their maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Storz, 2020</xref>). These 3’ UTR-derived sRNAs can be produced from monocistronic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chao and Vogel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grabowicz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) as well as long, operonic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Davis and Waldor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">De Mets et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miyakoshi et al., 2019</xref>) and typically act to regulate multiple target mRNAs in trans. The RNase E C-terminus also provides the scaffold for a large protein complex, called the degradosome, which in the major human pathogen, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, has recently been implicated in the turn-over of hypomodified tRNA species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kimura and Waldor, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The present work addresses the regulatory role of RNase E in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> at a genome-wide level. To this end, we generated a temperature-sensitive variant of RNase E in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and employed TIER-seq (transiently-inactivating-an-endoribonuclease-followed-by-RNA-seq) to globally map RNase E cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chao et al., 2017</xref>). Our analyses identified ~25,000 RNase E-sensitive sites and revealed the presence of numerous stable sRNAs originating from the 3’ UTR of coding sequences. Detailed analyses of two of these sRNAs, OppZ and CarZ, showed that 3’ UTR-derived sRNAs can act in an autoregulatory manner to reduce the expression of mRNAs produced from the same genetic locus. The molecular mechanism of sRNA-mediated gene autoregulation likely involves inhibition of translation initiation by the sRNA followed by Rho-dependent transcription termination. This setup directly links the regulatory activity of the sRNAs to their de novo synthesis, analogous to their transcription factor counterparts. However, we show that, in contrast to transcriptional regulators, autoregulatory RNAs can act at a subcistronic level to allow discoordinate operon expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TIER-seq analysis of <italic>V. cholerae</italic></title><p>The catalytic activity of RNase E (encoded by the <italic>rne</italic> gene) is critical for many bacteria, including <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cameron et al., 2008</xref>). To study the role of RNase E in this pathogen, we mutated the DNA sequence of the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> chromosome encoding leucine 68 of RNase E to phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This mutation is analogous to the originally described N3071 <italic>rne</italic><sup>TS</sup> isolate of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Apirion and Lassar, 1978</xref>) and exhibits full RNase E activity at permissive temperatures (30°C), but is rendered inactive under non-permissive temperatures (44°C). We validated our approach by monitoring the expression of two known substrates of RNase E in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>: A) 5S rRNA, which is processed by RNase E from the 9S precursor rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Papenfort et al., 2015b</xref>), and B) the MicX sRNA, which contains two RNase E cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Davis and Waldor, 2007</xref>). For both RNAs, transfer of the wild-type strain to 44°C only mildly effected their expression, whereas the equivalent procedure performed with the <italic>rne</italic><sup>TS</sup> strain led to the accumulation of the 9S precursor and the full-length MicX transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 1–2 vs. 3–4).

We obtained ~187 million reads from the twelve samples (corresponding to three biological replicates of each strain and condition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), resulting in ~98 million unique 5’ ends mapping to the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome.

We discovered that RNase E cleavage sites occur with a frequency of 2.8 (median)/6.3 (mean) sites per kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The majority of cleavage events occurs in coding sequences (~69.1%), followed by 5’ UTRs (~8.4%), antisense RNAs (~7.1%), 3’ UTRs (~5.3%), intergenic regions (~4.0%), and sRNAs (~0.6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). RNase E sites were slightly enriched around start and stop codons of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

CarZ binds Hfq in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and repression of <italic>carA::gfp</italic> by CarZ requires Hfq, possibly due to reduced CarZ levels in the <italic>hfq</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>).

Neither lack of <italic>oppZ</italic>, nor OppZ over-expression significantly affected OppA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).</p><p>Given the relatively mild effect of <italic>oppZ</italic> deficiency on steady-state OppB protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we next investigated the role of OppZ on the dynamics of OppABCDF expression. Specifically, transcription factor-controlled negative autoregulation has been reported to affect the response time of regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rosenfeld et al., 2002</xref>) and we speculated that sRNA-mediated feedback control could have a similar effect. To test this hypothesis, we employed a <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strain in which we replaced the native promoter upstream of the chromosomal <italic>oppA</italic> gene with the L-arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and monitored the kinetics of OppA and OppB production in wild-type and Δ<italic>oppZ</italic> cells before and at several time-points post induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Whereas OppA protein accumulated equally in wild-type and <italic>oppZ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), expression of OppB was significantly increased in Δ<italic>oppZ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This effect was most prominent at later stages after induction (&gt;30 min) and coincided with accumulation of OppZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Calculation of the OppB response time (50% of the maximal expression value) showed a significant delay in Δ<italic>oppZ</italic> cells (~78 min), when compared to the wild-type control (~52 min). We therefore conclude that alike transcription factors, autoregulatory sRNAs change the dynamics of their associated genes, however, in contrast to transcription factors, sRNAs act at the post-transcriptional level and can direct this effect towards a specific subgroup of genes within an operon.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Modified kinetics of gene induction by autoregulatory OppZ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of the <italic>opp</italic> operon including the <italic>oppA</italic>::3XFLAG and <italic>oppB</italic>::3XFLAG genes and the native <italic>oppZ</italic> gene (lanes 1–6) or an <italic>oppZ</italic> deletion (lanes 7–12) was induced from the pBAD promoter at late exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0) by the addition of L-arabinose (0.2% final conc.).

Transcriptomic data obtained from various microorganisms have shown that sRNAs are produced from almost all genomic loci and that the 3’ UTRs of coding genes are a hotspot for sRNAs acting through Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Storz, 2020</xref>). Expression of 3’ UTR-derived sRNAs can either occur by independent promoters, or by ribonucleolytic cleavage typically involving RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miyakoshi et al., 2015</xref>). In the latter case, production of the sRNA is intimately connected to the activity of the promoter driving the expression of the upstream mRNA, suggesting that the regulatory function of the sRNA is linked to the biological role of the associated genes. Indeed, such functional interdependence has now been demonstrated in several cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chao and Vogel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">De Mets et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miyakoshi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), however, it remained unclear if and how these sRNAs also affected their own transcripts. In this regard, OppZ and CarZ provide a paradigm for 3’ UTR-derived sRNAs allowing autoregulation at the post-transcriptional level. This new type of feedback inhibition is independent of auxiliary transcription factors and we could show that autoregulation by sRNAs can either involve the full transcript (CarZ), or act at the suboperonic level (OppZ).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Features of RNase E-mediated gene control</title><p>RNase E is a principal factor for RNA turnover in almost all Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bandyra and Luisi, 2018</xref>). The protein forms a tetramer in vivo and serves as the scaffold for the degradosome, a large, multi-enzyme complex typically containing the phosphorolytic exoribonuclease PNPase, the RNA-helicase RhlB, and the glycolytic enzyme enolase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aït-Bara and Carpousis, 2015</xref>). Substrates of RNase E are preferentially AU-rich and harbor a 5’ mono-phosphate. Thus, the enzyme relies on RNA pyrophosphohydrolases such as RppH, which convert the 5’ terminus from a triphosphate to a monophosphate, before transcript degradation can be initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deana et al., 2008</xref>). Recognition of a substrate is followed by scanning of RNase E for suitable cleavage sites along the transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Richards and Belasco, 2019</xref>). TIER-seq-based identification of a consensus sequence for RNase E target recognition revealed highly similar motifs for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and <italic>S. enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chao et al., 2017</xref>). These results further support the previously proposed ‘U<sub>+2</sub> Ruler-and-Cut’ mechanism, in which a conserved uridine located two nts down-stream of the cleavage site is key for RNase E activity. However, in contrast to the data obtained from <italic>S. enterica</italic>, we discovered only a mild enrichment of RNase E cleavage sites occurring at translational stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

BCM treatment of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> wild-type cells revealed 699 differentially regulated genes (549 upregulated and 150 repressed genes; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3A</xref>), suggesting an equally global role for Rho in this organism. Rho-dependent transcription termination is modulated by various additional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mitra et al., 2017</xref>). This includes anti-termination factors such as NusG, as well as Hfq and its associated sRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bossi et al., 2020</xref>). For sRNAs, the effect on Rho activity can be either activating or repressing. Previous work has shown that sRNAs can mask Rho-dependent termination sites and thereby promote transcriptional read-through (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sedlyarova et al., 2016</xref>). Negative gene regulation involving sRNAs and Rho typically includes translation inhibition by the sRNA resulting in separation of transcription and translation complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Coupling of transcription and translation normally protects the nascent mRNA from Rho action and loss of ribosome binding supports transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bossi et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, lack of ribosome-mediated protection can render the mRNA target vulnerable to ribonucleases, <italic>e.g.</italic> RNase E, which can also lead to the degradation of the sRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Feng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Massé et al., 2003</xref>). Which of these mechanisms are at play for a given sRNA-target mRNA pair is most often unknown and it is likely that both types of regulation can occur either independently or in concert. For example, over-expression of OppZ did not affect <italic>oppB</italic> transcript stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that induction of Rho-mediated transcription termination is the main mechanism for gene repression in this sRNA-target mRNA pair. In contrast, analogous experiments testing the stability of the <italic>carA</italic> and <italic>carB</italic> transcripts upon CarZ over-expression revealed a significant drop in transcript stability for both mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). These results suggest that translation inhibition of <italic>carA</italic> by CarZ has two outcomes: 1<sup>st</sup>) accelerated ribonucleolytic decay of the <italic>carAB</italic> transcript and 2<sup>nd</sup>) Rho-mediated transcription termination. Using two regulatory mechanisms (CarZ-<italic>carA</italic>) instead of one (OppZ-<italic>oppB</italic>) might explain the strong inhibition of <italic>carA::gfp</italic> by CarZ (~10 fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), when compared to the relatively weak repression (1.8-fold) of <italic>oppB::gfp</italic> by OppZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of the OppZ-dependent mechanism of <italic>opp</italic> regulation.</title><p>Transcription of the <italic>oppABCDF</italic> operon initiates upstream of <italic>oppA</italic> and in the absence of OppZ (left) involves all genes of the operon as well as OppZ.

In fact, sRNAs frequently repress genes that are downstream in an operon with their base-pairing target, which could point to a possible involvement of Rho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bossi et al., 2020</xref>). Rho is known to bind cytosine-rich RNA elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allfano et al., 1991</xref>), however, due to the strong variability in size and composition of these sequences, predicting Rho binding sites (a.k.a. <italic>rut</italic> sites) from genomic or transcriptomic data has been a difficult task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nadiras et al., 2018</xref>).

Identifying the relevant exonucleases might well allow for an advanced annotation of global Rho-dependent termination sites and cross-comparison with documented sRNA-target interaction could help to clarify the relevance of Rho-mediated termination in sRNA-based gene control.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Dynamics of RNA-based feedback regulation</title><p>Transcription factors and sRNAs are the principal components of gene networks. While the regulatory outcome of sRNA and transcription factor activity is often very similar, the underlying regulatory dynamics are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hussein and Lim, 2012</xref>). Regulatory networks involving sRNAs and transcription factors are called mixed circuits and have now been studied in greater detail. Similar to systems relying on transcription factors, feedback regulation is common among sRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nitzan et al., 2017</xref>). However, unlike the examples presented in this study, these circuits always involve the action of a transcription factor, which has implications for their regulatory dynamics. For example, the OmpR transcription factor activates the expression of the OmrA/B sRNAs, which repress their own synthesis by inhibiting the <italic>ompR-envZ</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guillier and Gottesman, 2008</xref>). This constitutes an autoregulatory loop, however, given that transcription of OmrA/B ultimately relies on OmpR protein levels, this regulation will only become effective when sufficient OmpR turn-over has been achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brosse et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, autoregulatory circuits involving 3’ UTR-derived sRNAs are independent of such auxiliary factors and therefore provide a more rapid response. In case of OppZ-<italic>oppB</italic>, we showed that the sRNA has a rapid effect on OppB expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) and given the involvement of Rho-mediated transcription termination in this process, we expect similar dynamics for OppZ autoregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Another key difference between feedback regulation by transcription factors and 3’ UTR-derived sRNAs is the stoichiometry of the players involved. In transcription factor-based feedback loops, the mRNA coding for the autoregulatory transcription factor can go through multiple rounds of translation, which will lead to an excess of the regulator over the target promoter. The degree of autoregulation is then determined by the cellular concentration of the transcription factor and the affinity towards its own promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rosenfeld et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, autoregulatory sRNAs which are generated by ribonucleolytic cleavage come at a 1:1 stoichiometry with their targets. However, this situation changes when the sRNA controls multiple targets. For OppZ, we have shown that <italic>oppBCDF</italic> is the only transcript regulated by the sRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and we currently do not know if CarZ has additional targets besides <italic>carAB</italic>. In addition, not all sRNA-target interactions result in changes in transcript levels as previously reported for the interaction of the Qrr sRNAs with the <italic>luxO</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Feng et al., 2015</xref>). New technologies, for example RIL-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Melamed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Melamed et al., 2016</xref>), capturing the global interactome of base-pairing sRNAs independent of their regulatory state could help to address this question and clarify the stoichiometric requirements for sRNA-mediated autoregulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Possible biological relevance of autoregulatory sRNAs</title><p>Autoregulation by 3’ UTR-derived sRNAs allows for discoordinate operon expression, which is in contrast to their transcription factor counterparts. This feature might be particularly relevant for long mRNAs containing multiple cistrons, such as <italic>oppABCDF</italic>. The <italic>oppABCDF</italic> genes encode an ABC transporter allowing high affinity oligopeptide uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hiles et al., 1987</xref>). OppBCDF constitute the membrane-bound, structural components of the transport system, whereas OppA functions as a periplasmic binding protein.

RNA regulators are modular, versatile, highly programmable, and therefore ideal candidates for synthetic biology approaches. Similarly, autoregulatory loops using transcriptional repressors find ample use in synthetic regulatory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afroz and Beisel, 2013</xref>). While it might be counterintuitive for a transcript to also produce its own repressor, negative feedback regulation has been reported to endow regulatory networks with improved robustness when disturbances to the system are imposed. Hfq-binding sRNAs providing feedback control have recently also been demonstrated to efficiently replace transcriptional regulation in artificial genetic circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kelly et al., 2018</xref>). However, these sRNAs were produced from separate genes and therefore required additional transcriptional input, which increases noise. In contrast, the autoregulatory sRNAs presented here are produced by ribonucleolytic cleavage and we have shown that both OppZ and CarZ are efficiently clipped off from foreign genes, such as <italic>gfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We therefore propose that autoregulatory sRNAs can be attached to the 3’ UTR of other genes as well, offering a simple and highly modular concept to introduce autoregulation into a biological system. These circuits can be further tuned by modifying the base-pairing strength of the RNA duplex formed between the sRNA and the target, as well as the introduction of Rho-dependent termination events. The latter could be used to avoid over-production of the sRNA, which will further shape the regulatory dynamics of the system.

The values were computed using the function ‘corr’ of the pandas Dataframe class (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3509134">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3509134</ext-link>).

Cells were harvested after 15 min by addition of 0.2 volumes of stop mix (95% ethanol, 5% (v/v) phenol) and snap‐frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated and digested with TURBO DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Ribosomal RNA was depleted using the Ribo-Zero kit for Gram-negative bacteria (#MRZGN126; Illumina, San Diego, California) and RNA integrity was confirmed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Directional cDNA libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (#E7760; NEB). The libraries were sequenced using a HiSeq 1500 System in single‐read mode for 100 cycles. The read files in FASTQ format were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench v11 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011853">SCR_011853</ext-link>; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and trimmed for quality and 3’ adaptors.

Reads mapping in CDS were counted, and genes with a total count cut-off &gt;15 in all samples were considered for analysis. Read counts were normalized (CPM), and transformed (log2). Differential expression was tested using the built-in tool corresponding to edgeR in exact mode with tagwise dispersions (‘Empirical Analysis of DGE’). Genes with a fold change ≥3.0 and an FDR-adjusted p-value≤0.05 were considered as differentially expressed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA-seq analysis: Bicyclomycin-dependent transcriptomes</title><p><italic>V. cholerae oppA</italic>::3XFLAG <italic>oppB</italic>::3XFLAG <italic>oppF</italic>::3XFLAG strains with wild-type or mutated <italic>oppB</italic> start codon were grown in biological triplicates to OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.5, divided in half and treated with either bicyclomycin (25 μg/ml final conc.) or water. Cells were harvested after 120 min by addition of 0.2 volumes of stop mix (95% ethanol, 5% (v/v) phenol) and snap‐frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated and digested with TURBO DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA libraries were prepared by vertis Biotechnology AG in a 3’ end-specific protocol: ribosomal RNA was depleted and the Illumina 5’ sequencing adaptor was ligated to the 3’ OH end of RNA molecules. First strand synthesis using M-MLV reverse transcriptase was followed by fragmentation and strand-specific ligation of the Illumina 3’ sequencing adaptor to the 3’ end of first-strand cDNA. Finally, 3’ cDNA fragments were amplified, purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP kit (Beckman Coulter Genomics) and sequenced using a NextSeq 500 system in single-read mode for 75 cycles.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Joe Wade as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All the reviewers found the work to be of high quality, and were excited by the discovery of autoregulation of 3' UTR-derived sRNAs. The one aspect where we felt the data fell short of supporting the conclusions relates to the mechanism of autoregulation. Specifically, we felt that more experimental evidence is needed to support the idea that OppZ repression of oppB translation leads to Rho termination within oppB. The data clearly demonstrate Rho termination when the oppB start codon is mutated, but there are insufficient data to conclude that repression of oppB by OppZ has the same effect, especially in light of published data suggesting that translational repression needs to be strong to permit Rho termination (PMID: 19059415). As detailed below, it should be straightforward to experimentally test this model more rigorously. You should also respond to the other reviewer's comments, none of which require additional experiments.</p><p>Essential revision requiring new experimental data:</p><p>Provide additional experimental support for the model in which OppZ represses translation of oppB, leading to premature Rho termination. Specifically, test whether OppZ represses its own expression when BCM is added. As an example, you could repeat the experiment shown in Figure 4B but with BCM added. It would be useful to look at RNA levels of several opp genes, including oppB and oppZ, and OppB protein levels.</p><p>Essential revisions not requiring new experimental data:</p><p>1) Show the RNA-seq data from Figure 3 for the opp operon. You would expect that overexpression of OppZ leads to a decrease in RNA levels from a position within oppB to the end of the operon (except for oppZ, which was overexpressed), but no change in oppA levels.</p><p>2) Soften the conclusions regarding CarZ. Evidence for autoregulation is strong, but, the model involving Rho is premature, and should be framed as speculation.</p><p>3) Briefly discuss the possibility that the M2 mutation that is intended to prevent OppZ processing may also disrupt base-pairing with oppB.</p><p>4) Briefly discuss the differences in time-points used in Figure 1A and TIER-seq. The inactivation of the RNase-TS after 30 min incubation at the nonpermissive temperature shown in Figure 1A does not appear to be very effective given the very modest reduction in 9S processing to 5S rRNA as compared to that observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Babitzke and Kushner. PNAS 88:1-5) or more recently in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> by Chao et al. (Cell 65: 39-51). Moreover, the results in Figure 1A serve to justify the approach used in the rest of the figure, yet the time points are very different from those chosen for the TIER-seq approach presumably for the reasons mentioned above.</p><p>5) Change the title, which is currently too vague.

We have previously attempted to perform the requested experiment, however, we discovered that certain plasmids (including the plasmids carrying a p15a origin of replication used in Figure 4B) are incompatible with BCM treatment. This observation is in line with previous reports showing that Rho is required for plasmid maintenance and suppression of Rho activity causes plasmid-mediated lethality (see PMID: 12946345). To overcome this caveat, we cloned the <italic>oppZregulator</italic> gene onto an established pSC101-based plasmid carrying a <italic>repA</italic> E93K mutation (see PMID: 18295880) that yields a copy number comparable to the previously used p15a plasmids (this origin of replication did not cause lethality upon BCM treatment). We confirmed that OppZ expression from this construct resulted in a significant drop in OppB protein, <italic>oppBCDF</italic> mRNA, and OppZ levels, while the <italic>oppA</italic> mRNA and OppA protein production was constant. Addition of BCM to these samples led to increased <italic>oppBCDF</italic> mRNA and OppZ levels. As expected, OppB protein levels remained repressed due to continued inhibition of translation initiation by OppZ. Again, <italic>oppA</italic> mRNA and OppA did not show significant changes in expression in response to BCM. These new data are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 of our revised manuscript. In addition, we extended the text in the Results section of our manuscript (subsection “OppZ promotes transcription termination through Rho”) to accommodate these new results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions not requiring new experimental data:</p><p>1) Show the RNA-seq data from Figure 3 for the opp operon.

Of note, we did not detect OppZ in the RNA-seq experiment due to a limitation of the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit, which fails to detect short transcripts such as OppZ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Soften the conclusions regarding CarZ. Evidence for autoregulation is strong, but, the model involving Rho is premature, and should be framed as speculation.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have rephrased wording of the respective paragraph in the Results section. We now write: “Together, these results provide evidence that CarZ is an autoregulatory sRNA and suggest that this function might be more wide-spread among the growing class of 3’ UTRderived sRNAs.” We also changed text in the Abstract and the Introduction section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Briefly discuss the possibility that the M2 mutation that is intended to prevent OppZ processing may also disrupt base-pairing with oppB.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. In our revised manuscript (Figure 3C), we now show that OppZ carrying mutation M2, when expressed from a separate plasmid, efficiently inhibits OppB::GFP production. We also updated the text in the Results section accordingly (subsection “Feedback autoregulation at the suboperonic level”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Briefly discuss the differences in time-points used in Figure 1A and TIER-seq.

To address this inconsistency among the experiments, we repeated the experiments shown in Figure 1A and extended the time for RNase E deactivation to 60 minutes. We obtained very similar results and thus updated this figure (and the relevant text in the figure legend) in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Change the title, which is currently too vague.
