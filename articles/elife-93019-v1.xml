We analyzed previously published AML relapse cohorts and found that 40% of relapses occur without changes in driver mutations, suggesting that non-genetic mechanisms drive relapse in a large proportion of cases. We therefore characterized epigenetic patterns of AML relapse using 26 matched diagnosis-relapse samples with ATAC-seq. This analysis identified a relapse-specific chromatin accessibility signature for mutationally stable AML, suggesting that AML undergoes epigenetic evolution at relapse independent of mutational changes. Analysis of leukemia stem cell (LSC) chromatin changes at relapse indicated that this leukemic compartment underwent significantly less epigenetic evolution than non-LSCs, while epigenetic changes in non-LSCs reflected overall evolution of the bulk leukemia. Finally, we used single-cell ATAC-seq paired with mitochondrial sequencing (mtscATAC) to map clones from diagnosis into relapse along with their epigenetic features. We found that distinct mitochondrially-defined clones exhibit more similar chromatin accessibility at relapse relative to diagnosis, demonstrating convergent epigenetic evolution in relapsed AML. These results demonstrate that epigenetic evolution is a feature of relapsed AML and that convergent epigenetic evolution can occur following treatment with induction chemotherapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (or AML for short) is a type of blood cancer characterized by abnormally high production of immature white blood cells. Despite advances in AML treatment, many patients relapse after an initially successful first round of treatment. As a result, understanding the factors contributing to relapse is essential for developing effective treatments for the disease.</p><p>Like most cancers, AML can evolve because of changes to the DNA sequence in cells that cause them to grow uncontrollably or resist treatment. Alongside these genetic mutations, AML cells also undergo ‘epigenetic’ changes, where regions of the DNA are modified and genes can be switched on or off without altering the DNA sequence. Previous research has demonstrated that epigenetic changes contribute to the development of AML, however, it was not clear if these changes could also make cells resistant to treatment without acquiring new DNA mutations.</p><p>Nuno, Azizi et al. addressed this question by analyzing the epigenetic states of AML cells from 26 patients at the time of their diagnosis and after treatment when the disease had relapsed. Analysis revealed that almost half of the patients with AML experienced a relapse without acquiring new DNA mutations. Instead, these AML cells developed specific epigenetic changes that helped them to resist cancer treatment. Moreover, studying individual AML cells from different patients showed that the cells became more epigenetically similar at relapse, suggesting that they converge towards a more treatment-resistant disease.</p><p>Future experiments will determine exactly how these epigenetic changes lead to treatment resistance. Currently, most of the drugs used to treat AML are either chemotherapies or ones that target specific DNA mutations. The findings of Nuno, Azizi et al. suggest that drugs targeting specific epigenetic changes may be more effective for some patients. Further studies will be needed to determine which patients may benefit and which epigenetic drugs could be useful.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>acute myeloid leukemia</kwd><kwd>relapse</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001422</institution-id><institution>American Society of Hematology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Azizi</surname><given-names>Armon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005189</institution-id><institution>Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koehnke</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lareau</surname><given-names>Caleb</given-names></name><name><surname>Corces</surname><given-names>M Ryan</given-names></name><name><surname>Satpathy</surname><given-names>Ansuman T</given-names></name><name><surname>Majeti</surname><given-names>Ravindra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01CA251331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Majeti</surname><given-names>Ravindra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG012579</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lareau</surname><given-names>Caleb</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG012076</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lareau</surname><given-names>Caleb</given-names></name><name><surname>Corces</surname><given-names>M Ryan</given-names></name><name><surname>Satpathy</surname><given-names>Ansuman T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Integrated analyses of acute myeloid leukemia genetics and epigenetics demonstrate that epigenetic evolution occurs in a convergent manner in the absence of DNA mutations at relapse post-chemotherapy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a blood cancer characterized by the accumulation of dysfunctional myeloid progenitors, resulting in severe cytopenias and an overall poor prognosis, especially in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Döhner et al., 2015</xref>). Despite recent advances in AML treatment, most patients relapse with aggressive disease that is highly resistant to further treatment. Relapse therefore presents a significant challenge for AML clinicians due to the lack of efficacious salvage options making it critical to study AML relapse to guide and improve outcomes.</p><p>Cancer progression is generally understood as an evolutionary process with certain cellular subpopulations containing genetic and other features that allow for improved fitness and growth. There is often substantial subclonal genetic heterogeneity in cancer, with a dominant clone comprising the bulk of the tumor with accompanying smaller subclones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akbani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koboldt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">The Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). Leukemia can persist after treatment during clinical remission as measurable residual disease (MRD) which is an independent risk factor for relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, whole-genome resequencing efforts have indicated that in many cases, clonal evolution at relapse results from the dynamic outgrowth of these resistant clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hassan et al., 2017</xref>). These data underscore the importance of characterizing the clonal dynamics of AML evolution to better understand how these cells evolve over time and contribute to relapse and chemoresistance.</p><p>According to the cancer stem cell model, AML is thought to be organized in a hierarchical manner, with transformed leukemia stem cells (LSCs) possessing long-term self-renewal capability giving rise to partially differentiated leukemia cells (non-LSCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thomas and Majeti, 2017</xref>). The role of LSCs in relapse is poorly understood, and future studies seeking to understand relapsed AML will require investigating how these cells contribute to disease recurrence. These studies are especially important given the lack of therapies that specifically target LSCs.</p><p>Recent genomic sequencing efforts have identified various classes of recurrent mutations in AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tyner et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, these studies implicate epigenetic regulators as key factors in AML pathogenesis, including DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2, ASXL1, and the cohesin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan and Majeti, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delhommeau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gross et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Wahab et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kon et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, epigenetic dysregulation is now known to be a distinctive hallmark of AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu and Shilatifard, 2016</xref>). Studies analyzing the transformation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into LSCs suggest epigenetic dysregulation is an initiating event in leukemic clonal evolution, and many mutations in epigenetic regulators persist between diagnosis and relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corces-Zimmerman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shlush et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>It is increasingly apparent that chromatin accessibility and its three-dimensional landscape are important factors in cancer pathogenesis and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corces and Corces, 2016</xref>). Recent studies profiling the chromatin landscape of certain cancers indicate that the fine regulation of chromatin activity is critical for tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hnisz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavahan et al., 2016</xref>). Analyses of active epigenetic programs in healthy hematopoietic and leukemic cells implicate epigenetic factors, including distal <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements and transcription factors, as critical features driving AML, with differential activation of regulatory chromatin programs defining disease subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corces et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McKeown et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, common AML mutations in transcription factors and RAS/RTK signaling have downstream activity on trans regulatory factors like NFkB, highlighting the importance of epigenetic regulatory elements in maintaining the balance of transcriptional programs required for proper cellular identity and preventing leukemic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corces et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assi et al., 2019</xref>). Cytosine methylation states have also been shown to evolve independently of genetic mutations in relapsed AML, indicating that epigenetic changes can occur with leukemia progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2016</xref>). We hypothesize that examining chromatin accessibility to infer cancer gene regulatory programs and cancer-specific properties is a useful tool for uncovering novel biology in AML progression and relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rosenbauer and Tenen, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report a longitudinal study of paired diagnosis-relapse AML patient samples to characterize mechanisms of AML relapse. We first interrogated previously published genotyping studies of relapsed AML to understand clonal evolution of somatic driver mutations and found a large proportion of cases lack mutational changes at relapse, suggesting that epigenetic evolution could be a driving factor in relapse. We then performed chromatin accessibility analysis to identify regulatory mechanisms associated with AML relapse in mutationally stable cases and further performed single-cell chromatin analysis to investigate epigenetic subclones and evolution in primary patient samples. These studies reveal that individual diagnosis clones persist and acquire similar epigenetic features and states in relapse, demonstrating convergent epigenetic evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A large proportion of relapsed AMLs lack mutational evolution</title><p>To define the genetic landscape underlying AML relapse, we analyzed published genotyping studies of paired diagnosis and relapse samples. We collected data from seven different cohorts with genome resequencing of AML-related mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tyner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greif et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shlush et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parkin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rothenberg-Thurley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stratmann et al., 2021</xref>). For each patient, we collected mutation variant allele frequency (VAF), karyotype, time to relapse, and overall survival when available. This resulted in a dataset containing 2111 mutations across 216 patients at paired diagnosis and relapse timepoints.</p><p>Recurrently mutated genes within this cohort were consistent with previous studies with NPM1, DNMT3A, FLT3, RUNX1, and TET2 being among the most frequently mutated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We previously showed that genes associated with epigenetic regulation such as DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2, and ASLX1 are pre-leukemic mutations that accumulate in HSCs and initiate leukemogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corces-Zimmerman et al., 2014</xref>). The VAF of mutations in epigenetic regulators was overall stable at relapse, consistent with the idea that these mutations are founder events occurring early during AML evolution and suggesting that the persistence of these mutations may play a role in AML resistance and progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

Notably, 93 cases (43%) exhibited stable mutation profiles at relapse. There were no significant differences in these clonal group frequencies across individual genes, and there was no clear enrichment of specific epigenetic mutations such as DNMT3A, TET2, or IDH1/2 in our stable samples, indicating that clonal evolution categories are unlikely to be driven by or associated with specific mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>).

We sought to identify such non-genetic factors playing a role in the evolution of the different genomic clonal evolution groups.

The different clonal groups showed varying levels of epigenetic change at relapse. Notably, relapsed samples with stable clonal evolution were epigenetically dissimilar to their diagnosis counterparts suggesting that epigenetic evolution may drive relapse in these cases. In addition, samples with both gain and loss of mutations showed substantial epigenetic changes at relapse which may be attributable to mutational changes occurring in these samples and/or to epigenetic factors (Mean DX-REL correlation: Stable-0.914, Gain-0.929, Loss-0.950, Gain +Loss−0.802). Collectively, these data suggest that epigenetic evolution may drive relapse in AML, particularly in cases that do not acquire or lose mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cell cycle and metabolic pathways of epigenetic evolution underlie relapse in mutationally stable AML</title><p>The clonally stable group exhibited substantial chromatin accessibility changes at relapse suggesting that epigenetic evolution may contribute to resistance in these cases. To identify the specific regulatory elements and pathways involved, we identified regions of chromatin accessibility that were enriched or depleted at relapse in mutationally stable AMLs. Of 115,551 features in the global peak set, 2373 peaks were enriched and 6145 peaks were depleted across all stable samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). To identify chromatin changes localized to specific gene loci, we generated chromatin accessibility ‘gene accessibility scores’ across all samples. This approach has been shown to predict the relative RNA expression of individual genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Granja et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Granja et al., 2021</xref>). We therefore used these scores to identify differentially accessible genes across stable samples with the underlying hypothesis that differential chromatin accessibility may act as a proxy for transcriptomic changes in these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e and f</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Granja et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Granja et al., 2021</xref>).

Differentially accessible genes in stable samples were not significantly differentially accessible in non-stable samples (AMLs that gained and/or lost mutations at relapse), indicating that mutationally stable samples undergo specific epigenetic evolution distinct from other AMLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). We additionally evaluated whether relapse accessibility changes were specific to certain mutational groups based on our genotyping data. For the genes FLT3, TET2, DNMT3A, and NPM1 (genes with more than five mutant cases), we did not find any chromatin loci with evolution at relapse that was significantly different between mutant and wildtype cases.</p><p>To analyze the association between chromosomal regions and genes that were found to be differentially accessible across stable samples, we searched for chromosomal loci with a higher proportion of either significantly enriched or depleted peaks relative to the global peak set with the hypothesis that large regions of chromosomal accessibility change may represent copy number alterations or changes in topologically associated domain activity associated with relapse. We found that certain genomic loci displayed a widespread increase in average accessibility at relapse paired with increased accessibility of specific genes in those regions. This was in contrast to the rest of the genome where average accessibility and gene accessibility change at relapse were not correlated. For example, chromosome 6 contained a region of increased relapse accessibility spanning approximately 100 kb which contained numerous histone and cell-cycle-associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). These locations may represent regions of co-regulated chromatin which evolve to allow for resistance and relapse.</p><p>We performed gene set enrichment analysis of genes with increased accessibility at relapse in stable samples and found enrichment of pathways associated with increased cell cycling, metabolism, and cell stress responses. These pathways were consistent with increased aggressiveness of relapsed AML and a response to genotoxic chemotherapy, as well as chromatin regulators, histones, and targets of transcription factors such as MYC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). We additionally examined transcription factor motif enrichment within differentially accessible chromatin peaks to identify <italic>trans</italic> regulatory factors important in mutationally stable relapse samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). We found depletion of AP1 family motifs, such as FOS and JUN, which have been demonstrated to be important in various genetically defined subtypes of AML, as well as CEBPA and SPI1, both critical regulators of myeloid cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assi et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, we observed an enrichment of FOXO family factors in the stable relapse samples, as well as the GATA family (known regulators of early progenitors in hematopoietic development) and E2F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rosenbauer and Tenen, 2007</xref>). These results suggest differential transcription factor activity and activation of relapse-specific biological pathways in mutationally stable relapse cases.</p><p>We then utilized healthy hematopoietic cell type chromatin profiles to identify the closest normal cell type for AML samples. We previously used the CIBERSORT algorithm to quantify the cell type contribution to overall AML chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corces et al., 2016</xref>). A follow-up study utilized latent semantic indexing projection of either single-cell ATAC or pseudo-single-cell ATAC (derived from bulk ATAC profiles) to healthy hematopoietic single-cell ATAC data to identify the closest normal cell type for single-cell ATAC profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Granja et al., 2019</xref>). We applied the latter, single-cell specific, methodology to our data in order to identify the closest normal cell types for diagnosis and relapse samples and by proxy, the differentiation status of these AMLs as determined by their chromatin state. Briefly, for each bulk AML sample, a ‘pseudo-single cell’ ATAC-seq dataset was generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Granja et al., 2019</xref>). This pseudo-single cell data was then projected to a reference of healthy hematopoietic ATAC-seq data, and each pseudo-single cell was assigned the closest normal cell type using a k-nearest neighbors clustering approach <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>. The closest normal cell types for diagnosis and relapse pairs were then compared across samples. This analysis revealed that at diagnosis, most AMLs mapped to different regions within the myeloid/monocyte compartment and that at relapse, AMLs overall became less differentiated with chromatin reflecting a more CMP/GMP/progenitor-like cell state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Evaluating individual cases showed that every sample which was myeloid/monocyte-like at diagnosis became less differentiated at relapse and that samples that were progenitor-like at diagnosis generally stayed within that compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c, d and e</xref>). These analyses indicate that the overall chromatin state of relapsed AML becomes less differentiated, which may result in epigenetic fitness associated with drug resistance and increased proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Epigenetic evolution at relapse is primarily driven by non-leukemic stem cell populations</title><p>Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are thought to be of critical importance in AML relapse, serving as a chemoresistant self-renewing reservoir for disease propagation after initial therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thomas and Majeti, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jordan, 2007</xref>).

The stable sample bulk AML relapse signature was strikingly similar to the LSC signature at diagnosis, indicating that a significant proportion of the epigenetic changes observed at relapse are due to changes in LSC frequency or evolution of non-LSC cells toward a more LSC-like state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>To examine the LSC-specific pathways involving differentially accessible genes within these cells, we performed GSEA using our gene score data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).

In patients SU360 (SF3B1 and KMT2D mutant secondary AML), SU484 (IDH1/FLT3-ITD/NPM1 mutant), and SU892 (RUNX1-mutant/FLT3-TKD), there were substantial epigenetic differences between diagnosis and relapse, along with significant heterogeneity within each timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

To further determine whether cellular subsets at diagnosis harbored relapse-like epigenetic states, we scored each cell from our single-cell ATAC-seq data using the relapse signature determined from our clonally stable bulk ATAC-seq cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), and evaluated if it was enriched in any diagnosis cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). As expected, relapse cells in patients SU360, SU484, and SU892 were enriched for the relapse signature to a significantly greater degree than diagnosis cells. Notably, in these three cases, subpopulations of cells were identified at diagnosis that harbored the relapse signature at levels comparable to the relapse cells. These results suggest that intercellular epigenetic heterogeneity and evolution may be mechanisms contributing to relapsed AML.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Single-cell ATAC-seq reveals relapsed AML cell state evolution</title><p>Next, we sought to determine how AML differentiation states changed at relapse at the single-cell level. We utilized latent semantic index projection to map AML scATAC-seq data onto a reference constructed from healthy hematopoietic cell scATAC data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>). Each AML cell was classified based on the healthy hematopoietic cell type to which it mapped closest in epigenetic space according to this projection. We found that the differentiation status of each AML sample broadly reflected the results obtained from our analyses of bulk AML profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c–d</xref>). However, single-cell mapping allowed for a significantly more granular identification of the differentiation status for all AML subpopulations in each sample. Significantly, the differentiation status as determined by the closest normal cell type changed substantially at relapse with cells either becoming more HSPC-like or mapping to a different hematopoietic lineage altogether. Consistent with our bulk data and with what we expected for a myeloid disease, patient SU484 mapped to the myeloid compartment at diagnosis, and at relapse became substantially more immature with most relapse cells becoming CMP/LMPP-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2e</xref>). Patient SU892 diagnosis cells also largely mapped to the myeloid lineage, but the relapse cells interestingly appeared to project onto more dendritic/basophil and erythroid-like states, perhaps reflecting an overall more neomorphic relapsed cell state than could be mapped onto one cell-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2f</xref>). Interestingly, case SU360 showed substantial epigenetic differences between diagnosis and relapse when comparing global AML profiles in both the bulk and single-cell data with an increase in the fraction of cells mapping to the DC/Basophil-like compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2d</xref>). Altogether, these data show that the epigenetic-based lineage status of AML subpopulations can change dramatically at relapse and that modulation of cell-type specific epigenetic programs is associated with relapse.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Mitochondrial single-cell ATAC-seq reveals intracellular and convergent evolution in mutationally stable AML at relapse</title><p>Our initial single-cell ATAC-seq experiments provided evidence that there was substantial epigenetic change within, and possible selection of, AML subclones unrelated to somatic mutation change. To definitively identify the subclonal chromatin changes occurring within these subpopulations at relapse, we employed mitochondrial single-cell ATAC-seq (mtscATAC-seq), a technique which leverages genetic variants accumulating naturally within the mitochondrial genome as an endogenous barcode to track cell populations while simultaneously capturing their chromatin accessibility profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lareau et al., 2021</xref>). We performed mtscATAC-seq on the 10 X Chromium platform using FACS-purified AML blasts from the four patients interrogated above. With this method, we were able to link AML subclones defined by mitochondrial mutations (henceforth referred to as ‘mitoclones’) between diagnosis and relapse, evaluate clonal dynamics, and identify epigenetic differences between mitoclones within and between timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Importantly, these mitoclones were identified agnostic of any somatic mutations previously characterized in these samples, allowing for the unbiased evaluation of subclonal dynamics in samples with no significant change in driver mutational profile at relapse.

In samples SU142, SU360, and SU892, 95% of the AML cells at diagnosis and relapse constituted 3–4 mitoclones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Reconstruction of mitoclone evolution during therapy showed that at relapse, mitoclone dynamics were stable with no significant change in the size of mitochondrially defined clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Importantly, many of the mitoclones were epigenetically distinct from one another at diagnosis, indicating that different epigenetic programs were active across these populations at diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).</p><p>To determine how epigenetic profiles changed between individual mitoclones at relapse, we calculated the global epigenetic similarity between all diagnosis mitoclones and separately, calculated the epigenetic similarity between all relapse mitoclones. In the genomically stable samples, there was a significant change in the bulk AML epigenetic profile at relapse, with relapse mitoclones overall clustering separately from diagnosis mitoclones. Additionally, mitoclones at relapse were epigenetically more similar to each other than mitoclones at diagnosis in two of three stable samples evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). When taken together, these two observations suggest that all relapse mitoclones evolve toward a distinct epigenetic state while also becoming epigenetically more similar to each other, demonstrating convergent epigenetic evolution in these populations.</p><p>We further evaluated epigenetic change across all genomic features between specific mitoclones. In SU360, for example, mitoclone 1 and mitoclone 2, clones with distinct evolutionary origins, showed similar patterns of accessibility change at relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). These data support the idea that single AML cells give rise to lineage-biased and epigenetically distinct subclones that may contribute to resistance and relapse independent of genomic alterations. In addition, intracellular epigenetic evolution can occur across AML subclones with convergent epigenetic evolution of distinct AML clones in patients with stable genomic profiles at relapse.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Mitochondrial single-cell ATAC-seq reveals evolution of epigenetically distinct AML subpopulations at relapse</title><p>We further utilized mitochondrial tracing to profile the clonal and epigenetic profile of SU484, a case in which a FLT3 point mutation detected at diagnosis was lost and a FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) was gained at relapse. While the stable samples profiled had relatively simple mitochondrial clonal heterogeneity, clonal structure was considerably more complex in SU484. We identified 12 mitoclones that underwent various levels of selection, elimination, and outgrowth, and which had distinctive epigenetic profiles at both diagnosis and relapse, reflecting a subclonal heterogeneity not evident through the investigation of somatic driver mutations and their dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>). Mitoclone 2, present at a frequency of 0.2% at diagnosis was selected, making up 36% of the AML cells at relapse, reflecting the selection of a clone likely associated with the FLT3-ITD driver mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The small number of detectable mitoclone 2 cells at diagnosis were epigenetically distinct from other clones, suggesting that this clone contained a more favorable epigenetic state amenable to selection following therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>). At relapse, mitoclone 2 cells became epigenetically distinct from mitoclone 2 cells at diagnosis, indicating that there was both selection for and evolution of this clone during therapy. On the other hand, several diagnosis mitoclones in SU484 appeared to undergo negative selection including mitoclones 1, 3, and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>). While these ‘unfit’ clones were distinct in their origins, they contained similar epigenetic profiles at diagnosis associated with their elimination at relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>).</p><p>To further explore epigenetic differences between mitoclones, we mapped SU484 cells to the healthy hematopoietic reference and identified the closest normal cell type for different clones. Strikingly, certain clone-defining mitochondrial variants were lineage biased. In SU484, one mitochondrial clone/variant was restricted to the myeloid compartment while others were distinctly progenitor-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Notably, mitoclone #2 that expanded at relapse was progenitor-like at diagnosis. In the stable samples with no mitoclone changes, mitoclones did not display lineage bias with diffuse mapping across multiple lineages in the hierarchy.</p><p>We additionally scored different mitoclones using our previously identified relapse signature and found that in all relapse samples, all clones displayed higher relapse-signature scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, in SU484, clone 0 and 2 which survived and expanded at relapse respectively had epigenetic states at diagnosis with higher relapse scores relative to clones that were eliminated during therapy. These data indicate that certain epigenetically distinct clones may be primed to relapse. Overall, these results demonstrate that epigenetic factors contribute to resistance and relapse in bulk AML and within epigenetically defined subclones that persist into relapse.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Relapsed AML remains a significant clinical challenge, and the mechanisms driving this disease state are incompletely understood. In this study, we found that many AML cases undergo no mutational evolution at relapse, suggesting alternative, non-genetic means that drive AML evolution during treatment and after remission. Our genotyping and chromatin accessibility analysis of paired diagnosis and relapsed AML samples indicates that genomic evolution and epigenetic evolution are two intertwined, yet independent mechanisms contributing to relapse, with specific epigenetic alterations occurring commonly across genetically stable samples. These findings are consistent with a prior study that identified diversity in cytosine methylation change at AML relapse, independent of genetic evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2016</xref>). We further found that epigenetic changes are not a reflection of increased leukemia stem cell proportion at relapse but represent alterations in regulatory sequences occurring across all subpopulations in the AML hierarchy. Single-cell ATAC-seq and analysis of mitoclones in diagnosis and relapse cell populations shows that convergent intracellular evolution occurs, with distinct mitoclones developing similar epigenetic features at relapse. This information further underscores the importance of the role of epigenetic factors in the clinical progression and pathogenesis of leukemia. Further and larger scale studies will need to be conducted to link specific mutational profiles with epigenetic alterations and clonal evolutionary patterns to understand the molecular mechanisms of AML relapse and guide future diagnostic tools and therapies.</p><p>Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) have long been thought of as a potential reservoir for relapse after clinical remission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thomas and Majeti, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jordan, 2007</xref>). Our data indicates that epigenetic changes occurring in LSCs contribute significantly to the overall epigenetic evolution taking place in each AML, likely driving the observed resistance and relapse of these cases. Interestingly, the LSC-enriched cells we investigated exhibited epigenetic stability between the diagnosis and relapse, suggesting that while non-LSC epigenetic changes are derived from changes occurring in stem cells, the LSC-enriched cells may indeed represent a latent population contributing to eventual relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shlush et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parkin et al., 2017</xref>). Our gene score data further suggests that these cells acquired inflammatory genetic programs at relapse, consistent with past reports of residual relapse-prone cells induced by chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duy et al., 2021</xref>). Further studies involving remission samples and epigenetic analysis of latent LSC populations across disease states could clarify the role of these cells in the initiation of AML relapse.</p><p>Single-cell mitochondrial ATAC-seq demonstrated that during chemotherapy, the AML as a whole evolves, with all populations changing their epigenetic state to occupy a distinct chromatin profile. At the same time, relapse mitoclones became epigenetically more similar to each other after chemotherapy in multiple samples, revealing a pattern of epigenetic convergent evolution. This is consistent with the idea of specific epigenetic traits and pathways being selected for during therapy, demonstrated by our bulk ATAC-seq data. These findings demonstrate that epigenetic evolution occurs in similar ways across genomically stable AMLs and that within these AMLs, epigenetic selection results in the convergence of global epigenetic states across clones.</p><p>The stable cases in our relapsed AML cohort exhibited a shared chromatin accessibility signature, suggesting the existence of a favorable epigenetic state contributing to eventual relapse which reflected activation of cell cycle gene pathways and DNA damage response. Based on this bulk ATAC-seq data, we hypothesized that epigenetic evolution could occur via different clonal mechanisms: either intercellular epigenetic evolution, wherein epigenetic cell clones with fixed chromatin states could be selected for at relapse, or intracellular epigenetic evolution, whereby cell populations across the entire AML adopt similar alterations in chromatin accessibility that permit survival and chemoresistance. Our single-cell ATAC sequencing data demonstrated that in some patients, epigenetically defined subpopulations of AML cells are selected for during therapy based on their epigenetic similarity to relapse epigenetic states, independent of genomic stability. In addition, our mitochondrial tracing data revealed that the mitoclones in the genetically stable AMLs were stable and did not demonstrate the selection of specific mitochondrial clones at relapse. We hypothesize that the selection of epigenetically defined clones is not detected by mitochondrial tracing since the AMLs analyzed in this study relapsed over the course of months and that there may not have been time for mitochondrial variants to accumulate in the epigenetically defined clones that were selected for at relapse in the stable samples.</p><p>Notably, we performed mitochondrial tracing in one genetically non-stable sample and found that there was substantial selection for and against multiple mitoclones in this sample. Although this represents a single AML, when considered alongside the stable samples, our data is consistent with the idea that mitochondrial variant heteroplasmy and dynamics capture AML evolution over longer periods of time and their stability is independent of the selection for epigenetic states or clones that occurs during shorter periods of time. In addition, the stability of mitoclones at relapse in the stable samples is consistent with the findings from our genetic studies that showed clonal stability, indicating that the samples we classified as stable in our study truly did not acquire or lose genetically defined clones during therapy and that our genetic studies were adequately powered to classify samples into clonal groups.</p><p>Several mechanisms could account for the epigenetic plasticity reported in many of the AML relapse patients from this study. Virtually all the samples queried here harbored mutations in epigenetic modifiers regulating chromatin, such as DNA methylation, histone methylation, or transcription factors such as RUNX1, reflecting the known landscape of epigenetic disruption by recurrent mutations in AML. It is possible that the altered chromatin state conferred by the loss of function of these regulators creates a permissive epigenetic state, allowing a ‘flexibility’ of the epigenome taken advantage of by cancer cells to grant an evolutionary growth or survival advantage, as has been previously postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corces and Corces, 2016</xref>). Several studies in the past have highlighted the importance of the non-coding regulatory genome in leukemia, and cancer generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Meyerson, 2020</xref>). We additionally hypothesize that since shorter time to relapse was associated with stable relapses, a lack of genomic evolution at relapse may result from a lack of time for mutations to accumulate and clonally expand. Alternatively, the shorter time to relapse in stable AMLs may be due to inherently more aggressive disease in these cases. The data reported here further reinforce the utility of chromatin accessibility as a readout for cell identity and epigenetic landscape. Future analysis of epigenetic mechanisms of relapsed AML will require the analysis of chromatin modifications, including DNA (hydroxy)methylation and histone marks, to specifically characterize the modification of gene regulatory sequences and specific pathways driving epigenetic evolution at different stages of leukemia and tumorigenesis.</p><p>The diversity of clonal evolutionary patterns characterized by our single-cell data highlights the challenge of developing novel therapeutics for, and curing, relapsed leukemia. Although we identify a broadly relapse-specific chromatin signature for mutationally stable samples, we note that there remains striking heterogeneity between patients in the dynamics by which various leukemic clones grow or recede at relapse. Our data also suggests mutational evolution and epigenetic evolution are connected, yet ultimately separate phenomena, as we observed several samples where one process appears to occur in the absence of the other. Moreover, we also identify several patients where there is little apparent clonal evolution, either via genetic variant marks or epigenetic configuration, begging the question of how these cases gain the ability to relapse. Additionally, other cell-extrinsic factors, interactions with the immune system and/or microenvironment, metabolic pathways, or other processes not made apparent through our analysis may have provided additional factors contributing to relapse. Future efforts to detail the cellular mechanisms of relapse and identify therapeutic avenues will likely require analyzing patient-specific mutations or epigenome-specific chromatin features to combat relapsed cell clones. Altogether, this study demonstrates the heterogeneity and importance of epigenetic evolutionary mechanisms including convergent evolution in the relapse of AML.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Relapsed AML genomic meta-analysis</title><p>A PubMed literature search was performed to identify papers studying mutational profiles in relapsed AML samples.

Importantly, all studies utilized in the meta-analysis had detection cutoffs at or below 0.05, allowing us to standardize the classification of mutations into gained, lost, and stable categories.

Cell pellets were then resuspended in 50 µL of ATAC-seq resuspension buffer (RSB: 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, and 3 mM MgCl2 in water) with 0.1% NP40, 0.01% digitonin, and 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated on ice for three minutes. After lysis, 1 mL of ATAC-seq RSB with 0.1% Tween-20 was added and tubes were inverted six times to mix. Isolated nuclei were then spun at 4 °C for 10 min at 500 rcf in a fix-angled centrifuge. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in 50 µL transposition mix (25 uL 2xTD buffer, 2.5 µL Tn5 transposase (100 nM final), 16.5 µL PBS, 0.5 µL 1% digitonin, 0.5 µL 10% Tween-20, and 5 L nucµlease-free water). Transposition reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a thermomixer with shaking at 1000 rpm. Reactions were cleaned up using Qiagen MinElute Reaction Cleanup kits and processed as previously described. All libraries were amplified with a target concentration of 20 μl at 4 nM, which is equivalent to 80 femtomoles of product. All libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq with 75 bp paired end reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Bulk ATAC-seq pre-processing, peak calling and merging, and count matrix generation</title><p>ATAC-sea data was processed based on workflows similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corces et al., 2018</xref>. First, read trimming and quality control was performed using trim_galore using default parameters. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome using bowtie2 and the <monospace>--very-sensitive</monospace> option. Aligned reads were converted to bam format and sorted using SAMtools, and deduplicated using Picard MarkDuplicates. Reads were subsequently indexed and mitochondrial reads were removed using SAMTools. TagAlign bed files from technical replicate libraries were generated using bedtools, shifted to find ATAC-seq cut sites, and pooled. Peaks were called using MACS2 using p-value cut-off of 0.01 and peaks falling within black list regions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/blacklists">https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/blacklists</ext-link>) were removed. A consensus peak set was generated using methods from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corces et al., 2018</xref>. Briefly, called peaks were merged by merging all peak bed files and using an iterative removal process to resolve overlapping peaks. This approach resulted in a consensus set of 115,551 500 bp fixed-width peaks covering accessible regions represented in at least two or more samples. Count matrices were generated using the consensus peak set, and the number of Tn5 cut sites in each peak were calculated using the CountOverlaps function from the GenomicRanges package in R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Diagnosis vs relapse chromatin similarity</title><p>Global chromatin similarity between diagnosis and relapse samples for each patient was calculated by first averaging the peaks counts per million vector between replicates across all samples and taking the pearson-product moment correlation between diagnosis and relapse timepoints. This approach was utilized for both bulk AML ATAC-seq samples and LSC-enriched ATAC-seq samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Gene accessibility scores</title><p>Accessibility scores were generated across all genes across all samples utilizing an approach previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Granja et al., 2021</xref> which was shown to estimate the expression levels of a gene more faithfully than other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Granja et al., 2021</xref>). Using the ArchR approach, a 5 kb tile matrix was utilized and for each gene, tiles falling within TSS-5kb to TTS were assigned a weight of 1+e^–1, and flanking tiles were assigned a weight using an exponential decay model of e^(-abs(distance)/5000)+e^–1. Tiles were assigned a weight of 0 if they ran into adjacent genes or if they were &gt;20,000 bp from the gene. Tn5 insertions were normalized per tile, and summed per gene to generate a gene accessibility score. These scores were then used to generate a gene accessibility score matrix which was utilized in subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Differential accessibility</title><p>Differential accessibility analysis was performed using the Tn5 cut sites per peak matrix or gene accessibility scores matrix. Raw count matrices were utilized as input to the DESeq2 model for this purpose. The DESeq model was used with default parameters to normalize the data and perform differential accessibility analysis across all features. Differential accessibility was performed across stable samples between diagnosis and relapse timepoints using patient labels as covariates to control for between patient differences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Chromatin accessibility gene set enrichment analysis</title><p>Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the GSEA Mac App v4.2.3 (Broad Institute, Inc) and the fgsea R package using a gene accessibility score matrix described above pre-ranked according to relapse vs diagnosis ATAC gene accessibility log fold change.

This approach involved the generation of pseudo-single cell ATACseq samples from bulk samples and the utilization of latent semantic indexing to project these pseudo-single cell libraries to the healthy reference. Briefly, pseudo-single cell samples were generated for each bulk ATAC sample by sampling reads to generate 250 pseudo-single cells per sample. These pseudo-single cell samples were then subjected to LSI and projection to the healthy hematopoietic reference. For full details, see ‘Projection to healthy hematopoietic reference’ below, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Granja et al., 2019</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Leukemia stem cell chromatin accessibility analysis</title><p>ATACseq data from sorted LSC-enriched cell populations was processed in a similar way as the bulk AML cells (described above).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>10X single-cell ATAC-seq</title><p>Sorted AML blasts were prepared with 10 X Genomics Chromium Single Cell ATAC Kit v1.1 according to the manufacturer’s specifications.

Fragment files from cellranger were processed with the ArchR software to generate Arrow files using the createArrowFiles function for each single-cell sample which were subsequently stored locally for downstream processing. Using ArchR, doublet scores were assigned to each cell and cells deemed to be doublets by ArchR were removed from all samples. Next, latent semantic indexing, batch correction, and clustering were performed using the ArchR functions addIterativeLSI, addHarmony, and addClusters functions, respectively.</p><p>To visualize the accessibility of specific genes across cells, we utilized the ArchR function addGeneScoreMatrix to generate a gene accessibility score matrix for each sample. These matrices were used in downstream analyses to visualize and quantify gene-specific chromatin accessibility. Samples in the study were visualized using UMAP dimensional reduction which was performed using the ArchR addUMAP function and default parameters. Upon visualization of clusters, we observed that for three of four samples, there existed a low percentage of cells that clustered separately from the bulk of AML cells. We hypothesized that these differences were biologically relevant or were caused by residual healthy immune cells captured and sequenced during sample preparation. To test this, we quantified and visualized the accessibility of genes shown to be highly expressed in T cell (CD89, TLR4, GZMA, CD247), B cell (TCL1, CD37), monocyte (CD209), and other cell subsets. Clusters that exhibited high accessibility of these genes which were overall epigenetically dissimilar to the bulk of the sample were filtered and excluded from downstream analysis as they were deemed to be residual contaminating healthy immune cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Projection to healthy hematopoietic reference</title><p>In order to identify the closest normal celltypes associated with cells in the AML single cell ATACseq data, we used an approach from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Granja et al., 2019</xref> which involves Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and projection of the sparse single cell data onto a single cell ATACseq manifold derived from healthy hematopoietic cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Granja et al., 2019</xref>). This approach ultimately results in a low dimensional representation of both the healthy hematopoietic reference data as well as the AML single cell ATAC data through which the projection can be visualized and the closest normal cell type for each AML cell can be calculated. For full details of analysis, please see the codebase for this manuscript or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Granja et al., 2019</xref>.</p><p>Following the application of LSI, dimensional reduction was further performed using the UMAP algorithm as described in Granja et al. The output of the UMAP projection was used to visualize the AML cells alongside the healthy hematopoietic scATAC reference. To classify AML cells based on their nearest healthy hematopoietic neighbors in epigenetic space, we used the LSI dimensional reduction output from both healthy and diseased cell states and classified each disease cell based on the top 10 healthy cells that it was closest to in LSI space using the knn function in the class package in R. These classifications were then used for visualization and quantification of the overall differentiation status and closest normal cell types for each cell and overall AML for each sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Relapse chromatin score</title><p>We generated a ‘relapse chromatin score’ for each cell evaluated using scATACseq in the study to determine how ‘relapse-like’ each cell was and whether there was variability in relapse-like states within samples. To generate a relapse score for each cell, we utilized the addFeatureCounts function from ArchR to sum the ATAC enrichment across the top 500 genes in our relapse signature derived from the bulk stable samples (analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We then subtracted from this value the sum of the bottom 500 genes from the same relapse signature. This resulted in a single numerical value per cell with higher values indicating that the cell contained an epigenetic state more similar to bulk relapse samples and less similar to diagnosis relapse samples. We then visualized and quantified these values across all cells and samples evaluated in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>mtscATAC-seq</title><sec id="s4-18-1"><title>Library preparation and sequencing</title><p>Mitochondrial single-cell ATAC-seq was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lareau et al., 2021</xref>).

Variants were deemed high quality if the number of cells the variant was detected in was greater than 3, strand correlation during sequencing was greater than 65%, and mean coverage at the locus was greater than 10 reads. The variants which passed filtering were manually extracted and used in subsequent steps. Next, these variants were read into a variant by cell matrix containing heteroplasmy values for each variant in each cell. This matrix was then binarized and the <italic>seuratSNN</italic> function from the R package <italic>Seurat</italic> was used to cluster the matrix and identify unsupervised clusters of cells grouped by their mitochondrial variants. Clustering resolution was manually selected as previously described. The average heteroplasmy for each variant in each cluster was inspected to verify that clusters were not primarily driven by low heteroplasmy variants. The clonal hierarchy for each sample was determined manually by building a clonal evolution tree based on shared and exclusive mitochondrial variants across all clusters for each sample.

Several important pieces of information would be important to include in this regard. First, for the relapse cases, the authors should clarify when the relapse occurred and whether the patient was recently treated with chemotherapy. One could imagine that chemotherapy could induce similar patterns of chromatin accessibility in AML, but that late relapses might not exhibit such &quot;convergent evolution&quot; since the epigenetic selection pressures imposed by chemotherapy would be in the distant past. Second, it is important for the authors to fully describe the impact of alterations in chromatin stability in unstable clone cases to determine if there is any evidence for epigenetic evolutionary convergence in these cases, common alterations in molecular pathways, de-differentiation, or adoption of more LSC-like states. Third, the authors should provide some type of orthogonal evidence to support claims regarding biological differences between diagnosis and relapse blasts, especially concerning alterations in differentiation, self-renewal, and alterations in cell cycle-related pathways. For example, the authors could assess differentiation status or cell cycle status by blast immunophenotype and size, respectively. Finally, the authors should be circumspect when they call sorted blasts &quot;LSCs&quot; based CD99+TIM3+ expression. As stated by the authors, this strategy allows distinction of blasts from non-leukemic residual HSCs, but does not necessarily allow significant enrichment of LSCs, even in the CD34+CD38- compartment since the Dick and Carroll groups previously showed LSCs can express all combinations of these markers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93019.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) Rev 1: Analyzing whether certain mutational groups are associated with specific epigenetic findings as seen by ATAC-seq?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point, as epigenetic changes at relapse specific to mutational groups have not been evaluated in the prior literature. Due to the limited number of samples and varied mutations across patients, there is a low number of samples in each mutational group in our cohort. Despite this limitation, we performed an analysis to identify mutation-specific epigenetic changes occurring at relapse by identifying chromatin changes specific to AMLs that had specific mutations present at both diagnosis and relapse. Inclusion criteria for each mutation in this analysis were that there were more than 5 samples with the mutation present at both diagnosis and relapse. Based on these criteria, mutations that were analyzed included FLT3, NPM1, TET2, and DNMT3A.</p><p>This analysis showed that for FLT3, NPM1, and DNMT3A, after multiple hypothesis testing correction, there were no chromatin loci that were significantly differentially changed at relapse between mutant and wildtype groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). For TET2 mutant AMLs, after multiple hypothesis testing correction, only 5 gene loci displayed significantly different change at relapse in mutant samples compared to wildtype samples. LINC01476, PITPNM3, SPSB1, CORO2B, and TMEM202 loci were significantly more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We attribute these predominantly negative findings to the low number of samples in each mutation group in our cohort. To fully address the reviewer’s comments and concerns, we have added points in our manuscript specifically stating that we did not find significant differences in chromatin evolution patterns in the mutational groups analyzed.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Volcano plots of differential analysis between mutant vs wildtype of relapse vs diagnosis fold change.</title><p>Mutations analyzed include (A) FLT3, (B) DNMT3A, (C) NPM1, (D) TET2. Volcano plots are displayed with unadjusted (left) and adjusted (right) p values. In all analyses but one, p-value adjustment resulted in no significant gene loci chromatin evolution differences.

While there are some analyses which were included in the submitted manuscript aimed at addressing the reviewer’s point, we appreciate that we did not speculate deeply about why only a subset of cases showed stable clonal patterns in the manuscript text. In the study, we initially hypothesized that clonal stability may be associated with or explained by the time from complete remission (CR) to relapse. Indeed, our analyses of both the metanalysis of genomic data as well as our own samples, demonstrate that AMLs with stable clonal patterns relapse more quickly when compared to AMLs with unstable clonality.</p><p>Based on these results, we speculate that the observed variation in clonal stability may be explained by 2 hypotheses.</p><p>Shorter times to relapse (TTR) might result in a higher likelihood that an AML is clonally stable. This may be related to the depth of clinical remission achieved and level of MRD, which is likely related to multiple factors including patient-specific, treatment-specific, and disease-specific features. We hypothesize that in cases where TTR is shorter, there is less time and therefore less opportunity for mutations to accumulate and subclones to expand into relapse. Conversely, in cases where TTR is longer, there is more time for mutations to accumulate in subclones and for these clones, or subclones lacking diagnosis mutations to expand, resulting in gained or lost mutations at relapse.</p><p>AMLs with stable clonality may be primed to relapse more quickly due to their underlying biology. Our analysis of differential chromatin accessibility at relapse in stable AMLs demonstrates that cell cycle and metabolic pathways are specifically upregulated in AMLs with stable clonality. These results suggest that there may be inherent biology specific to stable AMLs resulting in shorter TTR. These cases may represent a specific subtype of AMLs defined by a lack of genomic change and specific chromatin changes at relapse.</p><p>While we believe that both of these hypotheses are possible based on our results, we unfortunately lack the data or means to prove or disprove either conjecture. To further validate these hypotheses, a larger cohort of prospectively acquired diagnosis and relapse samples, stratified by their TTR would be required. However, to address the reviewer’s comment, we have further integrated these hypotheses into the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
