found in eukaryotic plant, metazoan, and protozoan kingdoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark, 2018</xref>). Crystal structures are known of HAP2 from the unicellular green alga, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardti</italic>; a model plant, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>; and a protozoan parasite, <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fédry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fedry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baquero et al., 2019</xref>). HAP2 can form a trimeric structure that is structurally homologous to the fusion state of viral class II fusion proteins. These fusogens have three extracellular domains, arranged in the order D2, D1, and D3, a disordered stem region, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain, and are expressed on the plasma membrane of male gametes or the envelope of viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Diagram of HAP2 pre-fusion monomer, trimerization and membrane fusion.</title><p>The model is based on postfusion structures of HAP2 referenced in the text, their similarity to postfusion structures of viral class II proteins, models for the conversion of prefusion to postfusion class II fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kielian and Rey, 2006</xref>), and work showing that D1 and D2 are sufficient for trimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liao et al., 2010</xref>), which suggests that the last step may be concerted foldback of D3 over D1 and D2 and fusion of the macrogamete and microgamete plasma membranes.

Domains are colored. Fusion loops at the tip of D2 are shown as ‘*’. Antibodies to D3, shown as Y shapes, may agglutinate microgametes, trigger antibody Fc-dependent effector functions, or neutralize HAP2 function by interfering with trimer formation and gamete membrane fusion.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74707-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>HAP2 is required for fertilization in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2008</xref>) and is thus an attractive target for vaccines that block transmission of malaria. Gamete fertilization takes place in the mosquito midgut in a blood meal taken from an infected individual. Blocking fertilization prevents transmission to the individual from which the mosquito takes its second, final blood meal. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> gametes emerge from infected erythrocytes well before digestion of the blood meal; specific antibodies present in the blood meal will react with and can agglutinate or otherwise neutralize gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angrisano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blagborough and Sinden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qiu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graves et al., 1985</xref>). HAP2 is present on male gametes (microgametes) and has hydrophobic fusion loops at the tip of D2 that insert into the plasma membrane of the female macrogamete and trigger trimerization and structural rearrangements of HAP2 to the fusion state, which mediates membrane fusion and merging of the cytoplasm of the two gametes through a fusion pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kielian and Rey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To mediate fusion, D3 of HAP2 folds over an inner trimeric core composed of D1 and D2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We reasoned that antibodies to D3 of HAP2 that blocked the interface formed with D1 and D2 in the fusion state might block fusion, as has been demonstrated with viral fusogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Austin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that HAP2 D3 antibody taken up in a blood meal could inhibit fertilization and infection of the mosquito and subsequent transmission to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delves et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Immunization of mice with HAP2 fragments or putative HAP2 fusion loop peptides has proved the concept that antibodies to different domains of HAP2 can, to different extents, block transmission of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> or <italic>P. vivax</italic>, species that infect rodents and humans, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angrisano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blagborough and Sinden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qiu et al., 2020</xref>). However, we are far from having an optimized HAP2 immunogen. Furthermore, the high-sequence divergence of HAP2 in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species from structurally characterized HAP2 in other phyla emphasizes the importance of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> HAP2 structures for rational vaccine design. Here, to advance a vaccine that would block malaria transmission, we have expressed a D3 fragment of <italic>P. berghei</italic> HAP2, raised monoclonal antibodies, crystallized D3 in complex with Fab fragments of two antibodies, and examined Fab complexes with the complete HAP2 ectodomain (D1-D3) by negative stain electron microscopy (EM). Furthermore, we show that one of these antibodies potently blocks gamete fertilization and transmission and thus for the first time that a monoclonal antibody to HAP2 can block transmission. We define the advantages, as well as the limitations, of using the D3 domain of HAP2 as an immunogen for transmission blockade. Moreover, the two structurally characterized antibodies have cross-reactivity with HAP2s among multiple plasmodial species that can cause malaria in humans. The insights into <italic>Plasmodium</italic> D3 structure, HAP2 ectodomain architecture, and mechanism of inhibition are important steps toward the development of a vaccine to block malaria transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>P. berghei</italic> HAP2 D3 elicits antibodies that cross react with human malaria pathogens</title><p>Apicomplexans such as <italic>Plasmodium</italic> are eukaryotes that have extracellular proteins that are disulfide-linked and glycosylated; therefore, we produced HAP2 proteins in insect and mammalian cells which are competent for such modifications.

Five IgG mAbs reacted with the immunogen with nanomolar EC50 values in ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The change of environment from the bloodstream to the mosquito midgut triggers the development of gametocytes in infected erythrocytes into mature, highly motile ‘male’ microgametes and more sessile ‘female’ macrogametes and gamete emergence from erythrocytes. These events can be mimicked in vitro by reducing the temperature or pH and adding xanthurenic acid to the medium (ookinete medium).

In adjacent interactions, Tyr-577 in β-strand E forms a sidechain hydrogen bond to the backbone of Gly-91 in L-CDR3 while the Tyr-577 backbone hydrogen bonds to the sidechain of Asn-104 in H-CDR3. Another close contact and backbone-backbone hydrogen bond between D3 E β-strand residue Ala-575 and H-CDR3 residue Tyr-102 further strengthens interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). All four of these major epitope residues are invariant among the species examined here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), correlating with excellent cross-reactivity of mAb 2/1.12.</p><p>Although mAb 2/6.14 contacts residues in each β-strand of the D3 DCFG β-sheet, the major contacts are formed by Arg-565 in strand D and six residues in the F-G loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and H</xref>). The F-G loop forms a large bulge on the D3 surface that fits into a cavity in the Fab centered between the three H chain CDR loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The Arg-565 sidechain forms bidentate hydrogen bonds to the backbone of Tyr-91 in L-CDR3 and a cation-pi interaction with Tyr-32 in L-CDR1. All three Fab H chain CDR loops surround the D3 F-G loop with each CDR forming at least one of a total of four mainchain-mainchain hydrogen bonds. A network of two sidechain-sidechain and two sidechain-backbone hydrogen bonds forms around FG loop residue Glu-603 and H-CDR2 residue Asn-56. Hydrogen bonds between Lys-597 and Ser-57 of H-CDR2 and salt bridge between Lys-602 and Asp-31 of H-CDR1 further extend the interaction with the F-G loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>D3 contains six cysteine residues, all of which are conserved among <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species; however, only four of these form disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). Cys-513 in the A-B loop forms a short-range disulfide to Cys-523 in the B strand that likely stabilizes the residues between Cys-513 and the beginning of the B strand, which are highly polar and mostly disordered. Cys-546 in the C strand and Cys-592 in the F strand form a long-range disulfide bond to bridge these two adjacent β-strands in the middle of the DCFG β-sheet. Two D3 cysteines are free. Free cysteines buried in hydrophobic regions are occasionally present in extracellular proteins. Cys-542 is well buried in the hydrophobic core. Cys-604 is exposed in D3-Fab complexes but in the full ectodomain may be buried by residues at the interface between D1 and D3, including residues N-terminal to D3 residue 502, which were not present in the crystallization construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Structural conservation of D3 of HAP2 across phyla.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>P. berghei</italic> HAP2 D3 from the Fab 2/1.12 complex showing the disulfide-bonded and free cysteines.

The two globules with stronger density correspond to the Fab, which has two domains per globule. The globules with weaker density correspond to the HAP2 ectodomain.

In contrast and surprisingly, the other four mAbs were only partially reactive with the ectodomain, although they reacted with D3 comparably to mAb 2/6.14.</p><p>These differences were followed up by further comparisons that focused on mAbs 2/6.14 and 2/1.12. Calculations of affinity and dissociation constants assume fully active material; if only a fraction is active then the apparent affinity is lower. In SPR, only the concentration of the analyte enters into affinity calculations. Therefore, we compared affinities measured for the two Fabs using them either as analyte or immobilized on the chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In contrast, these values for the ectodomain were 106/11.7 = 9.1 ± 6.2. Thus, the ectodomain appears to be only 0.88/9.1 = 9% ± 6% active in binding to Fab 2/1.12.

Furthermore, we found that a subset of D3 mAbs were not fully reactive with the HAP2 ectodomain and that these antibodies were ineffective in preventing ookinete conversion. These findings have important implications for choice of future HAP2 immunogens. Previously, in the absence of structural knowledge, a large number of <italic>P. berghei</italic> HAP2 cDNA clones beginning and ending in different positions were tested in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Only one sequence, residues 355–609, was found to be expressed well; fortunately, it yielded an immunogen that elicited polyclonal antisera that inhibited gamete fertilization in vitro and reduced transmission in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blagborough and Sinden, 2009</xref>). This sequence contained about half of D2, a small portion of D1, and all D3 except for the last four residues of strand G. Recently, polyclonal antibodies to the putative fusion loops of D2 of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> HAP2 also showed efficacy in blocking fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angrisano et al., 2017</xref>). The same laboratory and procedures were used for these studies, so the results are directly comparable, except for the use of a polyclonal antibody in the previous and monoclonal antibody in the current study. Surprisingly, mAb 2/6.14 to D3 is at least fivefold more effective than that affinity-purified polyclonal antibody, as 100 µg/ml reduced oocyst intensity by 78%, whereas 500 µg/ml affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to the fusion loop reduced intensity by 61%. Recently, residues 231–459 of <italic>P. vivax</italic> HAP2 were also tested. It contains ~30% of D1 and ~60% of D2 and, as expected from lack of a complete domain, had to be recovered from inclusion bodies in insect cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qiu et al., 2020</xref>). This material elicited antibodies that inhibited transmission, but the results cannot be directly compared. The present study is the first time that a defined domain from HAP2 has been used in immunization, that a monoclonal antibody has been found to be effective in blocking transmission, and that a <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species HAP2 structure has been reported. Thereby, this study advances the rational development of transmission-blocking malaria vaccines.</p><p>HAP2 is highly conserved, both within and between <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species.

The high-sequence identity of gamete antigens contrasts to malaria vaccine antigens expressed by sporozoites such as TRAP and the C-terminal region of CSP used in the RTS,S vaccine and those expressed by blood stage parasites such as MSP1 and AMA1, which have high levels of polymorphisms and have proven to be challenging for vaccine antigen design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neafsey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barry and Arnott, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ouattara et al., 2015</xref>). Compared to CSP and TRAP, HAP2 is also highly conserved among species; for example, <italic>P. berghei</italic> HAP2 is 60–70% identical in D3 to the five species we examined that are capable of infecting humans.</p><p>We structurally characterized HAP2 D3 in complex with two Fab fragments that bound to opposite faces of D3, on the β-sheets that form its β-sandwich domain. Conservation or variation among residues in these interfaces among <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species provides insights into which residues are important in their epitopes. The four residues most important for mAb 2/1.12 binding were identical among all six species examined, explaining the wide cross-reactivity of this mAb. Although the D3 F-G loop was central in the 2/6.14 epitope, many of its contacts were between backbone atoms. The sidechain with the most contacts was Arg-565 in the D strand. All three interactions by the Arg-565 sidechain would be abolished by the Asn substitution in <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), which had the lowest affinity.</p><p>Thus far, structural information on HAP2 has been on its post-fusion, trimeric form or on isolated domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fédry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fedry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baquero et al., 2019</xref>). The rod-like, linear conformation of the HAP2 ectodomain and its monomeric state has not previously been seen for HAP2. Its resemblance to the linear conformation of pre-fusion states of structurally homologous class II viral fusogens suggests that this linear conformation of the HAP2 ectodomain corresponds to its pre-fusion state. The pre-fusion state is preferred over the post-fusion state as the target for transmission blocking antibodies, because antibodies that bind to the pre-fusion state not only can act earlier but can also sterically block the interfaces required for trimer formation and the fold-back of D3 onto D1 and D2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In addition to immunological mechanisms for blocking gamete fertilization in the mosquito blood meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graves et al., 1985</xref>), mAb 2/6.14 might also block conformational changes required for conversion of the monomeric pre-fusion state of HAP2 to the trimeric post-fusion state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), especially reorientation of D3 to fold over D1 and D2 in the trimer, which is required for fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Direct blocking of fusion has been demonstrated with antibodies to D3 of viral type II fusion proteins that are structurally homologous to HAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Austin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To test this idea, we superimposed D3 from <italic>P. berghei</italic> HAP2 on D3 from the trimeric fusion conformation of HAP2 in other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> D3 structures superimpose well, despite only 8% and 17% identity with <italic>P. berghei</italic> HAP2 D3, respectively. This identity is too low for immunological crossreactivity. Superposition showed that the F-G loop recognized by mAb 2/6.14 is buried in D3 interfaces in the postfusion state trimer. The mAb 2/1.12 epitope also substantially overlaps with the D3 postfusion state trimer interfaces in the C strand. Moreover, both antibody epitopes overlap in the D strand with sites buried in the postfusion conformation. The incompatibility of Fab binding and conformational change to the postfusion state is shown by burial of the Fabs in superpositions on one monomer in a postfusion trimer of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> HAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, binding of either of these mAbs to D3 would block folding back of D3 in the fusion state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, we can only speculate on why mAb 2/6.14 and not mAb 2/1.12 blocked conversion of macrogametes to ookinetes. mAb 2/6.14 is differentiated from the other 4 mAbs studied here by its ability to completely react with the monomeric HAP2 ectodomain. Although all five mAbs reacted with D3 with nanomolar EC50 values by ELISA and pulled down similar amounts of isolated D3 by immunoprecipitation, only mAb 2/6.14 fully immunoprecipitated the ectodomain. SPR measurements further showed that the affinity of mAb 2/1.12 was substantially lower for the ectodomain than for D3, but only when the ectodomain was used as analyte and not when immobilized on the chip, suggesting that only ~10% of the ectodomain was active in binding to mAb 2/1.12. Gel filtration showed that the ectodomain complexed well with mAb 2/6.14, whereas only a minor fraction of the ectodomain complexed with mAb 2/1.12. Thus, three independent methods show that only a minor fraction of the HAP2 ectodomain reacts with mAb 2/1.12, and one of these methods, immunoprecipitation, showed that the other three mAbs behaved like mAb 2/1.12. While all 5 mAbs gave clear-cut staining of <italic>P. berghei</italic> microgametes, the microgametes had been fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated overnight in this solution, which denatures many proteins, prior to staining. Among many possible explanations for this discrepancy, perhaps mAb 2/1.12 recognizes an epitope that is available in D3 but is masked or destabilized by association with D1 and D2 in the HAP2 ectodomain, and this inhibition by D1 and D2 is relieved by partial denaturation during fixation by paraformaldehyde.</p><p>The scope of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of HAP2 D3 as an immunogen for transmission-blocking malaria vaccines. Nonetheless, our study also provides some useful guideposts for future use of the HAP2 ectodomain in transmission-blocking vaccines. Most eukaryotic extracellular proteins are highly dependent on N-glycosylation for stability and expression; however, lack of N-glycosylation sites in D3 appeared to have little or no effect on expression yield, which favors the hypothesis that N-glycans are not added to HAP2. Unfortunately, efficiently expressing eukaryotic extracellular proteins with complex multi-domain structures, multiple disulfide bonds, and no N-glycosylation requires refolding from <italic>E. coli</italic>, which is highly challenging. Therefore, the best approach for successfully expressing the HAP2 ectodomain may be to use eukaryotic hosts and to mutationally remove N-glycosylation sequons, as was done here for D3 but not for the ectodomain.</p><p>In conclusion, we find that D3 of HAP2 can elicit antibodies that block transmission of malaria. Furthermore, we have obtained a mAb that blocks transmission, determined the first structure of a fragment of HAP2 in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, and determined the structure of HAP2 of D3 in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> in complex with antibodies that either block or do not block transmission. We have confirmed the principle that HAP2 D3 can elicit transmission-blocking antibodies. On the other hand, we have also identified limitations of D3 as an immunogen because some antibodies to D3 did not react well with the HAP2 ectodomain. We also outline a possible strategy for obtaining improved expression and more native folding of the HAP2 ectodomain as an alternative immunogen for transmission-blocking immunity. This proposed approach is validated by our EM studies showing we can isolate a monomeric, pre-fusion state of the HAP2 ectodomain. Furthermore, stabilizing the pre-fusion state of HAP2, as successfully done for the respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McLellan et al., 2013</xref>) and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsieh et al., 2020</xref>), may not only increase expression but also efficacy in inducing neutralizing antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was designed to provide insights for developing a vaccine to block or reduce malaria transmission. This objective was addressed first by generating monoclonal antibodies against the D3 fragment of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> HAP2. CB6F1 mice were immunized with the glycan-shaved D3 protein. All in vitro characterization of binding properties was carried out after a detailed antibodies screening as described in Methods. We next tested the ability of the D3 mAbs to inhibit <italic>P. berghei</italic> microgametes from fertilizing macrogametes and forming ookinetes in vitro. The results showed that all five antibodies reacted with microgametes, and that mAb 2/6.14 was outstanding for its ability to block P. berghei fertilization in vitro. Therefore, we decided to test mAb 2/6.14 for its ability to block transmission in vivo in mosquitoes.

Twenty-four hr later, unfed mosquitoes were removed. Mosquitoes were maintained on 8% (w/v) fructose, 0.05% (w/v) p-aminobenzoic acid at 19–22°C and 50–80% relative humidity. Day 14 post-feeding, mosquito midguts were dissected, and oocyst numbers per midgut in each mosquito was determined by phase contrast microscopy. Reductions in oocyst intensity (number of oocysts/midgut) and prevalence (number of infected over total mosquitoes fed) in the presence of an HAP2 antibody were calculated with respect to the negative control IgG present at the same concentration in the feeds.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Crystallization and structure determination</title><p>The <italic>P. berghei</italic> D3 (502–617) construct with N516T, S533N and N539Q mutations to abolish N-glycosylation was used for crystallization. D3 and Fab were mixed in 1:1.3 molar ratios and complexes were isolated by gel filtration. Complexes were crystallized at 20 °C by hanging-drop vapor diffusion with equal volumes of complex and well solution. The Fab 2/1.12 complex (4.5 mg/ml) was crystallized with 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 25% PEG 3350, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH5.5. The 2/6.14 Fab complex (7.5 mg/ml) was crystallized with 0.3 M proline, 22% PEG 1500, 0.1 M HEPES pH7.5; crystals were dehydrated by soaking in solutions that had the starting concentrations of components in the protein and reservoir solutions while raising the concentration of PEG 1500% to 31% in 3% steps. Crystals of Fab 2/1.12-D3 and Fab 2/6.14-D3 were cryo-protected with reservoir solution containing 15% glycerol or 15% ethylene glycerol, respectively, in 2 steps of 5% and 10% increase and plunged in liquid nitrogen.

The 2/6.14 Fab-D3 complex structure was solved by molecular replacement using D3 from the 2/1.12 Fab complex, the H chain of PDB ID 1IGC, and the L chain of PDB ID 5AZ2. Each crystal structure has two complexes in the asymmetric unit.</p><p>During model building and refinement of the 2/6.14 Fab complex, the Fab constant domains of one complex had good density, but the variable domains and D3 had broad but continuous density that was difficult to trace. In contrast, all domains of the other complex were easily traced. Furthermore, refinement remained stuck. Alternative space groups including those with lower symmetry or use of twin rules provided no improvement. We then realized that in the troublesome D3-Fab complex in the asymmetric unit, two alternative conformations were present for D3, VH, and VL, whereas CH1 and CL had a single conformation. The transition between dual and single conformations occurred at the elbows between VH and CH1 and between VL and CL; that is the two conformations differed in elbow angle. In further refinement, the data cutoff was changed from 2.4 to 2.8 Å, and we largely treated each of the dual conformations of D3, VH1, and VL as rigid bodies based on their structure in the single conformation of the other D3-Fab complex.</p><p>The alternate conformations allow the VL domain in chain B and the D3 domain in chain C to pack against alternate conformation symmetry mates in different complexes along adjacent edges of the unit cell. Symmetry mates with the B conformation severely clash, while those with the distinct conformations A and B have good lattice contacts. In contrast, symmetry mates with conformation A are too far apart to provide stabilizing lattice contacts. Thus, clashes in one conformation together with a lack of stabilizing lattice contacts in the other conformation may have driven the formation of a crystal lattice with dual conformations of VL, VH, and D3 in one of two Fab-D3 complexes in the asymmetric unit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Negative stain electron microscopy</title><p>Each <italic>P. berghei</italic> HAP2 ectodomain construct (residues 43–617 or 61–611), with or without Fab at a molar ratio of 1:1.3, was subjected to Superdex 200 gel filtration in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH8, 500 mM NaCl. Peak fractions were adsorbed to glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids, washed with deionized water, and stained with freshly prepared 0.75% uranyl formate. Images were acquired with an FEI Tecnai-T12 transmission electron microscope at 120 kV and a nominal magnification of 52,000×. About two thousand particles were picked interactively and subjected to 2D alignment, classification and averaging using RELION-2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>). Selected EM class averages were masked and cross-correlated using EMAN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ludtke et al., 1999</xref>) with 2D projections generated at 2° intervals from the 2/6.14 Fab-D3 complex crystal structure filtered to 25 Å.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Expi293F cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider S2 cells were used to express proteins.

HAP2 is an evolutionary conserved gamete fusogen and a known transmission-blocking vaccine target. Here the authors produced recombinant forms of the D3 domain of P. berghei HAP2 protein and generated five monoclonal antibodies that recognize the recombinant protein as well as the native protein in P. berghei gametes. One of the antibody inhibits HAP2 function, as shown by reduced ookinete production in vitro and reduced parasite transmission to mosquitoes. The antibodies show some degree of cross-reactivity towards HAP2 from other Plasmodium species, except <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The authors resolved the structure of the D3 domain bound to two of the antibodies, including the one with neutralization potential. The structure of the PbHAP2 D3 domain appears similar to known HAP2 structures from other organisms. The data reveal that the two antibodies recognize distinct epitopes on the protein. Strikingly, only the neutralizing mAb can recognize the full-length HAP2 domain.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>– This work provides novel antibodies against HAP2 from the malaria parasite, and the first structural data for a Plasmodium HAP2 protein.</p><p>– Some degree of cross-reactivity was observed with HAP2 from other Plasmodium species, providing potentially interesting tools to study HAP2 function.</p><p>– The antibodies vary in their neutralization potential, which may be useful to investigate the mechanisms of transmission blocking.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>– The work was performed with a rodent species (P. berghei). Although the antibodies cross-react, at least in part, with HAP2 from other species, they do not recognize <italic>P. falciparum</italic> protein, which limits direct translation of the conclusions to the deadliest human malaria parasite.</p><p>– The only inhibitory mAb is the one that recognizes the full-length protein, so it is not clear to which extent the D3 domain represents an attractive target as compared to other domains of the protein. It is not clear how the data will inform vaccine design targeting HAP2.</p><p>– The fact that all five antibodies recognize the native protein in gametes yet only one mAb efficiently recognizes the full-length recombinant ectodomain is puzzling.</p><p>– The authors propose a model of action of the blocking antibody, but the mechanisms of neutralization are not addressed in the current manuscript.</p><p>I am not an expert in structural biology so I cannot evaluate the quality of the structural data.</p><p>– The authors propose a model of action of the blocking antibody in Figure 1, yet the mechanisms of neutralization are not addressed in the current manuscript. In particular, what is the evidence that the 2/6.14 mAb can exert Fc-dependent immune effector functions in the mosquito? Also, at which step does this antibody block gamete fusion? According to the model in Figure 1, one would expect that binding of male and female gametes would not be affected by the antibody. This could be tested experimentally.</p><p>– It is not clear how the data will inform vaccine design targeting HAP2. Only the 2/6.14 mAb shows neutralization potential, and strikingly it is also the only one that efficiently recognizes the full-length protein, so it is not clear to which extent the D3 domain represents an attractive target as compared to other domains of the protein.</p><p>– The fact that all five antibodies recognize the native protein in gametes yet only one mAb efficiently recognizes the full-length recombinant ectodomain is puzzling. The authors discuss that prolonged fixation is responsible for alteration of the protein in the IFA. They should test shorter fixation conditions, or test binding of the antibodies without fixation, to analyze whether the mAbs bind to the gamete surface, as would be expected at least for mAb 2/6.14 based on the functional data.</p><p>– Could structural modelling provide possible explanations for the differential cross-reactivity of the PbHAP2 mAbs against HAP2 from other species, especially <italic>P. falciparum</italic>?</p><p>– The data show that the mAb 2/1.12 does not inhibit ookinete conversion in vitro (Figure 3B) but can it block transmission to mosquitoes?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>HAP2 is a protein required by the sexual stages of the malaria parasite to fuse and to complete fertilisation. It is therefore thought to be a transmission-blocking vaccine candidate. If a mosquito takes up antibodies which target HAP2 with the blood-meal, then they can prevent parasite gamete fusion in the mosquito midgut and can block transmission. This manuscript explores whether the D3 domain of HAP2 may be a valuable transmission blocking immunogen.</p><p>Based on analogy to viral fusogens, the authors decided to focus on domain D3 of HAP2, as antibodies against the equivalent domain of viral fusion proteins are effective against viral fusogens. Plasmodium berghei HAP2 D3 domain was used to raised monoclonal antibodies. These were structurally characterised and were tested for their ability to prevent transmission of malaria parasites in a P. berghei mouse malaria model.</p><p>To begin, the authors produced the D3 domain of 6 different Plasmodium species in insect cells, carefully ensuring correct expression and removal of glycans. They immunised mice wih the P. berghei protein and generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies. As the D3 domains from different species show 60-70% sequence identity, they assessed cross reactivity, showing two of the mAbs to pull down D3 domain from most Plasmodium species. While this is a nice result, it was disappointing that the worst cross-reactivity was with the D3 domain from the most-deadly <italic>P. falciparum</italic> species.</p><p>They next tested the effect of their mAbs. All five selected mAbs could label in vitro differentiated gametocytes. The mAbs were then tested in a transmission blocking assay, in which they were added to P. berghei parasites in mouse blood, which was fed to mosquitos. One mAb, 2/6.14 was found to block ookinete formation in the mosquitoes. While this mAbs showed efficacy, it is less effective than the 45.1 mAb which binds to the gametocyte surface protein Pfs48/45. While the authors 2/6.14 mAb is 44.5% effective at 50μg/ml, 45.1 shows 100% transmission blocking at 14μg/ml. Nevertheless, this is, to my knowledge, the best HAP2-targeting mAb to date.</p><p>The authors next determine structures of two antibodies – the most transmission blocking, 2/6.14 and the other cross-reactive antibody 2/1.12. These antibodies bind to different surface of the D3 domain. To understand why one is transmission blocking while the other is not, the authors then tested the binding of the panel of nAbs to full HAP2 ectodomain, containing all three domains. Here they find that only 2/6.14 interacts with the full ectodomain to an appreciable degree, perhaps explaining its ability to block transmission.</p><p>Finally, the authors model their D3:mAb structure onto a model of the post-fusion conformation of HAP2. They find that the mAb is incompatible with the adoption of this conformation. Could this block membrane fusion and account for the effect of the antibody in transmission blocking?</p><p>This study tests the hypothesis that the D3 domain of HAP2 acts can raise transmission-blocking antibodies and reveals the molecular determinants of binding of their best antibody. The manuscript is well conducted, careful and balanced. As to whether the D3 domain of HAP2 will make a great transmission blocking vaccine candidate, I would say that the jury is still out. The best antibody generated in this work is effective, but less so that those which target the transmission-blocking vaccine candidate Pfs48/45. It will be useful to see other studies in which D3 of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> HAP2 is used as a vaccine candidate and to see the efficacy of a larger panel of antibodies.</p><p>In the introduction, where the authors write &quot;To mediate fusion, D3 of HAP2 folds over an inner trimeric core composed of D1 and D2 (Figure 1).&quot;, is this a proposal or model? If it has been proved, please cite the paper. If not, please indicate that this is a proposal.</p><p>In Figure 4A there is no structure shown for the two complexes – only opened up structures. This seemed strange and not intuitive. Could the structures of the complexes also be shown? Without this, it is very hard to understand how the two epitopes relate to each other from what is shown.</p><p>The authors also do not show the sulphate ions which they see in one of the structures. These ions appear to link the epitope and the antibody. How do they know that these are sulphate ions and are they likely to be physiologically relevant?</p><p>It would be good to move Figure S6 into the main manuscript as it helps explain develop a model for how the antibody works.</p><p>The number of clashes and RSRZ outliers are high for a 2.1Å structure for 7LR4. For 7LR3 the number of RSRZ outliers and Ramachandran outliers are both high. These structures appear to require more work in refinement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This was a great paper to read and straight-forward to review. All results are clearly stated without hyperbole and supported by their claims. We particularly appreciated that the authors also looked at the other HAP2 present in Plasmodium species for cross-reactive antibodies, examined the phenotype of the monoclonal antibodies using IFA, fertilization and transmission blocking, and used both X-ray crystallography and negative stain EM to provide structural insights into the mechanisms of inhibition (or lack of). It was also very useful to have experimental data showing that while one of the antibodies 2/1.12 could recognize D3 alone, it did not have the same level of recognition of the ectodomain. The Discussion covers this observation in an insightful way. The manuscript stands without further experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74707.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers agree that this is an interesting and important study, and that the work is very well conducted and presented.

We are one of the few groups that reports MolProbity statistics in our crystal statistics tables. These show that our structures are in the 97-99th percentiles of all structures in the pdb of similar resolutions for clashes and geometry (which includes Ramachandran outliers). Thus the quality of our refinement is outstanding. Our style of refinement (and we usually push resolution more than others, because we do not throw out useful data, as recommended by Diedrichs and Karplus) tends to give high RSRZ outliers. We tend to build the mainchain through weak but continuous density and we do not truncate sidechains. This takes more care in refinement, provides a more useful model for biologists, but also gives higher RSRZ outliers. Additionally, the 7LR3 complex was difficult to refine as explained in Methods:</p><p>&quot;During model building and refinement of the 2/6.14 Fab complex, the Fab constant domains of one complex had good density, but the variable domains and D3 had broad but continuous density that was difficult to trace. In contrast, all domains of the other complex were easily traced. Furthermore, refinement remained stuck. Alternative space groups including those with lower symmetry or use of twin rules provided no improvement. We then realized that in the troublesome D3-Fab complex in the asymmetric unit, two alternative conformations were present for D3, VH, and VL, whereas CH1 and CL had a single conformation. The transition between dual and single conformations occurred at the elbows between VH and CH1 and between VL and CL; i.e. the two conformations differed in elbow angle. In further refinement, the resolution cutoff was changed from 2.4 to 2.8 Å, and we largely treated each of the dual conformations of D3, VH1, and VL as rigid bodies based on their structure in the single conformation of the other D3-Fab complex.&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
