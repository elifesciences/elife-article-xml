regulators, biodiversity is declining at an alarming rate. Unless we find transformative solutions to preserve biodiversity, future generations may not be able to enjoy nature’s services. We have developed a conceptual framework that establishes the links between biodiversity dynamics and abiotic change through time and space using artificial intelligence. Here, we apply this framework to a freshwater ecosystem with a known history of human impact and study 100 years of community-level biodiversity, climate change and chemical pollution trends. We apply explainable network models with multimodal learning to community-level functional biodiversity measured with multilocus metabarcoding, to establish correlations with biocides and climate change records. We observed that the freshwater community assemblage and functionality changed over time without returning to its original state, even if the lake partially recovered in recent times. Insecticides and fungicides, combined with extreme temperature events and precipitation, explained up to 90% of the functional biodiversity changes. The community-level biodiversity approach used here reliably explained freshwater ecosystem shifts. These shifts were not observed when using traditional quality indices (e.g. Trophic Diatom Index). Our study advocates the use of high-throughput systemic approaches on long-term trends over species-focused ecological surveys to identify the environmental factors that cause loss of biodiversity and disrupt ecosystem functions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Over long periods of time, environmental changes – such as chemical pollution and climate change – affect the diversity of organisms that live in an ecosystem, known as ‘biodiversity’. Understanding the impact of these changes is challenging because they can happen slowly, their effect is only measurable after years, and historical records are limited. This can make it difficult to determine when specific changes happened, what might have driven them and what impact they might be having.</p><p>One way to measure changes in biodiversity over time is by analysing traces of DNA shed by organisms. Plants, animals, and bacteria living in lakes leave behind genetic material that gets trapped and buried in the sediment at the bottom of lakes. Similarly, biocides – substances used to kill or control populations of living organisms – that run-off into lakes leach into the sediment and can be measured years later. Therefore, this sediment holds a record of life and environmental impacts in the lake over past centuries.</p><p>Eastwood, Zhou et al. wanted to understand the relationship between environmental changes (such as the use of biocides and climate change) and shifts in lake biodiversity. To do so, the researchers studied a lake community that had experienced major environmental impacts over the last century (including nutrient pollution, chemical pollution and climate change), but which appeared to improve over the last few years of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p><p>Using machine learning to find connections over time between biodiversity and non-living environmental changes, Eastwood, Zhou et al. showed that, despite apparent recovery in water quality, the biodiversity of the lake was not restored to its original state. A combination of climate factors (such as rainfall levels and extreme temperatures) and biocide application (particularly insecticides and fungicides) explained up to 90% of the biodiversity changes that occurred in the lake. These changes had not been identified before using traditional techniques. The functional roles microorganisms played in the ecosystem (such as degradation and nitrogen metabolism) were also altered, suggesting that loss of biodiversity may lead to loss of ecosystem functions.</p><p>The findings described by Eastwood, Zhou et al. can be used by environmental regulators to identify species or ecosystems at risk from environmental change and prioritise them for intervention. The approach can also be used to identify which chemicals pose the greatest threat to biodiversity. Additionally, the use of environmental DNA from sediment can provide rich historical biodiversity data, which can be used to train artificial intelligence-based models to improve predictions of how ecosystems will respond to complex environmental changes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sedaDNA</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>freshwater</kwd><kwd>multilocus metabarcoding</kwd><kwd>functional biodiversity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012338</institution-id><institution>Alan Turing Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R-BIR-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orsini</surname><given-names>Luisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000270</institution-id><institution>Natural Environment Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NE/N005716/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orsini</surname><given-names>Luisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005687</institution-id><institution>Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RobustNature Cluster of Excellence Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orsini</surname><given-names>Luisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Hollert</surname><given-names>Henner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M01116X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eastwood</surname><given-names>Niamh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-throughput systemic approaches on long-term trends identify the environmental factors that cause loss of biodiversity and disrupt ecosystem functions.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biodiversity is the foundation of provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baert et al., 2016</xref>), which underpin economic prosperity, social well-being and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cardinale et al., 2012</xref>). Global biodiversity has been lost at an alarming rate in the past century, leading to what some have called the sixth mass extinction - biodiversity loss caused by human population growth and activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Naggs, 2017</xref>). Biodiversity is threatened by agricultural land use, climate change, invasive species, pollution and unsustainable production and consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bonebrake et al., 2019</xref>). Freshwater ecosystems have suffered the greatest biodiversity loss because of these anthropogenic drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ruckelshaus et al., 2020</xref>). Experimental manipulation of biodiversity has demonstrated the causal links between biodiversity loss and loss of ecosystem functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eisenhauer et al., 2019</xref>). However, studies on multi trophic levels are scarce and largely focus on terrestrial and marine ecosystems; freshwater ecosystems, especially lakes and ponds, are not well represented in multitrophic experimental manipulations, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dornelas et al., 2018</xref>). These holistic studies are critical to understand the context-dependency of biodiversity-ecosystem functions relationships and to implement management measures to conserve biodiversity. However, a better understanding of the environmental factors with the largest impact on biodiversity, and their cumulative effect over time is urgently needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Halpern et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Biodiversity action plans have been devised since the 1990s. However, most strategies have failed to stop or even reduce biodiversity decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rounsevell et al., 2020</xref>). This is because:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Biodiversity loss occurs at different spatial and temporal scales, and dynamic changes in community composition are the result of long-term ecological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eastwood et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nogués-Bravo et al., 2018</xref>). State-of-the-art environmental and biological monitoring typically captures single snapshots in time of long-term ecological dynamics, failing to identify biodiversity shifts that may arise from cumulative impacts over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eastwood et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nogués-Bravo et al., 2018</xref>). Recent initiatives like BioTIME started collating databases with species presence and abundance recorded from time series across different ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dornelas et al., 2018</xref>). However, freshwater ecosystems are poorly represented in these studies which at most encompass the last 10–25 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blowes et al., 2019</xref>). Although the large geographic breath of these studies is good to understand overall trends of biodiversity change, they are inadequate to identify drivers of biodiversity dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Halpern et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blowes et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the taxonomic species assignment in these databases is oftentimes derived from traditional observational methods (e.g. microscopy), which cannot resolve cryptic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blowes et al., 2019</xref>). High cryptic diversity is common in freshwater invertebrates and primary producers, potentially impacting the assessment of biodiversity in these ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hirai et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, <italic>seda</italic>DNA (environmental DNA extracted from sediment) has emerged as a promising tool to study decade-long biological dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Domaizon et al., 2017</xref>). However, these studies focus on specific taxonomic groups [microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Capo et al., 2019</xref>) and ciliates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barouillet et al., 2022</xref>)], failing to capture the community-level changes in any given ecosystem.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Biodiversity is threatened by multiple factors. Only by quantifying trajectories of abiotic, biotic, and functional systemic change over time, can we begin to identify the causes of biodiversity and ecosystem function loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonebrake et al., 2010</xref>). Studies are emerging that investigate the impact of chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Groh et al., 2022</xref>) or climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pecl et al., 2017</xref>) on biodiversity. Yet, understanding the combined effect of these abiotic factors on biological communities is still challenging.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The lack of paired biological and abiotic long-term monitoring data is a limiting factor in establishing meaningful and achievable conservation goals. Even well-monitored species have time series spanning a few decades at best (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Halpern et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonebrake et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, conservation efforts have historically focused on ecological surveys of few indicator species, the identification of which require specialist skills (e.g. light microscopy and taxonomy) and are low throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gillson and Marchant, 2014</xref>). High-throughput system-level approaches providing biological, abiotic and functional changes over multiple decades are needed to understand links between biodiversity loss, drivers of changes and potential consequences on ecosystem functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eastwood et al., 2022</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>Recently, we have developed a conceptual framework that helps establish the links between biodiversity dynamics and abiotic environmental changes using artificial intelligence, examines emergent impacts on ecosystem functions, and forecasts the likely future of ecosystem services and their socio-economic impact under different pollution and climate scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eastwood et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we illustrate the first component of this framework in a freshwater ecosystem (Lake Ring, Denmark) with a well-documented human-impact over 100 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cuenca Cambronero et al., 2018b</xref>) by quantifying the interrelations between community-level functional biodiversity, biocides and climate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Historical records, supported by empirical evidence show that Lake Ring experienced semi-pristine conditions until the early 1940s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cuenca Cambronero et al., 2018a</xref>). In the late 1950s, sewage inflow caused severe eutrophication. When the sewage inflow was diverted at the end of the 1970s, agricultural land use intensified, leading to substantial biocides leaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cuenca Cambronero et al., 2018b</xref>). The lake partially recovered from eutrophication and land use in modern times (&gt;1999) but, as with every lake ecosystem in Europe, it experienced an increase in average temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cuenca Cambronero et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cuenca Cambronero et al., 2018c</xref>). We apply multilocus metabarcoding and mass spectrometry analysis to a dated sedimentary archive of Lake Ring. These data, complemented by biocides sale records and climate records, were studied with explainable network models with multimodal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltrusaitis et al., 2019</xref>) to identify drivers of functional biodiversity changes across major ecosystem shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The combination of explainable networks and multimodal learning allow the simultaneous interrogation of data matrices describing different types of data. A symmetric matrix-on-matrix regression is typically used to identify the components that covary within a matrix (e.g. environmental variables), and among matrices (e.g. environmental variables and eDNA taxonomic units). Given the well-documented human-impact over time, Lake Ring represents an excellent natural system to demonstrate the power of systemic approaches in biological and functional monitoring.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conceptual framework.</title><p>A sedimentary archive spanning 100 years was sampled from Lake Ring, Denmark and dated using radioisotopes. Both biotic and abiotic changes were empirically quantified through time: (1) community-level biodiversity was reconstructed by applying multilocus metabarcoding to environmental DNA isolated from layers of sediment (biological fingerprinting); (2) chemical signatures were quantified from the same sediment layers using mass spectrometry analysis (chemical fingerprinting); (3) climate data were collected from publicly available databases. Explainable network models with multimodal learning were applied to identify significant correlations between system-level biodiversity, chemical fingerprinting, and climate variables. Taxonomic units (families) impacted by environmental factors were identified and environmental factors ranked based on their effects on community biodiversity.

This estimate was based on a radiometric chronology of the core completed in 2018 (see Materials and methods). Lake Ring has a well-known and documented history of human impact over the past century. The lake transitioned over time from a semi-pristine environment to eutrophication, and later to high pesticide pollution due to intensification of agricultural land-use in the area surrounding the lake. In modern times (&gt;1999), the lake partially recovered (see Materials and methods for more details) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cuenca Cambronero et al., 2018b</xref>). Hereafter, we refer to the lake transitions across these statuses as lake phases.</p><p>We quantified community-level biodiversity over a century (1916–2016) by applying high-throughput multilocus metabarcoding (18S, 16SV1, 16SV4, COI and rbcL barcodes) to bulk environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from layers of a dated sedimentary archive from Lake Ring. After denoising, the number of unique ASVs and total number of reads across all samples (including median number of reads per sample) found per barcode were as follows: 18S - 2,023 ASVs, 569,761 total reads (median 12,893 reads); 16SV1 - 4,022 ASVs, 842,619 total reads (median 20,798 reads); 16SV4 - 5,270 ASVs, 552,064 total reads (median 13,816 reads); COI - 822 ASVs, 362,616 total reads (median 9,595 reads); rbcL - 417 ASVs, 366,489 total reads (median 9,443 reads). Alpha diversity did not significantly vary across the lake phases for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>) and was proportionally higher in the prokaryotic (16 S barcodes) than in the eukaryotic community (18S barcode). Conversely, the invertebrate community (COI barcode), and the diatom community (rbcL barcode), showed significant changes over time across the lake phases, reflecting taxon-specific patterns over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). Even though the alpha diversity varied over time, it was not consistently lower in historical than modern communities across the barcodes, allowing us to exclude bias in the preservation state of environmental DNA.</p><p>The community composition (beta diversity) changed significantly in the transition between lake phases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>).

However, the composition of the primary producers (e.g. rbcL) changed significantly only in the transition between the pesticide and the eutrophic phases, whereas the invertebrate’s community (e.g. COI) changed significantly only between the pesticide and the recovery phases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; rbcL, COI).

We observed two patterns in the prokaryotic community composition over time: some taxonomic groups changed with the redox status of the sediment (e.g. acidophilus archaea [Thermoplasmata] and methanogenic archaea [<italic>Methanomassiliicoccaceae</italic>], which declined from the semi-pristine to the recovery phase [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, 16SV4]); others changed over time consistently with the nutrient levels of the ecosystem.

A functional ortholog was defined from functions experimentally assigned to the prokaryotes identified with the 16 S rRNA in each lake phase. We predicted a total of 6,257 Kegg Orthologs (KO) terms from the 16SV1 and 6,828 from the 16Sv4 barcode across the lake phases. Of the total number of KO terms, 1,418 were significantly differentially abundant across the lake phases in the 16SV1 and 1,064 terms in the 16SV4 dataset, respectively. The functional KEGG pathways enriched within these KO terms and significantly differentially enriched between lake phases (Fisher’s exact test, p &lt;0.05) were 19 (17 for the 16SV4 and 2 for the 16SV1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Correlations were identified between a total of 44 eukaryotic (18S, COI and rbcL) families and abiotic variables; of these correlations, 32 were with biocides and 33 with climate variables (some correlations involved the same taxonomic group correlating with multiple environmental factors). Of the 32 families negatively correlated with biocides, the largest proportion co-varied significantly with insecticides (22 families - 69%) and fungicides (16 families - 50%), followed by herbicides (9 families - 28%) and pesticides (3 families - 9%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Moreover, long-term freshwater studies tend to focus on indicator species or specific taxonomic groups (e.g. invertebrates), rather than capturing community-level patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dornelas et al., 2018</xref>). Developments in the field of <italic>seda</italic>DNA have addressed the limitations of direct observations, utilising the properties of eDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Capo et al., 2019</xref>). However, <italic>seda</italic>DNA studies have predominantly focused on microorganisms as proxies for ecosystems’ health [e.g. cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Picard et al., 2022</xref>); ciliates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barouillet et al., 2022</xref>); parasitic taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Talas et al., 2021</xref>)], with other taxonomic groups less well represented. Our study addresses some of the challenges of direct observations as it is not reliant on fossil remains. However, the completeness of the community taxonomic assignment depends on the completeness of reference databases. We acknowledge that our taxonomic classification may be incomplete.</p><p>Whereas the application of high-throughput sequencing technologies requires training, these technologies are well established with publicly available standard operating procedures. As compared to direct observations, high-throughput sequencing provides replicable results regardless of the operator. Moreover, the application of metabarcoding to <italic>seda</italic>DNA or more generally eDNA can be outsourced to established environmental services, removing the need for training if it is a limiting factor.</p><p>Studies of temporal dynamics typically start from an already shifted baseline and rely on discrete observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barouillet et al., 2022</xref>). Our study alleviates these limitations by providing a continuous community-level analysis of biological changes over recent evolutionary times and starting from a relatively undisturbed environment. However, eDNA-based studies suffer from limitations linked to the level of preservation of nucleotides in environmental matrices. Although it has been shown that DNA can be recovered from lacustrine and marine sediments as far back as the Holocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Slon et al., 2022</xref>), biases might still exist due to the degradation of eDNA, especially over geological times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jia et al., 2022</xref>) and in warmer climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mauvisseau et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, physio-chemical changes in sediment and soil may affect the assemblage and composition of prokaryotic communities that can survive in extreme conditions, including anoxic environments. However, it has been shown that slightly alkaline water (pH 7–9) facilitates DNA preservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jia et al., 2022</xref>). Whereas we cannot exclude that the eDNA in our study suffers from some of the mentioned biases, we expect DNA degradation not to have affected our study significantly. This is because we observed non-significant difference in species richness over time in both the prokaryotic (16 S barcode) and eukaryotic (18S barcode) communities. DNA degradation would have resulted in lower alpha diversity with increasing age of the sediment. Preservation of DNA in our study is also favoured by the time frame studied (100 years as opposed to millennia), the stable pH since the 1960s (data prior to 1960s were not recorded), and the latitude of Lake Ring which experiences average yearly temperatures below 15℃. All these factors are known to reduce microbial activity, allowing a better preservation of DNA in sediment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Giguet-Covex et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although the overall species richness did not change significantly over time, species assemblages significantly changed over time. Non-significant changes in alpha diversity coupled with significant changes in beta diversity over time have been reported for existing time series of biodiversity data in marine and terrestrial environments, even if the length of the time series rarely exceeded four decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blowes et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Insecticides and extreme temperatures drive changes in functional biodiversity</title><p>Threats to biodiversity pose a significant challenge because they change over time and may result in additive adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bonebrake et al., 2019</xref>). Long-term continuous observations are preferable to short-term observations because they can reveal correlations and possible causation between biological changes and abiotic drivers of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gillson and Marchant, 2014</xref>). Using eDNA-based data on multitrophic biodiversity over the past 100 years, we identified the taxonomic groups within the prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities that significantly contributed to community assemblages shifts. Whereas the prokaryotic community was overall changing at each major transition between lake phases, changes in the eukaryotic community were driven by different taxonomic groups in the transition between lake phases. The diatom community, typically used by regulators as an indicator of freshwater ecological status, did not change significantly over time, as the beta diversity and the LTDI2 index revealed. These results strongly suggest that a system-level approach, like the one proposed here, may be more appropriate than species or taxon-specific approaches. Our approach showed that diatom communities are not a reliable representation of the ecological status of freshwater ecosystems and are not good indicators of environmental change. Our approach provides a major advantage over traditional direct observations by identifying both taxonomic and functional changes of freshwater biodiversity in a high-throughput fashion. The analysis of temporal trends of biodiversity from a semi-pristine baseline through impacted environments provides a new reference point for regulators to define biodiversity in semi-pristine conditions.</p><p>Even if Lake Ring partially recovered from eutrophication and biocide pollution in modern times, both the contemporary eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities are significantly different from the semi-pristine historical community, as the PERMANOVA on beta diversity demonstrates. Our findings align with other studies using <italic>seda</italic>DNA on decennial timeframes focusing on prokaryotes (e.g. cyanobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cao et al., 2020</xref>), whereas studies on eukaryotic compositional changes are just emerging to enable quantitative comparative assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Studies on prokaryotic and eukaryotic assemblages based on short experimental manipulations suggest that natural communities can return to their original state before a perturbation occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hillebrand and Kunze, 2020</xref>). However, longer term experimental manipulations show a different perspective with irreversible changes in biodiversity composition and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fordham, 2015</xref>). These long(er)-term experimental manipulations and our study suggest that empirical observation of multi trophic changes over time in natural systems are critical to understand the context-dependency of biodiversity-environmental impact relationships and assess the resilience of natural ecosystems.</p><p>Changes in community assemblages are important because they can be associated with changes in functional biodiversity. Although biodiversity variables include taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional attributes, most studies have focused on generic taxonomic diversity measures – usually measured as species richness or abundance, ignoring functional biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Biomass and changes in biomass only capture productivity, while disregarding other metrics, such as decomposition or resource turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gounand et al., 2018</xref>). A complete assessment of biodiversity should include functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eisenhauer et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, enzyme activities are relevant because they exhibit the functions encoded in genes and reflect the role of microbiota in the transfer of matter and energy from low to high trophic levels in ecosystems. Changes in biological assemblages over time and across lake phases in our study resulted in significant changes in functional biodiversity, observable through changes in metabolic, biosynthesis and degradation functions of the prokaryotic community demonstrated by differentially abundant KEGG pathways between lake phases. Catabolic functions, metabolism (including methane metabolism), degradation and biosynthesis were differentially enriched between the recovery and other lake phases. These are key functions for the survival of organisms. For example, change is metabolic potency and the ability to break down complex molecules into smaller ones (catabolism and degradation) may affect survival and fitness of living organisms by influencing the uptake of nutrients.</p><p>Predicting the functional profiles of prokaryotic communities based on their taxonomic composition has its limitations. Predictions of functions linked to human gut microbes tend to be more accurate than predictions on other communities because reference databases are developed on currently available genomes, which are biased towards microorganisms associated with human health and biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi et al., 2017</xref>). Because of the bias in reference databases, functional predictions may be more accurate for basic metabolic and housekeeping functions (essential cellular functions that are evolutionary conserved), which are more commonly annotated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mi et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that we underestimated the predicted changes in functional biodiversity driven by environmental change in our study. Yet, we were able to detect important functional changes (e.g. metabolism and biosynthesis essential for survival) in correspondence with major ecosystem shifts (e.g. from semi-pristine to recovery phase).</p><p>In recent years, an increasing number of studies have documented impacts on biodiversity driven by climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pecl et al., 2017</xref>), whereas chemicals are thought to pose a negligible threat to biodiversity because living organisms can adapt and evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Groh et al., 2022</xref>). Adaptation to environmental change can happen, but it comes at a cost that can reduce resilience of natural populations to multiple stressors or novel stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cuenca-Cambronero et al., 2021</xref>). Our study showed that chemicals and climate variables each explain up to 47% of biodiversity compositional changes and that the joint effect of insecticides/fungicides and yearly extreme temperature/summer precipitation best explained changes in overall biodiversity. The joint effects of insecticides and extreme temperature events affected prokaryotes by altering their functionality and changing their metabolic, biosynthesis and degradation functions. The joint effect of insecticides and summer precipitation best explained changes in primary producers and grazers. This result aligns with previous studies showing that the effect of chemicals on freshwater can be exacerbated by temperature/precipitation, because of changes in the bioavailability, adsorption, elimination and relative toxicity of chemicals by water organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pinheiro et al., 2021</xref>). Higher temperatures increase diffusion of chemical molecules, resulting in faster uptake by living organisms and hence toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patra et al., 2015</xref>). In some cases, higher temperatures result in effects on the organism’s metabolic ability to reduce a chemical’s toxicity. Our study hints at examples of both mechanisms, distinguishing between families that are negatively and positively correlated with climate variables.</p><p>The resolution and reliability of our data-driven systemic approach goes beyond the current state-of-the-art, enabling us to identify the specific abiotic factors, down to the commercial name of biocides, that in isolation or combined with climate variables affected specific families of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Our algorithm provides a high degree of confidence that surpasses state-of-the-art analysis, which predominantly identify patterns of co-occurrence of taxa within communities e.g. Correlation-Centric Network approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). A step in the right direction to capture complex interactions between biotic and abiotic variables is the network analysis of co-occurrence patterns among physico-chemical and biological variables using random forest machine learning algorithms (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tse et al., 2018</xref>). This approach is hypothesis-free and allows the identification of synchronicity between various environmental variables and <italic>seda</italic>DNA sequence variation. However, even when applied to temporal trends, it does not quantify joint effects of environmental factors on biodiversity. So far, random forest machine learning algorithms have only been applied to prokaryotic communities, disregarding other taxonomic groups and providing a partial understanding of community-level patterns and responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tse et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A potential limitation of our approach is that correlations identified in field surveys do not demonstrate causation. However, they generate testable hypotheses that can be proven experimentally in controlled mesocosm experiments as explained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eastwood et al., 2022</xref>, providing a potentially transformative approach.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for conservation and management of biodiversity</title><p>Some of the greatest challenges in biodiversity conservation faced by water resource managers is the limited information available on a time scale sufficient to assess long-term changes of aquatic ecosystems. Large-scale models that link environmental drivers to biological indicators are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Solimini et al., 2005</xref>), even if some countries have tried to introduce semi-quantitative indices to assess the ecological status of freshwater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archaimbault and Dumont, 2010</xref>). Regulators must rely on approaches ingrained into environmental law, even though they have been proven inadequate (e.g. TDI), as the continuous decline in biodiversity demonstrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pecl et al., 2017</xref>). Even when direct links between biological indicators and abiotic drivers can be established, these rely on indicator species (e.g. a fish, an alga and an invertebrate) used as proxies for ecosystem health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kanno, 2016</xref>). Our data-driven approach provides a novel way to address regulatory needs. However, the use of data-driven, systemic approaches requires critical changes in current environmental practice and a shift to whole-system evidence-based approaches. The transition to the novel methodologies proposed here will require changes in regulatory frameworks, following a test and acceptance phase, as well as a buy-in from regulators. Our study is a proof of concept that the drivers of biodiversity loss can be identified with higher accuracy than currently possible, generating hypotheses that can be tested experimentally. Our data-driven approach enabled us to identify insecticides and temperature as strong drivers of biodiversity loss, both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The confirmation of these findings across multiple freshwater ecosystems has the potential to inform conservation and mitigation interventions, leading to an improved preservation of functional biodiversity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Environmental and paleoecological profile of Lake Ring</title><p>Lake Ring is a shallow mixed lake in Jutland, Denmark (55°57’51.83’’ N, 9°35’46.87’’ E) with a well-known history of human impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cuenca Cambronero et al., 2018b</xref>). A sedimentary archive was collected from Lake Ring in November 2016 with an HTH-type gravity corer; the core was sliced in 34 layers of 0.5 cm and stored in dark and cold (–20 °C) conditions.

According to historical records, the lake was semi-pristine until the 1940s. In the late 1950s, sewage inflow from a nearby town increased nutrient levels resulting in eutrophication. The sewage inflow was diverted at the end of the 1970s, but this period coincided with agricultural land-use intensification (&gt;1980), causing biocides leaching into the lake. The lake partially recovered in modern times (&gt;1999), experiencing a partial return to its original trophic state and reduced impact from biocides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cuenca Cambronero et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>Physico-chemical variables were measured in the lake between 1970 and 2016, even though data are sparse and discontinuous, limiting their use in a machine learning or statistical framework. To complement the historical records, we obtained climate data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The climate data were collected from a weather station 80 km from Lake Ring.

Hence, we used the data from the weather station as an estimate of the lake water temperature. We also observed a tight correlation between the recorded water temperature in Lake Ring and the summer air temperature recorded by the weather station. In addition, we procured sales records of biocides in Denmark between 1955 and 2015 from the Danish national archives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). To assess whether the biocide sales records were a good representation of persistent chemicals in the lake sediment, we quantified the persistent halogenated pesticide DDT in the sliced sedimentary archive of Lake Ring, applying gas chromatography with mass spectrometry analysis. Sediment samples were lyophilized and freeze dried in a lyophilizator using a Christ Beta 1–8 LSCplus freeze-dryer, (Martin Christ GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany), to avoid analyte loss during water removal. Following lyophilization, the sediment samples were sieved through 0.4 mm meshes and homogenised. Approximately 1 g of dry sediment was weighed into pre-cleaned glass tubes and spiked with 100 ng of deuterated [2H8- 4,4`- DDT], used as an internal (surrogate) standard, followed by 1 g of copper powder (Merck, Dorset, UK) for sulphur removal. The sediment samples were extracted using 5 ml of hexane: acetone (3:1 v/v), vortexed for 5 min, followed by ultrasonication for 15 min and centrifugation for 3 min at 5000 rpm. The supernatant was transferred to a clean, dry tube and the process was repeated twice for each sample. The combined extract was then evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of N2 and reconstituted in 2 mL of hexane. Sulphuric acid (3 ml) was used to wash the reconstituted crude extract. The organic phase was allowed to separate on top of the acid layer then transferred to another clean dry test tube. The remaining acid layer was washed twice, each with 2 ml of Hexane. The combined clean extract and washes was evaporated under a gentle stream of Nitrogen, reconstituted into 150 µl of iso-octane containing 100 pg/µl of PCB 131 used as syringe (recovery) standard.

The following step is a matrix-on-matrix regression, applied to correlate families called from the ASVs with either biocide type or climate variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>; Step 2).

A Sliding Window (Pearson) Correlation (SWC) analysis followed this step and was applied to each pair of vectors represented by the top ranked abiotic factor and the families. This approach was used to identify abiotic factors (either climate variables or biocide types) that significantly correlated with families over time, using the criterion that their Pearson correlation coefficient should be larger than 0.5, i.e. large effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buckland and Gey, 1994</xref>) with an FDR adjusted p-value (padj) &lt;0.05 following 10,000 permutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>; Step 3).

Time intervals with more than 50% zero values in either the biotic or the abiotic data were discarded from downstream analyses to reduce false positives. A recall rate was used to quantify the number of ASVs within a family that were individually significantly correlated with the abiotic variables over all ASVs in a given family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buckland and Gey, 1994</xref>).

For this analysis, we selected the climate variables and biocide types contributing the largest covariances in the correlation analysis in Step 4. Their combined effect on a family was considered to be significant if the biocide type and the climate variable were each significantly correlated with the family over the same time window, and their average Pearson correlation was &gt;0.5 with padj &lt;0.05 (SWC analysis with 10,000 permutations) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>; Step 6). The biocide type and the climate variable were interpreted to have an joint effect on a given family if the linear combination of the biocide type and the climate variable had a larger Pearson correlation coefficient than each of the correlations between the family and the biocide type and the family and the climate variable individually, in the same time interval with padj &lt;0.05 (with 10,000 permutations in the SWC analysis).</p><p>Within each biocide type that significantly correlated with a family, we established their ranking based on the correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>; Step 6). Significant Pearson correlations that identified the joint effect of climate variables and individual biocides on a given family were identified with the same criteria outlined above (Pearson correlation &gt;0.5; padj &lt;0.05; SWC with 10,000 permutations). Chemicals with more than 50% null values or Pearson correlation coefficients &lt;0.5 were discarded.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>sCCA analysis.</title><p>CCA loadings calculated with sparse canonical correlation analysis for biocides (A) and climate variables (B).

We present the alpha diversity captured by each barcode used in this study across the 100 years covered by the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). The biological samples used as PCR positive controls showed small variance, providing confidence across the lake phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The diversity captured by the rbcL barcode was compared to the diversity expressed by the Trophic Diatom Index, which is a standard reference to determine water quality according to the Water Framework Directive guidelines. The diversity captured by the Trophic Diatom Index shows low variation over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>) and is discussed in the main text alongside the diversity captured by the rbcL barcode.</p><p>Lake Ring physio-chemical parameters over time are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4A</xref>, followed by a reporting of biocides (Tons/year) from the 1960 to modern times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4B</xref>). The distribution of fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, pesticides and multi-targeted biocides are shown over a period of 50 years in Denmark. To assess whether the sales record was a good proxy for the biocides in the lake studied here, we compared the sales record and the empirical quantification of DDT from the sediment layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4C</xref>). The two patterns show a very good overlap, suggesting that sales records are a good proxy for persistent chemicals in sediment.</p><p>The AI pipeline used in this study to identify the likely drivers of biodiversity change over time in Lake Ring is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>. The main steps used in the pipeline to correlate biodiversity dynamics, biocides and climate variables is shown. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, sCCA analysis identifies the chemical class and climate variables loading for each barcode used, showing that insecticides are likely the main drivers of community biodiversity changes, followed by fungicides. Furthermore, the minimum temperature and precipitation were identified as strong drivers of biodiversity changes among the climate variables studies. An in-depth analysis of the environmental factors and taxonomic units identified with the metabarcoding analysis, enabled us to establish correlations between taxonomic units and specific environmental variables, to be used for further experimental validation to confirm causality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The joint effect of climate variable and biocide classes can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.

The authors identify three important points as to why biodiversity action plans have failed. Namely, community changes occur over large spatio-temporal scales and monitoring programs capture a fraction of these long-term dynamics (e.g. few decades) which although good at capturing trends in biodiversity change, they often fail at identifying the drivers of these changes. Additionally, most of these rely on manual sorting of samples, overlooking cryptic diversity, or state-of-the-art techniques such as sedimentary DNA (sedaDNA) which allow studying decade-long dynamics, usually focus on specific taxonomic groups unable to represent community-level changes. Secondly, the authors identify that biodiversity is threatened by multiple factors and are rarely studied in tandem. Finally, the authors stress the need for high-throughput approaches to study biodiversity changes since historically, most conservation efforts rely on highly specialized skills for biodiversity monitoring, and even well studied species have relatively short time series data. The authors identify a model freshwater lake (Lake Ring, Denmark) - suitable due to its well documented history over the last 100 years - to present a comprehensive framework using metabarcoding, chemical analysis and climatic records for identifying past and current impacts on this ecosystem arising from multiple abiotic environmental stressors.</p><p>Results - They are brief and should expand some more. Particularly, there are no results regarding metabarcoding data (number of reads, filtering etc.). These details are important to know the quality of the data which represents the bulk of the analyses. Even the supplementary material gives little information on the metabarcoding results (e.g. number of ASVs - whether every ASV of each family were pooled etc.). The drivers of biodiversity change section could be restructured and include main text tables showing the families positively or negatively correlated with the different variables (akin to table S2 but simplified).</p><p>Discussion</p><p>The discussion is well written identifying first, some of the possible caveats of this study, particularly regarding classification of metabarcoding data, its biases and the possible DNA degradation of ancient sediment DNA. The authors discuss how their results fit to general trends showing how agricultural runoff and temperature drive changes in freshwater functional biodiversity primarily due to their synergistic effects on bioavailability, adsorption, etc. The authors highlight the advantage of using a system-level approach rather than focusing on taxa-specific studies due to their indicator status. Similarly, the authors justify the importance of studying community composition as far back as possible since it reveals unexpected patterns of ecosystem resilience. Lake Ring, despite its partially recovered status, has not returned to its semi-pristine levels of biodiversity and community assemblage. Additionally, including enzyme activity allows to assess functional diversity of the studied environment although reference databases of these pathways are still lacking. Finally, the authors discuss the implications of their findings under a conservation and land management framework suggesting that by combining these different approaches, drivers of biodiversity stressors can be derived with high accuracy allowing for better informed mitigation and conservation efforts.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the constrictive and detailed feedback provided. We have adopted the proposed changes to improve the manuscript clarity and accessibility. The following revisions are included in the revised manuscript:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The analytical framework is not sufficiently explained in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the reviewer is referring to the conceptual framework mentioned in introduction. In the previously submitted manuscript, we did not provide details because the framework is published elsewhere. However, we agree with the reviewer that a short explanation may be helpful, which we have included in the resubmitted manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The significance of findings in relation to functional changes is not clear. What are the consequences of enrichment of RNA transport or ribosome biogenesis pathways between pesticides and recovery stages, for example?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In the previously submitted manuscript, we included an explanation of the central functions these pathways can alter (e.g. metabolism and infection response). These functions are self-explanatory. However, we have elaborated on the consequence that the disruption of these pathways can cause in the resubmitted manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The impact of individual biocides and climate variables, and their additive effects, are assessed but there is no information offered on non-additive interactions (e.g., synergistic, antagonistic).</p></disp-quote><p>This was a misunderstanding based on our use of the term synergistic in this context. The approach by which we define a synergistic or joint effect of two environmental variables on a taxonomic group is explained in the methods section. This analysis is based on climate variables and biocide types contributing the largest covariances in the correlation analysis explained in Supplementary Fig. 5; Step 4. The combined effect of two environmental variables on a taxon was considered to be significant if the biocide type and the climate variable were each significantly correlated with the taxon over the same time window, and their average Pearson correlation was &gt; 0.5 with padj &lt; 0.05 (SWC analysis with 10,000 permutations). The biocide type and the climate variable were interpreted to have a joint effect on a given taxon if the linear combination of the biocide type and the climate variable had a larger Pearson correlation coefficient than each of the correlations between the family and the biocide type and the family and the climate variable individually, in the same time interval with padj &lt; 0.05 (with 10,000 permutations in the SWC analysis). We realise that the use of synergistic or additive was not correct in this context and have replaced the term synergistic with joint effect throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The level of confidence associated with results is not made explicit. The reader is given no information on the amount of variability involved in the observations, or the level of uncertainty associated with model estimates.</p></disp-quote><p>As we didn’t use traditional statistical approaches, confidence level estimation in the traditional sense is not possible. Instead, we used permutation tests and adjusted P-values to identify significant correlations in the data. These approaches are more robust than traditional statistics for integrating and discovering complex, group-wise patterns among high-dimensional datasets. While most forms of machine learning require large sample sizes, sCCA uses fewer observations to identify the most correlated components among data matrices and captures the multivariate variability of the most important features.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major implications of the findings for regulatory ecological assessment are missed. Regulators may not be primarily interested in identifying past &quot;ecosystem shifts&quot;. What they need are approaches which give greater confidence in monitoring outcomes by better reflecting the ecological impact of contemporary environmental change and ecosystem management. The real value of the work in this regard is that: (1) it shows that current approaches are inappropriate due to the relatively stable nature of the indicators used by regulators, despite large changes in pollutant inputs; (2) it presents some better alternatives, including both taxonomic and functional indicators; and (3) it provides a new reference (or baseline) for regulators by characterizing &quot;semi-pristine&quot; conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, which we have included in the main text (L451461)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Results - They are brief and should expand some more. Particularly, there are no results regarding metabarcoding data (number of reads, filtering etc.). These details are important to know the quality of the data which represents the bulk of the analyses. Even the supplementary material gives little information on the metabarcoding results (e.g. number of ASVs - whether every ASV of each family were pooled etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have included a paragraph in results reporting read numbers and other statistics. The filtering criteria and handling of samples can be found in methods (L658-661; L670-675). As explained in methods the taxonomy was assigned using qiime feature-classifier classify-sklearn and used at family level where possible. When classification was not possible at family level because of incomplete/missing information in the online database or a poor match to reference database, the lowest classification possible was used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The drivers of biodiversity change section could be restructured and include main text tables showing the families positively or negatively correlated with the different variables (akin to table S2 but simplified).</p></disp-quote><p>As there are over 180 unique families/taxonomic units correlated with at least one biocide or environmental variable, a simplified version of this table would be too large to include in the main text. Therefore, we prefer to keep this information in supplementary table 2 complete with correlation statistics.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for providing detailed feedback on the manuscript and respond to their suggestions as follows:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to review your manuscript, which I found interesting and enjoyable to read. Here are some suggestions for improving it.</p><p>Remove spaces before citations in text.</p><p>Lines 51-53: &quot;Community-level biodiversity reliably explained freshwater ecosystem shifts whereas traditional quality indices (e.g. Trophic Diatom Index) and physicochemical parameters proved to be poor metrics for these shifts.&quot; Seems to be the wrong way around / not clear???</p></disp-quote><p>Rephrased to clarify.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 54: Should be &quot;...advocates the use of...&quot; or &quot;...demonstrates the advantages of...&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Done, thanks for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 62: Spell out numbers &lt;10, i.e. &quot;sixth mass extinction&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Done, thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 66-72: These sentences lack clarity. It's not clear that &quot;experimental manipulation of biodiversity&quot; hasn't involved investigation of &quot;multi-trophic changes&quot;. By the third of these four sentences it is not clear what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. And in the fourth sentence, &quot;these holistic studies&quot; are not defined. Perhaps it would suffice to say that experiments have so far focused primarily on a single trophic level and largely neglected freshwater systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased to improve clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 81: Delete unnecessary bracket</p></disp-quote><p>Done, thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 82: &quot;a minority of freshwater ecosystems&quot; sounds as if you're saying that few freshwater ecosystems are represented in BioTIME, which seems obvious and would also apply to terrestrial and marine systems. Do you mean that freshwater ecosystems re not well represented in the data?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the sentence, thanks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 106: Resolve issue with citation in text at the end of the sentence (repeated at line 109 and possibly other lines).</p></disp-quote><p>Done, thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 116: By &quot;&gt;1999s&quot; do you mean 1990s?</p></disp-quote><p>This was a typo. it was supposed to be &gt;1999</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 120: The reader would benefit greatly from a brief explanation of explainable network models and multimodal learning in the introduction. Why are these the right tools to use? How do they work in this context? Figure 1 helps to some extent but needs more commentary in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included an explanation of the explainable network models and multimodal learning and how their use can be beneficial to the study of diverse data types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 144: Here and throughout the text the language could be much more efficient and readable. &quot;Alpha diversity&quot; does not require a definite article. Furthermore, when referring to significance it is convention to state the p-value, test statistic and test used.</p></disp-quote><p>As there are different p-values for each barcode, we have included them in legend to Supplementary Fig. 1 to avoid crowding the main text. We prefer to leave the text unchanged for this reason.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 155: &quot;The primary producer's composition&quot; is grammatically awkward and less suitable than &quot;the composition of primary producers&quot;. This kind of awkwardness occurs again at line 285 (&quot;diatom's&quot;) and possibly in other parts of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 169: The statement that this family was &quot;relatively more abundant&quot; needs a little more explanation. What is it relative to - other groups or to previous stages?</p></disp-quote><p>More abundant than in the other phases – the sentence has been modified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 179: Nested brackets are unnecessary and affect readability. This could simply be a new sentence, i.e. &quot;For example, Nitrospiraceae (nitrite oxidizers)...&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Done, thanks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 215: &quot;Functional biodiversity&quot;, which implies that some biodiversity is functional and some not, does not seem an appropriate term to describe the results you present in this section. Simply &quot;functioning of the prokaryotic community&quot; would suffice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 214-233: This section may be inaccessible for many readers. For example, what are Kegg Orthologs and what role do they play in the functioning of a lake ecosystem? The explanation comes later in the paragraph but there needs to be a gentler introduction before diving into specific technical concepts.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and have included a short explanation of what KEGG and KO terms mean.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplementary Figure 3: It would be helpful to superimpose the lake stages here, as done in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>The figure has been updated with coloured data points corresponding to each phase, as in supplementary figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 265: Should be &quot;19 of which were identified...&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Done, thanks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 284: &quot;Predominantly&quot; rather than &quot;prominently&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Done</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 242-316: This section is good in that it identifies and ranks individual biocides and climate variables but there is no information on non-additive interactions (e.g., synergistic, antagonistic). Could the authors at least comment on why this was not done or not necessary, and what uncertainties this omission could introduce into the results?</p></disp-quote><p>This was a misunderstanding based on our use of the term synergistic in this context. the approach by which we define a synergistic or joint effect of two environmental variables on a taxonomic group is explained in the methods section. This analysis is based on climate variables and biocide types contributing the largest covariances in the correlation analysis explained in Supplementary Fig. 5; Step 4. The combined effect of two environmental variables on a taxon was considered to be significant if the biocide type and the climate variable were each significantly correlated with the taxon over the same time window, and their average Pearson correlation was &gt; 0.5 with padj &lt; 0.05 (SWC analysis with 10,000 permutations) – this is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5; Step 6. The biocide type and the climate variable were interpreted to have an additive effect on a given taxon if the linear combination of the biocide type and the climate variable had a larger Pearson correlation coefficient than each of the correlations between the family and the biocide type and the family and the climate variable individually, in the same time interval with padj &lt; 0.05 (with 10,000 permutations in the SWC analysis). we have replace synergistic with joint effect to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: These 3-D plots are very hard to read. Without additional features (e.g. shadows on each plane, or lines connecting points to planes) it is impossible for the viewer to tell where the points are located on each axis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have created interactive 3D plots here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://environmental-omicsgroup.github.io/Biodiversity_Monitoring/">https://environmental-omicsgroup.github.io/Biodiversity_Monitoring/</ext-link>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: Legend entry should be &quot;summer precipitation&quot; not &quot;precipitations&quot;. &quot;Additive effect&quot; rather than &quot;joint effect&quot; would be more consistent with the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>“Precipitations” has been updated to “precipitation” where relevant throughout. We left ‘joint effect’ and unified the main text, responding to a previous comment of this reviewer on the meaning of synergistic effects in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 348: Doesn't your approach also require specialist skills? I often feel that the &quot;traditional&quot; versus &quot;molecular&quot; monitoring debate misses this point. Some comment on the training and development needs for those interested in applying the sedaDNA approach would be welcome. Otherwise it is an unfair comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>Whereas the application of high throughput sequencing technologies requires training, these technologies are well established with publicly available standard operating procedures. As compared to direct observations, high throughput sequencing provides replicable results regardless of the operator. Moreover, the application of metabarcoding to sedaDNA or more generally eDNA can be outsourced to established environmental services, removing the need for training if it is a limiting factor. The above has been included in discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 391: &quot;Significantly did&quot; what? &quot;Did significantly change over time&quot; would be better.</p></disp-quote><p>Done, thanks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 407: Should be &quot;an indicator of...&quot; and &quot;did not significantly change over time...&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Done, thanks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 408-410: Regulators are not necessarily interested in identifying past &quot;ecosystem shifts&quot;, so this does not seem to be the best way to contrast the capabilities of the sedaDNA approach with those of LTDI2. The real value of this work, in my opinion, is threefold. First, it shows that the reliance on diatoms as indicators of ecological status is inappropriate due to the relatively stable nature of diatom communities in the face of large environmental changes. Second, it presents some better alternatives, including both taxonomic and functional indicators. And third, it provides a new reference point for regulators by characterising &quot;semi-pristine&quot; conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the insightful suggestion. We agree with the reviewer on the advantages and have spelled them out in the resubmitted manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 445: What are &quot;housekeeping functions&quot;? I checked the Cuenca-Cambronero paper cited but did not find the term there.</p></disp-quote><p>Housekeeping functions are essential basic cellular functions that are evolutionary conserved. They are more commonly present in public databases because they have been characterised in a number of model species (e.g. Drosophila, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and Mus musculus). Our reference it not to the Cuenca-Cambronero paper, but to Mi et al, describing the reference database PANTHER. We included the definition of housekeeping functions in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 449: Briefly state the main functional changes found here.</p></disp-quote><p>Examples have been included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 451-452: Whilst this statement may be found in the cited source, most readers I suspect would not identify with it. Indeed, one could argue that most of freshwater ecology has been dedicated to this very task (documenting chemical impacts on biodiversity)! A more balanced view is needed here.</p></disp-quote><p>The sentence the reviewer refers to includes also reference to climate change. Climate change and chemical pollution are the two most common causes of biodiversity loss, and not only in freshwater ecosystems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 463-466: These examples both point to non-additive (synergistic) effects, which were not assessed in the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our explanation above about the inappropriate use of synergistic and, here, additive. We have altered the text throughout to use joint effects as we do not investigate synergistic, antagonistic and additive effects as traditionally described in ecology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 472-474: This sentence is unclear. Do you mean that this approach surpasses others in terms of reliability? If so, I don't believe this has been demonstrated in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise. The word ‘reliability’ should have not been in the text. We have improved the clarity of this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 474-482: In these sentences it is unclear whether or not you are talking about your method or contrasting it with another method(s). If the latter, which method or methods are you referring to?</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed this sentence to better reflect that our algorithm provides a high degree of confidence that surpasses state-of-the-art analysis, which predominantly identify patterns of co-occurrence of taxa within communities (e.g. Correlation-Centric Network).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 631: Should be &quot;Physico-chemical variables&quot;.

Every year? Every 5 years? Or were they pooled to represent the (as of yet unlisted) phases?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that details are not provided here. They are in methods. We have added some text to explain the basic concepts of how the core was obtained and sliced and refer the reader to the method section for more details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 154 the authors have not yet explicitly listed the lake phases, so it is difficult to refer to them now.</p></disp-quote><p>Noted, the addition of a short explanation at the beginning of the results section should take care of this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 216 - may be worth briefly explaining KEGG orthologs and how these relate to functional biodiversity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer. Also responding to a similar comment from Reviewer #1, we included a description of KO terms and their links to functional biodiversity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 249 - 260 instead of a supplementary table, it could remain in the main text</p></disp-quote><p>Supplementary table 2 is a multi-tab table including information for each region amplified here. It is not possible to include this table in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Materials and MethodsDue to the formatting of the manuscript (results &amp; discussion before materials and methods), many of the results are not clearly understood without having to visit the M&amp;M section. Particularly, how the biocide types were obtained (Historic records plus persistence of DDT in sediments). This could be resolved y including a few sentences on how the data was gathered in the results section. Overall, materials and methods are sufficient, however, it is not clear how many of the 37 metabarcoding samples correspond to which of the lake phases. Finally, I suggest a better organization of M&amp;Ms by having subheadings for each section. For example, under Biodiversity fingerprinting across 100 years, one subheading could de DNA extraction and sequencing, another subheading could be bioinformatics.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. To alleviate the issues linked to the methods section coming after the results section, we have introduced a short explanation of the sediments core and the lake phases at the beginning of the results section. A description of the climate and chemical data has been included at the beginning of the section ‘Drivers of biodiversity change’ in results. Subheadings were introduced in methods as suggested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
