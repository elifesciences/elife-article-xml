We reported that the bisacrylamide concentration required for ten-fold expansion was different between labs in Ashburn and Utrecht, and suggested that the user test a range of bis concentrations to ensure ten-fold expansion. We have identified the source of this discrepancy to be a difference in the TEMED stock concentration between labs. As a result, the experiments in Figures 3E-G, 4 and 5 were performed with 1.5% TEMED and 90 ppm bisacrylamide, while the other experiments were performed with the reported TREx concentrations of 0.15% TEMED and 50 ppm bisacrylamide. After discovering this difference, we have replicated the experiments in Figures 3E-G, 4 and 5 with 0.15% TEMED and 50 ppm bis and obtained indistinguishable results. We have corrected the manuscript as follows:</p><p><bold>#1 (Discussion)</bold></p><p>Original text:</p><p>Therefore, we based our TREx recipe on recipe family D. The exact crosslinker concentration that produces 10-fold expanding gels was found to vary between labs (i.e., 50 µg/mL in Ashburn, VA, USA versus 90 µg/mL in Utrecht, the Netherlands, possibly due to differences in gelation chamber design), so we recommend that each lab test a range of crosslinker concentrations between 30 and 100 µg/mL using their choice of specimen, gelation chamber, and incubator.</p><p>Revised text:</p><p>Therefore, we based our TREx recipe on recipe family D.
