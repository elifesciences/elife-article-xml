In mouse models, however, limitations are imposed by their small joint size and thin cartilage surfaces. Here we present a three-dimensional (3D) automated surface mapping system and methodology that allows for mechanical characterization of mouse cartilage with high spatial resolution. We performed repeated indentation mappings, followed by cartilage thickness measurement via needle probing, at 31 predefined positions distributed over the medial and lateral femoral condyles of healthy mice. High-resolution 3D x-ray microscopy (XRM) imaging was used to validate tissue thickness measurements. The automated indentation mapping was reproducible, and needle probing yielded cartilage thicknesses comparable to XRM imaging. When comparing healthy vs. degenerated cartilage, topographical variations in biomechanics were identified, with altered thickness and stiffness (instantaneous modulus) across condyles and within anteroposterior sub-regions. This quantitative technique comprehensively characterized cartilage function in mice femoral condyle cartilage. Hence, it has the potential to improve our understanding of tissue structure-function interplay in mouse models of repair and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cartilage</kwd><kwd>biomechanics</kwd><kwd>automated</kwd><kwd>thickness</kwd><kwd>stiffness</kwd><kwd>transgenic animals</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krawetz</surname><given-names>Roman J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The method presented here allows researchers to retrieve accurate and reproducible biomechanical properties of mouse cartilage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The articular cartilage in synovial joints has a specialized three-dimensional (3D) structure and biochemical composition that provide low-friction, wear-resistance, and load-bearing properties to the tissue. Mechanical loading is essential to tissue homeostasis and influences gene expression, chondrocyte metabolism, extracellular matrix maintenance, and associated interstitial fluid permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vincent and Wann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grodzinsky et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, the biomechanical properties of cartilage are unique indicators of tissue homeostasis versus degeneration. Indeed, research into cartilage-related changes during the development of degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA) has demonstrated that early tissue dysfunction involves loss of proteoglycans and increased water content, resulting in reduced compressive strength and higher tissue permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stolz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Setton et al., 1994</xref>). Disease progression leads to further structural damage and altered mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kleemann et al., 2005</xref>), ultimately resulting in tissue failure.</p><p>Mouse models are commonly used in pre-clinical studies focused on cartilage repair and pathophysiology of OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCoy, 2015</xref>). Mice are advantageous because of the well-established development of genetically modified strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helminen et al., 2002</xref>) and the availability of diverse model systems mimicking mechanisms of spontaneous and induced tissue degeneration and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bedelbaeva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kyostio-Moore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murphy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christiansen et al., 2015</xref>). In this regard, mouse models serve as powerful tools for the targeted assessment of cellular and molecular processes, and the discovery of novel therapeutics related to cartilage regeneration and OA. Yet, while the structural integrity and biochemical composition of murine cartilage are routinely assessed through histological and molecular approaches, the evaluation of how these features translate into mechanical function is limited. The main challenge in mechanical function assessment stems from the small joint size and thin cartilage found in mice relative to other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malda et al., 2013</xref>). Prior efforts to overcome these challenges include finite element modeling and optimization of small-scale indentation techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stolz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berteau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das Neves Borges et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Mechanical indentation (including atomic force microscopy [AFM] techniques), performed using either creep or stress-relaxation protocols, is widely employed for assessing the biomechanical behavior of cartilage and OA-related changes in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Athanasiou et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Risch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoch et al., 1983</xref>) and considered the gold standard for small animal joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lakin et al., 2017</xref>). Unlike confined and unconfined compression tests, no sectioning or subsampling of tissue (i.e. cylindrical explants) is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mansour, 2013</xref>). Instead, the cartilage tissue and its subchondral bone interface is kept intact, providing more physiologically relevant data. Indentation is also advantageous in that it is non-destructive and allows for repeated measures in situ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu and Mow, 2008</xref>). However, the natural curvature of joint articular surfaces poses a challenge to testing, as indentation must be conducted perpendicularly to the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Swann and Seedhom, 1989</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a novel automated indentation technique has been developed for the mechanical assessment of cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sim et al., 2017</xref>). This commercially available multi-axial apparatus (Mach-1, <italic>Biomomentum Inc,</italic> Laval, QC) is capable of detecting specimen surface orientation at each position of measurement and subsequently indent normal to the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biomomentum, 2020</xref>). As such, it can map entire cartilage surfaces using a single setup with high spatial density and has been previously shown to discriminate between healthy and diseased human cartilage samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seidenstuecker et al., 2019</xref>). This apparatus has been recently employed by Woods and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woods et al., 2021</xref>) to evaluate altered biomechanics in a mouse model of cartilage degeneration. However, the study was conducted in the non-load-bearing region of the mouse knee joint. Considering that the knee range of motion in mice is between 40 and 145<sup>o</sup> (i.e. unable to fully extend) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jia et al., 2018</xref>), with normal gait range between 90.5 and 120<sup>o</sup> (extension-flexion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2017</xref>), the contact regions in the distal femoral condyles are located further posteriorly. Careful consideration of species-specific differences in knee joint anatomy and kinematics is imperative for proper translation of pre-clinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oláh et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Woods and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woods et al., 2021</xref>) were also unable to account for site-specific cartilage thickness variations in their measurements, instead of using the mean cartilage thickness obtained via histological analysis in their assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woods et al., 2021</xref>). Other studies have employed mean cartilage thickness values retrieved through histology or imaging techniques to characterize and model tissue mechanical parameters in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das Neves Borges et al., 2014</xref>). Implicit in this approach is the underlying assumption that cartilage thickness is relatively uniform among medial and lateral compartments (e.g. femoral condyles or tibial plateaus), and along their anteroposterior or mediolateral axis. Yet, regional variations in thickness are recognized within these cartilage surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das Neves Borges et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2005</xref>) and known to impact small-scale indentation measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Swann and Seedhom, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayes et al., 1972</xref>).</p><p>Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of automated indentation mapping in the assessment of healthy femoral articular cartilage in mice and characterize site-specific variations in cartilage thickness. We also employed concurrent contrast-enhanced 3D x-ray microscopy (XRM) imaging to validate the cartilage thickness measurements from our optimized needle probing (NP) protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jurvelin et al., 1995</xref>). Finally, this approach was used to investigate biomechanical differences in a clinically relevant mouse model of cartilage degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhee et al., 2005</xref>). Together, we show that automated indentation is reliable and able to characterize topographic and mechanical variations across condyle cartilage locations in intact cartilage. Moreover, this technique was able to identify regional changes in cartilage thickness and stiffness in degenerated cartilage. A comprehensive and standardized biomechanical evaluation of cartilage in repair and disease can greatly contribute to our understanding of tissue structure-function interplay, thereby enhancing the clinical relevance of mouse models in this area.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Automated indentation mapping reliability</title><p>While previous studies have employed indentation mapping on mouse cartilage, to our knowledge none has reported on its precision and test-retest reliability. Therefore, we performed three repeated mappings of 31 predefined positions distributed over the femoral condyles of 10 C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to assess the reliability of the automated surface indentation technique. The setup was developed and optimized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) to assess the load-bearing regions of the femoral condyles and achieve non-destructive retrieval of specimen post-testing for subsequent 3D XRM imaging analysis. The imposed step deformation (i.e. indentation depth) on the femoral cartilage yielded typical stress-relaxation behavior, characterized by a sharp increase in force followed by gradual relaxation over time until equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Assessment of stress-relaxation and corresponding force-displacement curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) demonstrated consistency among repeated measurements for single positions and visible differences in peak reaction forces between condyles. These observations were further evidenced by the spatial distribution of peak force values across condylar testing sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A total of 930 indentation measurements were retrieved, out of which only 21 produced atypical curves (7 testing sites at specimen’s periphery with higher angles yielded noisy signals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), representing a 2.26% error rate during data acquisition. High reliability and absolute agreement between repeated measures for individual testing sites were observed, with 4.7% intra-assay average coefficient of variation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and intraclass correlation coefficients – ICC (lower 95%, upper 95%) – ranging from 0.974 (0.966, 0.981) for the lateral condyle to 0.971 (0.963, 0.978) for the medial condyle. Mean peak force values illustrate site-specific variations within and between condyles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The lateral condyle values varied significantly per position (p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.0001), ranging from 0.07 to 0.15 N and showed a trend for higher values at outermost positions, with a slight decrease in force posteriorly. The latter was also seen for the medial condyle, wherein heterogeneities in peak force were apparent (p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.0001) and had a wider range – from 0.15 to 0.294 N. Since the analysis per testing site also reflects inherent deviations due to anatomical positioning across specimens, data was pooled for regional (between condyles) and sub-regional (between and within anteroposterior locations) comparisons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Indentation mapping of murine articular cartilage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of experimental design employed for biomechanical testing of murine articular cartilage using Mach-1 v500css mechanical tester.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, reconstructed 3D datasets of murine distal femurs allowed us to validate the spatial distribution of NP testing sites, whereby the corresponding region of interest (ROI) coordinates for imaging processing could be determined. Additionally, the two-dimensional slices confirmed that the needle probe pierced the full length of the cartilage, reaching the subchondral bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The cartilage surface and cartilage-subchondral bone interface positions were identified using the load-displacement curves from NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and the cartilage thickness for each position was then calculated considering the surface angle (see Methods section for details). There was a 2.58% rate of needle probe failure (8 out of 310 measurements, testing sites near the specimen’s edge) during data acquisition. NP and contrast enhanced XRM imaging yielded similar cartilage thickness distributions on both condyles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), demonstrating a highly significant correlation between paired values (<italic>R</italic>=0.842, n=302, p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Moreover, no significant differences were found between pairwise mean thickness values (NP vs. XRM) for individual positions within the lateral condyle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Similar results were shown for the medial condyle, wherein higher mean thickness values from XRM were only seen on M06 (∆=8.68 µm, p<italic>=</italic>0.028), M11 (∆=9.89 µm, p&lt;0.01), and M13 (∆=9.34 µm, p<italic>=</italic>0.012) testing sites.

Instantaneous modulus was calculated using Hayes et al. elastic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayes et al., 1972</xref>) at 20% strain, wherein linear elastic behavior can be assumed, and instantaneous response is considered as flow-independent (<italic>Poisson’s</italic> ratio, υ=0.5 assumed; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong, 1986</xref>). Regardless of femoral condyle, instantaneous stiffness demonstrated no significant correlation to thickness variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>).

Compared to recent mouse studies using this commercially available apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woods et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lavoie et al., 2015</xref>), the optimization of sample mounting and NP protocols allowed for unprecedented quantitative mapping of the mechanical behavior and associated cartilage thickness on load-bearing regions of distal femurs with higher spatial density.</p><p>For healthy, 4-month-old C57BL/6 mice, test-retest micro-indentation measurements were reproducible at any given testing site, also indicating that the instantaneous deformation and sustained compression steps in the stress-relaxation protocol did not compromise the mechanical behavior of the freshly harvested cartilage tissue. Heterogeneity in peak forces was identified across anatomical locations. Notably, the medial condyle surface yielded approximately two times higher peak forces on average than its lateral counterpart. Moreover, both condyles displayed a shift toward lower values at posterior regions. Previous studies have shown significant variation in mechanical properties within different cartilage surfaces in healthy joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Korhonen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Froimson et al., 1997</xref>), or even over a single surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoch et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Samosky et al., 2005</xref>). Considering the structural and material 3D complexities of articular cartilage, it is intuitive that reaction forces in indentation response are influenced by depth of indentation and applied strain rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae et al., 2006</xref>). As thickness variations across the cartilage surfaces are unknown prior to indentation test, the relative intra-tissue strain at each testing site varied due to the fixed indentation depth imposed, thereby influencing the measured reaction forces. In general, higher peak reaction forces in intact cartilage were associated with lower thickness values. However, the effect of site-specific cartilage geometry, such as thickness, when characterizing the mechanical properties of cartilage in indentation is often overlooked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moshtagh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Studies in mice commonly rely on mean thickness values from histology, requiring longer turnaround and lacking spatial specificity. The optimized NP protocol used here was able to resolve spatial thickness variations across condyle surfaces and closely localizes cartilage thickness measures to the footprint of indentation on mouse distal femurs. Moreover, 3D visualization of the femoral cartilage surfaces after XRM imaging validated the positioning and distribution of the testing grid used, allowing us to pinpoint individual testing sites and compute their thicknesses. A highly significant correlation between pairwise cartilage thickness values from NP and XRM, per measurement site, was observed. Variations seen between averaged thickness values could be explained by differences in instrument resolution capabilities (Mach-1 z-axis: 0.5 µm vs XRM: 4.39 µm voxel size) and partial volume artifacts, which may affect the accuracy of tissue detection on the XRM segmentation. It is worth noting, however, that previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das Neves Borges et al., 2014</xref>) on murine cartilage thickness has been performed using greater voxel sizes. Compromise of cartilage integrity by NP likely contributes to observed differences as well, leading to higher XRM measurements, possibly due to tissue swelling. Comparable mean cartilage thickness values between NP and XRM segmentation from contralateral femurs not subjected to biomechanical testing support this conclusion. Nevertheless, mean thickness values were in line with earlier reports for mouse cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oláh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Poulet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kotwal et al., 2012</xref>), with marked greater cartilage thicknesses measured on the lateral condyle compared to the medial counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malda et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Localized cartilage thickness measurements by NP enabled us to account for the effect of cartilage geometry on indentation, with implementation of aspect ratio (indenter radius-to-cartilage-thickness) corrections as per Hayes’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayes et al., 1972</xref>) analytical formulation when calculating compressive stiffness distributions at 20% strain (considered as physiological loading; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simha et al., 2007</xref>). A common area of concern in in situ indentation of thin materials, such as mouse articular cartilage, is the effect of substrates on the measured mechanical properties, wherein the indentation response of articular cartilage could be somewhat influenced by the underlying rigid bone, especially on thinner areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Julkunen et al., 2008</xref>). While we recognize this limitation when employing microindentation, we argue that knowledge of thickness variations improves the reliability of the indentation assessment and aids interpretation of results following degradation and loss. According to the present results, there was no significant variation in mean thickness of healthy cartilage over a condyle surface, therefore biomechanical parameters were compared between matched regions and sub-regions when assessing degeneration.</p><p><inline-graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif" xlink:href="elife-74664-inf001-v2.gif"/>Compared to C57BL/6 control, the loss of <italic>Prg4</italic> function resulted in an increase in thickness and decrease in stiffness of the knee cartilage in 16-week-old mice. This is consistent with previous observations on hip articular cartilage of <italic>Prg4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (same age), using AFM indentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coles et al., 2010</xref>). Apparent modulus values in our study were about an order of magnitude larger than those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coles et al., 2010</xref> for <italic>Prg4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and healthy controls, a discrepancy we attribute to differences in compression rate (1 μm/s <italic>vs</italic> 20 μm/s) and indentation scale (micro- <italic>vs.</italic> nanoindentation depth), leading to differences in strain fields, and the level of structure that is probed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae et al., 2006</xref>). It is worth noting that anatomical locations of assessment also differed between studies. The cartilage thickness values determined by NP in our study are in a similar range to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karamchedu et al., 2016</xref>. In their micro-CT imaging study, the <italic>Prg4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice displayed cartilage thickness averaging 61.0±4.3 µm and 42.4±2.6 µm for the load-bearing regions of the lateral and medial condyle, respectively.

We attribute that to differences in thickening in <italic>Prg4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> femoral cartilage compared to controls, 12.6 vs 41% on lateral and medial condyles, respectively, as well as <italic>Prg4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> compromised structural integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drewniak et al., 2012</xref>) having a bigger functional impact on the medial compartment, recognized as the main load-bearing region in most mammalian joints. Microscale indentation characterizes the overall tissue resistance to deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simha et al., 2007</xref>) and disrupted architecture, and composition can impart tissue mechanical response. Due to the rapid compression rate employed in the present protocol, normal cartilage tissue is expected to deform with minimal change in volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong, 1986</xref>), as its low permeability restrains fluid flow; thereby localizing the strain near the surface as fluid pressure pushes against the collagen meshwork. Thus, under instantaneous (rapid) loading the ability of cartilage to resist compression is known to be affected by the collagen fibril meshwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Julkunen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laasanen et al., 2003</xref>), particularly tangentially oriented collagen fibrils on the superficial tissue layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Korhonen et al., 2002</xref>). In <italic>Prg4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, the normal parallel organization of collagen fibrils adjacent to the surface is known to be disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jay et al., 2007</xref>), likely affecting fluid pressurization, helping explain the lower instantaneous modulus compared to controls.</p><p>Limitations of this study include evaluation of the anatomy of the distal murine femoral condyles and not the opposing articulation (i.e. proximal tibia). Also, we focused on a single timepoint of analysis; however, investigations related to aging and progressive degeneration are of interest as they are known to affect the biochemical composition and structural integrity of cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rahmati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Julkunen et al., 2009a</xref>), thereby influencing its mechanical properties. Finally, due to the biphasic/poroviscoelastic nature of cartilage, future studies should consider the use of more complex analytical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mow et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Julkunen et al., 2009b</xref>) that are able to capture the time-dependent viscoelastic behavior of cartilage in mice.</p><p>In this study, we have gained insights into the patterns of varying surface geometry and mechanics present within murine articular cartilage at the microscale. 3D indentation mapping was able to resolve site-specific differences in thickness and mechanical properties across knee cartilage surfaces in healthy mice.

This technique could also prove helpful for the study of other mouse models mimicking different mechanisms of, or therapies focused on, repair and degeneration of articular cartilage, as microscale indentation with high spatial density can provide a more comprehensive characterization of cartilage’s mechanical properties.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).

This customized setup allowed for simple and proper positioning of the sample, exposing the load-bearing region of the condyles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jia et al., 2018</xref>) for data acquisition, as well as non-destructive retrieval of samples after testing, such that subsequent XRM imaging could be carried out. A standardized mapping grid (n=31 positions) was superimposed on an image of the cartilage surface, consisting of 14 and 17 measurement sites at the lateral and medial condyles, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The testing chamber was filled with PBS solution at room temperature, and the tissue was allowed to equilibrate before testing. Automated indentation mapping under stress-relaxation was then performed using the Mach-1 v500css (Biomomentum Inc, Laval, QC) device, equipped with a calibrated multiple-axis load cell (±17 N, 3.5-mN force resolution) and associated software.

Then, by concurrently moving Mach-1 stages in all three-axis at different speeds, indentation can be performed along a virtual axis normal to the surface.

Many claims are made regarding the novelty of the work but these are generally minor advances and the claims are overstated. Overall there are major fundamental limitations with the method being used. The validation of the needle-probe thickness measure is a novel aspect of the work.</p><p>1. In many cases, it is noted that certain aspects of the studies have not been performed previously, but the overall rationale and motivation for doing so is missing. Thus it is not clear how this work is truly different than several previous studies. Primary example is &quot; This apparatus has been recently employed by Woods and colleagues to evaluate altered biomechanics in a mouse model of cartilage degeneration. However, the study was conducted in the non-load-bearing region of the mouse knee joint.&quot; The advance is to apply this technique to a different region of the joint, and to a mouse model that has already been shown to show degenerative changes.</p><p>2. Much of the reporting focuses on peak force. This value is highly dependent on indenter size, rate of loading, etc. and thus is not meaningful, as compared to intrinsic cartilage properties.</p><p>3. The authors comment that previous studies on indentation mapping have not measured its accuracy. This is not possible, nor was the accuracy of the modulus measurements made here. In general, many of the claims about novelty of this study are overstated.</p><p>4. There are several technical issues. For example, the surface of the joint is curved yet indentation is not adjusted to be performed perpendicular to the surface. This can have a significant effect on the measurements. Was the &quot;shift&quot; in values in the posterior area corrected for this curvature? What was the contact region of the indenter at these angles of indentation?</p><p>5. The study focuses on instantaneous modulus, which is only a single measure of cartilage properties and cannot be used in predictive modeling. There is no comparison of the current findings to those of previous mouse indentation modulus values. In fact, the numbers reported here seem to be an order of magnitude higher than previous reports.</p><p>6. The modulus of Prg4 mouse cartilage was reported already (although not in site-specific manner). Again the claims of novelty are overstated and no comparison is made to previous reports.</p><p>7. How is statistical analysis handled for comparison of so many values? It is not clear that the proper corrections are made for multivariate analysis at all the different sites.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74664.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

However, we would like to point out that the average difference between cartilage thickness measurements for the medial condyle ranged from 5.5 to 7.8 µm, representing 1.25 to 1.77-pixel difference. The XRM resolution (4.4 µm/pixel) allowed for eight to ten pixels across the cartilage thickness, which may affect the accuracy of tissue detection. Partial volume artifacts could further affect the segmentation, but previous research [1] has been performed using pixel sizes greater (5 μm/pixel, for example) than those used in our work.</p><p>Based on our existing and new data, we stand by our previous claim that resolution and partial volume artifacts are confounding factors on comparisons between NP and XRM point-specific thickness measurements as, proportionally, these would have a bigger impact on thinner regions. Compromise of cartilage integrity by needle probing could have also contributed to differences in point-specific thickness values between methodologies (likely leading to overestimation by XRM segmentation due to tissue swelling and partial volume artifacts). Thus, we completed image processing of previously harvested and imaged contralateral legs (<italic>n</italic>=5) of the same C57Bl6 mice that had not undergone mechanical testing (i.e., indentation/needle probing). The resulting heatmaps of cartilage thickness distributions across femoral condyles pointed to thicker cartilage on the lateral condyle, with mean cartilage thicknesses of 40.63 ± 2.14 µm and 56.99 ± 6.26 μm for the medial and lateral condyle surfaces, respectively. These values were in line with mean thickness values retrieved from NP (Table 2) and XRM post-NP (Table S2). We added two sentences regarding these results, and the image below was added to manuscript as supplementary Figure S3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to indentation thickness and substrate effects: Please acknowledge this phenomenon and pitfalls associated with mechanical indentation of thin materials in the discussion.

Blocks of rigid polyurethane foam PCF5 and PCF50 (Sawbone, Maomoe, Sweden) with 1148MPa and 16MPa compression modulus (ASTM D1621) respectively, where cut into 2cm x 2cm x 1cm thick samples prior to testing. Indentation was performed across five adjacent testing sites using two different size indenters (0.3mm and 1.0 mm in diameter) up to 40% strain. Load-displacement data was reproducible across indentation sites. Rise in reaction forces for bigger probing size (comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref> and 1C for same substrate type) are a result of different contact areas and intra-specimen stress-strains. A 2-to-3.33-fold increase in peak force for same indentation depth and substrate, however, corresponded to ≤ 2MPa difference in instantaneous modulus. As for substrate effects, a 7000% increase in substrate modulus (1148MPa <italic>vs</italic> 16Mpa) led to 1.38-to-2.29-fold increase in peak force and less than a 2-fold increase on the average instantaneous modulus at 20% strain, for both indenter sizes<italic>.</italic> Thus, indentation response is somewhat influenced by indenter-radius-to-sample-thickness ratio (aspect ratio) and substrate, with increasing reaction forces, but Hayes <italic>et al.</italic> (1972) scaling factor correction reduces sensitivity of derived elastic modulus to sample thickness (aspect ratio) and substrate material contributions. The average instantaneous modulus retrieved for PCF50 under indentation was 850.9 ± 23.8 MPa (0.3 indenter) and 885.4 ± 48.6 Mpa (1.0 indenter). The difference in measured and reported modulus are due to test differences, indentation versus uniaxial compression, respectively. In this study, a strain higher than 0.2% could not be achieved for this rigid material because the maximum force criteria set as per manufacturer recommendation (to avoid small indenter tip damage) was reached with minimal deformation.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Indentation protocol for substrate effect testing, at an indentation rate of 0.1mm/s, at a maximum 40% strain.

This can be further corroborated by close inspection of 3D PTA-XRM images (Author response mage 2), wherein no surface changes indicative of permanent deformation was observed on femurs subjected to indentation testing only (A), nor adjacent to the clearly visible needle probing sites on samples that underwent indentation followed by needle probing (B). Figure 2 has been updated in the manuscript by adding the zoomed in image displaying needle probing markings (A).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Representative 3D PTA-XRM volume renderings of distal femoral condyles subjected to indentation testing (A) and indentation followed by needle probing (B).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-74664-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>RSME should be corrected on lines 403 to RMSE.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study uses a commercial instrument to map the mechanical properties of cartilage in the mouse knee. Many claims are made regarding the novelty of the work but these are generally minor advances and the claims are overstated. Overall there are major fundamental limitations with the method being used. The validation of the needle-probe thickness measure is a novel aspect of the work.</p><p>1. In many cases, it is noted that certain aspects of the studies have not been performed previously, but the overall rationale and motivation for doing so is missing. Thus it is not clear how this work is truly different than several previous studies. Primary example is &quot; This apparatus has been recently employed by Woods and colleagues to evaluate altered biomechanics in a mouse model of cartilage degeneration. However, the study was conducted in the non-load-bearing region of the mouse knee joint.&quot; The advance is to apply this technique to a different region of the joint, and to a mouse model that has already been shown to show degenerative changes.</p></disp-quote><p>While we respect the reviewers opinion, we do not agree with their interpretation of the novelty or importance/impact of our study. This study is novel and impactful because of the following reasons:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It is the first to map biomechanical properties at multiple, spatially distributed testing sites across murine femoral condyle surfaces and on the load-bearing part of the joint [The study indicated by the reviewer – Woods et al., was undertaken in a region of the joint that is non-load bearing in the mouse and therefore has minimal physiological relevance].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Despite the use of this commercially available mechanical apparatus in previous studies, no one has yet to report on the precision and repeatability of indentation measurements for mouse cartilage has been previously demonstrated. Therefore, this is an essential finding to allow researchers/the field to have confidence in the methodology.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Needle probing cartilage mapping has never been successfully undertaken in mice, and as the reviewer stated themselves, this is the first time point-by-point validation of cartilage thickness measurements has been performed, as opposed to mean thickness comparisons that the field has relied on up to now.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We decided to use popular mouse model of reproducible cartilage degeneration in the study – the Prg4 knockout because of two main reasons. The first is that it is spontaneous and doesn’t rely on injury/intervention as these types of models have shown various differences in disease trajectories and cartilage degeneration depending on the lab performing the experiments. The second reason, is that the cartilage mechanical properties of the Prg4 knockout have already been reported in the literature and this is essential for the validation of the methodology – it is essential to compare our findings with that of a reproducible, spontaneous model of cartilage degeneration with minimal bias that could be introduced into the system by the ones performing the research. Our method not only showed spatial variation in stiffness and thickness for the degenerated cartilage in Prg4 knockout mouse, but was also comparable to previously published literature. This is a considerable strength in our experimental design and not a weakness as the reviewer believes.</p></list-item></list><p>We added a statement about the benefits of using spontaneous models of cartilage degeneration, such as <italic>Prg4</italic> knockout mice, to corroborate the use of this mouse model when validating the methodology employed in our study. Based on reviewer’s comments we also expanded on comparisons of current findings to previous studies (see response to comments 5 below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Much of the reporting focuses on peak force. This value is highly dependent on indenter size, rate of loading, etc. and thus is not meaningful, as compared to intrinsic cartilage properties.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that peak force is dependent on indenter size and other indentation testing parameters. That being said, reporting focused on peak force was used to investigate test-retest reliability of the mechanical apparatus regarding murine cartilage measurements. To that extent, raw data is more compelling than processed data, which in the end is required for calculation of intrinsic cartilage properties anyways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors comment that previous studies on indentation mapping have not measured its accuracy. This is not possible, nor was the accuracy of the modulus measurements made here. In general, many of the claims about novelty of this study are overstated.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment and would like to rectify the use of the term “accuracy”. Previous studies on mouse cartilage indentation mapping have not demonstrated the precision and repeatability of indentation measurements from the apparatus used.</p><p>We edited the manuscript clarifying that our study investigated the precision and test-retest reliability, not accuracy, of the proposed automated indentation mapping technique for mouse articular cartilage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There are several technical issues. For example, the surface of the joint is curved yet indentation is not adjusted to be performed perpendicular to the surface. This can have a significant effect on the measurements. Was the &quot;shift&quot; in values in the posterior area corrected for this curvature? What was the contact region of the indenter at these angles of indentation?</p></disp-quote><p>It appears that the reviewer misunderstood the methodology used in the paper and we would be happy to make it clearer in the methods section, however this comment is incorrect. We would like to clarify that Biomomentum’s mechanical tester was developed to overcome such limitations. Specifically, it detects the height and orientation of the surface at the XY position using four adjacent contact coordinates to each testing site (front, back, left, and right) in a 0.075mm scanning. Then, indentation is performed by simultaneously moving the three stages of the tester at different speeds, which allows the spherical indenter to be moved along a virtual axis normal to the surface of the sample. In sum, by identifying the surface orientation, the apparatus can correct for surface curvature before indentation measurement allowing for testing of curved surface, like the joints. Contact regions for surface angles ≥ 60<sup>o</sup> are unreliable and thus discarded.</p><p>We edited the Methods section in the manuscript and clarified how the Mach-1 mechanical tester is capable of identifying surface orientation prior to indentation measurement and thus, perform indentation normal to the surface of angled samples (like the femoral condyle). Of note, similar description highlighting such capabilities and its advantage had already been reported on the manuscript’s introduction (lines 69-76).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The study focuses on instantaneous modulus, which is only a single measure of cartilage properties and cannot be used in predictive modeling. There is no comparison of the current findings to those of previous mouse indentation modulus values. In fact, the numbers reported here seem to be an order of magnitude higher than previous reports.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment and would be happy to include further comparisons to previous studies in the field. Indeed, given cartilage’s poro-viscoelastic nature, its compressive modulus magnitude can be affected by the rate of loading to which it is subjected. It has already been demonstrated that the compressive modulus determined at shorter loading times (instantaneous compression), can be greater than modulus retrieved at lower speed indentations. We also used freshly harvested rather than frozen-thawed samples.</p><p>We added a couple sentences addressing comparisons to other studies and differences between studies that can explain such discrepancy in indentation values, as abovementioned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The modulus of Prg4 mouse cartilage was reported already (although not in site-specific manner). Again the claims of novelty are overstated and no comparison is made to previous reports.</p></disp-quote><p>This is the first time microscale automated indentation combined with needle probing mapping has been used to identify regional changes on Proteoglycan 4 knockout mice distal femurs. Previous studies using the same mouse strain, employed different techniques (AFM, Histology, microCT) and/or assessed other joint tissues (hip, ankle). Changes in thickness and stiffness in Prg4 knockout mice were in line with these studies and we would be happy to further expand on comparisons with previous reports.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. How is statistical analysis handled for comparison of so many values? It is not clear that the proper corrections are made for multivariate analysis at all the different sites.</p></disp-quote><p>Post hoc test was used for multiple comparison correction, and this was done up to the standard of what is published in the field. However, we would be happy to further explain it in the methods section.</p><p>[1] Das Neves Borges, P., Forte, A. E., Vincent, T. L., Dini, D. &amp; Marenzana, M.
