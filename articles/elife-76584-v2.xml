Here, we took advantage of the mutualism between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</italic> (Lp) to investigate a novel mechanism of host-symbiont interaction. Using chemically defined diets, we found that association with Lp improves the growth of larvae-fed amino acid-imbalanced diets, even though Lp cannot produce the limiting amino acid. We show that in this context Lp supports its host’s growth through a molecular dialogue that requires functional operons encoding ribosomal and transfer RNAs (r/tRNAs) in Lp and the general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase in <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s enterocytes. Our data indicate that Lp’s r/tRNAs are packaged in extracellular vesicles and activate GCN2 in a subset of larval enterocytes, a mechanism necessary to remodel the intestinal transcriptome and ultimately to support anabolic growth. Based on our findings, we propose a novel beneficial molecular dialogue between host and microbes, which relies on a non-canonical role of GCN2 as a mediator of non-nutritional symbiotic cues encoded by r/tRNA operons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>symbiosis</kwd><kwd><italic>Lactobacillus</italic></kwd><kwd>GCN2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20180339196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grenier</surname><given-names>Théodore</given-names></name><name><surname>Consuegra</surname><given-names>Jessika</given-names></name><name><surname>Akherraz</surname><given-names>Houssam</given-names></name><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Longwei</given-names></name><name><surname>Rahioui</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name><name><surname>Da Silva</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name><name><surname>Gillet</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Sandrine</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramos</surname><given-names>Cathy I</given-names></name><name><surname>Matos</surname><given-names>Renata C</given-names></name><name><surname>Leulier</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPF20170938612</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Consuegra</surname><given-names>Jessika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bacterial ribosomal and transfer RNAs are symbiotic clues sensed by host general control nonderepressible 2 to support <italic>Drosophila</italic> systemic growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals have evolved and live in symbiosis with a great diversity of microbes. Symbiotic microbes strongly influence various aspects of their host’s physiology, metabolism, and behaviour. The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (hereinafter referred to as <italic>Drosophila</italic>) is a powerful model to study the mechanisms underlying the interactions between host and symbiotic microbes. Indeed, <italic>Drosophila</italic> harbours simple bacterial communities, which individual components can be cultured aerobically. Moreover, <italic>Drosophila</italic> can easily be bred axenically, allowing gnotobiotic studies. Finally, <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s main bacterial symbionts can be genetically engineered, enabling deep mechanistical studies on both the host side and the microbe side. In the past decade, <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s symbiotic microbes were shown to modulate their host’s post-embryonic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Storelli et al., 2011</xref>), reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elgart et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gould et al., 2018</xref>), lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Keebaugh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yamada et al., 2015</xref>), metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gnainsky et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kamareddine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Newell and Douglas, 2014</xref>), immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Iatsenko et al., 2018</xref>), social behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sharon et al., 2010</xref>), and food preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>). The mechanisms underpinning these phenomena often rely on symbiotic cues: molecules produced by symbiotic microbes that interact with the host’s signalling pathways. Symbiotic cues can be nutrients: for instance, amino acids (AA) produced by symbiotic bacteria can inhibit the production of the neuropeptide CNMamide in the gut, which represses preference for AA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, symbiotic cues can be non-nutritional. Sensing of symbiotic bacteria’s cell wall components by gut cells leads to the production of digestive enzymes, which helps the larva digest the dietary polypeptides and improves its systemic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Erkosar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Matos et al., 2017</xref>). Acetate produced by symbiotic microbes alters the epigenome of enteroendocrine cells, which stimulates the secretion of the hormone tachykinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jugder et al., 2021</xref>). Tachykinin then promotes lipid utilisation in nearby enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kamareddine et al., 2018</xref>). Beyond these examples, we posit that symbiotic cues may be widespread in <italic>Drosophila</italic>-microbes symbiosis but their nature remains elusive. Hence, identifying them is an important goal of the field of host-symbionts interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Selosse et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we sought to identify additional non-nutritional symbiotic cues that allow <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s symbiotic bacteria to influence the physiology of their host. As a readout, we used <italic>Drosophila</italic>‘s post-embryonic systemic growth. <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s growth phase (larval stages) depends widely on the nutritional environment: larvae reach metamorphosis (pupariation) in 4–5 days in optimal nutritional conditions or up to 15–20 days in severe malnutrition conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erkosar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tennessen and Thummel, 2011</xref>). Nutrition regulates larval systemic growth through the action of nutrient-sensing regulatory pathways, especially AA-sensing pathways. The main AA (or lack of) sensing pathways are the target-of-rapamycin (TOR) kinase pathway and the general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gallinetti et al., 2013</xref>). Both kinases were first described in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dever et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heitman et al., 1991</xref>) and orthologous pathways were found in virtually all eukaryotes, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Olsen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). The TOR kinase forms two protein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2, which can be activated by many cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Laplante and Sabatini, 2009</xref>). Especially, mTORC1 responds to high intracellular AA levels through the action of AA transporters and AA-binding cytosolic proteins; conversely, AA scarcity represses TOR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goberdhan et al., 2016</xref>). Once activated, TOR increases translation through phosphorylation of 4E-BP and S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ma and Blenis, 2009</xref>) and promotes systemic growth of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colombani et al., 2003</xref>). GCN2 is activated by several cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donnelly et al., 2013</xref>, p. 2). The best-characterized cue is the quantity of uncharged tRNAs, a signature of hampered protein synthesis reflecting a scarcity in intracellular AA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Masson, 2019</xref>). Activation of GCN2 causes a global translational repression through phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Teske et al., 2011</xref>) except for a subset of mRNAs which translation is increased. Among these mRNAs, transcription factors such as ATF4 then promote adaptation to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harding et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to its cell-autonomous effects, the GCN2 pathway has systemic effects in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Ubiquitous knock-down of GCN2 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae causes developmental delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Malzer et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, GCN2 is involved in the regulation of other physiological processes. Activation of GCN2 in dopaminergic neurons of the larval brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bjordal et al., 2014</xref>) or in the enterocytes of adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2021</xref>) trigger a marked behavioural response leading to the avoidance of diets with an imbalanced AA composition. In addition, GCN2 in adult enterocytes regulates gut plasticity in response to AA/sugar imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonfini et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, GCN2 in the midgut or in the fat body is necessary for lifespan extension under dietary restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, GCN2 in the fat body represses reproduction under AA scarcity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although undernutrition greatly delays the development of germ-free (GF) <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (i.e. larvae lacking a microbiota), such delay can be buffered by the association of GF larvae with certain strains of symbiotic microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gould et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Keebaugh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Storelli et al., 2011</xref>). Growth promotion relies partly on nutrient provision: for instance, the symbiotic bacterium <italic>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</italic> (formerly named <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>], hereinafter referred to as Lp) can provide certain AA, which allows the larva to grow in the absence of these specific AA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Consuegra et al., 2020b</xref>). We sought to identify mechanisms of growth promotion that do not rely on AA provision. Therefore, we used a holidic diet (HD, diet composed of purified nutrients) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Piper et al., 2017</xref>) to create AA imbalance by specifically decreasing the quantity of an AA that Lp cannot synthesise. Interestingly, we found that Lp can still promote larval growth in these conditions. The mechanism thus does not rely on AA provision nor on stimulation of intestinal proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Erkosar et al., 2015</xref>) because the HD contains only free AA. Instead, we found that it depends on the production of ribosomal and transfer RNA (r/tRNA) by Lp, which are released in extracellular vesicles and lead to the activation of GCN2 in enterocytes. GCN2 activation results in a remodelling of the gut transcriptome towards epithelium maturation and altered metabolic activity, which may support systemic growth. Our study suggests that on top of its canonical role as a cellular sensor of uncharged eukaryotic tRNA, GCN2 is also a mediator of non-nutritional symbiotic cues encoded by bacterial r/tRNA operons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Association with Lp rescues AA imbalance</title><p>We used an HD which AA composition is based on <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s exome (FLY AA diet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Piper et al., 2017</xref>). This diet is well balanced in AA and allows optimal reproduction, lifespan, and growth. AA imbalance can be generated by decreasing the concentration of any essential AA (EAA), which then becomes limiting for animal fitness. Imbalanced diets cause defects in <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s growth, reproduction, and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Piper et al., 2017</xref>). In a previous study, we used HD to identify which AA can be synthesised by Lp and provided to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. Lp cannot rescue the development of larvae on a diet that completely lacks an EAA that it cannot synthesise such as isoleucine, leucine, and valine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Consuegra et al., 2020b</xref>). Here, we wondered whether or not Lp could rescue the effects of AA imbalance due to limitations in EAA. To this end, we selectively decreased the concentration of each EAA by 70% from the FLY AA diet and measured the time of development of larvae (expressed as D50, i.e. the median time of entry into metamorphosis). As expected, decreasing the concentration of any EAA caused growth delay in GF larvae. Decreasing the amount of certain EAA (Ile, Lys, Thr, Trp, Val) completely blocked the development of GF larvae, which stalled at the L2 or L3 stage. Decreasing the amount of the other EAA (Arg, His, Met, Leu, Phe) caused an important developmental delay in GF larvae compared to the FLY AA diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In order to compare the different conditions, we aimed at finding a setup in which GF larvae are able to reach pupariation, with a strong developmental delay. We thus imposed a less severe AA imbalance by only decreasing the concentration of each EAA by 60%. We observed a similar trend: decreasing the amount of Ile, Lys, Thr, Trp, or Val yielded an important developmental delay in GF larvae, whereas decreasing the amount of Arg, His, Met, Leu, or Phe resulted in a minor developmental delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This confirms that some EAA seem to be more important than others for the development of GF larvae; alternatively, it is possible that the FLY AA diet does not contain enough of these EAA (Ile, Lys, Thr, Trp, Val) and too much of the others (Arg, His, Met, Leu, Phe).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>L. plantarum</italic> (Lp) rescues the developmental delay due to amino acid (AA) imbalance.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Developmental timing of germ-free (GF) larvae (grey) and Lp-associated larvae (green) on FLY AA diets with a –70% (<bold>A</bold>) or –60% (<bold>B</bold>) decrease in each essential AA (EAA).

Lp’s genome does not encode the enzymes necessary for the synthesis of branched-chained AA (BCAA: leucine, isoleucine, and valine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Saguir and de Nadra, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Teusink et al., 2005</xref>), and thus Lp cannot provide them to <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Consuegra et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we were interested by the fact that Lp could rescue the developmental delay caused by BCAA limitation. We decided to focus on diets limited in valine (Val) to decipher the mechanisms underlying such beneficial effect of Lp on the growth of its host. We thereafter refer to the FLY AA diet as ‘balanced diet’, and to the FLY AA –60% Val diet as ‘imbalanced diet’. Decreasing Val by 60% resulted in a strong delay in the growth of GF larvae, which was almost completely rescued by association with Lp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Replacing the missing Val with an equal quantity of another EAA (Leu or His) did not improve the development of GF larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This shows that the delay observed on imbalanced diet is due to AA imbalance rather than total AA scarcity. Of note, further decreasing Val concentration (–80%, –90%) was lethal to GF larvae, but not to Lp-associated larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Completely removing Val from the diet is lethal to both GF larvae and Lp-associated larvae as Lp is a Val auxotroph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Consuegra et al., 2020b</xref>). On the contrary, increasing Val by 100% compared to its initial levels did not impact the development of GF or Lp-associated larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, egg-to-pupa survival was not impacted by AA imbalance nor by association with Lp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, supplementing the GF larvae with heat-killed (HK) Lp did not rescue the effects of an imbalanced diet on larval growth, which shows that the Val brought by the inoculation of Lp at the beginning of the experiment is not sufficient to restore Val levels required for larval growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Lp can rescue the effects of AA imbalance due to a single dietary EAA limitation on larval growth through a mechanism independent of AA providing.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> can adapt their feeding behaviour in response to internal cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bjordal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gu et al., 2022</xref>) and to their microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore tested whether GF larvae association with Lp altered larval food intake in our experimental conditions. We observed that Lp association does not alter food intake on imbalanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) or balanced diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). On a yeast-based diet, Lp stimulates the expression of intestinal proteases in larvae, which improves AA absorption by increasing the release of AA from dietary polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Erkosar et al., 2015</xref>). However, the HD that we used does not contain any polypeptide: its sole source of AA is free AA. We tested whether Lp could promote Val absorption in such conditions. We used high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to measure the Val concentration in the haemolymph of larvae. GF larvae fed an imbalanced diet (FLYAA –60% Val) showed a decrease in Val content in the hemolymph compared to GF larvae fed a balanced diet. This decrease was compensated upon association with Lp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, we posit that Lp promotes physiological adaptation of its host to AA imbalance through increased AA absorption, which supports larval growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rescue of AA imbalance by Lp requires functional r/tRNAs operons in Lp</title><p>In order to decipher how Lp rescues the effects of AA imbalance on host growth, we performed a genetic screen using a transposon insertion library of Lp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This library is composed of 2091 mutants, each carrying a transposon randomly inserted in the chromosome, including 1218 insertions inside open reading frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Matos et al., 2017</xref>). We mono-associated GF larvae with each mutant of the library and looked for transposon insertions in Lp’s genome altering the capacity of Lp to support larval development on a severely imbalanced diet (FLY AA –80% Val, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For each mutant, we calculated the D50 (median time of entry into metamorphosis) and normalised it into a z-score. We applied a threshold of z-score &gt;2.5 and identified 32 insertional mutants. Association with these mutants thus results in a delayed time of larval development on a severely imbalanced diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To validate these 32 candidates, we individually re-tested them in multiple (5) replicates. We compared the development of larvae associated with the 32 candidates to larvae associated with an intergenic region insertion mutant of the library showing a WT-like phenotype (Lp:Tn<sub>control</sub>, z-score=0.65).

As a consequence, an Lp strain that grows poorly on the food matrix would not support larval growth. Since we wanted to exclude such candidates, we tested the growth of the nine candidates on imbalanced HD, in the presence of larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Three candidates (B08.06, F09.11, and H04.06) showed growth defects on the diet and thus were not retained for further analysis. On the contrary, the remaining six candidates (B12.11, C08.20, C09.09, D12.09, D12.16, F07.08) showed no growth defect. Moreover, they did not show any impairment at colonising the larval gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). For further characterisation, we tested whether the effect of the mutations could also be observed on a moderately imbalanced diet (–60% Val). On such diet, the mutations B12.11 and C08.20 did not significantly impact Lp’s ability to rescue the developmental delays of larvae. On the contrary, larvae associated with the mutants C09.09, D12.09, D12.16, and F07.08 were still delayed compared to the larvae associated with the WT-like mutant Lp:Tn<sub>control</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), though the difference was less important than on a severely imbalanced diet (–80% Val, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we sequenced the genomes of the six selected candidates to determine in which genomic regions the transposons were inserted. Interestingly, four out of the six candidates (mutants C09.09, D12.09, D12.16, and F07.08) showed independent transposon insertions in operons containing genes encoding tRNAs and/or rRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These four mutants are also the ones that seem to most affect larval development on imbalanced diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The genome of Lp contains five operons encoding r/tRNAs. C09.09 and F07.08 display independent insertions in the same operon, but at different loci (upstream the 16S rRNA for C09.09 and inside the 23S rRNA for F07.08, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We further characterised F07.08, hereinafter referred to as Lp:Tn<sub>r/tRNA</sub>. We extracted total RNA from Lp cultured in liquid HD and found that despite the redundancy of r/tRNAs operon in Lp’s genome Lp:Tn<sub>r/tRNA</sub> displays an ~3- to 4-fold reduction of 16S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and 23S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) rRNA compared to Lp:Tn<sub>control</sub>, indicating that altering the sequence of a single r/tRNA operon is sufficient to compromise global rRNA levels in Lp cells without altering cell growth.</p><p>To confirm the importance of r/tRNA operons in supporting larval growth, we generated a deletion mutant of the whole operon identified in the insertion mutants C09.09 and Lp:Tn<sub>r/tRNA</sub> by homology-based recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Matos et al., 2017</xref>).

Bacterial sRNAs are regulatory RNAs belonging to the general class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). They can be a major mediator or host-symbiont interactions: for instance, the squid symbiont <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic> produces the sRNA SsrA, which promotes immune tolerance from its host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Moriano-Gutierrez et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we purified and sequenced the ncRNAs expressed by LpWT and LpΔop<sub>r/tRNA</sub> in culture. We identified 13 ncRNAs other than r/tRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Of those, 10 were encoded by leading sequences within the 5’-UTR of mRNAs, and are annotated as translation regulators. The remaining 3 ncRNAs (RNAseP, SRP4.5S, and tmRNA, which is the homolog of SsrA) are bona fide sRNAs but they are not encoded in the r/tRNA operons. In addition, we used our sRNAseq dataset to quantify the levels of each tRNAs. As a proxy for tRNA quantity, we focused on Thr-tRNAs. There are four copies of Thr-tRNAs in Lp’s genome: tRNA05, which is inside the operon that was deleted in LpΔop<sub>r/tRNA</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), and tRNA15, tRNA57, and tRNA69, which are outside the operon. The sequences of these four copies are very similar but we were able to assign certain uniquely mapped reads from our dataset to each specific copy using single nucleotide polymorphisms and the flanking regions. As expected, the number of reads mapping specifically on Thr-tRNA5 (inside the operon) was decreased &gt;99% in LpΔop<sub>r/tRNA</sub> compared to Lp. On the other hand, the three Thr-tRNAs outside the deleted operon did not show any difference of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). This shows that the deletion of one copy of Thr-tRNA did not induce a compensatory increase of the other copies. The fact that the chromosome of Lp contains five operons encoding rRNAs and multiple copies of each tRNA may explain why deleting one r/tRNA operon does not have a major impact on bacterial fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). However, it appears that the production of r/tRNAs from these operons is rate limiting to support <italic>Drosophila</italic> growth upon AA imbalance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Lp produces extracellular vesicles containing r/tRNAs</title><p>RNA produced by bacteria can be sensed by eukaryotic host’s cells and modulate host’s immune signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Oldenburg et al., 2012</xref>, p. 13; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ren et al., 2019</xref>). We hypothesised that products of the r/tRNAs loci may be microbial cues sensed by host cells to promote physiological adaptation. Lp is present in the endoperitrophic space of the gut: it is not in direct contact with the enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Storelli et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we wondered how r/tRNAs may be transferred from bacteria to host cells. sRNAs from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koeppen et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>V. fischeri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Moriano-Gutierrez et al., 2020</xref>) were found inside extracellular vesicles. <italic>Lacticaseibacillus casei</italic> produces extracellular vesicles that contain r/tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Domínguez Rubio et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, extracellular vesicles from <italic>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</italic> influence gut motility in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">West et al., 2020</xref>) and extracellular vesicles from Lp<sup>WCFS1</sup> increase the expression of immunity genes in worms and cultured colonocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2017</xref>). We thus hypothesised that extracellular vesicles may act as ‘vehicles’ allowing transfer of Lp’s r/tRNAs from bacteria to host cells. We isolated extracellular vesicles from Lp’s supernatant and imaged them using electron microscopy, revealing the presence of spherical structures of 70–200 nm of size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This corresponds to the expected size of Lp’s extracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2017</xref>). We then extracted RNA from the vesicles and from bacterial cells and quantified the amount of rRNA and tRNA by RT-qPCR. In cells, 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA were considerably more abundant than Thr-tRNA, as expected from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giannoukos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In purified vesicles, we observed an enrichment of Thr-tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In order to remove potential contaminants from the supernatant and retain only the RNAs present inside the vesicles, we treated the purified vesicles with RNAse before extracting RNA. Most rRNA were depleted by the RNAse treatment, suggesting that they were contaminants from the supernatant. On the contrary, Thr-tRNAs were enriched after RNAse treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggest that Lp’s extracellular vesicles contain mostly tRNAs, which may allow their transfer to host cells.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title><italic>L. plantarum</italic> (Lp) produces extracellular vesicles containing ribosomal and transfer RNAs (r/tRNAs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative transmission electronic microscopy images of extracellular vesicles purified from Lp’s supernatant.

Moreover, the GCN2 pathway is one of the main pathways that allow eukaryotic cells to adapt to AA imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gallinetti et al., 2013</xref>, p. 2).

Similarly to what was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kang et al., 2017</xref>), we observed 4E-BP<sup>intron</sup>dsRed reporter expression in the gastric caeca, the proventriculus and in the middle midgut, in a region known as the acidic zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Overend et al., 2016</xref>). This pattern was conserved between GF larvae and Lp-associated larvae. Conversely, the 4E-BP<sup>intron</sup>dsRed reporter was expressed in the anterior midgut specifically in Lp-associated larvae, while this signal was absent from GF guts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, red squares, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

It is currently unknown whether bacterial r/tRNAs can activate GCN2 as well. We therefore tested this hypothesis by feeding purified bacterial tRNAs to GF larvae carrying the 4E-BP<sup>intron</sup>dsRed reporter. At the highest dose tested (625 µg), bacterial tRNAs significantly increased the expression of the reporter in the anterior midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). This increase was comparable to the effect of feeding eukaryotic tRNAs to these larvae, though slightly inferior. However, the effect was minimal as compared to the association of larvae with Lp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Of note, Lp reaches a maximum of ~2.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFUs·mL<sup>–1</sup> in HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Based on observations made on other bacteria, this may yield ~225 µg of tRNAs in a 10 mL vial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Battley, 1988</xref>). This value is probably an underestimate, because tRNAs may accumulate during the stationary phase of Lp; the value of 625 µg thus appears to be within the physiological range of exposure of larvae. These results therefore suggest that Lp’s tRNA may be direct activators of GCN2 in enterocytes. However, we cannot exclude that Lp’s rRNAs or an indirect mechanism dependent on a functional Lp r/tRNA operon is at play.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Rescue of AA imbalance by Lp requires GCN2 in the larval midgut</title><p>We showed that association with Lp activates GCN2 in the anterior midgut of larvae in an r/tRNA loci-dependent manner. We thus sought to test whether GCN2 activation in enterocytes is necessary for Lp to rescue the developmental delay due to AA imbalance. To this end, we specifically knocked down GCN2 in enterocytes and followed the developmental timing of GF or Lp-associated larvae in AA-imbalanced conditions. On an imbalanced diet (–60% Val), GCN2 knock-down in enterocytes caused a significant developmental delay in Lp-associated larvae compared to control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), a phenotype that we confirmed by using two other GCN2 RNAi lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) and by measuring the efficacy of RNA interference against GCN2 expression in the midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Of note, GCN2 knock-down in enterocytes does not alter colonisation of the gut by Lp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Knocking-down GCN2 in the gut had no effect on larvae developing on an AA-balanced diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that GCN2 is necessary for Lp to rescue the developmental delay due to Val limitation. We wondered whether GCN2 is necessary to rescue AA imbalance due to limitation in other AA. We decreased the amount of each EAA identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> as most important for GF larvae (Ile, Lys, Thr, and Trp) by 60% and measured the growth of larvae knocked down for GCN2. We found that GCN2 is necessary for Lp to rescue development upon scarcity in Ile or Thr, but not in Trp or Lys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–F</xref>). Lp can synthesise Lys and Trp, but not Ile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Consuegra et al., 2020b</xref>); therefore, it seems that GCN2 is necessary only when Lp cannot provide the limiting AA. Lp can produce Thr, but in limiting quantity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Consuegra et al., 2020b</xref>), which may explain why GCN2 is also necessary for Lp to rescue the delay due to Thr scarcity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Expression of general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) in the gut is necessary for <italic>L. plantarum</italic> (Lp) to rescue the delay due to amino acid (AA) imbalance.</title><p>(<bold>A–I</bold>) Developmental timing experiments.

Ap rescued the developmental delay due to AA imbalance to the same extent as Lp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, conversely to Lp, Ap’s support to larval development upon Val limitation was independent of GCN2 expression in the gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This is likely explained by the ability of Ap to produce Val and rescue the host’s auxotrophy to Val (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Consuegra et al., 2020b</xref>). Interestingly, Ap did not activate GCN2 in the anterior midgut of larvae on imbalanced diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>) or balanced diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>). Therefore, the ability to activate GCN2 in the anterior midgut is not common to all symbiotic bacteria and a specific attribute of Lp-mediated benefit.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it was previously reported that AA scarcity engages the GCN2 pathway in enterocytes of the midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonfini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2021</xref>) but also in fat body cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>). We used the driver C564-Gal4 to knock down GCN2 expression in the fat body as well as other tissues such as salivary glands and hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Takehana et al., 2004</xref>). This had no impact on the development of Lp-associated larvae fed an imbalanced diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>), which suggests that the phenotype that we observed engages GCN2 in enterocytes rather than in other tissues. Of note, although the TOR pathway is another major factor supporting systemic host growth in the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colombani et al., 2003</xref>) and in enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Redhai et al., 2020</xref>), it was not required in the fat body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>) nor in enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>) for Lp to rescue AA imbalance. However, it was important to support the growth of GF animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>).</p><p>Upon activation, GCN2 phosphorylates eIF2, the major subunit of the translation initiation factor in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donnelly et al., 2013</xref>, p. 2). Phosphorylation of eIF2 inhibits translation, except for a subset of mRNAs including the transcription factor ATF4 which translation is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">B’chir et al., 2013</xref>). ATF4 then activates the transcription of genes involved in stress response. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, one of these genes is the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kang et al., 2017</xref>). 4E-BP activation promotes cap-independent translation, which boosts anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) production in the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vasudevan et al., 2017</xref>, p. 2039-2047) and can alter the composition of the microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vandehoef et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether ATF4 and 4E-BP acting downstream of GCN2 are necessary for Lp to support larval development upon dietary AA imbalance. We observed that knocking down ATF4 or 4E-BP in the enterocytes delayed the development of GF larvae on an imbalanced diet. However, such knock-downs did not affect the development of Lp-associated larvae like GCN2 knock-down did. ATF4 and 4E-BP are thus not required for Lp to support larval development upon dietary AA imbalance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Similarly, larvae carrying 4E-BP deletions were not delayed in presence of Lp. On the contrary, they grew slightly faster than Lp-associated yw larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results demonstrate a specific role of the GCN2 pathway in enterocytes to mediate Lp’s support to larval development despite dietary AA imbalance, independently of TOR and ATF4.</p><p>We then tested the interaction between GCN2 knock-down and Lp r/tRNA loci insertion mutants. As expected, control larvae reared on imbalanced diet in association with Lp:Tn<sub>r/tRNA</sub> showed a developmental delay compared to larvae associated with Lp:Tn<sub>control</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). On the contrary, larvae knocked-down for GCN2 in the enterocytes did not show a difference between association with Lp:Tn<sub>r/tRNA</sub> and association with Lp:Tn<sub>control</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>); in other words, the effect of the r/tRNA operon mutation was only observed when GCN2 is fully expressed. This suggests a functional interaction between Lp’s r/tRNAs and GCN2 in the larval gut and supports the notion that Lp’s influence on host adaptation to AA imbalance relies on a molecular dialogue engaging symbiont r/tRNAs and the host GCN2 kinase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The anterior midgut of Lp-associated larvae displays GCN2-dependent, ATF4-independent, and r/tRNA-dependent transcriptomic signatures of increased epithelium maturation and altered metabolic activity</title><p>We next wondered how GCN2 activation by products of Lp’s r/tRNA operon may support larval growth on an AA imbalanced diet. To get a first handle on the molecular roots of this phenomenon, we studied the transcriptome of the anterior midgut of third instar larvae raised on an imbalanced diet. We took advantage of the specificity of the phenotype to narrow down our analysis. Indeed, Lp rescues AA imbalance in a control background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), but not in an enterocyte-specific GCN2 knock-down background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Moreover, although ATF4 is one of the downstream targets of GCN2, ATF4 knock-down in enterocytes does not prevent the rescue of AA imbalance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Finally, rescue of AA imbalance depends on the presence of r/tRNA operons in Lp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H, I</xref>).

The microbial status is thus a major factor explaining transcriptomic variation. Moreover, among Lp-associated larvae, control larvae are more distant of ATF4 knock-down and GCN2 knock-down. This pattern was expected because ATF4 is downstream GCN2, and thus genes regulated by ATF4 should also be regulated by GCN2. However, ATF4 knocked-down samples and GCN2 knocked-down samples are clearly separated, which indicates that our dataset may allow us to identify signatures of GCN2-dependent ATF4-independent gene regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Even though control larvae associated with Lp:Tn<sub>control</sub> and Lp:Tn<sub>r/tRNA</sub> were closer, most samples were separated from each other by PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We applied the four aforementioned selective filters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) to our dataset and found 104 genes consistently DE (25 up-regulated and 79 down-regulated) by Lp in a GCN2-dependent, ATF4-independent, and r/tRNA operon-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). These genes are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p><p>We then performed a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to search for biological functions enriched within the 79 down-regulated genes, in search for biological functions repressed upon Lp association in a GCN2-dependent, ATF4-independent, and r/tRNA operon-dependent manner. We found a significant enrichment in GO terms associated with mitochondrial respiration, resistance to oxidative stress and negative regulation of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Proliferative cells such as cancer cells, growing yeasts, or embryonic cells tend to favour oxidative glycolysis and fermentation over mitochondrial respiration (in cancer cells, this phenomenon is known as the Warburg effect; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Warburg, 1956</xref>). Indeed, although mitochondrial respiration is more effective at producing ATP, fermentation allows the synthesis of intermediates such as NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate that are necessary for anabolism and cell growth. Moreover, fermentation allows to produce ATP at a faster rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>). Therefore, the decrease in genes responsible for mitochondrial respiration that we observe in the anterior midgut of Lp-associated larvae suggests that the organ is ongoing remodelling and proliferation. We then applied the same method to investigate the 25 up-regulated genes in Lp-associated larvae. We detected a significant enrichment for GO terms associated with organ morphogenesis, cell differentiation (different cell types: neurons or epithelial cells), and cell proliferation (especially members of the epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] pathway) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These signatures suggest that Lp enhances the growth and maturation of the anterior midgut in a GCN2-dependent, ATF4-independent, and r/tRNA operon-dependent manner. Taken together, our transcriptomic analysis of the anterior midgut of larvae growing in an imbalanced diet allowed us to identify GCN2-dependent, ATF4-independent, and Lp r/tRNA operon-dependent signatures evoking increased epithelium maturation and altered metabolic activity which would together support tissue growth and maturation.

Here, we reveal a novel mechanism supporting the symbiosis between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and its bacterial partner Lp. We show that Lp can rescue the developmental delay of its host due to AA imbalance without providing the limiting AA. To understand how Lp promotes adaptation of its host to such dietary condition, we performed an unbiased genetic screen and showed that Lp operons encoding r/tRNAs are necessary to support host growth. We further showed that Lp activates the GCN2 signalling pathway in enterocytes of the anterior midgut. GCN2 activation depends on the presence of intact r/tRNAs-encoding operons in Lp and leads to a remodelling of the intestinal transcriptome suggesting tissue growth and maturation. GCN2 activation in the midgut is necessary to support growth on an imbalanced diet, but not on a balanced diet or when symbiotic bacteria can synthesise the limiting AA (e.g. Lp in the context of lysine scarcity, or Ap upon valine scarcity). These results therefore reveal a mechanism by which a symbiont supports its host physiological adaptation to a suboptimal nutritional environment by engaging the host kinase GCN2 in enterocytes, a previously underappreciated function of this signalling module in the host gut.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>How is GCN2 signalling engaged by Lp?</title><p>We showed that GCN2 activation by Lp depends on the presence of the r/tRNA operons. GCN2 is known to be activated by several types of RNAs forming secondary and tertiary structures: eukaryotic tRNAs cognate to several AA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dong et al., 2000</xref>), free ribosomal eukaryotic RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhu and Wek, 1998</xref>), and viral RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berlanga et al., 2006</xref>). Our results show that purified bacterial tRNAs activate GCN2, which make Lp’s tRNAs interesting candidates. Of note, one of the mutants (D12.16) shows disruption of an operon that encodes only rRNAs. However, synthesis of tRNAs may be regulated by ribosomal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gourse et al., 1985</xref>); therefore, tRNAs production may be indirectly altered in D12.16 as well. Further work is needed to assess how the mutations that we identified impact the synthesis of each family of r/tRNA and to determine which of rRNA, tRNA or an indirect effect of the r/tRNA operon (for instance, through the translation rate in Lp that may be affected by r/tRNA mutations) is responsible for r/tRNA operon-dependent activation of GCN2 by Lp. Of note, the other two candidates that we identified through the genetic screen might also be linked to r/tRNA production: C08.20 has a transposon insertion of the gene <italic>gnd2</italic> that encodes a phosphogluconate dehydrogenase of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). One product of the PPP is the 5-phosphoribosyl-α-1-pyrophosphate, which is a precursor for the biosynthesis of nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kilstrup et al., 2005</xref>). It is thus possible that disruption of <italic>gnd2</italic> in C08.20 might alter production of r/tRNAs by the cells. B12.11 displays an insertion in the end of an operon encoding <italic>rsmC</italic>, <italic>lp_0696</italic> and <italic>lp_sRNA01. rsmC</italic> encodes a 16S rRNA methyltransferase. Methylation of rRNA stabilises ribosomes and improves translation in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wong et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>lp_0696</italic> encodes a cytidine/deoxycytidylate deaminase, which catalyses conversion of cytidine into uridine. <italic>lp_sRBA01</italic> encodes the signal recognition particle (SRP), a small ncRNA which addresses membrane proteins to the membrane during their translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kuhn et al., 2017</xref>). Disruption of this operon may thus directly alter RNA production and/or ribosomal function, which can negatively regulate r/tRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gourse et al., 1985</xref>). Several studies have shown that sRNAs from bacteria can act as cues sensed by host cells. tRNAs loci-derived sRNAs from bacteria can regulate host gene expression in the symbiotic nodules of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ren et al., 2019</xref>). The sRNA SsrA is secreted by the symbiont <italic>V. fischeri</italic> and fosters immune tolerance of its host, the squid <italic>Euprymna scolopes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Moriano-Gutierrez et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> secretes tRNA-derived sRNAs that inhibit the immune response in cultured human cells and in the mouse lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koeppen et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we show that Lp produces extracellular vesicles containing mostly tRNAs. Extracellular vesicles can mediate host-microbes communications by transporting bacterial molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ñahui Palomino et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we propose a model whereby Lp would deliver r/tRNAs to <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s enterocytes via extracellular vesicles. This model would explain why providing purified tRNAs directly to the larva does not fully recapitulate the effect of Lp on GCN2 activation, as if a vehicle (i.e. the extracellular vesicles) was needed. However, our model remains hypothetical: it is possible that r/tRNA production by Lp activates GCN2 through an undirect unidentified mechanism. We sequenced Lp’s sRNA and we found that Lp’s r/tRNA operons do not encode any additional sRNA; however, we observed that the expression of certain sRNAs was affected in LpΔop<sub>r/tRNA.</sub> In particular, LpΔop<sub>r/tRNA</sub> shows down-regulation of SRP, which we identified in the genetic screen (see above) and tmRNA, which is the homolog of SsrA in Lp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Moriano-Gutierrez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Further work may study whether these ncRNAs play a role in the symbiotic relationship of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Lp.</p><p>We showed that Lp activates GCN2 signalling in enterocytes of the anterior midgut. This region of the midgut is of particular interest because it is located anteriorly to the acidic zone that kills a majority of Lp cells upon transit. It is thus the main region where enterocytes can interact with live Lp cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Storelli et al., 2018</xref>). The pattern of expression of the 4E-BP<sup>intron</sup>dsRed reporter slightly differs from the pattern observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kang et al., 2017</xref>: upon AA scarcity, they observed activation of the reporter in the gastric caeca, the acidic region and the proventriculus like we did, but not in the anterior midgut. Those experiments were done in conventionally reared larvae where the microbial status of the animals was not reported. We showed that GCN2 activation in the anterior midgut is symbiont-dependent; this difference with our findings thus suggests that the larvae in Kang and colleagues’ experiments were associated with bacteria that do not promote GCN2 activation in the anterior midgut, such as Ap. An alternative explanation is that frequently flipped conventional fly stocks or crosses may carry very low microbial titres and therefore present GF-like phenotypes. Of note, we could still observe expression of the 4E-BP<sup>intron</sup>dsRed reporter in the gastric caeca, the acidic region and the proventriculus upon GCN2 knock-down (whereas GCN2 knock-down completely abolishes 4E-BP<sup>intron</sup>dsRed expression in the anterior midgut, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>). This suggests that other ATF4 activators such as PERK are active in the gastric caeca, the acidic region and the proventriculus. Importantly, we observed activation of GCN2 by Lp in both contexts of imbalanced and balanced diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). We thus identified a GCN2 signalling activation mechanism which is AA-independent but bacteria-dependent. This differs from the canonical GCN2 activation relying on sensing unloaded eukaryotic tRNA upon AA scarcity. Previous studies have observed GCN2 activation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval gut upon starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kang et al., 2017</xref>), upon lack of EAA in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2021</xref>), and upon exposure to a high sugar/low protein diet in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonfini et al., 2021</xref>). These observations were made without control over the fly’s microbiota, and it is thus difficult to conclude whether bacteria may be at play in these contexts (especially because microbial composition depends largely on diet composition; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lesperance and Broderick, 2020</xref>). Studies have reported activation of GCN2 by pathogenic microbes: infection stimulates GCN2 in the gut, which triggers a translational block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakrabarti et al., 2012</xref>) and promotes immune response through the ATF4-4E-BP axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vasudevan et al., 2017</xref>). The mechanism of activation of GCN2 by infection was not identified in these studies. Of note, <italic>Shigella</italic> infection causes GCN2 activation in HeLa cells, and it was proposed that GCN2 is activated by AA depletion caused by the intracellular infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tattoli et al., 2012</xref>). However, this mechanism seems unlikely in our situation because Lp is not intracellular, and because association with Lp actually promotes physiological rescue of AA scarcity. In the light of our results, we suggest that GCN2 may also be activated by r/tRNA produced by pathogenic bacteria upon infection. These studies and ours emphasise the role of GCN2 in the sensing of either pathogenic or symbiotic bacteria, in addition to its role in sensing uncharged eukaryotic tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donnelly et al., 2013</xref>) and raise the question of the evolutionary history of GCN2 function: could GCN2 have primarily evolved as a pattern recognition receptor, that is a sensor for bacterial RNA later co-opted to sense AA scarcity indirectly through sensing uncharged eukaryotic tRNAs?</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How does GCN2 activation in the gut support improved systemic growth despite imbalanced nutrition?</title><p>Our work shows that GCN2 expression in enterocytes is necessary for Lp’s support to larval growth on an AA-imbalanced diet. However, overexpression of a constitutively active form of GCN2 in dopaminergic neurons represses growth on an AA-imbalanced diet by inhibiting food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bjordal et al., 2014</xref>). These apparently contradictory results suggest that the action of GCN2 is organ-specific: in dopaminergic neurons, GCN2 may foster adaptation to an imbalanced diet by prompting the larva to find a better food source; whereas in the midgut, GCN2 may allow adaptation to an imbalanced diet through physiological changes of enterocytes.</p><p>Studies in yeast’s or <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s GCN2 pathway have focused on the effector ATF4, which translation increases upon eIF2 phosphorylation by GCN2. Especially, Vasudevan and colleagues showed than the GCN2-ATF4-4E-BP cascade yields the production of AMPs that help <italic>Drosophila</italic> fight infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vasudevan et al., 2017</xref>). Here, although we did indirectly observe activation of ATF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and 4E-BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) upon Lp-association, this activation was not necessary for Lp to rescue the effects of AA imbalance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Adaptation to AA imbalance may occur independently of eIF2, through other substrates of GCN2. eIF2 is the only known substrate of GCN2 so far; however, Dang Do and colleagues showed that in the mouse liver, GCN2 does not regulate the same set of genes as PERK, another eIF2-kinase. This suggests that additionally to their common substrate eIF2, GCN2 and PERK have distinct substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dang Do et al., 2009</xref>). eIF2-independent action of GCN2 was described in response to UV exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grallert and Boye, 2007</xref>) and viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2008</xref>). Alternatively, support to growth despite AA imbalance by Lp may rely on eIF2 targets other than ATF4. ATF4-independent regulation of gene expression by eIF2 was described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malzer et al., 2018</xref>), mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guo and Cavener, 2007</xref>), and cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wek and Cavener, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, GCN2, but not ATF4, is necessary for adaptation of mice to a Leucine-depleted diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). We took advantage of the specificity of the reported phenotype to find out how Lp may influence the physiology of the anterior midgut in a GCN2-dependent, ATF4-independent, and r/tRNA-dependent manner. Our transcriptomics data suggest that the anterior midgut of Lp-associated larvae shows increased tissue growth and maturation and reduced mitochondrial respiration. GO terms associated with cell differentiation, cell proliferation (such as EGFR signalling), and morphogenesis are enriched in the Lp-associated conditions. This is in line with previous transcriptomic analyses in the midgut of adult flies, which showed that EGFR signalling and cell proliferation are stimulated by the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Broderick et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, expression of the growth inhibitor <italic>fezzik</italic> is repressed in the Lp-associated conditions. We showed that inhibition of <italic>fezzik</italic> specifically in the midgut is sufficient to accelerate larval growth. Finally, genes related to mitochondrial respiration are more expressed in the GF condition when compared to Lp-associated larvae. This is suggestive of a metabolic switch from respiration to fermentation upon GCN2 activation by Lp that may favour host anabolism to increase the incorporation of cellular building blocks (such as AA, lipids, and nucleotides) into the host tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>). Of note, GCN2 activation can trigger a metabolic switch from respiration to fermentation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Longchamp et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, transcriptomic remodelling upon GCN2 activation by Lp seems to be dependent on the presence of the r/tRNA in Lp and independent of the expression of ATF4 in enterocytes. These signatures may help explain the phenotype of rescue of AA imbalance by Lp. In adults, midgut remodelling during reproduction promotes nutrient absorption and allows optimal fecundity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Reiff et al., 2015</xref>). We propose that a similar mechanism occurs in larvae under Lp association, through GCN2 activation dependent on the r/tRNA operon. Midgut remodelling via anabolism and maturation would improve nutrient absorption, including valine, correcting dietary valine scarcity and promoting systemic growth. Wild <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae exclusively grow on decaying fruits, which are processed by microbes such as <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Flatt, 2020</xref>); therefore, we speculate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> has adapted its nutrition to the presence of bacteria and optimised its capacity to benefit from essential nutrients produced by its symbiotic microbes. GCN2 may have evolved as a sensor of symbiotic cues, allowing the larva to couple its growth with the abundance of microbes present in the environment: when microbes are abundant, symbiotic cues may activate GCN2 in the gut, triggering gut growth, optimal nutrient absorption, and rapid organismal growth.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that the symbiotic bacterium Lp can activate GCN2 in the enterocytes, possibly through direct sensing of r/tRNAs as symbiotic cues. GCN2 activation in enterocytes decreases the transcription of the growth repressor <italic>fezzik</italic>, and triggers a metabolic switch that may improve AA absorption and rescue the effects of AA imbalance on larval growth. GCN2 is highly conserved across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donnelly et al., 2013</xref>), and is important for mouse adaptation to an AA-imbalanced diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anthony et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guo and Cavener, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Laeger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>, p. 2). Our study therefore paves the way to testing whether the molecular dialogue between symbiotic bacteria and GCN2 described here is conserved in the animal kingdom beyond insects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> lines and breeding</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks were maintained at 25°C with 12:12 hr dark/light cycles on a yeast/cornmeal medium composed of 50 g·L<sup>–1</sup> of inactivated yeast, 80 g·L<sup>–1</sup> of cornmeal, 4 mL·L<sup>–1</sup> of propionic acid, 5.2 g·L<sup>–1</sup> of nipagin, and 7.14 g·L<sup>–1</sup> of agar.

Here, the authors further explore this interaction using defined diets where they find that under conditions that have low levels of some essential amino acids, the bacteria can still promote survival even though the bacteria is not synthesizing the amino acid. Through a screen of bacterial transposon insertion mutants, these authors identify bacterial transfer and ribosomal RNAs as necessary for this effect, and studies in the fly demonstrate that the host kinase GCN2, a protein known to associate with host tRNAs, in enterocytes is the mediator of this response.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers found the work to be interesting however, found that there was a lack of proof of RNA transfer to host cells. Why the mechanisms remain unclear, there are indeed other examples of such a phenomenon. For example, FISH (RNA and DNA) can be used to demonstrate bacterial RNA in host cells. Studies demonstrating this transfer are required to support the conclusions.</p><p>Another question raised regards how GCN2 allows the larva to correct or deal with the amino acid imbalance. Any additional insights here would also be helpful for the audience.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an interesting article that uses the power of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to explore how organisms work with their symbionts to adapt to a changing environment. The authors show that reducing some non-essential amino acids that cannot be produced by the &quot;symbiont&quot; <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> can nevertheless be rescued by the presence of this bacteria. Why not Leucine? What makes valine and isoleucine different? And how does the adaptation work? They suggest it is not through provisioning from the bacteria by using heat killed bacteria. Therefore, there should be an overall reduction in total Valine in the animal. Is this the case? And if so, what causes the delay that is overcome? Are there less proteins made (measure total valine in proteins from different diets). What is adaptation here?</p><p>To explore this interaction, they begin to genetically dissect the requirements for protection in the bacteria. Further characterization of the bacterial mutants would be useful here to show the delay over time for decreasing concentrations of Leucine and to determine if this is specific to leucine. Figure 2F done with altered % and other aa. Show time courses and not the bar graphs. They then show that the mutants have transposon insertions in r/tRNA loci and reduced rRNA levels. What is its protein concentration? Is this different in these bacteria? And are these RNAs released out of cells? What is their half life? And how would they cross membranes? Nucleic acids cannot passively cross. Can be measured in media from the different strains. The calculations of the amount of these species assumes all of the nucleic acid inside the bacteria is accessible to the inside of the enterocyte.</p><p>Experiments next demonstrate that colonization with Lp leads to induction of an ATF4 reporter independent of diet. But that colonization of the mutant Lp, has reduced activation during a balanced diet but not in an imbalanced diet. This was also the case for a mutant identified in the screen. I am not sure what this means since the phenotypes are during an imbalanced diet. Moreover, feeding flies tRNA can induce some reporter but reduced compared to even the operon deleted strain of Lp. Does this impact D50 or %pupation? Does it also induce reporter in an imbalanced diet? Need to show more data around the tRNA experiments. This is a major conclusion.</p><p>The experiments in figure 5 show that there are selective requirements for GNC2 depending on the diet and aa imbalance. This is very complicated. As the depletion of GCN2 in 5a does not impact GF pupation on an imbalanced diet, it does for other alleles in S5A-B. This is striking and impacts some of the conclusions. What does it look like for these alleles on a balanced diet? Moreover, the day to 50% pupation is variable (eg controls in A different than controls in G). Only one Lp mutant tested and the graphs are spit between H and I while shown altogether in A. Is there a difference between the WT bacteria in the two fly genotypes as seen in A? Interestingly, AP can rescue independent of GCN2. Thus there are different solutions to this problem. Moreover, the authors found that ATF4 and 4EBP are dispensable, so what is important about GCN2, is it eiF2a phosphorylation. Is translation impacted in enterocytes, is turnover? What is the mechanisms? Does feeding tRNAs impact GCN2 dependent pupation changes? Characterization of the gut cells, ISCs, turnover and physiology (eg metabolomics to monitor aa levels and incorporation) they perform RNAseq and describe a series of GO categories. No experiments either validate or explore the significance of these genes.</p><p>We are left with an incomplete understanding of how Lp impacts development, whether RNA is a signal and how this may be sensed to induce a survival program.</p><p>Experimental interpretations:</p><p>It is unclear how many independent experiments and how many animals per experiment are included in each figure. What do the aggregate values represent? How many of each? This should be described in detail for all experiments including % pupation experiments and confocal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) For ease of comprehension, it would be helpful to refer to the L. plantarum mutants by a descriptive designation such as the interrupted tRNA/rRNA or &quot;control&quot;, in the case of the control mutant. It is difficult to remember the significance of the number designations.</p><p>2) Figure 4E and F: Here the authors feed GF <italic>Drosophila</italic> purified bacterial t-RNA's and then show that transcription of 4E-BP is increased in enterocytes. Feeding of an unrelated RNA of similar length would prove that tRNA, in particular, is required for this response.</p><p>3) Figure S4G: Feeding of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic tRNAs increases expression of 4E-BP. It would be helpful to show an alignment of the sequences of the eukaryotic and prokaryotic tRNAs used here and to comment on their similarity or lack thereof. Is the prokaryotic tRNA similar enough to eukaryotic tRNA to interact with GCN2 if it can be taken up?</p><p>4) Purified tRNAs have a much smaller effect on 4E-BP expression than L. plantarum. While one possibility is that a bacterial carrier such as OMVs are necessary for uptake into enterocytes, another possibility is that additional bacterial components are required for the response. Does a mixture of heat-killed bacteria and purified tRNAs yield a stronger response? While this experiment would require new reagents, the investigators could prove that transport is necessary by conditionally expressing a prokaryotic tRNA directly in enterocytes and showing that GCN2 is activated.</p><p>5) The data in Figure 5SE showing that L. plantarum does not alter food intake, might be better positioned earlier in the manuscript as this is a key control that does not rely on the data for tRNA or GCN2.</p><p>6) One of the interesting findings of this paper is that deceleration of development is not the direct result of the inability to access an essential amino acid but rather a regulated process that occurs when nutrition is suboptimal but actually adequate to support faster development. It is interesting to speculate on why this might be an adaptive response.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The work is essentially OK as is, except for a few specific issues outlined above.</p><p>The comments below aim to improve the impact of the article with suggestions for additional experiments.</p><p>1. Val absorption: would it be possible to monitor Val intake by the gut in pulse-chase experiments, using labelled valine which most likely would have to be radioactive?</p><p>2. Release of bacterial r/tRNAs: the authors mention the possibility of export through EVs. A simple experiment is to make an EV preparation and to check by PCR for the presence of r/tRNAs in the purified EVs. This experiment may also allow to answer the question as to whether the bacteria release the r/tRNAs in response to the imbalance of amino-acids in the culture medium (in other words, is the response to the imbalanced diet taking place at the level of the symbiont, the host, or both?). A more challenging one would be to feed the larvae with EVs from wt and mutant Lp bacteria. The difficulty may be to obtain enough material. Does a CAFE-like assay exist for larvae?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Intestinal GCN2 controls <italic>Drosophila</italic> systemic growth in response to <italic>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</italic> symbiotic cues encoded by r/tRNA operons&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Utpal Banerjee (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Please address the specificity questions raised about the vesicles by Reviewer 2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have responded to all the reviewers' comments in an impressively thorough way. While the effort to observe vesicles in the intestine is admirable, I agree with them that this is not convincing enough to include. I have only one concern regarding the qRT-PCR on membrane vesicles. I would like to see a negative control/ absent RNA that might demonstrate selectivity. The expected RNAs are there. Are these found in the same ratio as in the bacterium? If so, are there any RNAs that are found at different levels in the bacterium and the vesicle? If all RNAs are found in vesicles in the same ratios as in the bacterium, then how to prove that these are not contaminating RNAs? After all, these are some of the most abundant RNAs in the bacterium. I am also concerned that ribosomes may be co-purifying with OMVs. Another possibility might be to treat the membrane vesicles with RNase as RNA in vesicles is thought to be resistant to the action of such enzymes. Of course, I fully appreciate the challenge of proving that OMVs carry rRNAs and tRNAs and the best one may be able to do is provide supporting evidence.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have made a reasonable attempt to address the issues raised by the reviewers and it appears that this article has now only to address minor issues. Of note, may-be using RNAScope probes might have given the level of sensitivity required to detect bacterial RNA within enterocytes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76584.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers found the work to be interesting however, found that there was a lack of proof of RNA transfer to host cells.

Following the editor and referees’ suggestions, we performed additional experiments and made some changes to our manuscript which we feel address (at least partly) the major points raised by the reviewers.</p><p>In the discussion of our initial manuscript, we proposed a release of r/tRNA from <italic>L. plantarum</italic> (Lp) via extracellular vesicles. We have now directly tested this hypothesis and show the results in new Figure 3 of the updated manuscript. We now reveal that Lp produces extracellular vesicles that contain rRNAs and tRNAs, including those encoded by the r/tRNA operon under study. This observation indicates that extracellular vesicles may be one vehicle by which host cells acquire and sense symbiotic cues such as bacterial r/tRNAs.</p><p>Moreover, the editor suggested that we do FISH to visualize Lp’s r/tRNAs in host’s cells. We performed HCR-FISH on the gut of GF larvae and Lp-associated larvae using probes specific for Lp’s 16S rRNA (Akhtar et al., PLOS ONE 2021). In Lp-associated larvae, we detected large positive particles that may be extracellular vesicles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We did not see any signal in GF guts.

We therefore propose to provide these data only in our response to the referees (which will be accessible along the published paper) and remain speculative about this point in our discussion (line 642-647).Furthermore, we now bring additional insights regarding the mechanisms by which GCN2 promotes larval growth upon AA imbalance. To this end, we capitalized on our functional transcriptomics approach reported in the initial manuscript. Among the genes that were down-regulated upon Lp association in a GCN2-dependant manner, we identified the growth repressor and putative Ecdysone-oxydase <italic>fezzik</italic> as an interesting candidate. Using RNAi, we now show that on its own the repression of <italic>fezzik</italic> expression in enterocytes of GF animals leads to improved growth, indicating that Lp-mediated GCN2-dependant <italic>fezzik</italic> downregulation contributes to larval growth upon Lp association. These data are provided in the new Figure 8 and the new Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Moreover, we have now performed additional experiments to address several reviewers’ comments:</p><p>– We now show that Lp restores the Valine levels in the hemolymph of larvae deprived of Valine (new Figure 1E), which is in accordance to our hypothesis that Lp association improves gut functions and nutrient absorption, most likely by supporting gut maturation as indicated by our functional transcriptomics analysis.</p><p>– We now test the other GCN2-RNAi lines by RT-qPCR and showed that they efficiently knock-down GCN2 (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1D).</p><p>– We have now used two <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines carrying loss-of-function mutations in <italic>thor</italic> (<italic>4E-BP</italic>) to confirm our previous observation, based on RNAi, that <italic>4E-BP</italic> is not required for Lp to promote larval growth (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1I).</p><p>– We now show that the Lp deletion mutant for r/tRNA operon is impaired at promoting growth not only upon low Valine but also in the context of limiting Leucine (new Figure 2-supplement 1D), a result that reinforces the notion that Lp association improves gut functions and nutrient absorption, not just Valine uptake.</p><p>– Additionally, we wondered whether the r/tRNA operon may encode small non-coding (nc) RNA on top of ribosomal and transfer RNAs, as it has been described in other bacteria (Stenum et al., Frontiers in Microbiology 2021). We sequenced the ncRNAs expressed by Lp in culture and identified 13 ncRNAs expressed in these conditions. We now provide a list of these sncRNAs (new Supplementary file 1). None of them were encoded in the r/tRNA operon, which suggests that they do not play a role in the phenotype that we describe and reinforce the notion that r/tRNAs from the deleted locus are responsible for the phenotype observed. Moreover, we used this dataset to show that as expected, the expression of tRNAs is decreased in the Lp mutant for r/tRNA operon (new Figure 2-supplement 1I).</p><p>Finally, we made some corrections to the text and figures following the reviewers‘ recommendations.</p><p>We provide a point-by-point response to the reviewers’ comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an interesting article that uses the power of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to explore how organisms work with their symbionts to adapt to a changing environment. The authors show that reducing some non-essential amino acids that cannot be produced by the &quot;symbiont&quot; Lactobacillus can nevertheless be rescued by the presence of this bacteria. Why not Leucine? What makes valine and isoleucine different?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her kind words. We focused only on essential amino-acids: when one of these amino-acids (Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Histidine…) is completely removed from the diet, the larvae cannot develop (Consuegra et al. 2020; Sang 1956). We did observe that decreasing Leucine concentration causes developmental delays in GF larvae, which is compensated by Lp (new Figure 1A-B). As the reviewers points out, Valine and Isoleucine seem to be “more essential” because reducing the amount of Valine or Isoleucine leads to a greater growth delay in GF larvae than reducing Leucine. We hypothesize that either Leucine is less important for larval growth, or the recipe of the holidic diet is biased toward an overabundance of Leucine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And how does the adaptation work? They suggest it is not through provisioning from the bacteria by using heat killed bacteria. Therefore, there should be an overall reduction in total Valine in the animal. Is this the case? And if so, what causes the delay that is overcome? Are there less proteins made (measure total valine in proteins from different diets). What is adaptation here?</p></disp-quote><p>To answer the reviewer’s question, we measured the quantity of Valine in the hemolymph of size-matched larvae in different conditions (new Figure 1E). We observed a reduction in total Valine in GF larvae fed an imbalanced diet. This reduction was rescued by association with Lp, which supports our main hypothesis that Lp improves gut functions and nutrient absorption, including Valine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To explore this interaction, they begin to genetically dissect the requirements for protection in the bacteria. Further characterization of the bacterial mutants would be useful here to show the delay over time for decreasing concentrations of Leucine and to determine if this is specific to leucine. Figure 2F done with altered % and other aa. Show time courses and not the bar graphs.</p></disp-quote><p>To further characterize the mutant, we assessed the time of development of larvae associated with Lp r/tRNA mutant (Lp Δop<sub>r/tRNA</sub>) on a diet with decreased Leucine concentration (-70%). We observed that similarly to what we observed upon Valine limitation, LpΔop<sub>r/tRNA</sub> fail to promote larval growth upon Leucine limitation (new Figure 2-supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They then show that the mutants have transposon insertions in r/tRNA loci and reduced rRNA levels. What is its protein concentration? Is this different in these bacteria? And are these RNAs released out of cells? What is their half life? And how would they cross membranes? Nucleic acids cannot passively cross. Can be measured in media from the different strains. The calculations of the amount of these species assumes all of the nucleic acid inside the bacteria is accessible to the inside of the enterocyte.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting question. Upon passage through the intestine, the majority of Lp cells are killed when going through the acidic region (Storelli et al. 2018), which could cause a release of r/tRNAs. However, it is unknown whether free r/tRNA may be able to cross the membranes. Other studies have reported that extracellular vesicles produced by bacteria can contain bacterial RNAs. Host cells can uptake the content of extracellular vesicles (Brown et al. 2015). We now show that Lp produces extracellular vesicles and these vesicles contain r/tRNAs (new Figure 3). We therefore propose that Lp’s r/tRNAs can be transported into host’s cells through extracellular vesicles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experiments next demonstrate that colonization with Lp leads to induction of an ATF4 reporter independent of diet. But that colonization of the mutant Lp, has reduced activation during a balanced diet but not in an imbalanced diet. This was also the case for a mutant identified in the screen. I am not sure what this means since the phenotypes are during an imbalanced diet. Moreover, feeding flies tRNA can induce some reporter but reduced compared to even the operon deleted strain of Lp. Does this impact D50 or %pupation? Does it also induce reporter in an imbalanced diet? Need to show more data around the tRNA experiments. This is a major conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reduction in ATF4 induction upon colonization by Lp Δop<sub>r/tRNA</sub> is not significant (p-value=0.069), but we observed it also upon colonization by Lp:Tn<sub>r/tRNA</sub> and upon short-term association (where the decrease reaches statistical significance, Figure 5-supplement 1E,F). This suggests that Lp Δop<sub>r/tRNA</sub> leads to decreased GCN2 activation on both balanced and imbalanced diet. We tested whether purified tRNAs impacts developmental timing and found that it does not. This may suggest that low GCN2 activation in GF larvae is not sufficient to promote growth; however, as the reviewer points out the induction of the GCN2 reporter by purified tRNAs is very low. Especially, it is much lower than induction by Lp. Therefore, it is possible that purified tRNAs simply do not activate GCN2 enough to have a significant effect on growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiments in figure 5 show that there are selective requirements for GNC2 depending on the diet and aa imbalance. This is very complicated. As the depletion of GCN2 in 5a does not impact GF pupation on an imbalanced diet, it does for other alleles in S5A-B. This is striking and impacts some of the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We measured the efficiency of the other two RNAi lines (GCN2-2 and GCN2-3) and found that they do knock-down GCN2 effectively, though the interference efficiency is reduced as compared to GCN2-RNAi-1 (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1D). Lp-associated larvae knocked-down for GCN2 using any of these three lines are delayed compared to control Lp-associated larvae. Therefore, we concluded that Lp fails to promote growth when GCN2 expression is altered in enterocytes. We are unsure whether GCN2 is also important for GF larvae’s growth: knock-down using GCN2-1 does not impact pupariation timing in GF, whereas knock-down using GCN2-2 or GCN2-3 does. New Figure 4 shows that GCN2 activity is very low in GF enterocytes. It is possible that despites its low level, GCN2 activity is important for GF larvae to develop, as suggested by the results using lines GCN2-2 and GCN2-3. Lp would then further induce GCN2 expression, improving larval growth through the mechanisms described in Figure 7. On the other hand, the line GCN2-1 is the one generally used in literature (KK line VDRC#103976) and thus seems more reliable. GCN2-2 and GCN2-3 may cause toxicity or off-target effects on GF larvae, which seem to be generally sensitive to RNA interference (see the growth delay of GF larvae upon knock-down of ATF4, 4E-BP or TOR in Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1, respectively). Therefore, the importance of GCN2 for the growth of GF larvae is unclear. On the contrary, our data clearly demonstrate the importance of GCN2 in Lp-associated larvae.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What does it look like for these alleles on a balanced diet? Moreover, the day to 50% pupation is variable (eg controls in A different than controls in G). Only one Lp mutant tested and the graphs are spit between H and I while shown altogether in A.

Thus there are different solutions to this problem. Moreover, the authors found that ATF4 and 4EBP are dispensable, so what is important about GCN2, is it eiF2a phosphorylation.

It is difficult to remember the significance of the number designations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

It would be helpful to show an alignment of the sequences of the eukaryotic and prokaryotic tRNAs used here and to comment on their similarity or lack thereof. Is the prokaryotic tRNA similar enough to eukaryotic tRNA to interact with GCN2 if it can be taken up?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to points (2) and (3): GCN2 can interact with tRNAs cognate of each amino acid (Masson 2019), which show great sequence dissimilarity. Therefore, it seems more likely that GCN2 recognizes tRNA’s structure rather than tRNA’s sequence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Purified tRNAs have a much smaller effect on 4E-BP expression than L. plantarum. While one possibility is that a bacterial carrier such as OMVs are necessary for uptake into enterocytes, another possibility is that additional bacterial components are required for the response. Does a mixture of heat-killed bacteria and purified tRNAs yield a stronger response? While this experiment would require new reagents, the investigators could prove that transport is necessary by conditionally expressing a prokaryotic tRNA directly in enterocytes and showing that GCN2 is activated.</p></disp-quote><p>Ectopic expression of bacterial tRNAs in enterocytes would be of great interest, but we think it goes beyond the scope of our study.

Val absorption: would it be possible to monitor Val intake by the gut in pulse-chase experiments, using labelled valine which most likely would have to be radioactive?</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we now show that association with Lp improves Valine absorption and Valine levels in hemolymph. Since neither Lp nor the larva can produce Valine de novo, we do not think that it is necessary to use radioactive Valine to demonstrate that the Valine comes from the diet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Release of bacterial r/tRNAs: the authors mention the possibility of export through EVs. A simple experiment is to make an EV preparation and to check by PCR for the presence of r/tRNAs in the purified EVs. This experiment may also allow to answer the question as to whether the bacteria release the r/tRNAs in response to the imbalance of amino-acids in the culture medium (in other words, is the response to the imbalanced diet taking place at the level of the symbiont, the host, or both?). A more challenging one would be to feed the larvae with EVs from wt and mutant Lp bacteria. The difficulty may be to obtain enough material. Does a CAFE-like assay exist for larvae?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. As stated above, we did isolate extracellular vesicles from Lp and detected r/tRNAs inside (new Figure 3). We could try to add purified vesicles to the diet, but they would likely be too diluted compared to the concentration of vesicles that could be released inside the gut. A CAFÉ-assay could allow to reach higher concentrations, but to our knowledge such assay is restricted to adults that can “drink” liquid substrates through their proboscis and is not applicable to larvae.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Please address the specificity questions raised about the vesicles by Reviewer 2.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have responded to all the reviewers' comments in an impressively thorough way. While the effort to observe vesicles in the intestine is admirable, I agree with them that this is not convincing enough to include. I have only one concern regarding the qRT-PCR on membrane vesicles. I would like to see a negative control/ absent RNA that might demonstrate selectivity. The expected RNAs are there. Are these found in the same ratio as in the bacterium? If so, are there any RNAs that are found at different levels in the bacterium and the vesicle? If all RNAs are found in vesicles in the same ratios as in the bacterium, then how to prove that these are not contaminating RNAs? After all, these are some of the most abundant RNAs in the bacterium. I am also concerned that ribosomes may be co-purifying with OMVs. Another possibility might be to treat the membrane vesicles with RNase as RNA in vesicles is thought to be resistant to the action of such enzymes. Of course, I fully appreciate the challenge of proving that OMVs carry rRNAs and tRNAs and the best one may be able to do is provide supporting evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for the appreciation of our work and for the suggestions which improved our results. We now provide a comparison of the abundance of 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA and Thr-tRNAs in bacterial cells vs extracellular vesicles. In the new Figure 3, we show that the ratio of the r/tRNAs that we tested strongly differed between cells and extracellular vesicles: in cells, both rRNAs were considerably more abundant than Thr-tRNA but in extracellular vesicles we found them at similar levels (new Figure 3B, C). Moreover, we treated Lp’s extracellular vesicles with RNAse to remove potential contaminants. We then observed a further decrease of rRNAs, which levels got lower than Thr-tRNAs (new Figure 3C, D). These new results strongly suggest that Lp’s extracellular vesicles contain tRNAs, but not-or fewer rRNAs. We modified the Discussion (L964) and the Methods (L1468) to account for these new results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have made a reasonable attempt to address the issues raised by the reviewers and it appears that this article has now only to address minor issues.
