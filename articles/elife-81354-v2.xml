COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted cancer care, raising concerns regarding the impact of wait time, or ‘lag time’, on clinical outcomes. We aimed to contextualize pandemic-related lag times by mapping pre-pandemic evidence from systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses on the association between lag time to cancer diagnosis and treatment with mortality- and morbidity-related outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews for reviews published prior to the pandemic (1 January 2010–31 December 2019). We extracted data on methodological characteristics, lag time interval start and endpoints, qualitative findings from systematic reviews, and pooled risk estimates of mortality- (i.e., overall survival) and morbidity- (i.e., local regional control) related outcomes from meta-analyses. We categorized lag times according to milestones across the cancer care continuum and summarized outcomes by cancer site and lag time interval.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 9032 records through database searches, of which 29 were eligible. We classified 33 unique types of lag time intervals across 10 cancer sites, of which breast, colorectal, head and neck, and ovarian cancers were investigated most. Two systematic reviews investigating lag time to diagnosis reported different findings regarding survival outcomes among paediatric patients with Ewing’s sarcomas or central nervous system tumours. Comparable risk estimates of mortality were found for lag time intervals from surgery to adjuvant chemotherapy for breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancers. Risk estimates of pathologic complete response indicated an optimal time window of 7–8 weeks for neoadjuvant chemotherapy completion prior to surgery for rectal cancers. In comparing methods across meta-analyses on the same cancer sites, lag times, and outcomes, we identified critical variations in lag time research design.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our review highlighted measured associations between lag time and cancer-related outcomes and identified the need for a standardized methodological approach in areas such as lag time definitions and accounting for the waiting-time paradox. Prioritization of lag time research is integral for revised cancer care guidelines under pandemic contingency and assessing the pandemic’s long-term effect on patients with cancer.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>The present work was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR-COVID-19 Rapid Research Funding opportunity, VR5-172666 grant to Eduardo L.

With successive waves of SARS-CoV-2 variants waxing and waning disparately between and within countries, the standard cancer care framework from diagnosis to treatment has been distorted. Resulting stressors on cancer centres have introduced a multitude of challenges, including prolongation of existing lag times within the cancer care continuum. In the early months of the pandemic, cancer screening services were temporarily suspended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mast and Munoz del, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maringe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Villain et al., 2021</xref>). By May 2020, two months after the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, the volume of colorectal and breast cancer screenings in the United States dropped by 85% and 94%, respectively, compared to averages from the previous three years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mast and Munoz del, 2020</xref>). Routine and diagnostic patient visits to primary healthcare providers have been similarly affected. Clinics’ reduced overall patient volume and patient hesitancy to seek in-person care have further contributed to the backlog of elective and non-elective cancer services and procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lesley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jazieh et al., 2020</xref>). New and previously diagnosed cancer cases have been subject to risk-based prioritization and treatment triaging that differ from standard clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farah et al., 2021</xref>). For cancers that were diagnosed in the first six months of the pandemic, an increasing trend in diagnosis of late-stage cancers and a decreasing trend in diagnosis of early-stage cancers were observed, as a reflection of the initial effects of extended lag times to diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carvalho et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Changes in dosing and fractionation, as well as delays and interruptions in chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens of palliative and curative intent care have altered the sensitivity and timeliness of treatment administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teckie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elkrief et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, COVID-19 safety measures within hospitals and cancer centres have congested surgical windows, leaving surgical treatment opportunities for only the most urgent, non-elective cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moletta et al., 2020</xref>). Delay or cessation of clinical trials have restricted treatment and research opportunities integral for both present and future patients with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sharpless, 2020</xref>). Cumulatively, pandemic-dictated modifications to standard protocols for radiologic, surgical, and systemic therapy interventions have exacerbated lag times to cancer treatment.</p><p>Pandemic-induced changes have brought forth the rising concern within the cancer care community as to whether current lag times to diagnosis and treatment that deviate from standard-of-care practice will lead to poorer outcomes for cancer patients. With modelling studies forecasting the tolerability of these lag times based on estimated long-term outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sud et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malagón et al., 2022</xref>) and a recent scoping review summarizing the impact of the pandemic on time to cancer diagnosis and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carvalho et al., 2022</xref>), a pre-pandemic perspective of the effect of lag time on oncologic outcomes among patients undergoing cancer screening, diagnosis, and staging is of paramount importance. Retrospective, pre-pandemic data can help our understanding of the influence of lag time on patient outcomes, which would be imperative for planning cancer control and care services in the future. Thus, the purpose of this scoping review is to contextualize pandemic-related lag times to cancer diagnosis and treatment by presenting an overview of aggregated pre-pandemic data from systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses on the association between lag time to cancer diagnosis and treatment and clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Results from this review were reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tricco et al., 2018</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Search strategy and selection criteria</title><p>We systematically searched four electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews. The search strategy consisted of the index keywords <italic>cancer</italic>, <italic>diagnosis</italic> &amp; <italic>treatment</italic>, <italic>wait-time</italic>, <italic>delay</italic>, <italic>outcome</italic>, and <italic>systematic review</italic> and/or <italic>meta-analysis</italic>, along with their associated MeSH and iterative search terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We queried these databases for records published between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019. We chose the former date to avoid capturing changes in treatment modalities for cancer sites that might have affected clinical outcomes, and the latter date to prevent artifacts from the COVID-19 pandemic era impacting our search findings. We did not apply language restrictions. In addition, we manually searched the reference lists of eligible systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses to identify potentially relevant reviews missed in our search.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Eligibility assessment</title><p>We imported all records into EndNote X9 reference management software where duplicates were removed. Subsequently, remaining records were uploaded to Rayyan web tool for systematic reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ouzzani et al., 2016</xref>), where additional duplicates were removed. To be included, a review needed to (1) be a systematic review and/or meta-analysis, (2) refer to any clinical outcome associated with a lag time to cancer diagnosis or treatment, and (3) mention lag time to cancer diagnosis or treatment. In the first round, two reviewers (PT and EF; PT and RA; or EF and RA) independently screened the records’ titles and abstracts for eligibility in Rayyan. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion. Full-text eligibility screening was performed independently by two reviewers (EF and RA) and validated by a third (PT). Reference lists of records included in the full-text eligibility screening were manually searched by two reviewers (EF and RA) and validated by a third (PT) for further records that met the eligibility criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Data abstraction</title><p>The included records were divided into two sets and data were independently abstracted by two reviewers (PT and EF for one set, and PT and RA for the second set). One reviewer (PT) then verified all abstracted data. Inconsistencies among reviewers were resolved through discussion. From all included literature, we extracted the following variables: databases searched, number of hits, number of included studies, total number of participants, countries in which studies were conducted, start and endpoints of lag times evaluated, range of the lag time interval, cancer site, cancer type, and outcomes (e.g., mortality, disease-free survival [DFS], recurrence-free survival [RFS], disease progression, etc.). We extracted additional information and variables particular to the review type. This included overall qualitative findings from systematic reviews without a meta-analytic component (referred to herein as systematic reviews). For reviews with a meta-analytic component (referred to hereafter as meta-analyses), we further extracted lag time variable type (categorical or continuous), lag time comparator and reference categories, corresponding pooled risk estimates (e.g., risk ratios [RRs], hazard ratios [HRs], and odds ratios [ORs]) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs), model parameters, heterogeneity statistics, and results from subgroup (by cancer type, study quality, follow-up period, and confounding adjustment, i.e., for sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, study design, and sociodemographic variables) and/or sensitivity analyses. Findings from meta-analyses were categorized by outcome: morbidity- (e.g., disease progression) or mortality- related.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Definition and representation of lag time intervals</title><p>Based on the extracted start and endpoints of lag times, we defined unique lag time intervals that encompassed diagnostic, system, and treatment wait times. We visually represented these lag time intervals on a timeline by including horizontal bars that align the start and endpoints in relation to relevant ‘milestones’ along the cancer care continuum (i.e., symptom onset, first seen by primary care physician, referral to a specialist, diagnosis, treatment, and palliative care). For reviews that referred to a lag time of interest using terms of common usage in the cancer community (e.g., diagnostic delay and treatment delay), we abstracted the start and endpoints of lag time intervals from the original studies and cross-validated these definitions with those used in the included review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seoane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seoane et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neal et al., 2015</xref>). Some reviews did not mention whether the time between the start and endpoints included or excluded other ‘milestones’ along the cancer care continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hangaard Hansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graboyes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van den Bergh et al., 2013</xref>).

Although they provided consistent conclusions, differences in the magnitude of the reported risk estimates could be attributed to conflicting inclusion of a registry-based study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hershman et al., 2006b</xref>) that found a significant association between extended T32 and mortality. This registry-based study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hershman et al., 2006b</xref>) was included in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhan et al., 2018</xref> meta-analyses, which yielded risk estimates greatest in magnitude, and accounted for 21.24% and 8.09% of the weight in their analyses, respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raphael et al., 2016</xref>, who reported the most conservative pooled risk estimate, did not include this registry-based study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hershman et al., 2006b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raphael et al., 2016</xref> argued that inclusion of this registry-based study in Yu et al.’s analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2013</xref>) could have introduced bias by confounding or misclassification of ACT as palliative rather than curative, resulting in an overestimation of risk associated with prolonged T32. By extension, this argument could also apply to Zhan et al.’s analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhan et al., 2018</xref>). However, Raphael et al.’s argument relied on the assumption that those who received palliative ACT were not only less likely to survive, but also more likely to experience longer time to ACT after surgery, thus inducing an artifactual association between shorter time from surgery to ACT and mortality. Because it is unknown whether patients undergoing palliative care would be considered lower priority for receiving ACT or, conversely, experience shorter time to ACT due to directed resources specific to palliative care units, it is unclear as to whether the possible inclusion of patients undergoing palliative ACT in the registry-based study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hershman et al., 2006b</xref>) would have led to an over- or under-estimation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhan et al., 2018</xref> risk estimates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>T29 and rectal cancer</title><p>The three meta-analyses evaluating the impact of time from NACRT to surgery (T29) on pCR rates among patients with advanced rectal cancer provided different conclusions regarding the optimal timing of surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petrelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2018</xref>).

These cut-offs were determined based on the seminal Lyon R90-01 trial, which investigated the impact of 6–8 weeks between NART and sphincter-preserving surgery compared to 2 weeks on pathological downstaging among patients with rectal cancer and established 6–8 weeks as an accepted lag time of NART or NACRT after surgery in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Francois et al., 1999</xref>). However, an evaluation of a 6- to 8-week length of time between preoperative radiotherapy and surgery in the trial might not have precluded the potential for shorter time between preoperative chemoradiotherapy and surgery (T29) (&gt;2 and &lt;6–8 weeks), or longer T29 (&gt;6–8 weeks) to sustain benefit for patients with rectal cancer.</p><p>Considering this uncertainty, Wang et al. conducted subgroup analyses based on different cut-offs of T29 (5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12 weeks) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) and found that performing surgery at 7 and 8 weeks yielded a significantly improved pCR rates compared to performing surgery earlier, at 5 or 6 weeks, or later, at 10 or 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). This reported ‘optimal window’, which is narrower than the clinically accepted 6- to 8-week window, suggests that benefits associated with NACRT for patients with advanced rectal cancer are dependent on the timing of surgery and also on inter-individual variation in response to NACRT. Among rectal cancer patients, surgery performed too soon may not allow for the maximal anti-tumourigenic response to NACRT, however, waiting too long could mitigate any potential benefit that could be maintained from NACRT and permit tumour repopulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>T32 and colorectal cancer</title><p>Three meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petrelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Des Guetz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biagi et al., 2011</xref>) investigating the association between time from surgery to ACT on mortality among patients with colorectal cancer reported significant associations between extended time from surgery to ACT (T32) and risk of mortality.

Notably, the cut-offs defining ‘early’ versus ‘deferred’ lag time intervals in both meta-analyses were based on those used in the included original studies. It is also likely that the wide range of lag time intervals across studies might have influenced the precision and significance of the reported risk estimates, hence the importance of standardization of lag time cut-offs in meta-analyses and the impact of lag time variable type on statistical findings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Methodological gaps in lag time literature</title><p>In juxtaposing the design and analytical approaches of included reviews, we identified three predominant methodological gaps in lag time literature which can guide future research on lag times in cancer care. Firstly, consideration of change in intervention modality over time was inconsistent across included reviews. Failure to account for improvement of clinical protocols and treatment regimens, which can confer greater protection against morbidity- and mortality-related outcomes, could have biased the observed risk estimates based on recency of included studies and their corresponding weight in the meta-analyses. For example, the three meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raphael et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhan et al., 2018</xref>) that reported significant associations between time to ACT after surgery (T32) and mortality among patients with breast cancer included studies for which chemotherapy regimens were anthracycline-based and/or CMF regimens with the earliest included study dating to 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pronzato et al., 1989</xref>). This could constrain generalizability of results to patients treated with more recent ACT regimens which primarily include taxanes as standard care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zaheed et al., 2019</xref>). It is noteworthy, however, that apart from the recent advent of immunotherapy and targeted therapies, which fall under the umbrella of precision medicine, there have not been major paradigm shifts in treatment provision during the timespan covered by our search (1 January 2010 to 31 December 2019). Nevertheless, our restriction on publication date of included systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses does not prevent the inclusion of studies that evaluate interventions that have since evolved in type, dosing, and/or timing. Indeed, future ubiquity of novel therapies under the purview of precision medicine will necessitate consideration of the evolution of cancer care in meta-analytical lag time research. In such cases, conducting sensitivity analyses based on treatment type, regimen, or date of publication can provide a clearer understanding of the external validity of reported risk estimates. The findings of select included meta-analyses that did conduct such sensitivity analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) demonstrated the variation in significance of the association between lag time and clinical outcomes due to treatment specification and recency of publication in addition to baseline patient characteristics, such as demographics, stage, date of administration, dosing, type of therapy, and clinical decisions.</p><p>Secondly, ambiguity in defining lag time interval start and endpoints in the reviews and original studies could lead to exposure misclassification. For example, in the case of categorical lag time variables, specification of whether an endpoint is considered as initiation of NACRT, completion of NACRT, or time of medical charting of NACRT, could influence the length of the lag time interval measured and classification of such exposure as experimental or control.</p><p>The Aarhus statement, a set of recommendations and checklist resulting from discussion regarding methodological concerns in research conducted on lag times to cancer diagnosis, identified unclear definitions of start and endpoints in lag times, as well as inconsistency in defining these points across studies evaluating the same lag time as primary obstacles to aggregating research on lag time to cancer diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weller et al., 2012</xref>). We argue that the same concerns would apply to research on lag time between any start and endpoint on the cancer care continuum, not only within time to cancer diagnosis.</p><p>Some of the included qualitative systematic reviews initially intended to meta-analyze the abstracted data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hangaard Hansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graboyes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lethaby et al., 2013</xref>), however, variability in start and endpoint definitions of lag times across included studies and in type of lag time variable (categorical vs. continuous) prevented researchers from pursuing quantitative analyses. This lack of clarity of exposure definitions stymies lag time research and calls for an expansion of the pre-existing Aarhus statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weller et al., 2012</xref>) to encompass lag time research across the entire cancer care continuum. Refinements of the Aarhus statement integrating suggestions from clinicians and cancer diagnosis researchers have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coxon et al., 2018</xref>), yet are still restricted to cancer diagnosis, rather than applicable to the entire cancer care continuum. Additions to the Aarhus statement regarding the entire continuum could provide not only recommendations for standardizing lag time definitions in randomized controlled trials and observational studies, but also for justifying classification of lag time categorically versus continuously (e.g., evaluation of a lag time cut-off in standard care). Apart from residual confounding that can arise from categorical classification of lag time, the method of defining lag time categories using cut-offs can substantially impact resulting risk estimates and their corresponding uncertainty. Some included meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seoane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seoane et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gómez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Usón et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) utilized categories of ‘early’ and ‘deferred’ care defined by original studies. Even when classifying lag time categorically is appropriate, not standardizing cut-offs across included studies can give rise to more significant variation in risk estimates and constrict interpretation of resulting findings. Overall, recommendations for defining lag time exposure across the entire continuum and strategizing statistical classification of lag time exposure is necessary for improving the quality and utility of future lag time research.</p><p>Thirdly, confounding by indication needs to be taken into consideration in research conducted on lag times in cancer care. Otherwise monikered the ‘waiting-time paradox’, confounding by indication is the implication that patients with more advanced-stage disease are prioritized for referral and subsequent treatment within a given health system more rapidly than patients with early-stage, less severe disease. The overall effect of this prioritization leads to the indication that early referral and/or treatment is associated with higher mortality; this survival trend is in direct contradiction with the typical log-linear approach taken in meta-analyses on the association between extended lag time to cancer treatment and risk of mortality. The presence of the waiting-time paradox in meta-analyses can be most clearly identified when lag time is treated as a continuous rather than categorical variable. However, this can be difficult as studies included in meta-analyses often regard lag times as dichotomous exposures. Few of the meta-analyses included in the current scoping review reported risk estimates for lag time intervals as a continuous exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loureiro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raphael et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biagi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Notwithstanding appropriate justification for treating lag time categorically, either sensitivity analyses using different cut-offs of categorical lag time or meta-analyses using continuous lag time could facilitate identification of the waiting-time paradox and provide insights regarding its mechanisms.</p><p>Apart from inherent limitations of the included systematic reviews and meta-analyses, some overarching limitations in the methodology of our scoping review need to be acknowledged. Restricting our search to systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses published after 2010 did not prevent the introduction of medical interventions that have changed over time in included literature, however, our reporting of stratified analyses performed in included meta-analyses, when available, by treatment specifications (e.g., dosing, chemotherapy type) does provide context regarding modification of lag time on clinical outcomes by intervention modality. Further, even though some meta-analyses evaluated the same parameters, variability in statistical methods limited the scope of our comparisons between these meta-analyses. While we did not conduct quality assessment due to the nature of the included literature, we did describe characteristics of each review which could aid in assessing the validity and generalizability of each review’s findings. Moreover, differences in reporting across included systematic reviews and meta-analyses prevented our ability to provide (1) aggregated summary statistics of the associations between lag time and oncologic outcomes, and (2) the distribution of lag times experienced by patients included in each study within each meta-analysis. Our inability to provide these statistics stresses the need for transparent and comprehensive reporting in forthcoming research on lag times in cancer care. Finally, despite the importance of examining treatment variations among patients within clinical trial settings, which are circumscribed to well-established rules and procedures, real-world evidence, such as data from electronic medical or health records, can provide further insight into patient profiles, treatment choice, drug adherence, and adverse event management. These individual-level factors, which are not captured by the included meta-analyses, can appreciably influence oncologic outcomes and thus the true causal effect of lag time on morbidity- and mortality-related outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Contextualizing findings of the scoping review amidst the COVID-19 pandemic</title><p>Our comprehensive map of lag time intervals and clinical outcomes across multiple cancer sites is intended to serve as a reference point for future research evaluating the pandemic’s impact on lag times in cancer control and care. As it can take years for cancer-related survival outcomes to accrue, it is too soon to accurately quantify the impact of extended times to diagnosis and treatment attributable to the pandemic. Hence, the perspectives presented herein on the impact of lag time in cancer control and care not only aid in providing a contextual reference for pandemic-induced lag time compared to standard-of-care lag time experienced prior to the pandemic, but also inform ongoing research on these unprecedented lag times experienced by patients. The reported risk estimates therefore represent the estimated associations between lag time and cancer outcomes prior to the pandemic, which can serve as a standard-of-care reference of these associations regardless of other changes to cancer care due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Recently published modelling studies simulating the long-term impact of pandemic-induced lag times on cancer-related outcomes have informed the degree of tolerability of the widespread consequences of the pandemic on cancer care systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maringe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sud et al., 2020</xref>). A UK population-based modelling study predicting the impact of lag times to diagnosis of colorectal, breast, lung, and esophageal cancers on survival during the 12 months after national lockdown measures began estimated increases of 7.9–9.6%, 15.3–16.6%, 4.8–5.3%, and 5.8–6.0% in deaths due to breast, colorectal, lung, and esophageal cancers, respectively, up to five years after diagnosis compared to pre-pandemic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maringe et al., 2020</xref>). Another modelling study from our group projected a 2% increase in cancer deaths, or an excess 355,172 life-years-lost, in Canada between 2020 and 2030 due to pandemic-induced lag times to both cancer diagnosis and treatment, assuming the cancer care system returned to normal capacity in 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malagón et al., 2022</xref>). Triage systems prioritizing patients into treatment and diagnostic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farah et al., 2021</xref>), on top of system-related constraints, have resulted in unprecedented lag times that exceed those experienced pre-pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jazieh et al., 2020</xref>). This evokes the question as to whether adverse consequences associated with such pandemic-related lag times will be harsher than those described in retrospective data.</p><p>The prevailing concern is that any attenuation of the impact of pandemic-induced lag time on cancer diagnosis and treatment is dependent on immediate recovery of cancer care infrastructure. As was seen most recently with the Omicron variant, which stressed already over-burdened healthcare systems worldwide, healthcare systems’ recovery to full capacity is tenuous. Such fragility signals for an ongoing need to quantify and contextualize lag time’s impact on cancer-related outcomes. This need was highlighted by Hanna et al.’s meta-analysis, which reported generalizable measures of effect of 4-week lag time to treatment, stratified by modality, across seven common cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanna et al., 2020</xref>). While meta-analyses, especially the one by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanna et al., 2020</xref>, can serve as tools for parameterizing models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malagón et al., 2022</xref>) or summarizing the impact of time to treatment across common cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gheorghe et al., 2021</xref>), they may not capture information relevant to particular populations and outcomes. Three included meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petrelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2018</xref>), which reported improved pCR rates among patients with advanced-stage rectal cancer who experienced time between NACRT and surgery of 6–8 weeks, demonstrated the biological benefit of lag time within the context of the intervention. Similarly, extended lag time to subsequent steps in care can be clinically appropriate with regard to patient rehabilitation post-treatment. The impact of lag time to diagnosis and/or treatment may also vary across different types of cancer with differing risk or rates of development within the same site (e.g., breast cancer). That is, just as prolonged lag time can be deleterious, which is often how it is connoted, it can also denote advantageous clinical characteristics. Our scoping review aimed to attend to the same need of summarizing lag time’s impact on oncologic outcomes, however, with the intention of preserving the granularity of these associations across multiple cancer sites, with clearly mapped lag time interval start and endpoints.</p><p>Beyond potential changes in the true association between lag time and cancer-related outcomes attributable to period effects, such as that of the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognize that this true association may change over time with the advancement of treatment regimens and technology in cancer care. Just as the association between lag time to cancer care can change over time due to the advancement of other factors influencing patient outcomes (e.g., treatment modality), the same time-varying factors may have changed due to pandemic disruptions. Moreover, these alterations to additional factors could vary by country, health system, and wave of the pandemic. As such, direct comparison between risk estimates presented herein cannot be made with risk estimates of the association between lag time and patient outcomes during the pandemic when made publicly available. Instead, our tracing of defined lag times across relevant systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses can serve as a pre-pandemic reference when assessing the deviation in lag time duration attributable to the pandemic. Mapping the established relationships between lag time to care and oncologic outcomes when other elements of care were standard can help in constructing guidelines for flexible cancer care in the event of future public health emergencies. Most importantly, this scoping review could lay the groundwork for observational and meta-analytical research on lag time intervals’ influence on oncologic outcomes across sites beyond the most common ones, such as breast, lung, and colorectal. Our detailed exploration into the methodological gaps in lag time literature can assist in identifying key statistics to report such as the distribution of lag time duration experienced by patients, stratified estimates by treatment regimen, and adjustment for time-varying factors that altered during the pandemic. As research is being conducted on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the association between lag time and outcomes among patients with cancer, we believe that our findings can serve as guidance for the variables of interest in new studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Through the aggregation of known associations between lag time and oncologic outcomes and exploration into gaps in lag time research, this scoping review can guide future studies and meta-analyses in the discipline. Our lag time interval timeline, or mapping of lag times on the cancer care continuum, emphasizes the granularity of exposure classification in cancer care. This timeline can act as a blueprint for future studies assessing lag time intervals and/or multiple cancer sites. With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, our extensive characterization of the effect of lag time on oncologic outcomes could aid in gauging lag times in cancer care experienced during the pandemic.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>received MSc. stipends from the Gerald Bronfman Department of Oncology, McGill University</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>received an MSc. stipend from the Gerald Bronfman Department of Oncology, McGill University</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>reports a patent related to the discovery “DNA methylation markers for early detection of cervical cancer”, registered at the Office of Innovation and Partnerships, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>reports grants to his institution from Merck, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Cancer Research Society, Terry Fox Research Institute, Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation, and CCSRI; consultancy for Merck, BMS, Roche, GSK, Novartis, Amgen, Mylan, EMD Serono, and Sanofi; honoraria from McGill University, JGH, BMS, Merck, Roche, GSK, Novartis, Amgen, Mylan EMD Serono, and Sanofi; payments to his institution for participation in a clinical trial within the past 2 years BMS, Novartis, GSK, Roche, AstraZeneca, Methylgene, MedImmune, Bayer, Amgen, Merck, Incyte, Pfizer, Sanofi, Array, MiMic, Ocellaris Pharma, Astellas, Alkermes, Exelixis, VelosBio, and Genetech</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf5"><p>reports support for the present manuscript in the form of a grant to his institution is his name from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Cancer Research Society; consultancy for Merck; a patent related to the discovery “DNA methylation markers for early detection of cervical cancer”, registered at the Office of Innovation and Partnerships, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; and financial interests with Elsevier and Elifesciences Ltd in the form of support fees to maintain the editorial office and work as Senior Editor, respectively</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Search strategy used to identify relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the association between time to cancer diagnosis and treatment and outcomes of interest.</title><p>The search was performed on 15 February 2021, limiting to publications from before the COVID-19 pandemic (1 January 2010–31 December 2019), with no restriction on publication language.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-81354-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of included systematic reviews on the association between time to cancer diagnosis and treatment and clinical outcomes.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-81354-supp2-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of and subgroup and/or sensitivity analysis reported by included meta-analyses on the association between time to cancer diagnosis and treatment and clinical outcomes.</title><p>AC, adjuvant chemotherapy; CI, confidence interval; DFS, disease-free survival; HR, hazard ratio; LR, local recurrence; OR, odds ratio; OS, overall survival; pCR, pathological complete response; RCT, randomized controlled trial; RR, risk ratio; SMM, smoldering multiple myeloma.

Your article has been reviewed by one peer reviewer, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diane Harper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Philip Boonstra.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>– The use of the word 'contradictory' seems, at times, inappropriate. For example, in section T32 and ovarian cancer, it is stated that the two main meta-analyses arrived at contradictory findings because one found a statistically significant increase in mortality due to increases in lagtime and the other did not. It is, in my opinion, not appropriate to describe a non-statistically significant finding as contradicting a statistically significant finding. Both findings could very well be consistent under a null setting or a non-null setting.</p><p>– The connection to the Covid-19 pandemic is somewhat opaque. More specifically, although it stands to reason that the Covid-19 pandemic increased these various lag times (which the authors note on page 16, lines 486-487), it seems that the authors are also implying that the Covid-19 pandemic may have changed the <italic>association</italic> between lag-time and outcome. This is not stated explicitly, but the focus on characterizing relative risks would suggest that this is the case. If the former (namely, the pre-covid-19 distribution of lag times) is of interest, then really the most relevant statistic from the pre-Covid era is not the various associations between lag times and outcome but the distribution of lag times, which are only briefly mentioned and discussed in the manuscript. To serve as a benchmark for lag times, this manuscript would need to provide a carefully curated set of lag-time statistics from these various reviews and meta-analyses.</p><p>– A related question I have is how the relative risks from the pre-covid era are intended to be used as a benchmark. If the Covid-19 pandemic upset all aspects of patient care, then not only the conditional association between outcomes and lagtime will be modified but also (and more fundamentally) the baseline rates of outcomes. I recognize that such statistics are not readily available from meta-analyses or systematic reviews, and this leaves me wondering if the authors can more precisely characterize how the work as presently conducted will be able to help cancer patients on this side of the pandemic.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81354.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>– The use of the word 'contradictory' seems, at times, inappropriate.

We revised the specific example he provided as is indicated below:</p><p>“The two meta-analyses on the association between time to ACT after surgery (T32) and risk of mortality among patients with ovarian cancer reported distinct findings; one found a significantly increased risk of mortality due to longer T32 (46), whereas the other did not find this relationship significant (45).”</p><p>We had also mentioned that findings from other systematic reviews were ‘contradictory’ in the manuscript’s Abstract. We thus amended the language (replacing “contradictory” with “different”) for appropriateness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The connection to the Covid-19 pandemic is somewhat opaque.

This is not stated explicitly, but the focus on characterizing relative risks would suggest that this is the case.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this nuanced suggestion as to the interpretation of our juxtaposition between pre-COVID-19 pandemic lag times and those experienced during the pandemic. Indeed, by specifically presenting our findings within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we aimed to summarize what and how past research on lag times in cancer care has been conducted across cancer sites as well as identify lag times in cancer care that would be most useful to investigate over the duration of the pandemic.</p><p>Specifically, our focus on characterization of relative risks, which were the statistics available from included systematic review and meta-analyses, was to synopsize the established risk of adverse oncologic outcomes attributable to lag time distinct treatment endpoints; we concentrated on the associations between time to treatment and risks of poor outcomes. We do not know if the association between time to treatment and cancer outcomes has changed since the start of the pandemic because other variables such as deviation from standard-of-care dosage and treatment may have changed in emergent periods of the pandemic. It is possible that the crisis induced changes to care standards of care could have influenced the magnitude or directionality of the associations between lag time and cancer-related outcomes during the pandemic period. However, we are confident that reporting relative estimates of risk, despite confounding changes, could provide a reference for the magnitude of change for a given lag time-oncologic outcome association attributable to the pandemic when it is eventually investigated.</p><p>Beyond potential changes in the true association between lag time and cancer-related outcomes attributable to period effects, such as that of the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognize that this true association may change over time with the advancement of treatment regimens and technology in cancer care. We acknowledge this limitation in our discussion and highlight the need for future research to stratify estimates by treatment type, as interventions varying in efficacy can influence the summary estimates. We further address concerns about our presentation of the relationship between our findings and the COVID-19 pandemic in Response #4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the former (namely, the pre-covid-19 distribution of lag times) is of interest, then really the most relevant statistic from the pre-Covid era is not the various associations between lag times and outcome but the distribution of lag times, which are only briefly mentioned and discussed in the manuscript. To serve as a benchmark for lag times, this manuscript would need to provide a carefully curated set of lag-time statistics from these various reviews and meta-analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unsure as to whether Dr. Boonstra is referring to the “distribution of duration within specific lag time intervals” or “overall distribution of lag time intervals” experienced by patients with cancer over time.</p><p>Concerning the former potential interpretation of Dr. Boonstra’s comment, we agree that this would more appropriately distinguish between what lag time durations were standard prior to the pandemic and better characterize the variation in these standard lag time interval durations. However, the included systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses only provided the time range of the lag times experienced by patients with cancer based on the reporting in each individual study.</p><p>As for the latter interpretation of Dr. Boonstra’s comment, we were limited to mapping and presenting only lag time intervals for which their association with oncologic outcomes were systematically reviewed and/or meta-analyzed. We had restricted inclusion of literature to systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses as to select the highest level and quality of summarized evidence possible, however, we recognize the potential for differential selection and thus presentation of lag times which have been most researched. We endeavored to exhibit the distribution of these researched lag times in Figure 2, where we visualized the various lag time intervals included in our review across the cancer care continuum, as well as in Table 1, where we display at what frequency particular lag time intervals had been investigated across cancer sites.</p><p>To clarify this aim, we revised the manuscript to include the following:</p><p>“Table 1 highlights the distribution of and frequency at which unique lag time intervals were investigated over different cancer sites, and thus synopsizes the distribution of lag time intervals across systematic review and meta-analytical research.”</p><p>In order to attend to the limitations in reporting the distribution of lag time durations experienced by patients, we included the following revisions to the limitations section of our Discussion (red text designates changes):</p><p>“While we did not conduct quality assessment due to the nature of the included literature, we did describe characteristics of each review which could aid in assessing the validity and generalizability of each review’s findings. Moreover, differences in reporting across included systematic reviews and meta-analyses prevented our ability to provide (1) aggregated summary statistics of the associations between lag time and oncologic outcomes, and (2) the distribution of lag times experienced by patients included in each study within each meta-analysis. Our inability to provide these statistics stresses the need for transparent and comprehensive reporting in forthcoming research on lag times in cancer care.”</p><p>As for the second part of the Reviewer’s comment, two issues were raised. First, we wish to clarify that the purpose of the term ‘benchmark’ with regards to lag times was to emphasize the ‘clinically acceptable’ lag times experienced by patients with cancer prior to the pandemic in comparison to extended lag times during the COVID-19 pandemic. These ‘clinically acceptable’ lag time durations are presented in the ‘Lag time interval’ columns of Tables 3 and 4. We felt that presenting the range of lag times experienced by patient populations and the categorical cut-offs chosen by clinical investigators would capture what was standard and common prior to the pandemic. However, to Dr. Boonstra’s point, the term ‘benchmark’ could be misleading for readers as it connotes the ability for direct comparison between risk estimates reported in our scoping review and risk estimates reported during the pandemic. We concur. To avoid this possible misinterpretation, we replaced the term “benchmark” with “contextual reference”, as per the below modifications:</p><p>“Hence, the perspectives presented herein on the impact of lag time in cancer control and care not only aid in providing a contextual reference for pandemic-induced lag time compared to standard-of-care lag time experienced prior to the pandemic, but also inform ongoing research on these unprecedented lag times experienced by patients. The reported risk estimates therefore represent the estimated associations between lag time and cancer outcomes prior to the pandemic, which can serve as a standard-of-care reference of these associations regardless of other changes to cancer care due to the COVID-19 pandemic.”</p><p>Second, lag time statistics – such as the distribution of lag times and/or summary statistics aggregating the relative risks reported by included systematic reviews and meta-analyses through a meta-analysis of these meta-analyses – may provide further utility in encapsulating the relationship between lag time and cancer outcomes. However, pooling such summary statistics would have been inappropriate given the substantial heterogeneity in methodology across the included systematic reviews and meta-analyses and was beyond the scope of this scoping review’s aim. Moreover, aggregation of lag time-oncologic outcomes associations could have resulted in aberrant findings due to potential confounding. As such, we presented in as much detail as possible the statistical decisions made in each meta-analysis to provide the reader with enough context to determine the validity and utility of the various estimates of these associations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A related question I have is how the relative risks from the pre-covid era are intended to be used as a benchmark. If the Covid-19 pandemic upset all aspects of patient care, then not only the conditional association between outcomes and lagtime will be modified but also (and more fundamentally) the baseline rates of outcomes. I recognize that such statistics are not readily available from meta-analyses or systematic reviews, and this leaves me wondering if the authors can more precisely characterize how the work as presently conducted will be able to help cancer patients on this side of the pandemic.</p></disp-quote><p>As was stated previously in our Response #3, we agree with this concern. Time to care was one of many cancer care elements that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because lag time was our exposure of interest, we concentrated our efforts towards presenting what lag times were standard of care prior to the pandemic. Even though other factors like treatment regimens may have changed during the pandemic, clearly defining standard-of-care lag time durations and the deviation in lag times that occurred before pandemic disruptions could aid clinicians in determining how much deviation from lag times was ‘normal’ before the pandemic compared to during the pandemic. We hope that exhibiting these estimates would help in generating guidelines for future public health emergencies that would interrupt cancer care.</p><p>After taking into consideration Dr. Boonstra’s comments and suggestions, we added the following to the discussion of our scoping review (red text designates changes).</p><p>“Beyond potential changes in the true association between lag time and cancer-related outcomes attributable to period effects, such as that of the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognize that this true association may change over time with the advancement of treatment regimens and technology in cancer care. Just as the association between lag time to cancer care can change over time due to the advancement of other factors influencing patient outcomes (e.g., treatment modality), the same time-varying factors may have changed due to pandemic disruptions. Moreover, these alterations to additional factors could vary by country, health system, and wave of the pandemic. As such, direct comparison between risk estimates presented herein cannot be made with risk estimates of the association between lag time and patient outcomes during the pandemic when made publicly available. Instead, our tracing of defined lag times across relevant systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses can serve as a pre-pandemic reference when assessing the deviation in lag time duration attributable to the pandemic. Mapping the established relationships between lag time to care and oncologic outcomes when other elements of care were standard can help in constructing guidelines for flexible cancer care in the event of future public health emergencies. Most importantly, this scoping review could lay the groundwork for observational and meta-analytical research on lag time intervals’ influence on oncologic outcomes across sites beyond the most common ones, such as breast, lung, and colorectal. Our detailed exploration into the methodological gaps in lag time literature can assist in identifying key statistics to report such as the distribution of lag time duration experienced by patients, stratified estimates by treatment regimen, and adjustment for time-varying factors that altered during the pandemic. As research is being conducted on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the association between lag time and outcomes among patients with cancer, we believe that our findings can serve as guidance for the variables of interest in new studies.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
