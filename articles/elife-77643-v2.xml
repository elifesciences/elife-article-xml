How a change in reproductive state or the discrete event of mating modulates specific female behaviors is still incompletely understood. Using calcium imaging of the whole brain of <italic>Drosophila</italic> females, we find that mating does not induce a global change in brain activity. Instead, mating modulates the pheromone response of dopaminergic neurons innervating the fly’s learning and memory center, the mushroom body (MB). Using the mating-induced increased attraction to the odor of important nutrients, polyamines, we show that disruption of the female fly’s ability to smell, for instance the pheromone cVA, during mating leads to a reduction in polyamine preference for days later indicating that the odor environment at mating lastingly influences female perception and choice behavior. Moreover, dopaminergic neurons including innervation of the β’1 compartment are sufficient to induce the lasting behavioral increase in polyamine preference. We further show that MB output neurons (MBON) of the β’1 compartment are activated by pheromone odor and their activity during mating bidirectionally modulates preference behavior in mated and virgin females. Their activity is not required, however, for the expression of polyamine attraction. Instead, inhibition of another type of MBON innervating the β’2 compartment enables expression of high odor attraction. In addition, the response of a lateral horn (LH) neuron, AD1b2, which output is required for the expression of polyamine attraction, shows a modulated polyamine response after mating. Taken together, our data in the fly suggests that mating-related sensory experience regulates female odor perception and expression of choice behavior through a dopamine-gated learning circuit.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfactory system</kwd><kwd>mushroom body</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>neural circuits</kwd><kwd>internal state</kwd><kwd>imaging</kwd><kwd>mating state</kwd><kwd>polyamine</kwd><kwd>female behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC StG FlyContext</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedrich</surname><given-names>Anja B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GR4310/5-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boehm</surname><given-names>Ariane C</given-names></name><name><surname>Bandow</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC870</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siju</surname><given-names>KP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siju</surname><given-names>KP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behavioral and in vivo imaging analysis in the fly suggests that mating-related sensory experience regulates female odor perception and expression of choice behavior through a dopamine-gated learning circuit.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>External stimuli and internal states guide decisions by influencing interpretation of the environment. These decisions not only impact on the individual itself but may have severe effects on its offspring. A female animal, therefore, adapts her choices to her reproductive state. This includes not only the decision to mate, but also a preference for certain, nutrient-rich food sources or, in case of egg-laying animals, oviposition sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chapman and Wolfner, 2017</xref>; Sayin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sayin et al., 2018</xref>). Choices pertaining to food, nutrients, or egg-laying sites frequently depend on chemosensory cues such as odors or tastes. In line with this, changes in olfactory and gustatory perception have been reported for pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ochsenbein-Kölble et al., 2007</xref>). The cellular and neural mechanisms responsible for such reproductive state-dependent preferences remain incompletely understood.</p><p>A powerful mechanism for adapting preference for an odor or taste according to internal state acts within the very sensory neurons that detect the chemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2011</xref>). For instance, hunger increases the sensitivity of sweet taste and quenches that of bitter taste neurons in different animal species including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carnell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">LeDue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Palouzier-Paulignan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rolls, 2007</xref>). The estrous cycle influences how a female mouse perceives a putative mate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dey et al., 2015</xref>). Outside of estrus, the hormone progesterone strongly inhibits the female’s male pheromone-sensitive olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), and thereby, completely blunts her interest in males. Moreover, previous results using volume measurements in human females before, during, and after pregnancy suggested that pregnancy induces long-lasting, global changes in grey matter volume in several brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hoekzema et al., 2017</xref>), indicative of modulation in multiple higher brain regions. In the genetically tractable insect, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, reproductive state also induces dramatic shifts in the female’s chemosensory perception and choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hussain et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). We have previously shown that a mating-induced transient neuropeptidergic modulation of OSNs strongly increases a female fly’s preference for higher concentrations of polyamines, a nutrient that significantly increases female egg production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hussain et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hussain et al., 2016b</xref>). This rather short-lasting sensory modulation (~24 hr) leads to a longer lasting change in the female’s choice behavior, indicating that mating might modulate higher chemosensory processing in the female’s central brain. Here, we aimed at investigating the nature and circuit mechanisms of these mating-induced longer lasting behavioral changes.</p><p>We used reproductive state-dependent behavior of flies to polyamines to address the more general question of how mating lastingly changes odor perception. Polyamines, namely putrescine, spermine, and spermidine, play essential and conserved roles in most eukaryotic cells and organisms, ranging from DNA replication, cell proliferation, embryonic development to healthy aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Miller-Fleming et al., 2015</xref>). High concentrations of putrescine in food increase egg laying in <italic>Drosophila</italic> females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hussain et al., 2016b</xref>). More importantly, olfactory detection of polyamines is relatively well characterized at the sensory neuron level and depends on two co-expressed ionotropic receptors (IR), IR76b and IR41a on the fly’s antenna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hussain et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>). Within the first several hours after mating, the expression of the neuropeptide receptor, sex peptide receptor (SPR), increases by tenfold in the OSNs leading, when bound to its ligand myoinhibitory peptide (MIP), to a depression of polyamine OSN presynaptic output to the second order neurons of the olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hussain et al., 2016a</xref>). While virgin flies show a high attraction toward low concentration of polyamines, mated flies are attracted to higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hussain et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>OSNs and second order neurons of the olfactory system, the projection neurons (PNs), synapse in glomeruli in the antennal lobe (AL). PNs pass on the olfactory information to two higher order brain centers of the insect, the mushroom body (MB) and the lateral horn (LH). Output neurons of these brain centers, MB output neurons (MBON) and LH output neurons (LHON), respectively, are thought to pass on this information to neurons eventually projecting to motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bates et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schlegel et al., 2021</xref>). Both brain centers also receive input by neuromodulatory neurons. In particular, the role of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) innervating the 15 compartments of the MB, where they form neuromodulatory synapses with MBONs and the MB intrinsic neurons, the Kenyon cells (KC), have been studied extensively for their role in aversive and appetitive memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Siju et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Thum and Gerber, 2019</xref>). In a simple model, DANs respond to contextual information such as reward or punishment and thereby modulate the synapse between a specific MBON, usually of the same compartment as the DAN, and the KCs. Most studies have reported a depression of the KC-MBON synapse as a result of context or experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Owald et al., 2015</xref>). Further evidence indicates that DANs might not only modulate MBONs but also activate them directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, MB output can affect LH output. Dolan et al. recently reported that learning modulates the response of specific LHONs through an MBON connecting the MB to the LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Attraction to nutrients, egg-laying or nest building sites are considered innate behaviors in most female animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cury et al., 2019</xref>). Innate olfactory behavior is thought to rely on stereotyped circuits connecting specific glomeruli in the AL to specific neurons in the LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ebrahim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Min et al., 2013</xref>). In line with this, previous work in the fly has implicated the LH in the control of reproductive behaviors, such as responses to sex pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>). Neurons innervating or providing output of the LH show largely stereotypic responses to groups of odors (; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, recent studies implicated neurons in the LH in innate valence decisions and odor classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Strutz et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, modulation of innate behavior, for instance in the context of hunger, also involves the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bräcker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grunwald Kadow, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sayin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>). In reproductive behavior, dopaminergic neurons (DANs) innervating the MB regulate the mated female’s decision of where to lay her eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azanchi et al., 2013</xref>). DAN odor responses are modulated by the mating state of the female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Siju et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, it is worth noting that a crucial role for dopamine and the MB have been shown in the mating-induced changes in male courtship learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Keleman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Siegel and Hall, 1979</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have investigated the neural circuits underpinning female reproductive state-dependent odor attraction on the example of polyamine sensing using brain-wide imaging, connectomics, and behavioral analysis. Our combined data suggest that specific dopaminergic neurons relay the experience of mating to the female’s MB, thereby inducing a long-lasting change in female olfactory preference.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mating-related signals induce a lasting increase in female polyamine attraction</title><p>Mated female flies show an increased attraction to polyamine odors, such as putrescine, as compared to virgin females due to SPR-mediated neuromodulation of polyamine sensitive OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hussain et al., 2016a</xref>).

However, the attraction to the odor of ammonia, another odor released during decomposition of organic matter, or the food odor vinegar did not increase significantly after mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>,B). Nevertheless, it is conceivable that other odor responses are similarly affected by mating. Moreover, the context or test assay likely also influences the expression of olfactory behavior (e.g. T-maze vs. egg-laying assay).</p><p>During copulation, the male fly transfers sperm and seminal fluid into the female reproductive tract. Among the factors transferred with the sperm is one of the ligands of SPR, sex peptide (SP). SP binds to neurons expressing SPR in the female’s reproductive tract and induces the so-called canonical post-mating switch, a suite of behaviors associated with reproduction such as increase in egg laying and rejection of males attempting to mate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kubli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yapici et al., 2008</xref>). Although SPR is required for the change in the mated female’s polyamine preference behavior, this appears to rely mainly on the other ligands, myoinhibitory peptides (MIPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hussain et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kim et al., 2010</xref>) as females mated to SP mutant males still undergo the change in polyamine preference behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hussain et al., 2016a</xref>). Therefore, we next tested females mated to sterile males. There are two previously used experimental methods to achieve such an effect: males that do not produce either seminal fluid protein or sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boswell and Mahowald, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chow et al., 2015</xref>). To generate males incapable of producing seminal fluid protein, accessory glands were disrupted through induction of ER stress (see methods; <italic>prd-GAL4;UAS-BiP-RNAi</italic>). After copulation with a seminal fluid protein deficient male, females showed a normal increase in preference for polyamine odor as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Similarly, copulation with sperm-deficient males, which were generated by using the male progeny of female mutants of <italic>tudor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chapman et al., 2003</xref>), also led to mated females that behaved indistinguishable from females that mated with wildtype males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This result was in line with our previous finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hussain et al., 2016a</xref>), and suggested that not only was SP not essential, but also that other sperm- and seminal fluid-associated factors were dispensable. Moreover, we had previously tested females that, similarly to females mated to sterile males, were unable to produce eggs by generating <italic>ovoD</italic> mutant females. <italic>OvoD</italic> females mated with wildtype males underwent the switch in behavior and were attracted to polyamines to the same extent as controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hussain et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>We continued to look for additional triggers that could work in synergy with courtship such as signals transferred or present during mating. Male flies perform a complex courtship before attempting to mount the female in order to mate. During this time, females will, among other signals, also smell male-emitted pheromones such as 11-cis-Vaccenyl acetate (cVA). We hypothesized that mating, or more specifically pheromone, could act as a contextual sensory signal able to lastingly modulate higher olfactory processing, perhaps analogous to other sensory contextual experiences such as sweet taste or pain. Our earlier work using in vivo two-photon imaging revealed that some subsets of DANs, presumably primarily through input from KCs, responded strongly to cVA in a mating state-dependent manner suggesting (a) that cVA could act as a contextual signal and (b) that mating induces a lasting change cVA-induced DAN activity. Primarily, DANs innervating a specific compartment of the MB, β’1, responded significantly stronger to cVA in females days after mating as compared to virgins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Siju et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, cVA and other pheromones (e.g. 7-tricosene) are transferred onto the female during courtship and mating, and remain on her body for an extended period of time (~24 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ejima et al., 2007</xref>). To test the role of courtship and its signals <italic>vs</italic>. actual mating, we allowed fly couples to go through the courtship ritual but separated them just as the male attempted to mount the female. We then analyzed the odor preference behavior of these females that were technically still virgins. The behavior of these females lay between virgins and mated females and was neither significantly different from virgins nor from mated females consistent with the hypothesis that courtship related signals might contribute as behavioral change triggers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Based on this observation and our data above, we next tested one specific aspect of the courtship ritual, odor detection. Pheromone detection relies on the general OR co-receptor, ORCO, and different specific ORs. We thus analyzed mated females mutant for <italic>ORCO</italic>, and hence unable to smell pheromones among other odors. Importantly, ORCO is not required for the detection of polyamine odor, which is mediated by IR76b and IR41a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hussain et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>). Mated <italic>ORCO</italic> mutant females displayed a significantly lower polyamine preference compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Previous work showed that food odors also enhance courtship and mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grosjean et al., 2011</xref>), and that cVA promotes aggregation behavior of flies on food patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lebreton et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, polyamines are present in high concentrations in standard fly food (in μg/100 g fly food): histamine (5.49), ethanolamine (676.65), phenylethylamine (5.16), putrescine (172.50), β-alanine (930.84), tyramine (166.64), spermidine (18120.77), and spermine (492.81) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, the total amount of polyamines in standard fly food is ~20 mg in 100 g food, which is comparable to levels in very polyamine-rich foods such as oranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kalač, 2014</xref>). To test whether the presence of odors such as pheromones or polyamines was important during mating to induce a higher polyamine odor preference upon mating, we blocked the synaptic output of ORCO and IR76b/IR41a-expressing OSNs exclusively during the 24 hr at and around mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While synaptic inhibition of IR41a- and IR76b-expressing OSNs during mating had no effect on the mated female’s odor preference, blocking the synaptic output of ORCO-OSNs during mating but not at test significantly reduced those females’ attraction to the putrescine odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, inhibition of synaptic output of cVA-responsive OR67d OSNs during mating but not during test reduced the mated female’s attraction to putrescine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, we analyzed whether the smell of cVA was sufficient to induce mated-like female polyamine preference by exposing virgin females in food vials for 24 hr to cVA (50 µl pure solution) or just water on a filter paper. We detected no significant difference between the groups indicating that cVA alone is insufficient to induce mated female odor preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>Next, to test whether the context of food was necessary for females to change their preference upon mating, we removed virgin females for 24 hr from fly food and transferred them to a pure agarose substrate. We mated 50% of these females to males on agarose, while the other 50% remained alone – hence, they remained virgin – for the same amount of time. After these 24 hr, flies were transferred again onto regular fly food. Virgins behaved as expected and showed no polyamine preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Females mated on agarose showed no significant decrease in polyamine preference compared to females mated on regular fly food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). We next raised and mated females on a holidic diet containing precise amounts of nutrients such as amino acids but no added polyamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Piper et al., 2014</xref>). We again found no difference in the preference for polyamine odor between the two groups of mated females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p><p>These results provide evidence that courtship promoting signals such as the pheromone cVA contribute to a switch in preference behavior during mating, but that the presence of food odor, including polyamines, during mating is not required.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mushroom body Kenyon cells promote mating state-dependent odor attraction</title><p>Given the role of the MB in olfactory processing and behavioral adaptations and our data above indicating a role of olfaction at the time of mating (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), we wondered whether the MB was involved in the mating-induced increase in odor preference. We started with the principal cells of the MB, the KCs, which receive olfactory input through projection neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Their long axons form the MB lobes that are innervated by DANs and provide output to MBONs. In addition, they also form recurrent connections with the DANs of the same and in rarer cases additional MB compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Li et al., 2020b</xref>). Given the role of olfaction in courtship and mating, we switched to single fly assays to ensure that mated females were indeed mated; all females were analyzed for successful fertilization upon mating and females that did not produce offspring were discarded from the analysis. We used a set of split-Gal4 lines, generated to target individual cell types of the MB network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>). We expressed the temperature-sensitive mutant of dynamin, Shibire<sup>ts1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kitamoto, 2001</xref>), in all KCs (<italic>MB10B-Gal4;UAS-shits1</italic>), inhibited synaptic transmission by shifting the females to 30℃, and tested their individual polyamine odor preference in the T-maze assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). KC output could be required for the expression of polyamine odor attraction but also for the increase from virgin to mated female behavior. To test this hypothesis, we shifted the females (<italic>MB10B-Gal4;UAS-shi<sup>ts1</sup></italic>) from 25 to 30℃ for 24 hr at four different time points: (1) 24 hr before mating, (2) 24 hr during mating, (3) 24 hr after mating, and (4) at test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Blocking synaptic output during 24 hr before or between mating and test had no significant effect on the mated female’s preference for polyamines showing that long-term synaptic inhibition of KCs per se does not affect this behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, 50% represents chance). By contrast, blocking KC output exclusively during the 24 hr during and around mating, completely prevented the change from virgin to mated female putrescine attraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Inhibition of KC output during the choice test also reduced the percentage of single females choosing putrescine over water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), suggesting an involvement of KC output for the expression of polyamine preference. KC output did not affect the choice of virgins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, KC synaptic output appears to be required at two timepoints: First, it is necessary to induce the change in behavior upon mating, and second, it influences the expression of the actual behavioral choice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The mushroom body and learning mechanisms are required in long-term preference change upon mating.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simplified schematic overview of the observed connections between neurons in the olfactory system.

PNs project to the two higher olfactory center, the mushroom body (MB) and the lateral horn (LH). In the MB, they provide input to KCs. In the LH, they connect to various types of LHNs. KCs form excitatory synapses onto MBONs. DANs form modulatory synapses onto KCs and MBONs. Note the existence of several recurrent connections.

Moreover, MB β’1-innervating DANs respond to cVA in a mating state-dependent manner. We next asked whether these state-dependent changes in odor response where specific to some neurons or whether mating would induce a more wide-spread or even global change in brain activity. For instance, recent evidence suggests that changes in hormone levels trigger circuit maturation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies during the first week of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Leinwand and Scott, 2021</xref>). We used whole brain lightfield imaging to record the activity of all neurons in the brain in living female flies (<italic>nsyb-Gal4;UAS-CaMP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aimon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aimon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Woller et al., 2021</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Mating did not appear to change brain activity globally in 1-week-old mated and virgin females stimulated with putrescine, and we did not find any significant brain-wide mating state-dependent changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Similarly, we did not detect any significant differences between mated and virgin flies by analyzing individual brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). These data suggested that mating does not induce a significant global change in brain state (e.g. general arousal state), but rather relies on modulation of specific neurons and neural circuit elements relevant to a specific task.</p><p>Therefore, we sought to test experimentally whether DANs, in particular the DANs responsive to cVA, can induce the switch from virgin to mated female odor choice behavior. We started with line MB188B, because it labeled several PAM DANs with axons in the β’1 lobe, namely PAM-β’1ap and PAM-β’1 m, as well as PAM-γ3, and PAM-γ4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>). We manipulated the activity of these PAMs in virgin and mated females as a replacement for actual mating or during mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Given that β’1 DANs responded to cVA, we again used a single fly T-maze to be able to check every single female fly after an experiment for its mating state (i.e. eggs laid or not). Neuronal activation of these DANs with TrpA1 was highly efficient in switching virgin female preference to mated female preference levels for polyamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). By contrast, the same paradigm with another line, MB109B that expresses in a set of β’2 DANs, did not induce changes in mated or virgin fly behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Activation of most of the second cluster of DANs innervating the MB, the PPL1-DANs (MB60B) instead of mating, only induced a mild reduction in mated female preference, but had no effect on virgin female behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Surprisingly, activation of the same DANs during mating significantly reduced the mated female’s attraction to polyamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Inhibition of PAM-DAN synaptic output at the time of test had no effect on virgin behavior, but significantly reduced mated female attraction to putrescine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). By contrast, inhibition of PPL1-DAN output resulted in an opposite phenotype; mated females were still highly attracted to the odor, but now also virgins showed a higher attraction to putrescine as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E-H</xref>). These results are consistent with the interpretation that DANs regulate the expression of female odor attraction in a mating state-dependent manner; although PAM-DANs appear to be necessary for the expression of attraction of mated females, the activity of PPL1-DANs in virgins seems to suppress the expression of odor attraction.</p><p>The present data show that specific DANs can mimic mating experience in inducing a change in odor choice behavior. First, DANs innervating the β’1,γ3/4 compartment of the MB bidirectionally modulate odor attraction at the time of mating. Second, additional PAM-DANs including β’2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>) promote the expression of mated female odor attraction, while PPL1-DANs repress this expression in virgins (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E-H</xref>). As for the involvement of KCs, we speculate that this effect is not limited to a mating-induced change in polyamine odor preference but could extend to other odors and possibly additional internal states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Specific MB output neurons are involved at different time points during reproductive state-dependent female decision-making</title><p>MBONs, as major output of MB KCs and modulatory targets of DANs, are involved in guiding valence-based action selection.

Blocking of synaptic output of MBON-β'1 during the 24 hr period around mating resulted in a strong reduction of polyamine odor preference in mated females at the time of odor test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). suggesting that this MBON’s synaptic output critically contributes to the induction of mating-related behavioral changes. In line with this interpretation, dTrpA1-mediated activation of MBON-β'1 in virgins in place of mating significantly increased these females’ polyamine preference at the time of choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Similar to mating which did not modulate ammonia preference (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the same manipulation did not increase the virgins’ preference for ammonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, activation of MBON-β'1 in virgin females at the time of choice also led to a significant increase in polyamine attraction compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This activation also reduced mated female attraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) suggesting a bidirectional role for this MBON at expression of choice.

MBON-β'1 releases GABA as neurotransmitter and might, therefore, inhibit downstream neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>). We used the trans-TANGO system and EM connectomics to identify the putatively inhibited downstream neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E-G</xref>). Expression of trans-TANGO under the control of the MBON-β'1 Gal4-driver primarily and repeatedly labeled a neuron with neurites in the β'2 region of the MB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F, F’</xref>).

PAM-β’2 m (aka PAM06) receives direct input from MBON-β’1. PAM-β’2 m in turn synapses onto MBONs providing output from the β’2 MB compartment (i.e. β′2mp, β′2mp_bilateral; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Interestingly, β’2 MBONs (i.e. MBON- γ5β′2 a) form direct input synapses with MBON-β’1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>) suggesting a recurrent loop between the β’1, β’2 MBONs and DANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Li et al., 2020b</xref>). Such a recurrent loop could drive persistent behavioral changes as previously shown for male courtship memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>MBONs providing output of β'2 were shown to be required for hunger state-dependent innate odor aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Owald et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, activation of these MBONs using optogenetics is sufficient to elicit strong avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>). To probe the involvement of β’2 MBONs in mating state-dependent attraction, we used line MB11B-Gal4, which drives Gal4 expression in three different MBON-types, namely MBON-β'2mp, MBON-β'2mp_bilateral, and MBONγ5β'2 a. Indeed, temporary thermogenetic activation of these MBONs (<italic>MB11B-Gal4;UAS-dTrpA1</italic>) at the time of olfactory choice, significantly reduced the mated female’s attraction to polyamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Temporary synaptic output inhibition at the time of choice in virgins increased their attraction to polyamine odor but did not affect the high attraction of mated females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). By contrast, neither activation nor synaptic output inhibition at the time or in place of mating influenced the female’s preference behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data suggest that β'2 output is important for the expression of the choice in mated females, but in contrast to β'1 output, it is insufficient to induce the mating-induced change in choice behavior.</p><p>We thus propose a similar scenario as observed for learning with the experience of mating providing a contextual signal conveyed to the MB primarily through the β'1 compartment. The β'2 compartment, like in expression of learned behavior, is only necessary to express attraction at the time the mating-induced preference is needed. Given that MBONs are typically not specific to any one odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hige et al., 2015</xref>), we speculate that this mechanism might also affect other mating state-dependent odor perceptions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Specific lateral horn output neurons mediate attraction to polyamines</title><p>Given the previously reported role of the LH in the expression of learned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>), we also analyzed candidate neurons in this brain structure for their role in the expression of polyamine attraction in mated females. Projection neurons (PNs) project from the antennal lobe (AL) glomerulus (VC5), where they receive input by the OSNs detecting polyamine odors (i.e. IR41a/IR76b OSNs) to the LH and the MB calyx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-B’</xref>). As the number of LH output neurons (LHONs) is large, we used the lightfield imaging data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) to narrow down the putative anatomy of candidate neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <italic>nsyb-Gal4;UAS-GCaMP6m</italic>). Stimulation of mated females with putrescine elicited a clear increase in GCaMP fluorescence mainly in the ventral, but also in a smaller area in the dorsal, region of the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). By contrast, stimulation with 1% vinegar activated primarily neurons in the dorsal part of the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Strutz et al., 2014</xref>). This suggested that putative polyamine-responding LHONs strongly innervate the ventral portion of the LH. We again used EM connectomics to search for LHNs receiving input from VC5 PNs in the EM connectome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Li et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). According to neuPrint, three different types of PNs receive direct input from the VC5 glomerulus, adPN, lvPN, and l2PN. Only one of these types, adPN, innervates both the LH and the MB calyx. The primary LHON type receiving adPN input is AD1b2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Most AD1b2 dendrites are indeed located in the ventral part of the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To test the function of putative LHNs more directly in polyamine attraction of mated females, we selected several LHN split-Gal4 lines that labeled AD1b2, but also LHNs that were not directly connected to VC5 PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>). Using these LHN split-Gal4 lines, we temporally blocked synaptic output with Shi<sup>ts1</sup> during test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Only two lines showed a significant reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). One of these lines, L1779, strongly labeled several neurons of the AD1b2 type suggesting that the observed synaptic connections are indeed relevant for the attraction of putrescine. Two additional lines that also expressed in AD1b2 neurons, by contrast, did not reduce putrescine attraction significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These lines, however, labeled fewer neurons than L1779 suggesting a certain redundancy between the AD1b2 type neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E-G</xref>; L1538/1539: 9.8±1.5 <italic>vs</italic>.

We optogenetically activated these DANs with pulsing light for 24 hr using CsChrimson and recorded calcium responses in the β’1 and β’2 MBONs to putrescine odor thereafter (<italic>MB188B-Gal4;UAS-CsChrimson; VT1211-lexA;lexAop-GCaMP7f</italic>). Imaging following this exogenous activation again did not reveal a difference in polyamine responses between the test group and the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Acute optogenetic activation of PAM β’1,γ3/4 at the time of imaging, however, led to an activation of β’1 and β’2 MBONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>,C). Although additional experiments would be needed as further confirmation, these data are consistent with the presence of an excitatory synapse between these DANs and the MBONs in addition to a neuromodulatory connection.</p><p>Based on the behavioral data, we predicted and found that MBON β’1 would respond to cVA. We also predicted that mating or the exogenous activation of β’1,γ3/4-PAMs would lead to a lasting modulation of the MBON odor response. However, we did not observe a lasting change in the response of β’1 or β’2 MBONs to putrescine after mating or exogenous PAM activation. We considered two main reasons for this result: First, it is possible that modulation of the β’1-compartment is only short-lasting (e.g. minutes to hours but not days) and therefore, any change is no longer observable at the time of imaging. In addition, the fact that β’1-MBONs bidirectionally modulate the behavior of virgin and mated females suggests that their role and thus the way they are modulated by DANs might be more complex and not detectable through calcium imaging. Second, it is possible that neurons downstream of the MB involved in the expression of the behavior are lastingly modulated.</p><p>Thus, we next analyzed the response of the AD1b2 LH neuron in virgins as compared to mated females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Given that several neurons are labeled in the AD1b2 Gal4 line with slightly different projections, we imaged the odor response at the level of the cluster of cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, upper left panel). In virgins, in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging indicated that AD1b2 neurons responded at the same level to the water control as to putrescine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In mated females, by contrast, AD1b2 neurons responded significantly stronger to putrescine than to the water control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These data are in line with the behavioral data where only mated females show a preference for putrescine over control, while virgins appear to be indifferent and do not prefer either odor. Moreover, these findings resemble previous work indicating that learning modulates the odor response of specific LH neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mating modulates the putrescine response of lateral horn neuron AD1b2.</title><p>Upper left panels: High-resolution two-phtoton image of expression of Gal4-line LH1779 (<italic>LH1779-Gal4; UAS-GCaMP7s</italic>) in the region of the lateral horn (LH).

This modulation and our finding that they are involved in the expression of putrescine attraction in mated females indicates that mating-induced modulation of the LH is important for female reproductive behavior.

Inhibition of MBON-α2sc, which connects the MB to specific neurons in the LH, reduces polyamine attraction in mated females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) consistent with the hypothesis that a mating-induced modulation of MB DANs could be relayed to the LH.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The transition from a sexually immature to a mature, reproducing parent is a major step in the life of most animals. With this step come new needs and demands, reflected in a significant change in an animal’s behavior and preferences. While many aspects of reproductive behavior are innate, sexual and parental behavior is highly flexible and changes through physiology and with experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Griffith and Ejima, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Koch and Ehret, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Marlin et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, sexually mature animals spend a major proportion of their lives with generating or caring for their offspring. In line with this, some of the behavioral and neuronal changes persist for a significant fraction of an animal’s lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hoekzema et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Insel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Reisenman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have identified a mechanism how a change in reproductive state translates into behavioral output. We propose a model wherein mating experience, through the sensation of mating-related odors such as cVA, is relayed to the MB via specific DANs innervating the β’1 compartment. Thereby, mating-related stimuli modulate or activate the output of β’1, and lastingly change the polyamine response of LHON AD1b2. This in turn induces a higher polyamine preference upon mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The expression of this higher preference relies on β’2 MBONs and AD1b2 LHONs, analogous to the situation found upon associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, changes induced by the experience of mating are induced and expressed through a dopamine-gated learning circuit. Given that neither MBONs nor LHONs are selective for any one odor, we propose that this mechanism could also play a role in the mating state-dependent adaptation of other choice behaviors.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The mushroom body regulates odor preference behavior of females before and after mating.</title><p>Working model showing that in virgin females (before mating), the activity of PPL1 dopaminergic neurons and MBONβ’2 suppress the expression of polyamine odor preference. During mating, β’1,γ3/4 PAM dopaminergic neurons and β’1-MBONs convey the experience of mating, possibly through the detection of the pheromone cVA, to the mushroom body. This mechanism induces a long-lasting change in polyamine preference in mating females. Moreover, mating changes the polyamine odor response of the AD1b2 LHONs. After mating, mated females express their higher attraction to polyamine odor through a circuit involving the activity of PAM-β’2,γ4 dopaminergic neurons and the suppression of MBON-β’2 output. In addition, output of the lateral horn through at least two different types of output neurons (AD1b2 and aSP-g) is required for the expression of high polyamine preference. It is conceivable that the lateral horn and the mushroom body circuits are connected through specific output neurons such as MBON-α2sc.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77643-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>Triggers for reproductive state-dependent changes in the female brain</title><p>We have previously shown that SP appears to play a rather redundant role in the increase in polyamine attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hussain et al., 2016a</xref>). Instead, SPR in OSNs together with its conserved ligand MIP depress OSN synaptic output upon mating and thereby reduce OSN sensitivity to polyamines. As a consequence, SPR mutant females do not show the increased preference for polyamines after mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hussain et al., 2016a</xref>). Mating also reduces the response of the DA1 glomerulus to cVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lebreton et al., 2014</xref>). How this translates into a higher response of β’1 DANs to cVA is unclear and probably lies within the complex, recurrent circuit structure of the MB. Nevertheless, the combined evidence indicates a mating-induced modulation of early as well as higher olfactory processing in MB and LH.</p><p>Our data reported here is consistent with the interpretation that olfactory signals related to mating are involved in conveying mating experience to higher olfactory processing as transient blocking of synaptic output of ORCO-dependent OSNs (i.e. OR67d) during mating reduced the mated females’ attraction at the time of test, suggesting that OR-dependent pheromone detection contributes to the change in behavior from virgin to mated female. Of note, males transfer some of their pheromone onto the female during copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Keleman et al., 2012</xref>), and they also mark feeding and oviposition sites for females by depositing pheromone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lin et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that pheromones are present in the female’s environment just before, during and sometime after mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ejima et al., 2007</xref>). By contrast, the presence of polyamines during mating was not required as temporal inhibition of polyamine OSN synaptic output during mating did not affect the mated female’s high putrescine attraction during test. In line with a putative role of odors such as pheromones, in vivo calcium imaging data shows that the pheromone cVA activates DANs of the β’1 compartment; this activation is modulated by state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Siju et al., 2020</xref>). We speculate, that the mechanisms we describe here might represent a female version of male courtship learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ejima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Keleman et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with our observations, specific DANs can mimic courtship experience in naive males in the absence of an actual rejection by an already mated female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Keleman et al., 2012</xref>). Males likely associate cVA, which was transferred during previous copulation by another male onto the female, with the experience of rejection by an already mated female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ejima et al., 2007</xref>). In our scenario, the pheromones transferred to the female during copulation would be ‘sensed’ by the β’1 DANs which in turn induce a shift in how the MB regulates the expression of odor preference through output neurons of the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Naturally, mating itself stimulates also mechanosensory neurons in the female’s reproductive tract and thereby appears to contribute to a switch in her behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shao et al., 2019</xref>). Among the most important is SPR-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yapici et al., 2008</xref>). SPR mutant females, as mentioned above, do not undergo the change in polyamine preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hussain et al., 2016a</xref>). Other hormonal or peptidergic signals, such as steroids or juvenile hormone (JH) could play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Moshitzky et al., 1996</xref>). For instance, JH drives network maturation of the MB in young flies and thereby promotes their ability to form memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Leinwand and Scott, 2021</xref>). Recent elegant work showed that mating triggers neuropeptide (i.e. Bursicon) release from enteroendocrine cells, which in turn modulate female appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hadjieconomou et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, additional factors are likely involved in conveying mating experience to the female’s higher brain centers. We propose that these factors also explain the fact that inhibition of PAM-β’1,γ3/4 during mating does not prevent the switch in the mated female’s preference for polyamines. Thus, PAM-β’1,γ3/4 is sufficient to induce a behavior in a virgin female that resembles a specific aspect of the behavior of a mated female, but it not strictly necessary. Given the importance of reproductive behavior for any species, it might not be surprising that multiple parallel systems ensure the transition from a virgin to a mated female.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mushroom body and lateral horn output promote state-dependent female preference behavior</title><p>The finding that KC synaptic output is required during mating for a lasting change in female choice behavior and not only for its expression is particularly interesting. Previous results using associative learning paradigms suggested that KCs are not essential during learning but only during test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dubnau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">McGuire et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schwaerzel et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In line with our findings, a very recent study suggests that KC output is necessary during training to establish appetitive odor memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pribbenow et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Like KCs, inhibition of MBON-β’1 output at the time of mating prevented the switch to mated female behavior. Similarly, activation of MBON-β’1 output instead of mating also increased the virgin’s polyamine attraction to mated female levels. We thus propose that mating-induced modulation of the relative activity and output of the β’1 compartment of the MB changes the female’s interest in the beneficial compound polyamine. Notably, β’1 MBONs have been implicated previously in courtship conditioning in <italic>Drosophila</italic> males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Montague and Baker, 2016</xref>). Our data confirms that these MBONs are quite selective in their odor response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hige et al., 2015</xref>). They don’t respond to putrescine but to cVA. At this point, we can only speculate about what β’1 MB output does to reproduction related behavior. EM connectomics and trans-TANGO data suggest that β’2 DANs are directly and β’2 MBONs indirectly connected to MBON-β’1. In line with this, we find that blocking β’2 MBON output increases the virgin’s and exogenous activation reduces the mated females attraction to polyamine at the time of test.</p><p>If the mating-induced long-lasting changes in polyamine odor preference are due to a learning mechanism, why do we only see lasting mating-induced changes in the odor response in β’1-DANs but not in β’1 or β’2 MBONs? One possible explanation could be that the changes are subtle and would require the analysis of a significantly higher number of animals. Alternatively, they could be short-lived (e.g. minutes or hours) and observable only at a very specific time point in these MBONs after mating that we were not fortunate enough to hit in our imaging experiments. It is also conceivable that, as the behavioral data indicates, the role of the β’1 compartment is complex and bidirectional, possibly with subtypes of β’1-innervating DANs that connect to different downstream neurons and receive different inputs (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H-J</xref>). Mating could affect these subtypes differently such that a difference is difficult to identify at the current resolution of split-Gal4 lines.</p><p>Lastly, lasting modulation could manifest in changes downstream of the MB circuit. Like previous work indicating that the expression of associative learning requires the activity of specific LHONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>), we also find that AD1b2 LHONs are involved in the expression of putrescine attraction in mated females. As our data suggests, these neurons appear to undergo longer lasting changes in their response to putrescine upon mating (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). While AD1b2 neurons in virgins do not respond differently to the water control as compared to putrescine, mated females do. Given that these neurons are involved in the expression of polyamine attraction, we favor a model where state-dependent changes in the MB network are relayed to the LH to modulate odor attraction. How a mating-induced modulation of the β’1 compartment is relayed to the LH remains to be further investigated. It is possible that another MBON, MBON-α2sc, which connects from the MB to specific neurons in the LH, is involved (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Does state change or a discrete signal induce neuronal changes to facilitate reproductive behaviors?</title><p>A state change, such as before and after mating, could conceivably represent a window of opportunity for changes in relevant neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Griffith and Ejima, 2009</xref>) or even globally in many or all brain regions. Our in vivo whole brain imaging data suggests that, at least in female flies, mating does not induce a strong global change in brain state. Rather, mating appears to induce discrete changes in a dopamine-gated learning circuit. In line with this interpretation, mating and SPR signaling were recently shown to enhance MB-dependent long-term memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic> females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Scheunemann et al., 2019</xref>). Similar scenarios as through mating might arise at times of hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Root et al., 2011</xref>). In other words, food consumed when hungry not only tastes and smells better, it also leaves a longer lasting impression. Mechanistically, such a window of enhanced plasticity might arise through an increase in cAMP in neurons of the MB network at critical phases of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Louis et al., 2018</xref>). Our data provides some evidence that a discrete signal (e.g. pheromone, the act of courting and mating) rather than the physiological state change itself induces the observed increase in olfactory preference. Females that cannot produce eggs, were mated to sterile males, or had a small group of neurons activated instead of mating, they all displayed the increased attraction to polyamines. Given the variety of behavioral adaptations and their ethological importance, it is conceivable that a combination of discrete signals and systemic physiological changes, possibly dependent on the type of behavioral change, work hand-in-hand or in parallel to promote the right behavior at the right time.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>While not all odor responses or odor-induced behaviors are subject to mating-induced changes, it is conceivable that other mating-induced adaptations in sensory including odor perception use the same or similar mechanism as described here on the example of polyamines. Importantly, odor responses in higher brain centers show relatively little odor selectivity for a specific odorant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frechter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hige et al., 2015</xref>). MBONs and LH neurons usually respond to subgroups of odorants possibly depending on their innate or experience-dependent valence. Therefore, it is unlikely that the described mechanism, including the shown manipulations of specific neurons (e.g. manipulations during odor preference test), work exclusively in the context of mating state-dependent behavior to polyamines. We speculate that the described mechanism could be a more general one allowing the responses to other odors or possibly even other sensory modalities to adapt upon mating.</p><p>Beyond insects, such a scenario could arise during different periods of important changes in the body and its environmental demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlson et al., 2018</xref>). An example could be mother-child-bonding in mammals where mother and newborn are particularly sensitive to memorizing the sensory characteristics of each other for a certain period after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cernoch and Porter, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Galbally et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sullivan, 2003</xref>). For instance, the neuropeptide oxytocin, which is released during birth and lactation, induces lasting changes in the mother’s cortex, transforming weaker responses to pup calls in the virgin to strong responses in mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Marlin et al., 2015</xref>). The orchestration of internal state-dependent sensory tuning with plasticity of neurons in higher brain centers could, thus, ensure that animals remember the most relevant information at key turning points in their lives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

T-maze tubes were either prepared with 50 µl of 100 mM 1,4-Diaminobutane (Putrescine, Sigma), 50 µl ultrapure water or different concentrations of ammonia on a piece of Whatman filter paper and sealed with Parafilm until right before the experiment started. Note that the concentration of putrescine is higher than previously reported in Hussain et al. due to a change odor solution preparation as follows. To ensure precise odor concentrations, solid 1,4-Diaminobutane was heated mildly until the solid pieces became liquid. The precise amount was pipetted directly from the solution and diluted in water. Odor solutions were stored at 4 ℃ for a maximum of 14 days, because of the rapid degradation of putrescine molecules in water and air. Thus, it is important to note that the precise concentration of 1,4-Diaminobutane varied and was usually lower than the initial concentration of 100 mM. To ameliorate the problem of fast molecule degradation, odor solution efficacy was regularly tested on CantonS wildtype mated and virgin females and remade if the expected attraction of mated females and low attraction of virgin females was not observed. For the test, flies were tested in groups of ~30 in a non-aspirated T-maze and were allowed 1 min to respond to stimuli. Experimentation was carried out in climate-controlled boxes at 30 °C and 60% rH. A preference index (PI) was calculated by subtracting the number of flies on the control side by the number of flies on the stimulus side and normalizing by the total number of flies. The data is represented by bar graphs of the PIs plus standard error of the mean (SEM) and was analyzed using a Mann-Whitney-U test in R-software. This has been done in Excel’s RealStats Resource Pack. Unless indicated otherwise, significance stars or n.s. concern the comparison between the two virgin groups or the two mated fly groups, respectively.</p><p>Given the importance of reproductive state, we used a single fly assay in order to be able to confirm the reproductive state of each animal tested. All virgin flies that laid fertilized eggs in the days after an experiment were excluded from the analysis. Similarly, all mated females that did not lay fertilized eggs were equally excluded. For single fly T-maze experiments, single mated or virgin females were tested in the same T-maze setup as described above. They were given 1 min to make a choice between water and putrescine. The data is represented as percentage of flies that made a certain choice in bar graphs and was analyzed using a Fisher’s exact test in R-software. This has been done in Excel’s RealStats Resource Pack. Unless indicated otherwise, significance stars or n.s. concern the comparison between the two virgin groups or the two mated fly groups, respectively.</p><p>All experiments were carried out with the experimenter unaware of the genotype or state of the sample.

Five- to 7-day-old female virgin or mated flies of appropriate genotypes were used for experiments. In vivo fly preparations were prepared according to a method described previously. Experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> were imaged using an Olympus FV1000 two-photon microscope system with a BX61WI microscope and a 40 x, 0.8 water immersion objective. GCaMP fluorescence was excited at 910 nm by a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire Mai Tai DeepSee laser. Time series images were acquired at 200x200 pixel resolution at a rate of 3 frames per second for 200 frames using the Olympus FV10-ASW imaging software. In order to minimize brain movement of in vivo preparations under the two-photon microscope, a drop of 1% low melting temperature agarose (NuSieveGTG, Lonza) in imaging buffer maintained at 37 °C was added to the exposed brain. Experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> were imaged using a custom-built two-photon microscope (‘Denk scope’) with a 40 x, 0.8 water immersion objective.

Successful mating or virginity was confirmed later by keeping the vials at 25 °C and checking for larvae a few days after the experiment. Flies were prepared for whole brain imaging at Day 4 after eclosion, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Woller et al., 2021</xref>). The light field microscope was set up according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aimon et al., 2019</xref>. The system was based on a Thorlabs Cerna with a Leica HC FLUOTAR L 25 x/0.95 objective and MLA-S125-f12 microlens array (RPC photonics). The microlens array was placed on the image plane, while the camera imaged the microlens array through 50mmf/1.4 NIKKOR-S Nikon relay lenses. The light field images were recorded at 10 Hz with a scientific CMOS camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0). For odor delivery, a Syntech Stimulus Controller (CSS-55) was connected to a 4 mm PVC tube that was placed under the microscope, 5 mm in front of the fly’s head and delivered a constant air stream of 1000 ml/min. Flies were stimulated by redirecting 30% of main air flow for 1 s through a head-space glass vial filled with 1 ml of 100 mM putrescine by a manual trigger. Each fly was stimulated five times with 50 s interstimulus intervals. The imaging data was processed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Siju et al., 2020</xref>. Volumes were reconstructed using a python program developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Broxton et al., 2013</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Broxton et al., 2013</xref>) and available on github: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/sophie63/FlyLFM">https://github.com/sophie63/FlyLFM</ext-link><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aimon, 2021</xref>. The movement artifacts were removed by 3D registration using the 3dvolreg routine from AFNI. The following steps were performed with MATLAB (version R2019b, MathWorks Inc) unless stated otherwise. The voxel time series were transformed to DF/F by subtracting and normalizing by a moving average over 20 s and noise was reduced, using Kalman filtering. Functional regions were then extracted using principal component analysis and independent component analysis. These were then used as landmarks to align the recordings to anatomical templates from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ito et al., 2014</xref> in FIJI. Masks were created to extract and average DF/F time series for twelve major brain regions (neuropil supercategories). Linear regression of the response time series with the stimulus time series (convolved with the response profile of GCamp6s) was performed. Peak responses to the first four odor stimulations were calculated by subtracting the mean DF/F in a 5 s window before the stimulus from the maximum value in the 20 s window after the stimulus. Interstimulus phases were extracted as 30 s intervals (10 s after a stimulus and 10 s before the next stimulus). Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism (version 9.1.2, GraphPad Software LLC).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Chemical analysis of fly food</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>The following compounds were obtained commercially from the sources given in parentheses: formic acid, sodium hydroxide (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), histamine, ethanolamine, 2-phenylethylamine, putrescine, β-alanine, tyramine, spermine, spermidine, trichloroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), benzoyl chloride (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany), [2H4]-histamine, [2H4]-putrescine (CDN Isotopes, Quebec, Canada), [13C2]-ethanolamine, [13C3,15N]-β-alanine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), [2H4]-phenylethylamine (Dr. Ehrenstorfer, Augsburg, Germany).

mating-induced change of odor preference in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Olfactory cues during mating induce a long-lasting increase in attraction to polyamines in female flies. The authors use a combination of neurogenetics, imaging, and behaviour to identify elements of the mushroom body and lateral horn circuitry involved in this behaviour. The importance of mushroom body plasticity in female postmating changes highlights a novel pathway for these changes and reveals the variety of mechanisms by which the brain can encode experience and adapt behavior, making this paper of interest to scientists within the field of reproductive behaviors and neuroscience of internal states.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77643.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Sen</surname><given-names>Sonia</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04xf4yw96</institution-id><institution>Tata Institute for Genetics and Society</institution></institution-wrap><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Sen</surname><given-names>Sonia</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04xf4yw96</institution-id><institution>Tata Institute for Genetics and Society</institution></institution-wrap><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.07.24.453623">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.24.453623v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Sonia Sen as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We appreciate the extensive body of work presented in this manuscript. All three reviewers were in agreement that the study is both of high quality and of interest to the community. There was also a general agreement that the paper took on parallel aspects of mating induced learning and recall of polyamine preference without resolving the circuit mechanism underlying either. Since blocking KCs is known to broadly affect olfactory coding (Wang et al., 2003), we recommend that the authors focus their analyses on the circuit elements required during mating (not recall). This would give the authors the opportunity to address some of the unresolved issues.</p><p>We summarise here a potential framework for the revised manuscript that we think will help focus the work.

This is a dense paper and the manner in which it is currently written it makes hard for the reader to follow the data. There are a few things that I thought might be causing this. Could the authors please consider these, and any others, to make the data more accessible to the reader?</p><p>– The introduction doesn't equip the reader for what's to come. It doesn't cover many topics that are essential to the story in the manuscript. For example, it would have been nice to include material on mushroom body circuitry, the DA neurons and lateral horn circuitry. It would also have been nice to cover aspects of how these circuits encode associative learning in other contexts.</p><p>– Use of different names for the same neurons: The authors switch between names – sometimes referring to them by their Gal4 lines at others by their functional names.</p><p>– There are non-linear elements of the story telling that make it hard to follow any one thread. For example, the imaging data come up in three places – imaging of DANs in response to cVA, imaging of the whole brains, and finally the imaging of the MBONs to cVA. Have the authors considered addressing the circuit elements first, and then following how the relevant odours are represented in the represented in circuit elements?</p><p>– In general, it would help to have sentences with fewer clauses. At times these clauses are also unexpectedly ordered. A few of these can be a nice touch, but maybe there are a few too many here :</p><p>– Particularly in such dense data, it would really help to start each line of experiments with a motivation for why it was done.</p><p>– Related to the circuitry: The authors have identified various neurons that are involved in different aspects of the mating memory and recall behaviour (in both the MB and the LH). It wasn't clear to me how they think these neurons might function together within a circuit to bring about this behaviour. What's the link between these neurons? What's the link between the LH and MB induced behaviour? Aside from one experiment that stimulated the B1 DAN and monitored the activity in the MBONs, I see few examples of such 'epistatic' interrogation of circuitry. This left me feeling that I knew the parts, but didn't know how they tied up together. It would have been nice to see a few predictions of the circuitry tested as such here.</p><p>– Bidirectional behaviours: There are a couple of examples of bidirectional behaviours mediated by the same neurons in this manuscript. It was surprising to me, for example, that activating B1 DANs during mating interfered with the ability to mount a preference for polyamine, particularly because these neurons are active during mating (their imaging data). Is it possible that with thermogenetics, they are driving the neuron too hard? The P1 neuron mediates different behaviours when driven at different thresholds. Could such a phenomenon be occurring here? Have the authors tried to show this with another tool – csChimson, for example?</p><p>– cVA: I wasn't convinced that cVA was the relevant cue for this behaviour. Neither courtship nor cVA alone could reproduce the behavioural switch. This makes me think that it's likely a combination of pheromones and the physical act of mating that is driving the behaviour. So, I wonder how relevant it is to look for representation of cVA with the identified circuit elements -for example in the B1 DANs. Assessing the representation of the polyamine in a mating dependent way might be more relevant (and the authors have done this for many of their experiments).</p><p>Was there a reason why the authors decided to use an of 16 for the single fly experiments?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>For a previous review I had asked some things, for example if exposure to cVA alone induces preference. I am quite happy to see these experiments now included in the new version of the paper, although it seems a coincidence that I am asked to review another time.</p><p>I think the paper has improved and it is also easier to read now.</p><p>Since I reviewed before, and my comments were seemingly already incorporated, I don't have so many new comments!</p><p>Suggestions:</p><p>1) line 151 following, Figure 1 C, D &gt; I don't understand why these response to cVA experiments are shown here and how they fit with the natural flow of the story- just take them out? It is an interesting finding on its own but confuses the main story a bit. After all, the paper deals with the response to polyamine and how that changes after mating.</p><p>2) Figure 6 A: replace red green color scheme with one more suitable for red green blind.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although the amount of data is impressive, it obscures main conclusions. Trim them to minimal set of data to support the main conclusions. For instance, data in Figure 3C and 3D are irrelevant to the model in Figure 7. Also some of data seem to be replication of previous reports and dispensable. For instance, Figure 1C-D are replication of Siju et al., 2020. ovoD1 mutant data was in Hussain et al., 2016. Otherwise, please clarify what is novel about these data. Along the same line, there is only weak link between data of Kenyon cells and LHON (Figure 2 and 6) and PAM-b'1/MBON-b'1.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A dopamine-gated learning circuit underpins reproductive state-dependent odor preference in <italic>Drosophila</italic> females&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved, and the reviewers are enthusiastic about its publication provided the following issues, as outlined below, are addressed.</p><p>The reviewers appreciate that the authors do not want to trim the data down as was recommended in the initial set of essential revisions. In this case, we are concerned about the specificity of the odour responses for many of the manipulations. However, to keep revisions to the minimum at this stage, our recommendations are the following:</p><p>1. Please move the recall experiments (Figure 3E, 3F, 4D, 4F , Figure 7—figure supplement 1) to supplementary data and discuss these in the &quot;ideas and speculation&quot; section. While doing so, do please explicitly state that it is possible that these manipulations might affect response to other odours, which has not been tested.</p><p>2. In the imaging data presented in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 we were concerned that the retinal minus control was actually activating DANs (perhaps through the contents of the cornmeal media). Could the authors please test that B'1 DANs are not actually active in their no retinal control by conducting the experiment in the absence of CsChrimson.</p><p>The detailed reviews are appended below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript &quot;A dopamine-gated learning circuit underpins reproductive state-dependent odor preference in <italic>Drosophila</italic> females », the authors addressed all comments and concerns raised by the reviewers. The manuscript still tells a complex story with some open ends that requires focus and concentration from the reader, but efforts have been made to make the data more accessible than in the first version.</p><p>It is helpful that the author inserted a short paragraph with an overview of the olfactory system to the introduction. Other adjustments to the text, e.g. in the discussion, also improved the manuscript.</p><p>Figure 1 is more streamlined now.</p><p>All requested experiments were carried out. Whenever the requested experiments did not give conclusive results due to supposed technical problems, this was explained in an appropriate way.</p><p>From my side, I accept and respect the author's argument that they would not like to completely omit all experiments addressing recall (as was suggested in order to simplify the manuscript).</p><p>The new results of LHAD1b2 changing its response to putrescine upon mating (Figure 7) is an interesting finding adding to the story.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As shown by the authors, a key feature of mating-induced change of odor preference is its specificity to polyamine. In this study, the authors presented many data that manipulation of some mushroom body cell types enhance or disrupt behavioral response to polyamine. However, such outcome of circuit manipulation does not necessarily mean that those cell types are responsible for induction or expression of polyamine-preference after mating. It could be because circuit manipulation recapitulated a situation after olfactory learning and affected response to arbitral odors including polyamine. Thus, in my opinion, the results of circuit manipulation are uninterpretable without control experiments to test polyamine-specificity (i.e. ammonia for virgin females and vinegar or other attractive odor for mated females).</p><p>For MBON-β′1, authors collected new data to show that its thermogenetic activation in virgin females induce long-lasting preference to polyamine but not to ammonia (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Taken together with blocking experiments (Figure 4A), I'm convinced that MBON-β′1 plays an essential role in duction of mating-induced polyamine preference. I think the data about MBON-β′1 alone is worth publishing. I very much appreciate author's efforts to collect a large amount of data. However, showing them without control experiments about odor-specificity will be confusing to readers and even harmful to future investigation.</p><p>I suggested this experiment to establish functional connection between PAM-β′1 and MBON-β′1 either through direct DAN-to-MBON connection as depicted as an arrow in author's model in Figure 8, or through indirect connections. The outcome of DAN activation can be modulatory, but the data in Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A showed no evidence of mating-induced or DAN-activation-induced plasticity in the β′1 compartment. Therefore, I postulated that PAM-β′1 may directly activate MBON-β′1, as shown in other compartments (Takemura et al., 2017 <italic>eLife</italic>), to induce plasticity somewhere else.</p><p>The new imaging data in Figure 6—figure supplement 1B is hard to interpret without validation of retinal minus control. Without supplement of all-trans-retinal, cornmeal may contain enough precursor for biosynthesis of all-trans-retinal. Thus, to interpret the data, authors need to demonstrate that DANs are not activated by red light in retinal minus control or repeat the experiment without CsChrimson expression. I suspect that clear MBON-β′1 response to red light is due to activation of PAM-β′1 rather than visual response, especially when duration of activation is prolonged. Unlike γ dorsal Kenyon cells, there is no EM connectome data to support visual inputs to the α prime/β prime Kenyon cells.</p><p>If PAM-β′1 activation does not activate MBON-β′1, authors need to clarify, at lease in a working model, which synapses are modulated by PAM-β′1.</p><p>This new MB057B&gt;dTrpA1 data about polyamine specificity of activation phenotype is a valuable addition. For MBON-β′1, there are a compelling set of data to conclude that MBON-β′1 is required during mating and its activity replace mating experience.</p><p>The data to demonstrate ployamine-specificity of the MB188B&gt;dTrpA1 is still missing. I find it essential, especially because blocking PAM-DANs with MB188B&gt;Shi during mating did not show any defect in mating-induced polyamine-preference. If 24-hour activation of DANs with MB188B&gt;dTrpA1 change preference of other odors, it should be considered as artifact of long thermogenetic activation rather than recapitulation of mating experience.</p><p>I agree that Figure 2 &quot;during mating&quot; data is not expected and can be a strong result if authors could show polyamine-specificity of Kenon cell perturbation and evidence of mating-induced plasticity inside the mushroom body that is read out during odor test. I suggested to omit the Figure 2 data because the former requires additional experiments, and the latter is not supported by the presented data (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><p>To keep the Figure 2 data as a main figure, the vinegar (or other innately attractive odor in both virgins and mated females) should be used as a control odor to distinguish whether the defect of polyamine-preference by circuit-perturbation is due to impairment of forming/expressing mating-induced change or general defect in odor attraction as reported in Wang et al., 2003. As authors noted, a couple of papers claimed that KC's output is dispensable during training for olfactory conditioning. However, the timescale of manipulation is totally different. In the cited olfactory learning papers about short-term memories, temperature was elevated ~30min prior to the training and shifted lower to the permissive temperature immediately after training. In contrast, flies were kept at restrictive temperature for 24 hours in Figure 2 experiments, which likely include a long period after mating.</p><p>I suggest validating that mated MB010B&gt;shi flies show intact vinegar attraction compared to control genotypes when temperature is elevated 24-hour period during/around mating or before/during test. Otherwise, I suggest omitting Figure 2 data.</p><p>As side notes about olfactory learning literatures, Krashes et al., 2008 Neuron showed that blocking α prime/β prime Kenyon cells impair memory, presumably because KCs are kept inactive for a while after temperature shift. Ichinose et al., 2015 <italic>eLife</italic> showed that output from the α/β KCs is necessary during training for long-term appetitive memory.</p><p>MB188&gt;CsChrimson may not have such problem. I think that author's decision to tone down the conclusion is reasonable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77643.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We appreciate the extensive body of work presented in this manuscript.

As the reviewers have noted, we have collected a large amount of data over the course of several years. Like the reviewers, we had hoped that some data would significantly simplify the main conclusions and help us ‘distill’ a straight-forward mechanism. We have not been successful to identify the simple switch responsible for the change in behavior that we observe. In our opinion, given the importance of mating-induced behavior, it is not surprising that several parallel mechanisms ensure the proper behavioral transition from a virgin to a mated female. Therefore, we are somewhat reluctant to remove too much data or to streamline the paper too much. We don’t believe it would do justice to the biology.

We have not observed a change in preference upon activation of the MBON. This is in line with our experiments shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A. We find no significant difference between mated and virgin females in their preference for ammonia. The new data are included in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1A.</p><p>– Regarding specificity, we have tested the preference of virgin and mated females for vinegar (1%) in the T-maze.

These data are included as Figure 1 —figure supplement 1B.</p><p>– We have tested the preference for polyamines upon activation of MB025B (instead of mating) to test the sufficiency of β′1.

The results with line MB025B are difficult to interpret. For unknown reasons, the preference to polyamines in MB025B&gt;TrpA1 females in single female T-maze experiments was already extremely high in virgins without the temperature shift instead of mating.

Hence, inhibition of PAM-β’1 in that background is unlikely to reduce the lack of preference even further.</p><p>We have opted for experiment (c) and used the broader PAM-line MB42B which covers PAM-α1, PAM-β'1 apm, PAM-β’2 amp, PAM-β1, and PAM-γ3-γ5 to inhibit PAM output during mating. Similar to the results observed with inhibition of PAM-β′1, γ3,γ4 during mating, we have not observed a phenotype during test. These data are now including as Figure 3D.</p><p>Based on these data, we suggest -as also put forward by the reviewers- that the SPR pathway compensates and is sufficient to induce the observed mating-dependent increase in polyamine preference. We have also included this interpretation in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The results are included as Figure 7. We find that the response of these LHONs is significantly different between polyamine and water only upon mating but not in virgin females. In virgins, LHAD1b2 neurons show the same the response to the water control as to the polyamine odor. Based on these results, we suggest that mating modulates the output of specific LHONs through changes in mushroom body output. These LHONs are important for the expression of the mating-induced increased preference to polyamines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to this, please read the detailed reviews below and, wherever possible, do please try to address them.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed all points below in detailed responses and, in some cases, by adding data.

This is a dense paper and the manner in which it is currently written it makes hard for the reader to follow the data. There are a few things that I thought might be causing this. Could the authors please consider these, and any others, to make the data more accessible to the reader?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for the suggestions below. We have made several edits to the text to streamline data presentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The introduction doesn't equip the reader for what's to come. It doesn't cover many topics that are essential to the story in the manuscript. For example, it would have been nice to include material on mushroom body circuitry, the DA neurons and lateral horn circuitry. It would also have been nice to cover aspects of how these circuits encode associative learning in other contexts.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph to the introduction to equip the reader for the results as suggested by the reviewer. We have also introduced an additional schematic figure as Figure 2A depicting the connections between neurons of the MB and LH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Use of different names for the same neurons: The authors switch between names – sometimes referring to them by their Gal4 lines at others by their functional names.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that the use of Gal4 and their names/innervation patterns makes it somewhat complicated to follow. Unfortunately, we don’t see an easy solution to this problem. First, several MB-lines cover many neurons and using the names of the neurons in the text would make the text even less readable. Second, using only the MB-line names would obscure which neurons are covered and therefore make it more complicated for people not familiar with the MBline collection by Aso et al. Nevertheless, we tried to reduce the incidents where we’ve used both as much as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There are non-linear elements of the story telling that make it hard to follow any one thread. For example, the imaging data come up in three places – imaging of DANs in response to cVA, imaging of the whole brains, and finally the imaging of the MBONs to cVA. Have the authors considered addressing the circuit elements first, and then following how the relevant odours are represented in the represented in circuit elements?</p></disp-quote><p>We followed this suggestion. We have removed the imaging data in Figure 1 as similar findings were published by us previously in Siju et al., Current Biology 2020. In addition, we have moved the LHON behavioral data (former Figure 6) before the MBON imaging figure (former Figure 5). In the revised manuscript, Figure 1-5 include only behavioral and anatomical data while Figure 6 and 7 contain in vivo imaging results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In general, it would help to have sentences with fewer clauses. At times these clauses are also unexpectedly ordered. A few of these can be a nice touch, but maybe there are a few too many here :</p></disp-quote><p>We have reduced the complexity of the sentences. Thank you for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Particularly in such dense data, it would really help to start each line of experiments with a motivation for why it was done.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Related to the circuitry: The authors have identified various neurons that are involved in different aspects of the mating memory and recall behaviour (in both the MB and the LH). It wasn't clear to me how they think these neurons might function together within a circuit to bring about this behaviour. What's the link between these neurons? What's the link between the LH and MB induced behaviour? Aside from one experiment that stimulated the B1 DAN and monitored the activity in the MBONs, I see few examples of such 'epistatic' interrogation of circuitry. This left me feeling that I knew the parts, but didn't know how they tied up together. It would have been nice to see a few predictions of the circuitry tested as such here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be helpful. To this end, we have now included the experiment suggested above to test whether PAM-β’1 neurons are capable of activating MBON-β’1 (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1). In this particular case, we did not mean to suggest that PAMs would activate MBONs. Instead, we assume a neuromodulatory relationship between DANs and MBONs. We had hoped that former Figure 7 (now Figure 8) would help to piece the circuit together. As mentioned above, we have now introduced another schematic to clarify the synaptic connections of the MB (Figure 2A). In virgins, our data suggest that the MB (i.e. β’2 region) prevents high attraction to polyamines. During mating, in part through cVA and MBON-β’1, this effect of the β’2 compartment is suppressed. These neurons, as indicated in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1, are indirectly connected. Thus, mating changes the balance in the MB circuit, which in turn leads to, possibly through MBON-α2sc (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1), a change in the LHON response to polyamine (Figure 7).</p><p>We absolutely agree that epistasis experiments would be very useful and we plan to do them in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Bidirectional behaviours: There are a couple of examples of bidirectional behaviours mediated by the same neurons in this manuscript. It was surprising to me, for example, that activating B1 DANs during mating interfered with the ability to mount a preference for polyamine, particularly because these neurons are active during mating (their imaging data). Is it possible that with thermogenetics, they are driving the neuron too hard? The P1 neuron mediates different behaviours when driven at different thresholds. Could such a phenomenon be occurring here? Have the authors tried to show this with another tool – csChimson, for example?</p></disp-quote><p>This is possible. We have repeated the same experiment with csChrimson to induce preference in virgins for the imaging experiments shown in Figure 5 —figure supplement 1. Strong activation over 24h with pulsed light led to the same phenotype as activation with TrpA1. We have not systematically tested different light intensities, but this would be a good idea. Unfortunately, as my lab has moved during the week of July 11. We, therefore, had to prioritize the experiments listed above to finish whatever was possible before the move.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– cVA: I wasn't convinced that cVA was the relevant cue for this behaviour. Neither courtship nor cVA alone could reproduce the behavioural switch. This makes me think that it's likely a combination of pheromones and the physical act of mating that is driving the behaviour. So, I wonder how relevant it is to look for representation of cVA with the identified circuit elements -for example in the B1 DANs. Assessing the representation of the polyamine in a mating dependent way might be more relevant (and the authors have done this for many of their experiments).</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that cVA is just one of the cues needed for the switch. Our data in Figure 1CE, however, show that inhibition of cVA detecting neurons during mating reduces later polyamine preference. In our opinion, this indicates an important function of cVA in the mating induced change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was there a reason why the authors decided to use an of 16 for the single fly experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, there are two main reasons: 1. 16 single experiments for multiple groups could be carried out in one to two consecutive days, which is what we aimed for given the sensitivity of state-dependent behavior to all kinds of confounds. 2. 16 flies were sufficient to observe strong phenotypes. Given the vast number of neurons in and around the mushroom body, we decided to focus on the neurons that resulted in a strong change rather than milder phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Suggestions:</p><p>1) line 151 following, Figure 1 C, D &gt; I don't understand why these response to cVA experiments are shown here and how they fit with the natural flow of the story- just take them out? It is an interesting finding on its own but confuses the main story a bit. After all, the paper deals with the response to polyamine and how that changes after mating.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed these data from Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 6 A: replace red green color scheme with one more suitable for red green blind.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the colors in this panel.

Trim them to minimal set of data to support the main conclusions. For instance, data in Figure 3C and 3D are irrelevant to the model in Figure 7. Also some of data seem to be replication of previous reports and dispensable. For instance, Figure 1C-D are replication of Siju et al., 2020. ovoD1 mutant data was in Hussain et al., 2016. Otherwise, please clarify what is novel about these data. Along the same line, there is only weak link between data of Kenyon cells and LHON (Figure 2 and 6) and PAM-b'1/MBON-b'1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and, as written above, we had hoped that we would eventually obtain a very clear cut and simple result to explain our observation. We have removed Figure 1 C and D. We have also removed the <italic>ovoD1</italic> mutant data, which had only been included following a previous reviewer comment. We believe that the results in Figure 2 are very important, because they show that KC output is required during mating. KCs are a major part of the olfactory pathway and provide input to DANs and MBONs. Regarding the role of the LHONs, we now show that these neurons change their response to putrescine after mating (Figure 7). In addition, we show that MBON-α2sc, which has been previously shown to connect the mushroom body to the lateral horn, is important for the expression of the behavior (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1).

In this study, the authors presented many data that manipulation of some mushroom body cell types enhance or disrupt behavioral response to polyamine. However, such outcome of circuit manipulation does not necessarily mean that those cell types are responsible for induction or expression of polyamine-preference after mating. It could be because circuit manipulation recapitulated a situation after olfactory learning and affected response to arbitral odors including polyamine. Thus, in my opinion, the results of circuit manipulation are uninterpretable without control experiments to test polyamine-specificity (i.e. ammonia for virgin females and vinegar or other attractive odor for mated females).</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree. First, we have never claimed that our findings apply exclusively to polyamines. We have added additional data regarding specificity because Reviewer 3 requested it. At this point, we can only say that mating does not change the response to any odor but appears to be restricted to some, possibly physiologically important, odors.</p><p>Polyamines are a model for the behavior we observe. Given that neither MBONs, DANs nor LH neurons are specific for any single odorant (e.g. Dolan et al., 2019; Hige et al., 2015), we think it is quite unlikely that this mechanism only applies to polyamines. In fact, our data showing that the presence of polyamines during mating is not required for the switch in behavior shows that this is NOT a form of associative learning. It is long-term plasticity that appears to involve components of the mushroom body as well as the lateral horn.</p><p>Nevertheless, even in associative memory paradigms, animals including flies can generalize to other odors that were not present during learning.</p><p>We have added and modified the text throughout to make this clearer. We do not claim that this mechanism only applies to polyamines. However, in disagreement with Reviewer 3, we do not see a problem with this interpretation. Mating induces a change that affects many aspects of behavior.</p><p>Polyamines, likely for physiological reasons, are indicators for beneficial environments upon mating. Ammonia is not. However, there might be other odors that signal a similar beneficial condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For MBON-β′1, authors collected new data to show that its thermogenetic activation in virgin females induce long-lasting preference to polyamine but not to ammonia (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Taken together with blocking experiments (Figure 4A), I'm convinced that MBON-β′1 plays an essential role in duction of mating-induced polyamine preference. I think the data about MBON-β′1 alone is worth publishing. I very much appreciate author's efforts to collect a large amount of data. However, showing them without control experiments about odor-specificity will be confusing to readers and even harmful to future investigation.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see above. Odor specificity to just one odor, i.e. polyamines, is unlikely given the makeup of the neurons and circuits involved. This mechanism might very well also extend to other, similarly indicative, odors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I suggested this experiment to establish functional connection between PAM-β′1 and MBON-β′1 either through direct DAN-to-MBON connection as depicted as an arrow in author's model in Figure 8, or through indirect connections. The outcome of DAN activation can be modulatory, but the data in Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A showed no evidence of mating-induced or DAN-activation-induced plasticity in the β′1 compartment. Therefore, I postulated that PAM-β′1 may directly activate MBON-β′1, as shown in other compartments (Takemura et al., 2017 eLife), to induce plasticity somewhere else.</p><p>The new imaging data in Figure 6—figure supplement 1B is hard to interpret without validation of retinal minus control. Without supplement of all-trans-retinal, cornmeal may contain enough precursor for biosynthesis of all-trans-retinal. Thus, to interpret the data, authors need to demonstrate that DANs are not activated by red light in retinal minus control or repeat the experiment without CsChrimson expression. I suspect that clear MBON-β′1 response to red light is due to activation of PAM-β′1 rather than visual response, especially when duration of activation is prolonged. Unlike γ dorsal Kenyon cells, there is no EM connectome data to support visual inputs to the α prime/β prime Kenyon cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is possible that the food source included sufficient retinal to induce Chrimson activation. Unfortunately, we simply did not have enough time to include additional controls before our laboratory move. At this moment, we do not have a functional 2-P microscope (we have ordered one but it will only arrive in 4-6 months unfortunately) to carry out additional experiments. We have therefore toned down our claims regarding this experiment in the text with the note that additional experiments would be needed to confirm the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If PAM-β′1 activation does not activate MBON-β′1, authors need to clarify, at lease in a working model, which synapses are modulated by PAM-β′1.</p></disp-quote><p>We still believe it is possible that PAM-β′1 modulates the response of MBON-β′1. In addition, it is also possible, as suggested by Reviewer 3, that the DAN directly activates the MBON. We have now included both scenarios in the text.</p><p>Why do we not see plasticity at the MBON? We speculate in the text that this is due to finding the correct time window. This modulation might be very transient and eventually manifest in long-term changes in other neurons such as the LHON AD1b2 as we have shown.</p><p>We now state explicitly that a direct activation of the MBON through the PAM is a possible scenario.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This new MB057B&gt;dTrpA1 data about polyamine specificity of activation phenotype is a valuable addition. For MBON-β′1, there are a compelling set of data to conclude that MBON-β′1 is required during mating and its activity replace mating experience.</p><p>The data to demonstrate ployamine-specificity of the MB188B&gt;dTrpA1 is still missing. I find it essential, especially because blocking PAM-DANs with MB188B&gt;Shi during mating did not show any defect in mating-induced polyamine-preference. If 24-hour activation of DANs with MB188B&gt;dTrpA1 change preference of other odors, it should be considered as artifact of long thermogenetic activation rather than recapitulation of mating experience.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we do not believe that the described mechanism only applies to polyamines. We have shown however that these DANs are activated by cVA (Siju et al., 2020), which shows that mating-related information is detected by these neurons. It is conceivable that this PAM is not specific to cVA or mating, but instead responds to additional cues or conditions. For instance, we show in Siju et al., 2020 that these neurons are also modulated by hunger. Thus, this type of PAM might be more generally involved in internal state-dependent behavior.</p><p>In 2015, we have shown that PAM- β′2 is involved in the resolution of sensory conflict dependent on hunger (Lewis et al., 2015). In parallel, other groups have shown that this neuron is also involved in associative learning, arousal from sleep etc (e.g. Owald et al., 2015; French et al., 2021). Similar scenarios are observed in the mammalian amygdala (e.g. Douglass et al., 2017). In line with this, we do not postulate that the β′1 region is only important for mating state-dependent behavior to a single type of odor.</p><p>We have tried to make this clearer in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I agree that Figure 2 &quot;during mating&quot; data is not expected and can be a strong result if authors could show polyamine-specificity of Kenon cell perturbation and evidence of mating-induced plasticity inside the mushroom body that is read out during odor test. I suggested to omit the Figure 2 data because the former requires additional experiments, and the latter is not supported by the presented data (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree. In our view, the interesting finding is that KC output is needed during mating to lastingly induce a change in odor preference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To keep the Figure 2 data as a main figure, the vinegar (or other innately attractive odor in both virgins and mated females) should be used as a control odor to distinguish whether the defect of polyamine-preference by circuit-perturbation is due to impairment of forming/expressing mating-induced change or general defect in odor attraction as reported in Wang et al., 2003. As authors noted, a couple of papers claimed that KC's output is dispensable during training for olfactory conditioning. However, the timescale of manipulation is totally different. In the cited olfactory learning papers about short-term memories, temperature was elevated ~30min prior to the training and shifted lower to the permissive temperature immediately after training. In contrast, flies were kept at restrictive temperature for 24 hours in Figure 2 experiments, which likely include a long period after mating.</p><p>I suggest validating that mated MB010B&gt;shi flies show intact vinegar attraction compared to control genotypes when temperature is elevated 24-hour period during/around mating or before/during test. Otherwise, I suggest omitting Figure 2 data.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we respectfully disagree. We maintain that the finding in Figure 2 is very important. Whether it is specific for polyamines or not is not relevant in our view. The important finding is that KC output is required during mating so that the change in mating-induced odor preference can happen. Importantly, 24h inhibition of KC output before or after mating did not have the same effect. This strongly suggests that something specific to mating and involving the KC/MB neurons is taking place. This, in our view, is the relevant finding. If we were to see the same with another odorant, this would not change anything regarding our conclusions as we do not see odor specificity as the important point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As side notes about olfactory learning literatures, Krashes et al., 2008 Neuron showed that blocking α prime/β prime Kenyon cells impair memory, presumably because KCs are kept inactive for a while after temperature shift. Ichinose et al., 2015 eLife showed that output from the α/β KCs is necessary during training for long-term appetitive memory.</p></disp-quote><p>We already know from previous work (for instance Lewis et al., 2015) that KCs are involved in innate odor responses. For the same reasons as mentioned above, we don’t see this as a problem. In our opinion, no circuit in any brain also subserves a single function (perhaps with the exception of MN connecting to a specific muscle).10.17632/5rz28jr8gc.2</p></body></sub-article></article>
