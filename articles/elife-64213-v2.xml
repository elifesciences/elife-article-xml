revealed fibrosis in embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) patients comparable to levels seen in atrial fibrillation (AFib). We used computational modeling to understand the absence of arrhythmia in ESUS despite the presence of putatively pro-arrhythmic fibrosis. MRI-based atrial models were reconstructed for 45 ESUS and 45 AFib patients. The fibrotic substrate’s arrhythmogenic capacity in each patient was assessed computationally. Reentrant drivers were induced in 24/45 (53%) ESUS and 22/45 (49%) AFib models. Inducible models had more fibrosis (16.7 ± 5.45%) than non-inducible models (11.07 ± 3.61%; p&lt;0.0001); however, inducible subsets of ESUS and AFib models had similar fibrosis levels (p=0.90), meaning that the <italic>intrinsic pro-arrhythmic substrate properties</italic> of fibrosis in ESUS and AFib are indistinguishable. This suggests that some ESUS patients have latent pre-clinical fibrotic substrate that could be a future source of arrhythmogenicity. Thus, our work prompts the hypothesis that ESUS patients with fibrotic atria are spared from AFib due to an absence of arrhythmia triggers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The heart usually beats with a regular rhythm to pump the blood that carries oxygen and nutrients to different organs. Sometimes, alterations in the heart’s rhythm known as arrhythmias can occur. Atrial fibrillation, also called AFib, is a type of arrhythmia in which the heart beats rapidly and irregularly, causing abnormal blood-flow that can lead to the formation of blood clots. If one of these blood clots travels to the brain, it can block a blood vessel, causing a stroke. However, many strokes occur without any evidence of AFib.</p><p>One subset of strokes that are not associated with AFib are embolic strokes of undetermined source (ESUS), which account for 25% of all strokes. By definition ESUS and AFib do not occur together, but both are associated with similar elevated levels of disease-related remodeling (i.e., fibrosis) in the heart tissue, which appears when the heart is injured. Fibrosis impairs the heart’s normal electrical activity.</p><p>Bifulco et al. wanted to determine whether there is some fundamental difference in fibrosis between people with AFib and those who have had an ESUS event. To do this, they used a computational approach to model the geometries and patterns of fibrosis of the hearts of 45 ESUS patients and 45 patients with AFib, essentially producing a virtual version of each patient’s heart. Bifulco et al. then applied a virtual pace-maker (working in overdrive mode) to each heart model to determine whether electrical inputs that can lead to AFib had different effects on ESUS and AFib patients.</p><p>The results showed that the electrical inputs had similar effects in all of the heart models. This led Bifulco et al. to conclude that ESUS and AFib patients have indistinguishable patterns of fibrosis. The key difference is that ESUS patients are missing the trigger to initiate the fibrillation process – if atrial fibrosis is the proverbial tinderbox, these triggers are the spark needed to ignite a fire.</p><p>Further research, including confirmation of Bifulco et al.’s findings in live patients, will be needed to confirm the hypothesis that ESUS patients lack AFib primarily due to an absence of triggers. If this is indeed the case, these findings may make it easier to identify ESUS patients at higher risk for AFib or further strokes. Additionally, a better understanding of fibrosis as a link between stroke and AFib will help clinicians provide better, more personalized treatments, for example guiding whether a patient should take blood thinners or undergo more rigorous cardiac monitoring.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>atrial fibrillation</kwd><kwd>embolic stroke of</kwd><kwd>undetermined source</kwd><kwd>fibrosis</kwd><kwd>LGE-MRI</kwd><kwd>computational modeling &amp; simulation</kwd><kwd>reentry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-EB001650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bifulco</surname><given-names>Savannah F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008227</institution-id><institution>Achievement Rewards for College Scientists Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bifulco</surname><given-names>Savannah F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/S015086/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roney</surname><given-names>Caroline H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL152256</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niederer</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PREDICT-HF (864055)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niederer</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG/20/4/34803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niederer</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/P01268X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niederer</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>203148/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niederer</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH 5-U01-NS095869</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tirschwell</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Longstreth</surname><given-names>WT</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Washington</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>John L.

The primary source of AFib-related mortality is stroke, with around 20% of all ischemic strokes occurring in AFib patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrade et al., 2014</xref>). Sub-clinical AFib (i.e., transient, asymptomatic AFib) is implicated as a potential cause of embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS), and the current course of clinical care following ESUS is to look for evidence of AFib via an external monitor, an implanted loop recorder, or other forms of wearable monitoring devices. If AFib is diagnosed, treatment with oral anticoagulants is started to mitigate the possibility of recurrent stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Israel et al., 2017</xref>). Clinical studies have shown that AFib has been detected in only 30% of patients with long-term rhythm monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brachmann et al., 2016</xref>). This creates a frustrating problem for clinicians: in the wake of ESUS events, it is impossible to know which individuals should be treated as high-risk for AFib and therefore monitored accordingly.</p><p>Recent evidence from clinical studies suggests that the left atrial fibrosis burden measured by late gadolinium enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) is as high in ESUS patients as in AFib patients without stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tandon et al., 2019</xref>). This finding supports the hypothesis that atrial fibrosis is an element of the causal pathway for stroke, through an atrial cardiopathy, and independent of AFib. The absence of AFib despite the presence of a fibrotic substrate is intriguing and one potential explanation is that ESUS patients have pro-arrhythmic fibrotic substrate but lack the triggers needed to initiate arrhythmia. Another potential explanation is that the fibrosis present in ESUS patients is not pro-arrhythmic. Patient-derived computational modeling of atrial arrhythmias is uniquely poised to test these hypotheses. Previously, personalized atrial models have been used to assess arrhythmogenic propensity of fibrotic substrate and predict AFib ablation targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zahid et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2019</xref>). Applying the same approach, we can use computational models to predict if, in the presence of appropriate triggers, fibrotic remodeling in ESUS has the fundamental capacity to harbor reentrant arrhythmic activity.</p><p>Thus, we present a large-scale computational study to ascertain whether the fibrotic substrate with the potential to perpetuate AFib-sustaining reentrant drivers (RDs) exists in ESUS. Our hypothesis is that a pre-clinical AFib substrate, attributed to a pattern of fibrotic atrial remodeling that is conducive to RD perpetuation, exists in ESUS patients. By conducting simulations in models derived from LGE-MRI, we can begin to understand potential pro-arrhythmic properties of atrial fibrosis in ESUS patients. The study thus provides insights on the role of atrial fibrosis as a pathophysiological nexus between AFib and stroke.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>Ninety patient-derived models were included in our analysis: 45 post-stroke ESUS and 45 pre-ablation AFib patients.

In models reconstructed from 45 post-stroke ESUS and 45 pre-ablation AFib patients, we showed that the AFib and ESUS groups did not differ significantly in (1) the propensity of the fibrotic substrate to sustain RDs in response to simulated burst pacing; (2) the LA fibrotic burden of RD-inducible models or RD-free models; and (3) the RD localization or the region-wise inducibility. One noteworthy difference was that the extent of tissue in the LPV region with a pro-RD fibrosis spatial pattern was greater in AFib vs. ESUS models. This is the first study to use computational modeling and simulation to assess potential pro-arrhythmic capacity of LA fibrosis in ESUS patients. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cohort ever studied via computational analysis of atrial electrophysiology in models derived from LGE-MRI, exceeding the number of patient-specific models (N = 50) in the former largest study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roney et al., 2020</xref>) by a factor of ≈1.8.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Inducibility of reentry and fibrosis quantification in patient-derived atrial models</title><p>Experimental findings have shown that atrial fibrosis results in changes that promote reentry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Litchenberg et al., 2000</xref>), but the exact mechanism of this connection is not fully understood. Previous modeling studies have linked RD localization to specific spatial patterns of fibrotic remodeling in AFib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zahid et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hakim et al., 2018</xref>). Recent clinical findings indicate that atrial fibrosis burden does not differ significantly between AFib and ESUS patients, and yet (by definition) ESUS patients do not demonstrate AFib at the time of stroke or during ambulatory monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tandon et al., 2019</xref>). Given the findings summarized above, a potential explanation is that, notwithstanding the fact that ESUS patients have substantial fibrosis, the particular <italic>spatial distribution</italic> of fibrotic remodeling in their atria is not conducive to arrhythmia perpetuation. Our findings suggest that this is likely not the case. From the standpoint of computational models derived from patient LGE-MRI scans, fibrotic substrate in individuals with ESUS is indistinguishable from that in patients with AFib in terms of the fundamental capacity to sustain RDs. For inducible models from both cohorts, we found that high fibrosis models were more likely to exhibit RDs irrespective of whether they corresponded to ESUS or AFib patients. This is in agreement with prior computational studies, which found the same general association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zahid et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2019</xref>), and is consistent with clinical understanding, wherein higher fibrosis burden is associated with poor outcomes in AFib ablation procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marrouche et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, we did observe several cases in which models defied inducibility expectations based on fibrosis alone. Such models exhibited RDs despite low fibrosis or were non-inducible despite high fibrosis. This observation confirms that, as observed previously in analogous AFib modeling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zahid et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2019</xref>), assessment of raw fibrosis burden LGE-MRI scans alone is insufficient to fully characterize arrhythmogenic capacity of potentially pro-arrhythmic substrate in ESUS. In the present study, this is confirmed by our region-wise analysis of fibrosis spatial pattern (i.e., density, entropy), which is discussed below.</p><p>Consistent with the goal of this research to understand the contribution of fibrotic substrate to potential RD formation in ESUS, we purposefully excluded arrhythmias perpetuated by other mechanisms from our study design (e.g., self-sustaining activity driven solely by focal sources). This allows us to study the fibrotic substrate in the absence of all other confounding factors. Additionally, our analysis of abnormal steady-state depolarization in LA models suggests the potential for fibrosis itself to serve as a source of arrhythmia triggers is no greater in AFib than in ESUS models. Potential contributions from the right atrium (RA) were also excluded, since only the LA was segmented from LGE-MRI as part of the clinical workflow. Either of these factors may explain the absence of simulated arrhythmia in 23 of 45 AFib models, many of which had very little LA fibrosis (i.e., AFib in these individuals might have been predominantly focal in nature or sustained by RDs in the RA). This rate of inducibility is consistent with previous studies (e.g., 13 of 20 in computational models reconstructed from LGE-MRI scans of persistent AFib patients) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zahid et al., 2016a</xref>), supporting the notion that LA fibrosis is associated with increased arrhythmia inducibility but fails to tell the whole story. Importantly, neither of these model constraints repudiates the central finding of our study, which suggests that there is no difference between ESUS and AFib patients in terms of the fundamental capacity of the fibrotic substrate to potentially harbor RDs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>RD localization dynamics and morphology in patient-derived atrial models</title><p>As discussed above, our qualitative findings suggest that ESUS patients’ fibrotic substrate is no different than that of AFib patients in terms of the capacity to sustain RDs per se. We performed additional analysis to assess whether specific consequences of fibrotic remodeling influenced any characteristics of RD inducibility in different ways for simulations in models corresponding to ESUS vs. AFib patients. First, we found that there was no significant difference in global fibrosis burden between inducible AFib and ESUS models. Thus, our computational modeling suggests that intrinsic pro-arrhythmic traits of ESUS and AFib fibrotic substrate are indistinguishable. Given this result, one potential alternative explanation for the lack of arrhythmia in ESUS patients is a lack of suitable triggers, despite an abundance of fibrotic substrate on par with that observed in AFib. The plausibility of this explanation is strengthened by the fact that the pacing sites from which episodes of reentry were induced in our study were based on common AFib trigger sites as identified in a recent clinical study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Santangeli and Marchlinski, 2017</xref>); this is in contrast to previous modeling studies, which simulated triggered activity from evenly-distributed atrial sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, the premise of this aspect of our work was not to assess an absence of triggers, but instead ask the following: if the atria of these ESUS patients were subjected to the same type of triggered activity known to occur in typical AFib patients, is it possible the result be would sustained arrhythmia? In more than half of the cohort (24/45), our analysis suggests that the answer is yes. This new hypothesis could be validated in future studies by designing clinical protocols that systematically monitor ESUS patients with different levels of fibrosis for potential AFib triggers via electrocardiographic readouts.</p><p>Further analysis was performed to probe potential differences between ESUS and AFib simulations that went beyond consideration of RD inducibility as a binary variable. Specifically, we found no difference in the number of unique model-predicted RDs or the number of pacing sites that induced RDs between ESUS and AFib. Instead, these variables were highly correlated with LA fibrosis burden, which is consistent with the concept that high fibrosis models are more susceptible to pacing-induced RDs. This finding further substantiates our principal claim that no significant differences exist between the detected fibrotic substrate in ESUS and AFib, in that it holds true for the substrate’s capacity to sustain reentry and its susceptibility to triggered activity. The general implication is that in the presence of simulated triggered activity, both of these characteristics are closely linked to global fibrosis burden.</p><p>RDs identified by non-invasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) and in silico phase singularity identification have been shown to co-localize with fibrosis boundary zones identified by LGE-MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zahid et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Roney et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cochet et al., 2018</xref>). RD localization dynamics in this study were consistent with these findings, as illustrated by representative LA fibrotic tissue distributions and corresponding RDs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. RD morphology in this study corroborated previous findings – arrhythmias were perpetuated by one RD at a time, with activity in the periphery including conduction block, transient reentry, and wavefront collision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zahid et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Insights from analysis of RD inducibility and localization by LA region</title><p>Further to the macroscopic analysis discussed above, our region-by-region analysis of RD inducibility and localization showed that spatial properties of the fibrotic substrate between AFib and ESUS models are not intrinsically different. However, this analysis yielded several noteworthy findings that suggest subtle distinctions in fibrosis pattern may exist between the two groups. The most striking difference exists for the posterior wall region, where the IdS score was ≈2× higher in AFib compared to ESUS models. Thus, even in cases where posterior LA wall ectopic excitations occur in ESUS patients, our simulations suggest that they could be up to 50% less likely to engage the fibrotic substrate and initiate sustained reentry compared to the same activity in AFib patients. This possibility does not contradict our hypothesis that the lack of arrhythmia in ESUS is due to a dearth of triggers; rather, it is a complementary corollary that can be put to the test in future clinical and computational analysis.</p><p>While understanding of RD localization dynamics in AFib remains limited, evidence from ECGI mapping indicates that reentrant activity occurs most frequently in the PV and posterior wall regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haissaguerre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>). Our findings are consistent with these data for AFib but not ESUS models. Many (41.1%) AFib model RDs localized to the LPV region. In contrast, in the ESUS population the RD localization hotspot was the region comprising the anterior wall and LAA (37%). The importance of this finding is unclear, as tendencies toward reentrant activity in particular LA areas have not been meaningfully correlated to clinical arrhythmia properties and are potentially subject to changes in conduction velocity or action potential duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2017</xref>). However, it provides a path for future validation studies: if incident AFib in patients who previously presented with ESUS can be characterized by intracardiac mapping, the hypothesis that RDs localize preferentially to the anterior wall can be tested.</p><p>Finally, our analysis of fibrosis spatial patterns revealed that the proportion of tissue with the propensity to harbor RDs (as established via machine learning in prior work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zahid et al., 2016a</xref>) was higher in the LPV region for AFib compared to ESUS models. While we acknowledge that a more fulsome analysis will be required to draw comprehensive conclusions on this subject, we note that our results are consistent with the most prominent observed regional variabilities in RD localization and inducibility between the two model groups. In contrast, ESUS patients trended toward a higher percentage of pro-RD tissue in all anatomical areas except the LPVs. Thus, despite some interesting and potentially consequential differences in regional distribution of potentially pro-arrhythmic fibrosis, our overarching conclusion remains unchanged: our models suggest that if the ESUS substrate were subjected to suitable triggered activity, it could sustain the same types of RDs as those that contribute to AFib perpetuation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations</title><p>In this study, atrial tissue is modeled as a bilayer to drastically reduce computational load.

Moreover, clinical-grade MRI resolution limits our ability to detect fine details in anatomical structure and spatial distribution of potentially arrhythmogenic substrate, for instance slow-conducting tracks of fibrotic atrial tissue that could underlie microreentrant circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>). While these models are patient-specific in terms of LA anatomy and each individual’s unique pattern of fibrotic remodeling, they do not incorporate inter-patient variability in conduction velocity (CV) and electrophysiological properties such as ion channel expression. Nevertheless, our previous analysis indicates that this representation of atrial architecture with generic ‘average AFib’ electrophysiology is appropriate for use in patient-derived modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hakim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>As in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shade et al., 2020</xref>), our models do not differentiate between cell- or tissue-scale properties of atrial electrophysiology between patients with paroxysmal and persistent forms of AFib. Likewise, our approach to characterizing potential arrhythmia propensity in ESUS patients assumes cell- and tissue-scale remodeling based on experimental and clinical data from the AFib milieu. Although this is relevant as a limitation and must be considered when interpreting our results, this aspect of our approach is also one of the major advantages of the modeling and simulation methodology. Specifically, it allows us to assess whether there are any relevant differences in the spatial pattern of fibrotic remodeling between ESUS and AFib patients in the absence of other potentially confounding variables. A related limitation is that patients with stroke were excluded from the AFib cohort. This was because stroke etiology in the database from which AFib patients were drawn was not explicitly adjudicated to be cardioembolic, other ischemic such as atherosclerotic, or hemorrhagic. Therefore, we would not be able to draw reliable conclusions regarding the role of fibrosis in stroke in this population.</p><p>Finally, the mechanism of stroke in ESUS patients may be independent of AFib. Decreased atrial function due to atrial fibrosis may contribute to reduced hemodynamic efficacy and thrombus formation in the absence of AFib. Currently, secondary stroke prophylaxis is dependent on detecting AFib and predicting, through computational modeling, which atria are more prone to manifest AFib may be of clinical value. Another future research direction that could prove highly fruitful would be to create multi-scale, multi-physics image-based models of the fibrotic atria to assess each individual’s risk of clot formation in a patient-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyle et al., 2021a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Simulations suggest that the pro-arrhythmic properties of fibrotic substrate in ESUS and AFib patients are indistinguishable. Our results show that fibrotic remodeling in ESUS patients has the theoretical capacity to sustain reentry when subjected to common AFib triggers. Thus, we conclude that fibrotic substrate conducive to perpetuating reentry may exist in up to half of ESUS patients. As individuals studied in this cohort present with incident AFib over the next few years, we will be able to put this hypothesis to the test. Our findings also support the notion that the lack of AFib in this population may be attributable to a lack of suitable arrhythmic triggers, but further research is needed to fully justify this claim. While the existence of pre-clinical substrate is correlated with a higher global proportion of fibrotic tissue, many ESUS cases defied these expectations, suggesting that fibrosis burden alone is insufficient for predicting pre-clinical AFib substrate. This conclusion justifies the use of computational simulations to probe beyond the fibrosis as imaged. Overall, these results provide novel insights into the role of atrial fibrotic remodeling as a critical nexus between the otherwise distinct manifestations of AFib and ESUS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient population</title><p>Patients were recruited to undergo cardiac LGE-MRI from the University of Washington (Seattle, WA) and Klinikum Coburg (Coburg, Germany) between July 2016 and June 2019.

Clinical-grade meshes (i.e., coarse discretization) produced by Merisight Inc (Salt Lake City, UT) were resampled with a target resolution of 200 µm using an automated process based on gmsh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geuzaine and Remacle, 2009</xref>). Each LA model was represented as a bilayer comprising of nested endocardial and epicardial shells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Labarthe et al., 2014</xref>), linked at every point by linear connections (σ = 0.8 S m<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). LA bilayer models were generated by slightly inflating the single-surface mesh to form the epicardial surface (i.e., duplicating endocardial points then moving them outward by 100 µm along the surface normal vector), then connecting the nested shells by attaching linear elements between corresponding nodes. In each patient-derived model, realistic myocardial fiber orientations were mapped from an atlas geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Labarthe et al., 2014</xref>) using the universal atrial coordinates (UAC) approach. Briefly, this process assigned epicardial and endocardial fibers from a previously published bilayer model to the target atrial geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roney et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Roney et al., 2021</xref>). In all finite-element LA meshes, the average element edge length was ≈188 µm and the number of nodes ranged from ≈600,000 to ≈1.4 million, depending on LA size. This mesh resolution is consistent with previously established benchmarks for minimizing numerical error due to spatial discretization in simulations of cardiac wavefront propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Niederer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyle et al., 2021b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Modeling of atrial electrophysiology in fibrotic and non-fibrotic regions</title><p>Our methodology for computational modeling at the cell and tissue scale of the fibrotic and non-fibrotic atrial electrophysiology can be found in previously published papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zahid et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyle et al., 2018b</xref>). Briefly, in non-fibrotic regions, a human atrial action potential model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Courtemanche et al., 1998</xref>) was used to represent membrane kinetics, including parameter modifications to fit clinical monophasic action potential recordings from AFib patients (I<sub>Kur</sub>, I<sub>to</sub>, and I<sub>CaL</sub> decreased by 50%, 50%, and 70%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zahid et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krummen et al., 2012</xref>). At the tissue scale, conductivity tensor values in non-fibrotic tissue (longitudinal: σ<sub>L</sub> = 0.409 S m<sup>−1</sup>; transverse: σ<sub>T</sub> = 0.0820 S m<sup>−1</sup>) were calibrated to obtain effective CV values of 71.49 cm s<sup>−1</sup> and 37.14 cm s<sup>−1</sup> (longitudinal and transverse). These conductivities were chosen as a compromise between CV values measured in patients induced AFib (61 ± 6 cm s<sup>–1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Konings et al., 1994</xref>), clinically mapped patients with AFib or atrial flutter (median: 60 cm s<sup>–1</sup>; inter-quartile range: 22 cm s<sup>–1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Verma et al., 2018</xref>), and simulations calibrated to match intracardiac mapping data from an individual with paroxysmal AFib (median: 143 cm s<sup>–1</sup> longitudinal, 94 cm s<sup>–1</sup> transverse) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Roney et al., 2019b</xref>). In fibrotic regions, modifications to the AFib-like action potential model (I<sub>CaL</sub>, I<sub>Na</sub>, and I<sub>K1</sub> decreased by 50%, 40%, and 50%, respectively) were implemented as in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zahid et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zahid et al., 2016b</xref>), resulting in a 15.4% increase in action potential duration and a 49.6% decrease in upstroke velocity. These changes represented the effect of elevated transforming growth factor-β1, a key component of the fibrogenic signaling pathway.

Arrhythmia induction via rapid pacing was attempted from 15 pacing sites derived from AFib trigger sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, see caption for detailed anatomical site descriptions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Santangeli and Marchlinski, 2017</xref>). Clinically relevant AFib trigger sites were chosen over a random pacing schematic to specifically capture RDs that arise from locations demonstrated to induce AFib. As in previous publications, a clinically relevant pacing sequence of 12 electrical stimuli was delivered at each of the 15 locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zahid et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zahid et al., 2016b</xref>). Individual cell-scale ionic models were paced to limit cycle at a rate basic cycle length of 500 ms. The electrical stimulus consisted of two initial pulses with a coupling interval of 300 ms, followed by pulses ramping down to 200 ms in 20 ms intervals. After the delivery of the final stimulus, simulations were monitored for self-sustaining electrical wavefront propagation. For all cases in which activity persisted for at least 5000 ms post-pacing, we applied further analysis to determine whether the cause was an induced RD or macroscopic reentry (i.e., continuous repetitive, self-sustaining activation propagating around a non-conductive obstacle such as the mitral valve or pulmonary vein(s)), which we consider flutter-like reentry. Instances of macroscopic reentry were excluded from further analysis.</p><p>For each AFib-inducible simulation, we documented whether each pacing site induced reentry and analyzed patterns of RD localization. Unique RD morphologies in each patient-derived model were classified as belonging to one of five anatomical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which were delineated automatically in a process summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. First, the LA was subdivided into three broad anatomical areas (region 1: LA floor, 2: posterior wall; 3: anterior wall including LAA) using standardized cutoff values in the UAC space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roney et al., 2019a</xref>). Second, the left and right PV areas (regions 4 and 5, respectively) were established using a region-growing approach such that each accounted for 15% of the total LA surface area. We then defined region-wise inducibility scores (IdS) across all models in a particular group (ESUS or AFib) as the proportion of pacing sites within a given region from which rapid pacing resulted in initiation of an RD. For example, since the LPV region contains four pacing sites (anterior/posterior LSPV/LIPV), the corresponding ESUS IdS value would be derived by summing the number of instances in which pacing from those locations induced RD across inducible ESUS models then dividing by four. This ensured our ability to assess spatial heterogeneity of sensitivity to triggered activity in a manner that was unbiased to the relative abundance of pacing sites in some LA regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantitative analysis of fibrosis spatial pattern and potentially pro-ectopic effects of fibrosis</title><p>Fibrotic tissue areas with both high local fibrosis density (FD) and high local fibrosis entropy (FE) have increased propensity for RD localization, as shown in computational models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Roney et al., 2016</xref>) and intracardiac mapping of patients with persistent AFib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cochet et al., 2018</xref>). We used a constraint equation derived by support vector machine-based classification to delineate such pro-RD regions. As in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zahid et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2019</xref>), the classification polynomial was as follows: 0.4096 FD<sup>2</sup> +3.28(FD)(FE) − 0.1036 FE<sup>2</sup> – 0.7112(FD) – FE + 0.0429. Maps of pro-RD tissue were subdivided into the five LA regions, as described above, and region-specific burdens of pro-RD fibrosis pattern were calculated.</p><p>In some situations, fibrosis itself can develop the capacity to generate ectopic triggers of arrhythmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gouvêa de Barros et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso et al., 2016</xref>). Although the cell-scale models used in this study do not undergo early or delayed afterdepolarizations due to simplified intracellular calcium handling, fibrotic regions in our models do have a potentially pro-ectopic higher resting membrane voltage (V<sub>m</sub>) compared to non-fibrotic regions due to reduced ion channel expression levels (I<sub>CaL</sub>, I<sub>Na</sub>, and I<sub>K1</sub>). Thus, as a surrogate measure of potential intrinsic pro-trigger capacity in fibrotic tissue, we characterized the extent of tissue in ESUS and AFib models in which the fibrosis pattern resulted in abnormal depolarization. To do this, we allowed all 90 models to reach a quasi-equilibrium state (1000 ms in the absence of pacing). We aggregated resting V<sub>m</sub> values across all models and identified the 95th percentile as the threshold for delineation of fibrosis-induced abnormal depolarization (–75.3 mV). Then, we calculated the proportion of tissue in each model with an equilibrium V<sub>m</sub> above that threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>LA models for ESUS and AFib patients were divided into quartiles based on the extent of fibrotic remodeling as measured by LGE-MRI.

Using MRI-based computational modeling the authors show that in patients with inducible atrial fibrillation fibrosis was slightly higher but that fibrosis was similar whether or not there was a history of stroke. These findings suggest common trigger mechanisms underlying inducible atrial fibrillation, irrespective of stroke history. These novel findings are of great interest for clinicians and research scientists working on the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Computational modeling identifies embolic stroke of undetermined source patients with potential arrhythmic substrate&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Axel Loewe (Reviewer #2); Colleen Clancy (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors could go farther in describing why this is surprising. Generally, severe fibrosis is thought to potentially serve as a means or mechanism for pro-arrhythmic triggers. This is because damage to cardiac tissue typically results in calcium dysregulation. When calcium overload occurs in isolated fibrotic tissue areas, or depolarization of the resting membrane potential due to localized ischemia allows for ectopic pacemaking, we might expect that the diseased/fibrotic tissue is itself the source of arrhythmia generation. The novel finding here is that this notion may be a simplification, and the sources of arrhythmia generation may be more complex and may need to come from outside the areas of fibrosis.</p><p>2. Can the authors provide more explanation for the fiber orientation maps shown in figure 1B? Shouldn't the topology and surface area of the endocardial fiber area be substantially different than the epicardial surface? It looks as though the endocardial fiber orientation was mapped onto the epicardial surface. Some clarity around this would be helpful.</p><p>3. In the aggregated data and figure 3, where the authors demonstrate that fibrosis burdens for inducible and non-inducible models or significantly different, can they say why? Does this relate directly to the extent of fibrosis? Is this essentially the same data that's presented in figure 2, that describes the relationship between the fibrotic burden and inducibility?</p><p>4. The authors state that their simulations suggest that triggered activity in the posterior wall maybe more likely to initiate reentrant arrhythmia in AFib patients compared to ESUS patients. Is this correlated in any way to the pattern of fibrosis observed in the two different groups? It would be nice to get more mechanistic insight here. In the discussion the authors describe the spatial distribution of fibrotic remodeling as a potential factor leading to the differences between the two groups. Isn't it possible to examine and quantify the special distribution? This feels like a prime application for machine learning.</p><p>5. L280: &quot;This observation suggests that even in the cases when common potential LA triggers, such as (i.e., PV or posterior wall ectopy) do occur in ESUS patients, they are less likely to engage the fibrotic substrate and initiate sustained reentry compared to the same activity in AFib patients.&quot; This statement should be revised to make clearer that it pertains only to the PV regions and the posterior LA wall.</p><p>6. L399: Can the authors elaborate on the bilayer model? The standard monodomain would either be solved on a 2D-surface mesh or a volumetric model, the generalization to a bilayer model has been reported before but should be described in more detail / referred to, to enable reproduction.</p><p>7. Because the authors mentioned that there is a marked difference in LA surface area and BMI between the groups, it would also be better if the authors could actually analyze this aspect further, such as actually normalizing the LA surface area to body surface area, to confirm whether this factor could affect their findings.</p><p>8. While the discussion does a good job in general, it could be made more concise by focusing on the discussion of results and shortening their summary.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64213.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Sources of arrhythmia generation may come from areas outside of fibrotic tissue. Our simulations seek to represent the capacity of each individual’s unique fibrotic substrate to sustain reentrant drivers of arrhythmia; the explicit exclusion of other potentially arrhythmogenic factors is a <italic>key feature</italic> of our design, in that it allows us to study the fibrotic substrate in the absence of all other confounding factors. We have reinforced this point via a brief addition to the Discussion section.</p><p>In response to the review team’s specific suggestion, we ran additional simulations to rule out the possibility that fibrotic tissue might serve as a source of arrythmia generation (in AFib but not ESUS models) via ectopic pacemaking due to depolarized resting membrane potential. Fibrotic regions in our simulations have an intrinsically higher resting potential compared to non-fibrotic regions due to changes in ion channel expression (reduced I<sub>CaL</sub>, I<sub>Na</sub>, I<sub>K1</sub>). Our new results show that there is no significant difference in the extent of significantly depolarized tissue between models representing the atria of ESUS and AFib patients (P=0.32). We have added this analysis to Figure 3F. This supports the review team’s sentiment that “trigger-centric” conventional wisdom regarding links between fibrosis and arrhythmogenesis is an over-simplification; this point has also been emphasized in our Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Can the authors provide more explanation for the fiber orientation maps shown in figure 1B? Shouldn't the topology and surface area of the endocardial fiber area be substantially different than the epicardial surface? It looks as though the endocardial fiber orientation was mapped onto the epicardial surface. Some clarity around this would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We are extremely grateful to Dr. Loewe for this observation. A close inspection of these images led us to an error in the directionality of the fibers in a small subset of our patient specific models. As a result, we fixed the defect in our model reconstruction process and repeated all simulations and analysis for the affected cases. We revised images in Figure 1B to highlight the major differences between endocardial and epicardial fiber patterns, which are more prominent on the anterior wall compared to the posterior wall. These revisions did not change the major findings of our study (i.e., no changes in results of statistical analysis at the cohort scale); in fact, there is now even stronger evidence (i.e., more convincing P values) suggesting that pro-arrhythmic properties of fibrosis in ESUS and AFib are indistinguishable in these models. Nevertheless, as noted in our preamble to this response, there were subtle changes in summary data for ESUS and AFib cases throughout the study (Figures 2-4, original Figure 6, now renumbered as Figure 5) and one observation from our original study (dual reentrant driver feedback; original Figure 5 and Supplemental Video 1) were removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the aggregated data and figure 3, where the authors demonstrate that fibrosis burdens for inducible and non-inducible models or significantly different, can they say why? Does this relate directly to the extent of fibrosis? Is this essentially the same data that's presented in figure 2, that describes the relationship between the fibrotic burden and inducibility?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, both figures emphasize the observation that reentrant driver inducibility in these models is strongly associated with fibrosis burden. This is consistent with prior computational studies, which found the same general association (e.g., <italic>Zahid et al. (2016) Cardiovasc Res). From the clinical standpoint, higher fibrosis burden is associated with poor outcomes in AFib ablation procedures (e.g., Marrouche et al. (2014) JAMA)</italic>. However, it is known that fibrosis burden alone is not enough to completely predict reentrant driver inducibility. Prior simulation work has shown that area with a spatial fibrosis pattern that has high local density <italic>and</italic> entropy are most likely to harbor reentrant activity. We have added clarifying text to the manuscript to make this point more explicitly.</p><p>On the question of redundancy between figures: While there is significant overlap between the findings presented in these two figures, we believe there is value in showing both, as they present the same results in a different light. Figure 3A stresses the contrasts between groups; Figure 2B emphasizes association between inducibility and fibrosis, while also highlighting the small number of cases that defy this relationship (i.e., models that have regions with high fibrosis density and entropy despite low global fibrosis burden). Of note, the format for the latter graph parallels that of Figure 3 from <italic>Tandon et al. (2019) Neurology.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

In the discussion the authors describe the spatial distribution of fibrotic remodeling as a potential factor leading to the differences between the two groups.

This feels like a prime application for machine learning.</p><p>Please note, there are subtle differences between precise results discussed here and those originally presented due to the corrected method for atrial fiber mapping, as discussed above.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion for deeper analysis. The data presented in our figure on reentrant driver inducibility and localization (originally Figure 6; now Figure 5), we found that there was no difference in region-wise spatial distribution of pacing sites that initiated arrhythmia (P=0.45); similarly, in the case of reentrant driver localization site distribution, there was no discernible regional trend (P=0.13). However, we did observe interesting regional trends (e.g., higher prevalence of localization sites in the LPV region for AFib models and the anterior wall region for ESUS models). Based on the review team’s suggestions, we performed new analysis (new Figure 6 and accompanying text in Results and Methods) to delve deeper into whether this might be due to region-wise trends in fibrosis spatial pattern. Indeed, we now present findings that confirm there is a higher extent of tissue with a pro-arrhythmic fibrosis pattern in one of areas discussed above (LPV in AFib). While we did not find a significant difference in the anterior wall of ESUS models, there was a trend towards higher pro-arrhythmic fibrosis patterns in that area. Implications of all the latter analysis points are noted in our revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The text in question has been amended to be consistent with the conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis in the figures on reentrant driver inducibility/localization (old Figure 6, new Figure 5) as well as the new analysis on fibrosis density and entropy (new Figure 6). Please note that the specific regions in question have changed due to the aforementioned corrections to the model reconstruction pipeline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. L399: Can the authors elaborate on the bilayer model? The standard monodomain would either be solved on a 2D-surface mesh or a volumetric model, the generalization to a bilayer model has been reported before but should be described in more detail / referred to, to enable reproduction.</p></disp-quote><p>Our implementation of the bilayer model (Methods Section: Reconstruction of 3D patient derived atrial models from LGE-MRI) is generated by slightly inflating a surface 2D mesh (i.e., duplicating endocardial points then moving them outward by 100 µm along the surface normal vector at that location), then connecting the two surfaces by attaching linear elements between the corresponding nodes. With this formulation of the bilayer model, there are no alterations needed in the implementation of the openCARP solver. We have included a brief description and an additional reference to prior work with more detailed information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Because the authors mentioned that there is a marked difference in LA surface area and BMI between the groups, it would also be better if the authors could actually analyze this aspect further, such as actually normalizing the LA surface area to body surface area, to confirm whether this factor could affect their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the review team for this astute comment. In fact, while the LA surface area and BMI values are provided in the interest of complete transparency, the preferred clinical metric for unbiases comparison of LA size between individuals is the left atrial volume index (i.e., ratio between LA volume and estimated body surface area). These data are already presented in Table 1 of our manuscript and show no statistically significant difference between ESUS and AFib cohorts. A deeper analysis of LA surface area and BMI values would be less clinically interpretable and is unlikely to provide meaningful insights. We have added clarifying text to this effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. While the discussion does a good job in general, it could be made more concise by focusing on the discussion of results and shortening their summary.</p></disp-quote><p>The review team’s critique is duly noted and appreciated. Where possible, we have removed repetitive or extraneous text from the Discussion section. We do note that this part of our manuscript remains quite long due to the addition of several salient points raise by the review team, which we feel greatly improve the overall quality of the study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
