task demands. However, relatively little is known about how such mechanisms operate in continuous monitoring contexts requiring intermittent target detection. Here, we examined neural decision processes underlying detection of 1 s coherence targets within continuous random dot motion, and how they are adjusted across contexts with weak, strong, or randomly mixed weak/strong targets. Our prediction was that decision bounds would be set lower when weak targets are more prevalent. Behavioural hit and false alarm rate patterns were consistent with this, and were well captured by a bound-adjustable leaky accumulator model. However, beta-band EEG signatures of motor preparation contradicted this, instead indicating lower bounds in the strong-target context. We thus tested two alternative models in which decision-bound dynamics were constrained directly by beta measurements, respectively, featuring leaky accumulation with adjustable leak, and non-leaky accumulation of evidence referenced to an adjustable sensory-level criterion. We found that the latter model best explained both behaviour and neural dynamics, highlighting novel means of decision policy regulation and the value of neurally informed modelling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>detection</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>neurally informed modelling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15/CDA/3591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geuzebroek</surname><given-names>Anna C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>219572/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geuzebroek</surname><given-names>Anna C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 European Research Council Consolidator Grant Ind</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>865474</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Connell</surname><given-names>Redmond G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>For the purpose of Open Access, the authors have applied a CC BY public copyright license to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising from this submission.

It is now widely understood that making accurate decisions on noisy sensory information involves the accumulation of evidence up to a criterion amount or ‘bound’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ratcliff and Smith, 2004</xref>). This bound is seen as the primary means to strategically adapt perceptual decision policies to meet various task demands. Significant behavioural and neural evidence has now amassed to establish that bound adjustments are indeed carried out for certain, well-studied scenarios, such as when trading speed for accuracy in discrete, two-alternative forced choice decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogacz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palmer et al., 2005</xref>), but it is not clear whether this mechanism generalises to all situations that require policy adaptations. In particular, in the pervasive daily life scenario in which unpredictably timed targets must be detected within continuous streams of noisy sensory information, one’s decision policy must be tailored to rapidly detect as many targets as possible while keeping false alarms to a minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lasley and Cohn, 1981</xref>). Here, an overly liberal policy could result in an excessive amount of false alarms driven solely by noise in between targets, while an overly conservative policy will miss too many targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gold and Stocker, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ossmy et al., 2013</xref>). In such contexts, expected target strength is a key factor in setting a decision policy to optimise performance – contexts with weaker targets call for a more liberal decision policy. Although bound adjustments present a natural mechanism for these policy adjustments, this has never been experimentally tested for this scenario.</p><p>Much has been learned about the neural implementation of decision-bound adjustments from studies of the neural basis of the speed-accuracy trade-off. In these studies, motor-selective cortical networks have been shown to implement an increase of baseline activity prior to evidence onset, emphasising speed by effectively decreasing the criterion amount of cumulative evidence needed to reach an action-triggering threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forstmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forstmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ivanoff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Veen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wenzlaff et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, recent behavioural and neurophysiological findings have established the operation of a time-dependent ‘urgency’ signal in these motor circuits, an evidence-independent build-up component that drives the decision process closer to a fixed decision threshold, gradually decreasing the cumulative evidence required to respond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Churchland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thura and Cisek, 2016</xref>). However, little is known about how such mechanisms may participate in continuous detection scenarios, or in the adjustments needed to account for other task-related factors such as the expected target evidence strength. Our initial prediction for the present study was that the decision bound – that is, the criterion amount of cumulative evidence – would be lower in continuous detection contexts containing weaker targets. However, in continuous detection where target onsets are unpredictable, the decision process must operate continuously, offering other parameters that could alternatively be adjusted. For example, if accumulation proceeds continuously it is unlikely to be perfect because this generates excessive false alarms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ossmy et al., 2013</xref>) and would instead entail some form of information loss such as through non-linear or leaky accumulation, which has been shown to form a critical adjustable component governing decision-making policies in volatile environments (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gold and Stocker, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glaze et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murphy et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our findings indicate that observers can adjust their decision-making policy based on their knowledge of the difficulty context, but not by adjusting bound settings in the way expected from observed speed/accuracy adjustments. While the electrophysiological signature of motor preparation gradually approached its action-triggering threshold through the inter-target interval (ITI) consistent with the operation of evidence-independent urgency, this baseline activity was not set higher in weak target contexts in order to reduce the bound as predicted. Instead, the motor preparation signal suggested that the bound was reduced in the strong context. We therefore hypothesised that an alternative way to set a conservative decision policy is to reduce the information gathered in the accumulator, and tested two ways of implementing this: (1) leaky accumulation with context-dependent leak and (2) a non-leaky accumulation of evidence referenced to a context-dependent sensory criterion. Fitting these models with urgency dynamics directly constrained by the observed motor preparation signals, we found that the latter model produced a superior fit to both behavioural data and the dynamics of a motor-independent signature of evidence accumulation, the centro-parietal positivity (CPP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kelly and O’Connell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Connell et al., 2012</xref>). We are thus able to falsify the initially predicted bound-adjustment model in favour of an account based on the adjustment of a sensory-level criterion that regulates the transfer of incoming evidence into the accumulation process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioural signatures of contextual adjustments</title><p>We analysed the data of 14 participants that continuously monitored a cloud of randomly moving dots for unpredictable, intermittent targets defined by coherent upward motion. Within each block, the difficulty context was set to be fixed with (1) only weak targets, (2) only strong targets, or (3) mixed with both randomly occurring weak and strong targets. The mixed context was included to control for differences due to target motion coherence itself as distinct from context (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Leaky accumulation is represented as a convolution with an exponential decay kernel. The degree of leakage is a free parameter but constrained to be equal (not adjusted) across contexts. When the target evidence is weak, a more liberal (lower) bound needs to be set to avoid misses; this comes however at the cost of more false alarms (example indicated in red).

In accumulator models of decision making, these patterns can be captured by setting a higher bound when the task is easy, to avoid false alarms while still detecting all targets (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Confirming this, a leaky accumulator model with a higher bound for the strong context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for all the fitted parameters) was able to accurately reproduce behavioural data, particularly the important context-dependent false alarm pattern (see bars of the false alarm plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>=16).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Parameter values estimated for the leaky accumulator model with adjustable bound fit to behaviour alone, and for the neurally informed models featuring leak adjustment and criterion adjustment. ’Noise’ refers to the standard deviation (σ) for the Gaussian sensory evidence noise. ’Bound’ refers to the threshold set on the decision variable for triggering a response. ’Leak’ refers to the proportion of the current cumulative evidence total that leaks away on the following sample (note a 16.7 ms time step is used).

condition and expressed as a difference relative to the corresponding pre-response level taken to reflect motor execution threshold (i.e. threshold level is indicated by zero). To ensure that the beta rebound effect following false alarms (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) could not artificially drive the differences in excursion across conditions, targets occurring within 1.2 s of a false alarm were excluded from these data. The scalp topography shows the distribution of the difference between weak and strong targets in the baseline amplitude (again relative to the motor execution threshold; blue corresponds with more negative amplitude for strong relative to weak motion coherence).

More recently, several replicating findings further indicate that this beta-indexed motor preparation signal reflects a build-to-threshold decision variable driven by a combination of evidence accumulation and urgency. First, it builds at an evidence-dependent rate during decision formation and reaches a stereotyped threshold level at the time of motor execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelly et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Connell et al., 2012</xref>). Second, fluctuations in pre-target beta activity have been shown to predict trial-to-trial behavioural variability in the way accumulator starting point variability does in models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Lange et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gould et al., 2012</xref>). Third, pre-target beta is systematically shifted closer to its pre-response threshold level under conditions of speed emphasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelly et al., 2021</xref>). Fourth, in scenarios where evidence onset is anticipated, beta starts building towards its threshold even before evidence onsets. This is consistent with a dynamic urgency component and aligns with other behavioural and electrophysiological markers of dynamic urgency observed in the similar scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelly et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbett et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In line with this body of previous research, we took the amplitude reached by beta 80 ms prior to response (allowing for motor execution delays) to correspond to the threshold level required to trigger a response in a given condition. This way, the level in the pre-target baseline period can be taken to represent the decision variable starting point at the time of evidence onset. Thus, the difference between these two, known as the ‘excursion’, indexes the change in motor preparation required to commit to a detection decision and thus indexes bound settings in a given context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heitz and Schall, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelly et al., 2021</xref>, see below for separate analysis of baseline and pre-response amplitudes). First, to support the use of beta activity to reflect the motor-level decision variable in this dataset, we confirmed that it built up more steeply during higher coherence targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <italic>GMM</italic>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:msup><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>(1)=–2.8, p=0.004), and that faster RTs within a given condition were associated with the signal starting relatively closer to pre-response threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <italic>GMM</italic>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:msup><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>(1)=2.6, p=0.008). Additionally, we found that the beta amplitude prior to a false alarm closely matched to the amplitude reached prior a true target detection, verifying the assumption that this threshold level is applied consistently within each block (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Turning then to context-dependent adjustments, we found that difficulty context (fixed vs. mixed) and motion coherence (weak vs. strong) had a significant interactive effect on beta excursion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <italic>GMM</italic>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:msup><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>(1)=2.8, p=0.006). Contrary to the prediction of the bound-adjustment model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), this was driven by a pattern whereby beta excursion was smaller, not larger, in the strong context relative to other conditions, indicative of a lower decision bound (weak vs. strong in fixed condition: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:msup><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>(1)=–2.3, p=0.02; strong fixed vs. strong mixed: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:msup><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>(1)=2.1, p=0.03).</p><p>More recently, another signature of decision formation has been characterised – the CPP – which, like beta, builds at an evidence-dependent rate to a peak around the time of decision commitment and response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Connell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kelly and O’Connell, 2013</xref>). This signal, unlike beta, builds even in the absence of motor requirements, but does not undergo baseline shifts according to speed/accuracy emphasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>). The current working hypothesis is thus that the CPP reflects pure cumulative evidence which feeds into motor-level decision variable alongside other evidence-independent signal components such as urgency. In support of this scheme, simulations of pure cumulative evidence build-up have been shown to match empirical CPP waveforms in their dynamics and pre-response amplitude patterns across conditions and RTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afacan-Seref et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelly et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Twomey et al., 2015</xref>). Here, a hypothetical higher bound setting in the strong context would predict that more cumulative evidence is required before reaching the movement execution threshold, and hence a higher CPP amplitude. More specifically, a true contextual adjustment effect should give rise to a CPP amplitude difference in the strong relative to weak context over and above any difference between high and low coherence targets in the mixed context. This, however, was not observed in the empirical pre-response CPP, where only a significant motion coherence effect was found (<italic>GMM</italic>: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:msup><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>(1)=5, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Tracing the waveforms beyond the pre-response measurement window shows that the CPP tends to climb higher for the mixed strong than fixed strong condition, if anything (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The electrophysiological data are therefore inconsistent with the bound-adjustment model. This raises the question of whether an alternative mechanism can explain the behavioural markers of policy adjustment while also producing the observed dynamics in neural decision signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Alternative neurally informed models</title><p>Following a recent approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelly et al., 2021</xref>), we constructed models whose decision-bound settings were constrained to match the observed beta excursion measurements. We use beta activity as it best corresponds to the motor-level decision variable which is ultimately subjected to a threshold. After fitting to behaviour, we then examined whether key dynamical features of evidence accumulation predicted by the models matched those of the observed CPP time courses in a further validation step. To determine the beta activity-based model constraints, it was important to first characterise the dynamics of motor preparation during the ITI more fully. Beta waveforms during the full ITIs showed that in addition to the static shift towards the motor execution threshold in the strong context, there was a strong tendency for beta to decrease over the course of the ITI in all contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <italic>lower</italic>). This increasing trend in beta mirrored a tendency for false alarm rate to increase during the ITI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <italic>upper</italic>). In keeping with our recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corbett et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelly et al., 2021</xref>), we assumed that beta-indexed motor preparation is driven by the sum of evidence accumulation and evidence-independent urgency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Churchland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O’Connell et al., 2018</xref>), and reasoned that since evidence is zero mean during the ITI, beta dynamics can be taken to index urgency alone during that period. Accordingly, we took the grand-average beta amplitude waveform during the 8 s ITI and baseline-corrected these relative to the motor execution threshold indexed by average pre-responses in a given context. These traces were normalised and flipped so that 1 corresponded to the motor execution threshold level and 0 to the lowest level of motor preparation during the ITI. To this waveform a second-order polynomial was fitted to capture the smooth urgency trend relative to threshold (see Materials and methods for more details). This signal was added to the output of the continuous evidence accumulation and the resultant decision variable was subjected to the ultimate, constant decision threshold (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Neurally informed modelling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Motor preparation throughout the inter-target interval (ITI), showing a dynamic urgency trend.

Since, contrary to expectations, the offsets in beta waveforms during the ITI would on their own predict increased false alarms in the fixed strong condition, there must be another adjustment applied elsewhere to counteract this. First, we considered that the same leaky accumulation mechanism as the bound-adjustment model may be at play but with the adjustment across contexts being applied to leak rather than bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Here, a more forgetful (higher leak) integration would reduce the risk of false alarms driven by noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glaze et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murphy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ossmy et al., 2013</xref>) in a way similar to an increased bound, and thus presents an alternative means of setting a conservative policy. Second, we considered that, alternatively, a context-dependent evidence criterion could be set at each momentary evidence sample serving as a ‘zero’ reference placed between noise and signal evidence distributions, similar to the ‘drift criterion’ principle proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ratcliff, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ratcliff et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ratcliff and Tuerlinckx, 2002</xref>. This criterion is distinct in meaning to that of signal detection theory (SDT) in that it does not on its own define the ultimate decision rule to categorise signal versus noise, but rather serves as a reference subtracted from the evidence so that only evidence samples substantially above the noise would be positively accumulated towards the decision bound, while noise alone would conversely tend to count negatively. To prevent runaway negative accumulation in this model, we adopt a reflecting lower bound at zero in the accumulator process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>). Thus, this last model has two major distinctions: it assumes that an adjustable criterion is set directly on the momentary evidence in addition to the adjustable decision bound on the cumulative evidence (here linked directly to beta excursion), and involves a different form of information loss than leak which nevertheless has a similar effect of reducing risk of false alarms due to noise (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). False alarms in this model can be prevented by setting a higher evidence criterion, that is creating a stricter reference point distinguishing target evidence samples from noise.</p><p>While both neurally informed models mimic the behavioural patterns well (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, goodness-of-fit in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), the leak-adjustment model provides a poorer fit (<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>=23) to the behavioural data than the criterion-adjustment model (<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>=16; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <italic>lower</italic>). Remarkably, despite being constrained to adopt the precise bound settings indexed by beta excursion, which oppose the adjustments predicted by the bound-adjustment model, the criterion-adjustment model was able to attain the same goodness-of-fit to behaviour as the initial bound-adjustment model (<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>=16).</p><p>In the above neurally constrained model fits, we assumed that the cumulative evidence component of motor preparation is negligible during the ITI so that beta excursion directly constrains the urgency component only. A potential issue with this arises from the fact that the accumulator operates continuously in our models: whereas the zero-mean noise in the ITI would accumulate to an average level of zero in the leaky accumulation model, the lower reflecting bound in the criterion-adjustment model would cause a positive asymptotic value of the average evidence accumulation during the ITI which scales inversely with criterion. This would predict highest tonic activity in the weak context as it has the lowest criterion, so it does not constitute a viable alternative explanation the observed lowest beta offset in the weak context. Nevertheless, it highlights a likely inaccuracy in the model’s estimation of the degree of adjustment of criterion and urgency offsets. We therefore carried out a revised model fitting procedure in which urgency offsets were not set directly by beta excursion, but rather free to vary in order to reproduce the observed static shifts in the beta excursion across contexts simultaneously with the behavioural data (see detailed explanation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The behavioural fits still favoured the criterion-adjustment model (<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>+penalty = 24) over the leak-adjustment model (<italic>G</italic><sup>2</sup>+penalty = 33; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), and as expected, estimated even larger urgency offsets to compensate for the asymptotic evidence accumulation levels.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Parameter values estimated for neurally informed models fitting behaviour and beta excursion simultaneously (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In the case of the neurally informed models, predicted signatures of bound settings (e.g. cumulative evidence at response) are not informative for validation because they are forced to equal the observed beta excursions by design (see Discussion for comparison of the observed CPP pre-response amplitudes with observed beta excursions). Instead, for the comparison of these two models, respectively featuring leaky accumulation and criterion-referenced, non-leaky accumulation, the stimulus-locked dynamics of accumulator build-up rate (i.e. first derivative) are particularly informative. While a leaky accumulator would be expected to begin to decline in its steepness immediately as it starts to build, a non-leaky accumulator would be expected to rise linearly with a steady slope for a certain amount of time. To test this and compare the models, we analysed the slope profile of the observed and simulated accumulation waveforms. We focused on the strong conditions which will be the most diagnostic in this regard because the strong evidence onset produces a high, robust initial slope, as well as a sharp and relatively invariant CPP build-up onset which best approximates the onset invariance assumed in the models. The fixed strong and, to a lesser degree, the mixed conditions also had stronger predicted degrees of leakage, so that any leak-induced drop in slope should be most apparent against EEG noise. By comparison, the weak conditions have a much less clear onset time presumably due to greater variability in build-up onset timing not accounted for in the model. We found that the empirical CPP slope time course plateaued in the strong conditions indicating a linear build-up profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), whereas the simulated time course of the leaky accumulator models indeed showed a steep drop-off in temporal slope after an initial peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B/C</xref>). Meanwhile, the criterion-adjustment model with non-leaky accumulation showed a plateau in the slope similar to the empirical CPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To capture this key feature quantitatively, we computed the percentage drop in slope in the first 100 ms relative to its initial peak. For the fixed strong condition the empirical slope dropped by 5% (bootstrap CI<sub>95%</sub> = [–5% 16%]), while the criterion-adjustment model predicted a drop of 6%, and the leak-adjustment model a drop of 27.5%, the latter falling outside the empirical bootstrapped 95% CI. Similarly, in the mixed strong condition the empirical slope dropped by 1.5% (bootstrap CI<sub>95%</sub> = [–9.5% 13%]), compared to 3% predicted by the criterion-adjustment model and 17% predicted by the leak-adjustment model.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Comparison of empirical and simulated evidence accumulation waveforms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Empirical average target-locked centro-parietal positivity (CPP) signals (upper row) for each condition as well as their first derivative (lower row).

The dynamics of beta amplitude relative to the action-triggering threshold were the key element for constraining the models as these amplitudes dictate the criterion amount of cumulative evidence required to trigger a response. However, to help interpret these changes in terms of context-related differences in psychological state, it is also of interest to separately examine variations in absolute pre-target and pre-response beta amplitudes across and within conditions. At first blush the smaller excursion in the strong context appears consistent with participants being tonically more prepared to make a movement, which seems counter-intuitive for a task condition that is by far the easiest. However, pre-target beta amplitude was actually found to be higher, reflecting lower baseline motor preparation in the strong context than both the weak and mixed context (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <italic>left</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <italic>GMM</italic>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:msup><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>(1)=2.3, p=0.02 and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:msup><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>(1)=2.4, p=0.02, respectively).

Thus, compared to the mixed and weak contexts, the much easier strong context appeared to have lower tonic levels of preparation, but also a disproportionately more liberal threshold level, resulting in the smaller beta excursion overall.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Detailed analysis of raw beta amplitude in the baseline and pre-response time frames.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Beta amplitude (15–30 Hz) over the motor cortex without any baseline or threshold subtraction, aligned to the target (<italic>left</italic>) and to the response (<italic>right</italic>), averaged for each condition.

As stated above, beta excursion was larger on trials with longer RTs. Interestingly, examining the baseline and pre-response amplitudes separately indicated that this RT relationship was driven by a correlation with beta amplitude in the baseline for the mixed and weak conditions (as seen previously, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>), whereas it was driven by a correlation with pre-response amplitude in the strong context. This was indicated by a significant interaction between context, motion coherence, and RT for both baseline beta (<italic>GMM</italic>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf33"><mml:msup><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>(1)=–0.43, p=0.004) and pre-response beta (<italic>GMM</italic>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:msup><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>(1)=–0.3, p=0.007).

In classic SDT, this is accomplished by adjusting a decision criterion which the observer uses to categorise a unitary observation as either signal or noise, setting it lower (more liberal) when targets are known to be weak. However, the normative SDT framework is based on a unitary sensory observation. In continuous detection scenarios, where fast responses are required to unpredictable targets within ongoing noisy information, decisions benefit from accumulating evidence over time. An obvious analogous mechanism for setting liberal/conservative policies in this case is to adjust a criterion on cumulative evidence, in the form of a response-triggering decision bound, as has been found to regulate speed-accuracy trade-off in discrete forced-choice decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Churchland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palmer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reddi and Carpenter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reddi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thura and Cisek, 2016</xref>). Here, we tested this prediction through the joint analysis and modelling of behavioural and electrophysiological data in a continuous motion detection task performed in three different difficulty contexts. Although we confirmed that context-dependent behaviour can be explained by a bound-adjustment model, we found that beta activity over motor cortex, a well-established neural signature of a thresholded decision variable, showed adjustment trends in the opposite direction. Beta excursion from baseline to motor execution threshold was smaller in the fixed strong context, indicative of a more liberal bound in this condition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Using the exact urgency dynamics reflected in beta oscillations which dictate the decision variable’s starting level relative to threshold and hence the decision bound, we showed that behaviour can be captured equally well by a continuous accumulation model that employs an adjustable sensory criterion to which momentary evidence is referenced before accumulation.</p><p>Building on other recent studies using neurally informed modelling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Connell and Kelly, 2021</xref>), the current study highlights the value in incorporating neural signatures of decision formation in models to uncover effects that cannot be resolved by considering behaviour alone. Specifically, the discrepancy between the behaviour and beta excursion proved to be crucial to test alternative computational mechanisms to implement context adjustments. The essential characteristic of the sensory criterion-adjustment mechanism is that it controls the strength of sensory input that is sufficient to give rise to significant positive accumulation. Within the framework of the current study, in which we assumed a common basis of continuous accumulation for all models, we implemented the criterion as a reference point subtracted from all evidence samples as they enter a continuous accumulator with lower reflecting bound. However, future research should systematically explore other viable implementations of the sensory criterion mechanism. In particular, accumulation need not be continuous and could instead be triggered, for example by the evidence first reaching a ‘gate’ level as has been proposed for visual search decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Purcell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Purcell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schall et al., 2011</xref>), or by a distinct, lower-level process functioning as a relevant transition detector, neural correlates of which have been reported in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Loughnane et al., 2016</xref>) and are also present in the current data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These gate-based triggering mechanisms provide alternative ways to implement an adjustable criterion to regulate the input to the accumulator in order to set decision policy, and could potentially be teased apart through more complex manipulations of noise and target evidence dynamics.</p><p>As we have cautioned previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Connell and Kelly, 2021</xref>), this neurally informed modelling approach comes with the caveat that the validity of model inferences heavily depends on that of the ‘linking propositions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schall, 2019</xref>) specifying how the measured neural decision signals relate to the underlying computational decision process. In this study we relied primarily on the assumption that beta amplitude, relative to its pre-response threshold level (e.g. excursion), maps onto a motor-level decision variable driven by the additive combination of evidence accumulation and urgency components. While several previous studies support this, it is important to survey the supporting results in this specific dataset, especially given the divergence of results from the bound adjustment that we had predicted. First, beta builds over time during targets at a rate that scales with evidence strength, pointing to the evidence accumulation component. Second, beta excursion strongly predicts RT in the way predicted of a bounded accumulator with starting point variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Lange et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gould et al., 2012</xref>). Third, it also builds during the ITI where we would expect that the accumulation of noise would flat-line or quickly asymptote, and the build-up trajectory matched the increasing false alarm rates, pointing to an evidence-independent urgency component. Last, false alarms are associated with a decrease of beta reaching a threshold level closely matching that of hits, indicating a stable threshold both before and during target evidence.</p><p>When analysing absolute beta amplitudes, however, there was one result that did not align fully with previous studies. Previous studies found that beta activity usually reaches a stereotyped pre-response amplitude contralateral to the response across different conditions and RTs, suggesting a fixed threshold applied to motor preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Connell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelly et al., 2021</xref>). While this holds true for most conditions in the current data, pre-response beta activity in the fixed strong condition was significantly elevated relative to the other conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We side-stepped this issue in our models by constraining them using the excursion relative to the pre-response level in a given condition rather than the absolute baseline activity. However, follow-up analysis of absolute beta levels yields further insight into how the context-dependent adjustments are physiologically implemented. Although the smaller beta excursion in the fixed strong condition might suggest that people maintained a higher state of continuous preparedness, which is presumably energy-consuming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gottsdanker, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Näätänen, 1972</xref>) and thus counter-intuitive for such an easy task, the elevated absolute beta amplitude in the ITI suggests much lower tonic preparation in this context. Meanwhile, the yet greater elevation in absolute beta at the time of response could be interpreted as a more relaxed level of response caution at the motor level, which in our criterion-adjustment model is counteracted by the higher sensory-level criterion to create an overall more conservative policy. We also found that pre-response, absolute beta amplitude in the fixed strong condition was higher for faster RTs than for slower RTs. However, relative to the mixed strong condition, this elevation for the fastest trials was also observed in the baseline period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that other, slower-fluctuating generators of beta activity that also relate to RT may superimpose on the motor preparation signal. Indeed, beta activity has been linked to many cognitive factors other than motor preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brovelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buschman and Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buschman and Miller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engel and Fries, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murthy and Fetz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Spitzer and Haegens, 2017</xref>), and here the topographies of condition differences suggest context-dependent changes across a wider network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This again underlines the importance of using beta excursion as model constraints to minimise the influence of slower-fluctuating interfering beta generators, but also highlights the need for future research into how other factors such as attention, response vigour, and sensorimotor connectivity can influence pre-response contralateral beta amplitudes.</p><p>An advantage of having characterised multiple neural signatures of decision formation is that one can be used to constrain models while the other can be used for additional follow-up validation. However, in these data the observed CPP and beta signals were not precisely aligned in their respective estimates of decision-bound settings. Specifically, the pre-response amplitude of the CPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) failed to mirror the reduction in beta excursion seen in the fixed strong condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Under the assumption that the CPP reflects the pure cumulative evidence component that adds to urgency at the downstream motor level where the threshold is set, it should reach lower pre-response amplitudes for conditions in which beta excursion is smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelly et al., 2021</xref>). However, simulations of both neurally informed models (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) confirm that the predicted reduction in pre-response accumulator amplitude for the fixed strong relative to mixed strong is very small (6%), and not an effect easily detected in event-related potentials, suggesting the possibility of a type 2 error. Nevertheless, it is possible that the true empirical CPP amplitude in the fixed strong condition exceeds the value predicted in the models. We could speculate that this could arise from a relaxation of either the weighting or the delay of the transmission of CPP information into motor preparation in this easy condition, either of which would cause the amplitudes to be higher in the fixed pre-response window without changes to model structure or constraints.</p><p>The sensory criterion adjustment mechanism presents an interesting alternative means of policy setting with respect to the strategic adjustment of the action-triggering bound suggested by the dominant computational models and empirical research on the speed-accuracy trade-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogacz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palmer et al., 2005</xref>). It is important to note, however, that it is not yet clear why the policy is set by sensory criterion setting here and by decision-bound setting in the speed/accuracy work, as there are two major differences: here the decision requires an adjustment for sensory target strength, not speed/accuracy emphasis, and here the task is detection within a continuous stimulus as opposed to discrimination within discrete trials. To tell which factor explains the difference in adjustment mechanism, it will be necessary to examine speed-accuracy trade-off manipulations in a continuous detection task.</p><p>In conclusion, while previous studies of decision policy adjustments for other perceptual task manipulations have found that they are enacted by changing the decision bound, we here show that, when adjusting for expected difficulty level during continuous detection, people instead regulate the transfer of sensory evidence into the accumulator process. This suggests that the brain harbours a broader range of mechanisms to regulate decision policy than it had previously seemed.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Fourteen participants (aged 21–60 years; eight female) were recruited at University College Dublin.

While this flicker was included as standard at the time to measure steady-state visual evoked potentials (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kelly and O’Connell, 2013</xref>), these potentials do not reflect sensory evidence for the decision (which is instead the motion coherence) and therefore were not analysed here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Behavioural analysis</title><p>All trials were sorted and analysed according to the four conditions of fixed weak, fixed strong, mixed weak, and mixed strong. RT was calculated in milliseconds (ms) relative to the evidence (i.e. coherent dot motion) onset. Hits were defined as trials in which a response was made between 200 ms after target onset up to 650 ms after target offset. It was assumed that responses with RT faster than 200 ms were false alarms as it is too soon for them to be informed by the sensory evidence from the target. Meanwhile, late responses made up to 650 ms after target offset were defined as hits because this was the point where the post-target response probability returned to the level of false alarm rate during the ITI. Conversely, false alarms were defined as responses in the period from 650 ms after target offset to 200 ms after the following target onset. False alarm rate was calculated as the proportion of 2 s periods of ITI time in which such a false alarm response was made. We chose this ‘per 2 s’ scaling as it is the shortest ITI but note that no results are dependent on this choice of scaling, as it merely sets the units of measurement. In one exception, to look at the distribution through the ITI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <italic>upper</italic>), we computed the proportion of false alarms per 1 s for each context.</p><p>Effects of the different conditions on RT were statistically analysed using a repeated-measures ANOVA (rANOVA) that organised the four conditions into two binary factors of difficulty context (fixed vs. mixed), and coherence (25% vs 70%), and with the additional factor of ITI duration preceding a given target (2, 4, 6, or 8 s). GMM were used to analyse hit rate and false alarms rate, which allows statistical testing of proportions and bounded variables. A logit link function was used for hit rates as they are binomially distributed. False alarm rates were analysed as a function of context (weak, strong, and mixed contexts). A log-link function is used for the false alarm rates as participants had unbounded opportunities to make false alarms within each ITI, yielding a Poisson distribution. For all models, intercepts and slopes were added as random effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>EEG acquisition and preprocessing</title><p>Continuous EEG was recorded from 128 scalp electrodes using a BioSemi system with a sample rate of 512 Hz.

Eye movements were recorded with four electro-oculogram (EOG) electrodes, two above and below the left eye and two at the outer canthus of each for vertical (vEOG) and horizontal (hEOG) eye movements and blinks. EEG data were low-pass filtered by convolution with a 137-tap hanning windowed sinc function to give a 3 dB corner frequency of 37 Hz with strong attenuation at the mains frequency (50 Hz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelly et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Widmann et al., 2015</xref>). Noisy channels were automatically detected using the PREP pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bigdely-Shamlo et al., 2015</xref>) and interpolated using spherical spline interpolation. Initially, large target epochs were extracted using a window capturing the preceding ITI (up to 650 ms after the previous target offset) to 1 s after the current target offset, and shorter target epochs were further extracted from these.</p><p>Target trials were rejected if the absolute difference between the vEOG or hEOG electrodes exceeded 200 μV during –100 ms before target onset up to 100 ms after response or if 10% of the electrodes exceeded 100 μV in the target epoch. If less than 10% of the electrodes exceeded 80 μV on a given trial, then these electrodes were interpolated using a spherical spline interpolation. One participant was excluded due to excessive trial rejection (&gt;70% in each condition) due to a mix of blinking, eye movements, and EEG artefacts. After artefact rejection, the data were subjected to a current source density (CSD) transformation utilising the CSD toolbox in MatlabR2018a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kayser and Tenke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kayser, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Decision signal analysis</title><p>We analysed two neurophysiological signals previously established to reflect decision formation. First, motor preparation was measured via effector-selective spectral amplitude decreases in the beta (15–30 Hz) frequency range. We omitted the 15 Hz frequency bin to avoid contamination of motor preparation signals by the 15 Hz steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) evoked by the on-off flicker of the dots at the same frequency. Second, we analysed the CPP, a motor-independent signal exhibiting evidence accumulation dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Connell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kelly and O’Connell, 2013</xref>). To measure beta amplitude, we computed a short time Fourier transform by applying a Fourier transform in a sliding window of 266 ms (four full cycles of the SSVEP) in steps of 10 ms, and then extracted amplitude in the 15–30 Hz frequency range for the electrode at standard sensorimotor sites C3 and C4, for participants that responded with right and left hand, respectively.</p><p>The CPP was measured from three centro-parietal electrodes that we selected from each individual participant with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (amplitude –133 to –66 ms before the response divided by the standard measurement error as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luck et al., 2021</xref>), within a cluster of nine electrodes delineated based on the visual inspection of the grand-average topography of the response CPP (see topography in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Beta and CPP signals were then segmented into target-locked and response-locked epochs. Target-locked epochs were extracted from –200 to 1000 ms around target onset, and response-locked epochs were extracted from –400 to 200 ms around response time. For the CPP, epochs were baseline-corrected to –133 to –66 ms around target onset (two full cycles of the SSVEP at 15 Hz). They were additionally low-passed filtered at 6 Hz with a fourth-order Butterworth filter, for plotting purposes only. Only hits, where no false alarm occurred within 1.2 s pre-target onset, were included in the analysis of stimulus- and response-locked CPP and beta.</p><p>To determine whether the neural signals show signs of decision-bound adjustment, we compared the beta amplitude ‘excursion’ – that is, amplitude just prior to response relative to just prior to target onset – and the pre-response CPP amplitude across the four conditions. Beta excursion was calculated on each trial by taking the difference of mean baseline amplitude (−133 to –66 ms relative to target onset) minus mean pre-response amplitude (−133 to –66 ms relative to response). CPP amplitude was calculated for each trial as the average amplitude in the pre-response time range –133 to –66 ms relative to response. The effects on beta excursion and CPP were examined using a GMM with the factors of difficulty context (fixed vs. mixed) and motion coherence (25% vs 70%), and including RT (z-scored within participant) as a covariate. For all models, random intercepts and slopes were added as random effects.</p><p>In our framework we assume that beta reflects the combination of evidence accumulation and urgency components. As the noise during the ITI is zero mean, we assumed any beta dynamics or effects in the ITI mainly reflected the operation of urgency. Thus, in order to create a standardised urgency signal to constrain computational decision models (see below), we took the grand-average beta amplitude for each context in the pre-response amplitude (−67 to –33 ms) as the threshold level for that context and subtracted it from the beta signals measured during the ITI. Then, we took the longest ITI (8 s) and fitted a second-order polynomial to capture the smooth urgency trend, ignoring any residual noise. The smooth urgency function was then normalised by dividing it by the maximum value during the ITI in any context, and finally it was inverted (urgency = 1-urgency). In this way, 0 corresponds to the lowest motor preparation level measured during the ITI in the grand-average beta signals of any context and 1 corresponds to the threshold level for triggering a response. During the targets, evidence accumulation adds to urgency and therefore beta cannot be used to isolate the dynamics of urgency on its own. For the sake of parsimony, we simply assumed that during targets following 2, 4, or 6 s ITIs, urgency continued on its trajectory measured from 8 s ITIs. For targets following 8 s ITIs, we assumed that urgency held steady at its pre-target level, based on the fact that beta tended to saturate during the ITI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Computational models</title><p>We fitted three alternative models to the behavioural data: a leaky accumulator model with context-dependent bound (henceforth the bound-adjustment model) and two neurally constrained models with urgency quantified directly from beta signals as above, and featuring either leaky accumulation with context-dependent leak (henceforth the leak-adjustment model) or non-leaky accumulation of evidence cast relative to a sensory criterion with a lower reflecting decision bound at zero (henceforth the criterion-adjustment model).

The apportioning of non-decision delays to before or after the accumulation to bound process does not generally impact the fitting of behavioural models, but we applied this fixed motor time here to be consistent with the measurement time window used for CPP amplitude. For the purposes of comparing the simulated and observed CPPs, rather than setting <italic>y</italic>=0 immediately upon threshold crossing, we allowed the simulated accumulator to continue accumulating for 80 ms beyond the point of decision commitment, after which the accumulator linearly decreased back to 0 over a period of 400 ms, mimicking the overshoot and fall of the empirical CPP after the response time. Note that model fits to behaviour are unaffected by the inclusion of this post-decision ramp-down.

In this initial broad search, about 4500 trials were simulated per model evaluation in separate SIMPLEX fits for 1000 different initial ‘guess’ parameter vectors. These initial guess vectors were made by sampling from a uniform distribution spanning a reasonable range along each parameter dimension, so that the guess vectors together comprehensively covered a large parameter space in which to find a global minimum. In a second refinement stage, about 20,000 trials were simulated in each model evaluation in separate SIMPLEX fits starting from the 30 best estimated parameter vectors arising from the first step, with lower tolerance criteria for termination or convergence. This second step tended to improve the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf65"><mml:msup><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> only slightly, typically by about 2%.</p><p>Last, we ran a similar refinement step for model versions that now had four separate free drift rate parameters, to allow capturing any modulation of evidence accumulation quality due to either practice (as the participants always performed the mixed condition last) or context itself (e.g. drift rate may depend on how often strong targets arise in a given context). Using the 30 best refined parameters, we produced 200 new initial parameter vectors by adding random Gaussian jitter of a standard deviation of 1.1 times the mean of each of the refined parameters and 1.15 times of the mean for the drift rate parameters. Again about 20,000 trials were simulated in each model evaluation for this last step.</p><p>To confirm that the added complexity of four free drift rates was warranted over a single free drift rate parameter within each model, we computed the Akaike’s (AIC) and Bayes information on criterion (BIC), to penalise for the complexity of the models, for example number of free parameters (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf66"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>).<disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mtext>AIC</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ5"><label>(5)</label><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mtext>BIC</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The principal comparisons in the study were across the three models with the same number of free parameters in any comparison, only differing in accumulation and/or adjustment mechanisms.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Valentin Wyart as Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Romy Frömer (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. As you will see, the two reviewers have found that your work makes a strong case as to how behavior alone can be insufficient to tease apart competing models of sequential sampling models of decision-making, and possibly lead to misattribution of observed behavioral differences. Your neurally-informed modeling approach shows how neural measures may help in such situations to arbitrate between models that are indistinguishable from behavior alone. However, both reviewers agreed that this approach relies strongly on the assumed relationship between the neural measure of interest (here, the Β amplitude signal) and the decision process, something which amounts to 'reverse' inference to some extent. It is therefore important to consider more explicitly the possibility that this assumed relationship may either be incorrect in some respect – e.g. because the neural measure reflects a mixture of components of the decision process rather than a single component. The approach is nevertheless novel, and potentially powerful, and the main text could provide all the available empirical evidence in the data that points toward the assumed relationship between Β amplitude and evidence-independent urgency.</p><p>The reviewers have agreed on the below list of essential revisions that should be addressed in a point-by-point fashion and accounted for in a revised version of your manuscript. The individual reviews of the two reviewers are also provided at the bottom of this decision letter for you to address also minor comments on the manuscript. These individual reviews do not require point-by-point responses. We hope that you will be able to address these comments and that you will choose to submit your revised manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The revised manuscript should give greater consideration to the possibility that the hypothesized relationship between the neural measure of interest (Β amplitude) and the decision process may not be entirely correct. The neurally-informed modeling approach is indeed quite appealing to distinguish between candidate models that are indistinguishable from behavior alone. However, it appears at times in the current manuscript to rely on a form of 'reverse' inference: assuming that the neural measure of interest is a faithful, selective correlate of a specific component of the decision process. It is almost never the case that such inferences can be made without significant doubt, especially in the case of non-invasive neural measures such as EEG-derived metrics.</p><p>A specific paragraph in the Discussion section would be very useful for readers to clarify not only the benefits of your novel approach but also its assumptions and potential caveats.</p><p>2) The neurally-informed modeling approach (Figure 3) appears to use Β amplitude as an evidence-independent urgency signal that adds to the decision variable (it is described as such in the Methods section). However, Β amplitude is clearly affected by the evidence (Figure 2A). And in the Results section, Β amplitude is described as best corresponding to a decision variable, which would include a dependence on sensory evidence. This seems conflicting: how can Β amplitude be used as an evidence-independent urgency signal in the neurally-informed modeling if it depends on sensory evidence?</p><p>To resolve this apparent discrepancy between the assumption of the neurally-informed modeling approach and the data, it would be very important to provide the key properties of the Β amplitude signal (ideally from your own dataset) that make it suitable to use as an evidence-independent urgency signal. This list should ideally be found in the Results section so as to give readers a clear idea of the several properties of this signal before using it as an evidence-independent urgency signal in the modeling. Because the interpretability of the results of these analyses depends on this assumption, it is key that the reader understands how much this modeling assumption is grounded in the available data. Nevertheless, a Discussion paragraph that explains how the neurally informed modeling approach depends on this assumption (see point 1) is very important.</p><p>3) Related to the previous point, the properties of the Β amplitude signal suggest that it reflects a mixture of processes rather than a selective component of the decision process. As noted by Reviewer 2, in the evidence criterion adjustment model, the average DV value during the ITI will be closer to the decision bound in the weaker signal condition compared to the stronger signal condition (this is how the model fits the false alarm rate differences). This should be reflected in Β amplitude if the latter reflects the DV. However, the Β-derived urgency is highest for the condition with the lowest false alarm rate and lowest for the condition with the highest false alarm rate. It would be very useful to clarify these seemingly hypothesis-inconsistent aspects of the data in the revised manuscript, which may be resolved with further details and explanations regarding what is expected of the neural signal of interest.</p><p>4) Regarding the criterion-adjustment model, could there be an alternative equivalent account that does not involve regulation of the transfer of incoming evidence? It appears highly similar to one with a constant negative drift added to the decision variable in addition to the contribution of evidence (and a lower reflecting bound).</p><p>5) Parameterization of the models. You explain clearly that one of the model parameters (e.g., noise or bound) must be fixed, but it is not clear why you didn't keep it the same parameter across all models. Couldn't you have fixed the noise parameters for all the models? Having it different across models makes it difficult to compare parameter values across the models, especially because the fitted noise term in the neurally-informed models appears dramatically reduced compared to the fixed value of noise used for the bound-adjustment model. Also regarding model parameterization, could you possibly report the leak parameter using more intuitive units? It seems to be parameterized as a fraction leak per time step, but the time step is unclear. Reporting the leak as a time constant would be immediately understandable.</p><p>6) Reviewer 2 has identified several problems with Figure 3, which should be corrected in the revised version: Figure 3 could benefit from a number of improvements. The various line types in the top panel of A are not labeled or described. The range of values of the y-axis in the top panel seems rather small compared to the overall false alarm rates. I know the latter was calculated as a proportion over 2-second intervals. I don't know the bin width for Figure 3A, but the numbers being a factor of 10 smaller seems pretty far off based on my best guess of bin width. The scaling of the bottom panel of A clips off 2 of the 3 curves at earlier times. From the methods, I believe at least one of the curves should go all the way down to 1, so half the range is cut off in the current version. In panel B, the evidence distributions are not labeled and a bit confusing. I can guess that they correspond to distributions with a strong signal, with a weak signal, and without a signal. However, the presumptive &quot;without signal&quot; black distribution appears shifted negative of zero, which I don't think is correct. The title of panel F says &quot;simulated Bound-adjustment&quot; while the text describes this as the &quot;simulated criterion-adjustment&quot; model.

You explain that the urgency signal was removed from the simulations of this &quot;DV&quot;, which is useful, but there should still be an influence of pre-target noise. Did the simulations not include any influence of pre-target noise? Reviewer 2 is correct that it is unclear why it is not included, and it should be explored explicitly if possible.</p><p>8) It would be useful to discuss at least some alternative models that may have not been considered in this study. Modeling studies and their comparison are always dependent on the models being included. One could maybe have thought of a different alternative to the standard model, such as the precision-weighted evidence integration mentioned by Reviewer 3. It would be useful to discuss alternative variants of the standard account of the contrast between conditions somewhere in the Discussion section.</p><p>Frömer, R., Callaway, F., Griffiths, T., &amp; Shenhav, A.

The neurally-informed modeling approach is indeed quite appealing to distinguish between candidate models that are indistinguishable from behavior alone. However, it appears at times in the current manuscript to rely on a form of 'reverse' inference: assuming that the neural measure of interest is a faithful, selective correlate of a specific component of the decision process. It is almost never the case that such inferences can be made without significant doubt, especially in the case of non-invasive neural measures such as EEG-derived metrics.</p><p>A specific paragraph in the Discussion section would be very useful for readers to clarify not only the benefits of your novel approach but also its assumptions and potential caveats.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that it is very important to question and discuss the assumptions upon which our modelling approach relies especially as the results are contradicting our initial hypothesis. As suggested by the reviewers, we have now added a new paragraph in the Discussion section listing the pieces of evidence within this dataset supporting the link between Β oscillations relative to pre-response levels and the motor-level decision variable (see line 343-359, page 11 and 12), while also highlighting the caveat that inferences can only ever be as accurate as these linking propositions. In the process, we also decided to show more of the empirical evidence in figures. In particular, revised Figure 2B now shows the prediction of reaction time by Β excursion, and Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 shows the Β waveforms for false alarms, verifying there is a decrease to a similar threshold as for true target detections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The neurally-informed modeling approach (Figure 3) appears to use Β amplitude as an evidence-independent urgency signal that adds to the decision variable (it is described as such in the Methods section). However, Β amplitude is clearly affected by the evidence (Figure 2A). And in the Results section, Β amplitude is described as best corresponding to a decision variable, which would include a dependence on sensory evidence. This seems conflicting: how can Β amplitude be used as an evidence-independent urgency signal in the neurally-informed modeling if it depends on sensory evidence?</p><p>To resolve this apparent discrepancy between the assumption of the neurally-informed modeling approach and the data, it would be very important to provide the key properties of the Β amplitude signal (ideally from your own dataset) that make it suitable to use as an evidence-independent urgency signal. This list should ideally be found in the Results section so as to give readers a clear idea of the several properties of this signal before using it as an evidence-independent urgency signal in the modeling. Because the interpretability of the results of these analyses depends on this assumption, it is key that the reader understands how much this modeling assumption is grounded in the available data. Nevertheless, a Discussion paragraph that explains how the neurally informed modeling approach depends on this assumption (see point 1) is very important.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment as we indeed were not consistently clear on our assumptions regarding Β oscillations. As suggested, we clarified provided a list of properties in the Results section (see line 111-125, page 4) and added a cautionary discussion in the Discussion section (see line 343-359, page 11 and 12). Furthermore, we now provide more Β analyses using our own dataset to examine this critical issue (see line 133-140, page 6). First, reviewer 1 is correct that Β reflects both urgency and evidence accumulation, which we now state more clearly, and this underpins our assumption that Β amplitude reflects a thresholded decision variable additively combining urgency and cumulative evidence. For clarity we now exclusively use the term “decision variable” in reference to this motor-level, thresholded process combining both components. Our assumption, following Kelly et al. (2021), was that during the inter-target interval (ITI) when the evidence is zero-mean, we can take the cumulative evidence component as negligible and use Β excursion during the ITI as a pure measurement of urgency. However, as pointed out in Comment 3, this assumption does not hold for the criterion-adjustment model and so we describe below a new control model fit addressing this.</p><p>We have made edits in the Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion that are consistently clear on our <italic>‘Β = evidence accumulation + urgency’</italic> assumption, and we additionally added a list of properties supporting this assumption from the present dataset in the Results section and reiterate them in the Discussion:</p><p>Β builds at an evidence-dependent rate as decisions are formed during targets, as clearly indicated in Figure 2A,</p><p>To add a fourth property, we characterise the Β decreases just prior to false Alarms. Initially we did not include any false alarm waveforms as there were almost no false alarms in the Fixed strong conditions. Nevertheless, Β waveforms for false alarms are still illustrative for the other conditions and we have included them in the supplementary material (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1). Two aspects are important: first that false alarms are associated with a local Β decrease, reaching the same pre-response Β amplitude for false alarms as the pre-hit level, supporting the assumption in the models that the same threshold level applies through the ITI as during the target epochs (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1B). Second, there is a post-response increase or β “rebound” effect as typically observed (Pfurtscheller and Silva, 1999). Although the decreasing and increasing phases appear to roughly balance so that this effect in the minority of ITIs containing false alarms is unlikely to impact the measurements of static offsets between urgency signals during the ITI, to be conservative, we have replotted and recalculated all target-locked and response-locked waveforms in Figure 2A to exclude trials where a false alarm occurred within the 1.2 seconds prior to the target onset. These new figures still show the same pattern as in the initial manuscript and confirms that the occurrence of false Alarms is not artificially elevated baseline Β in the Weak condition away from the decision threshold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the previous point, the properties of the Β amplitude signal suggest that it reflects a mixture of processes rather than a selective component of the decision process. As noted by Reviewer 2, in the evidence criterion adjustment model, the average DV value during the ITI will be closer to the decision bound in the weaker signal condition compared to the stronger signal condition (this is how the model fits the false alarm rate differences). This should be reflected in Β amplitude if the latter reflects the DV. However, the Β-derived urgency is highest for the condition with the lowest false alarm rate and lowest for the condition with the highest false alarm rate. It would be very useful to clarify these seemingly hypothesis-inconsistent aspects of the data in the revised manuscript, which may be resolved with further details and explanations regarding what is expected of the neural signal of interest.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this counter-intuitive aspect of the criterion-adjustment model. As mentioned in response to Comment 2, we do assume that Β excursion represents the additive combination of cumulative evidence plus the urgency signal. For the leaky accumulation models the cumulative noise in the ITI has a trial-average of zero, allowing us to assume that during the ITI in the absence of evidence that the average Β reflects the urgency component only. In contrast, as reviewer 1 points out, in the criterion-adjustment model, due to the reflective bounds, the average asymptotic level of noise accumulation would be higher for the Weak condition due to the lower sensory criterion feeding more positive values to the accumulator. Illustrating this, we simulate the individual urgency and evidence accumulation components, along with the total DV reflected in Β, arising from the original fit of the criterion-adjustment model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This highlights the inaccuracy in our original assumption that Β is ‘evidence independent’ during the ITI. We had estimated the urgency offsets directly from Β measurements, when Β actually reflects the sum of the urgency component plus this context-dependent average level of noise accumulation during the ITI. The simulation shows that the inaccuracy is not large – the differences in tonic levels of noise accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>) are small compared to the assumed urgency offsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), and so the aggregate motor-level DV offsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>) are still in the direction observed, with Strong elevated over Weak, albeit smaller. Nevertheless, it was important to correct for this inaccuracy in a control analysis to verify that the overall conclusions do not change.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Simulations of the original criterion-adjustment model showing the traces throughout the longest ITI (8 sec).</title><p>Here showing, (A) the urgency constrained by the Β data, (B) “evidence” (zero-mean noise during ITI) accumulation and (C) the sum of the urgency component plus evidence accumulation<italic>.</italic> These figures show that within the original criterion-adjustment model the noise accumulates to a context-dependent average asymptotic level, which contributes alongside urgency to the context-dependent offsets seen in the motor-level decision variable reflecting the sum urgency + evidence accumulation.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83025-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In the control analysis, we refitted the data to not only reproduce the observed behavioural patterns but also, simultaneously, the static shifts observed in baseline Β amplitude in Figure 2C. Specifically, we now constrained the time-dependent urgency function to equal the quadratic approximation of Β during the ITI for the Mixed condition only, and added two free parameters to capture the static shifts in urgency for the Weak and Strong conditions, relative to the Mixed. The models were fitted using Monte Carlo simulations of the decision process to generate simulated behavioural responses as well as the normalised Β excursion, whose match to the observed data was evaluated by adding a penalty term <italic>w*(observed Β – simulated Β)<sup>2</sup></italic> to the G<sup>2</sup> value in the objective function to be minimised (Described in Lines 222 – 238, page 8). This gave us the results that are now added in Table 2 (page 8) and Figure 3 —figure supplement 1.</p><p>‘In the above neurally-constrained model fits, we assumed that the cumulative evidence component of motor preparation is negligible during the ITI so that Β excursion directly constrain the urgency component only. A potential issue with this arises from the fact that the accumulator operates continuously in our models: whereas the zero-mean noise in the ITI would accumulate to an average level of zero in the leaky accumulation model, the lower reflecting bound in the criterion-adjustment model would cause a positive asymptotic value of the average evidence accumulation during the ITI which scales inversely with criterion. This would predict highest tonic activity in the Weak context as it has the lowest criterion, so it does not constitute a viable alternative explanation the observed lowest Β offset in the Weak context. Nevertheless, it highlights a likely inaccuracy in the model’s estimation of the degree of adjustment of criterion and urgency offsets. We therefore carried out a revised model fitting procedure in which urgency offsets were not set directly by Β excursion, but rather free to vary in order to reproduce the observed static shifts in the Β excursion across contexts simultaneously with the behavioural data see detailed explanation in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1. The behavioural fits still favoured the criterion-adjustment model (G2 + penalty = 24) over the leak-adjustment model (G2 + penalty = 33; see Table 2), and as expected, estimated even larger urgency offsets to compensate for the asymptotic evidence accumulation levels.’</p><p>These new model fits show that even when fixing this issue of ignoring noise accumulation differences, the criterion-adjustment model is able to capture the behaviour while adopting the counterintuitive urgency offsets that result in the static shift in pre-target motor preparation in which the Strong condition is closest to the bound but has the least false alarms. The results of this control analysis have been added to Table 2. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> we show a re-simulation of the individual urgency and evidence accumulation components and the sum reflecting the predicted motor-level decision variable for this control analysis, in the same way as above. Here we see that the urgency offsets lie even more strongly in the originally observed direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>), more than counteracting the smaller offsets in the noise accumulation, so that the total decision variable now more closely matches the offsets in the observed Β traces (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Simulation from the control analysis where the Criterion-adjustment model was forced to reproduce the static shifts observed in baseline Β amplitude as well as the observed behavioural patterns simultaneously.</title><p>Traces in the Longest ITI are plotted, from left to right: (A) Urgency traces, where the Mixed condition is constrained by the observed Β signals and the Weak and Strong conditions are statically shifted by two free parameters relative to the Mixed condition; (B) the evidence (zero-mean noise during ITI) accumulation; (C) the sum of the urgency component and evidence accumulation.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83025-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>While this control analysis quantitatively reconciles the apparent discrepancy in the context-dependent effects in Urgency versus average noise accumulation during the ITI, it remains quite counter-intuitive that the observed Β, in the reviewers’ words, “is highest for the condition with the lowest false alarm rate and lowest for the condition with the highest false alarm rate.” We therefore provided an additional simulation of the decision variable’s behaviour at the single-trial level (taking a random single trial for illustration), which demonstrates that since the accumulator spends much of its time at the reflecting bound level of zero during the ITI, the total decision variable spends most of its time lying lower for the Weak than the Strong context, as dictated by the dominant urgency offsets; however, due to the lower criterion set in the Weak context, it more often happens that a short sequence of noise samples drives the accumulator high enough to accidentally trigger a false alarm in that context. This is shown in Figure 3 —figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Regarding the criterion-adjustment model, could there be an alternative equivalent account that does not involve regulation of the transfer of incoming evidence? It appears highly similar to one with a constant negative drift added to the decision variable in addition to the contribution of evidence (and a lower reflecting bound).</p></disp-quote><p>This is true – a constant negative drift rate would work also – but as reviewer 1 pointed out, this is equivalent to the criterion adjustment model. In fact, this is exactly what the criterion-adjustment model does, subtracting a constant value from all the evidence samples before being accumulated. We refer to it as “referencing to a criterion” but this subtraction is the same as adding a negative drift. We refer to this equivalence when we mention the “drift criterion” of Ratcliff. Our Discussion also lays out other possible implementations of the regulation of incoming evidence, for example involving triggered rather than continuous accumulation. These would still adhere to the claims of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Parameterization of the models. You explain clearly that one of the model parameters (e.g., noise or bound) must be fixed, but it is not clear why you didn't keep it the same parameter across all models. Couldn't you have fixed the noise parameters for all the models? Having it different across models makes it difficult to compare parameter values across the models, especially because the fitted noise term in the neurally-informed models appears dramatically reduced compared to the fixed value of noise used for the bound-adjustment model. Also regarding model parameterization, could you possibly report the leak parameter using more intuitive units? It seems to be parameterized as a fraction leak per time step, but the time step is unclear. Reporting the leak as a time constant would be immediately understandable.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the potential difficulty in evaluating parameter values from the table. To avoid confusion when comparing parameter values between the neurally-informed and bound-adjustment models, we have added an explanation for these differences in scaling parameters in the table caption. For the bound-adjustment model, we made noise σ = 0.1 the fixed scaling parameter both because this is the most common practice in the diffusion model literature and because the bound parameter needed to be free to vary across the three contexts. In the neurally-constrained models it is the bound itself that provides the most natural anchorpoint because all urgency estimates are measured relative to the pre-response amplitude that is taken to correspond to that bound. We considered rescaling the bound-adjustment model to facilitate direct quantitative comparison in the table, but this would entail some arbitrary choices that in turn may lead to confusion; for example, a natural rescaling would be to take the bound in one of the conditions – say, the Mixed condition – to be equal to 1 in the bound-adjustment model just as it is in all conditions in the neurally-constrained models, and dividing all other bound parameters and the drift rate parameters by 0.85. This would require adding another column for the bound-adjustment model to enter the rescaled value of the noise (0.1/0.85), which would make it less clear at a glance what free parameters were in each model. What’s more, because the neurally-constrained models have a strong urgency component the effective bound on cumulative evidence is much less than 1 and varies not only across conditions but also across ITIs, further complicating any attempt we might make to try to bring the bound-adjustment model into register for direct comparison. We hope, therefore, that the reviewer will agree that adding the below to the Table 1 caption is on balance the least confusing way to guide the reader in how to compare parameter values across models, though of course we are happy to consider other suggestions the reviewer may have. For the leak parameter, we also added an explanation to the caption to avoid confusion, and provided the time step size as suggested by the reviewer. Since we speak in terms of “more and less leak” in the text rather than “shorter or longer time-constant,” we opted to stick to the leak parameter, but with a clear explanation as to how to interpret it.</p><p>See the new Table 1 caption, page 4: ‘Parameter values estimated for the leaky accumulator model with adjustable bound fit to behaviour alone, and for the neurally-informed models featuring leak-adjustment and criterion-adjustment. ’Noise’ refers to the standard deviation (σ) for the Gaussian sensory evidence noise. ’Bound’ refers to the threshold set on the decision variable for triggering a response. ’Leak’ refers to the proportion of the current cumulative evidence total that leaks away on the following sample (note a 16.7 ms time step is used). No leak was fitted for the criterion-adjustment model. ’Tnd’ refers to the non-decision time in ms. ’Drift’ refers to drift rate, corresponding to the mean of the sensory evidence during targets. The Goodness-of-Fit metric, G2, is listed for each model. Note that, if comparing parameter values between models directly, it must be taken into account that whereas the bound-adjustment model set a scaling parameter of noise σ = 0.1 and allowed bounds to vary freely with respect to this. In contrast, the neurally-constrained models were scaled directly by the normalised urgency signals relative to the ultimate action triggering bound taken to be equal to 1. These fixed parameters are indicated in red.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Reviewer 2 has identified several problems with Figure 3, which should be corrected in the revised version: Figure 3 could benefit from a number of improvements. The various line types in the top panel of A are not labeled or described. The range of values of the y-axis in the top panel seems rather small compared to the overall false alarm rates. I know the latter was calculated as a proportion over 2-second intervals. I don't know the bin width for Figure 3A, but the numbers being a factor of 10 smaller seems pretty far off based on my best guess of bin width. The scaling of the bottom panel of A clips off 2 of the 3 curves at earlier times. From the methods, I believe at least one of the curves should go all the way down to 1, so half the range is cut off in the current version. In panel B, the evidence distributions are not labeled and a bit confusing. I can guess that they correspond to distributions with a strong signal, with a weak signal, and without a signal. However, the presumptive &quot;without signal&quot; black distribution appears shifted negative of zero, which I don't think is correct. The title of panel F says &quot;simulated Bound-adjustment&quot; while the text describes this as the &quot;simulated criterion-adjustment&quot; model. I presume this is a mistake in labeling the title, but as this is the most critical distinction for the paper's main conclusion, it's really important to get it right.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching each of these issues. In addition to correcting the mistakes, since Figure 3 contained a lot of information, we decided that the manuscript would benefit from splitting this figure into two: (1) Figure 3 which includes the false alarm and motor preparation trends during the ITI and the two Neurally-informed models with the behavioural data, and (2) Figure 4 which shows the validation analysis based on the simulated evidence accumulation traces and their first derivatives. This also allows us to add a similar simulation of the Bound-adjustment model, which illustrates that the level of leak in that behaviour-only model predicts an even starker immediate drop in buildup rate.

We think that our original inversion of the axis so that “up” corresponds to Β decrease may have caused this confusion, and so we have flipped the y-axis back to normal, as in Figure 2A, with the pre-response level corresponding to zero now at the bottom, and fixed the caption to clarify that Β as shown has not yet been normalised to scale between 0 and 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In panel B, the evidence distributions are not labeled and a bit confusing.

Note, that in the models this correction is not applied and in the simulation there is indeed an effect of pre-target noise, as we showed above in response to Comment 3.

One could maybe have thought of a different alternative to the standard model, such as the precision-weighted evidence integration mentioned by Reviewer 3. It would be useful to discuss alternative variants of the standard account of the contrast between conditions somewhere in the Discussion section.</p><p>Frömer, R., Callaway, F., Griffiths, T., &amp; Shenhav, A.

In our Discussion we describe some alternative model implementations but do not provide fits here because they would not change the central claim that unlike speed-accuracy tradeoff, the strategic policy adjustments to take account of target strength are not the direct bound adjustments. In ongoing work we are testing alternative models on this and other continuous monitoring datasets mostly focussing on continuous vs. alternative gating models, but the results are orthogonal to this claim. In other work in our group, we are also examining continuous motion direction identification around 360 degrees, which will lend itself to examining aspects of precision.</p></body></sub-article></article>
