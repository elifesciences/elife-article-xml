advancing precision medicine. Here, we studied 246 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive (COVID<sub>pos</sub>)patients and propensity-matched 2,460 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative (COVID<sub>neg</sub>) patients subjected to around 700,000 lab tests cumulatively across 194 assays. Compared to COVID<sub>neg</sub> patients at the time of diagnostic testing, COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients tended to have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and lower platelet counts. However, as the infection evolves, COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients distinctively show declining fibrinogen, increasing platelet counts, and lower white blood cell counts. Augmented curation of EHRs suggests that only a minority of COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients develop thromboembolism, and rarely, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with patients generally not displaying platelet reductions typical of consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal trends provide fine-grained resolution into COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC) and set the stage for personalizing thromboprophylaxis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf2"><p>Colin Pawlowski, This author is an employee of nference with financial interests in the company.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf3"><p>Tyler Wagner, This author is an employee of nference with financial interests in the company.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf4"><p>Arjun Puranik, This author is an employee of nference with financial interests in the company.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf5"><p>Karthik Murugadoss, This author is an employee of nference with financial interests in the company.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf6"><p>Liam Loscalzo, This author is an employee of nference with financial interests in the company.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf7"><p>AJ Venkatakrishnan, This author is an employee of nference with financial interests in the company.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf8"><p>Rajiv K Pruthi, One or more of the investigators associated with this project and Mayo Clinic have a Financial Conflict of Interest in technology used in the research and that the investigator(s) and Mayo Clinic may stand to gain financially from the successful outcome of the research.
