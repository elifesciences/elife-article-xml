<italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic> differs from most other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species in that it lays eggs in ripe, rather than overripe, fruit. Previously, we showed that changes in bitter taste sensation accompanied this adaptation (Dweck et al., 2021). Here, we show that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has also undergone a variety of changes in sweet taste sensation. <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has a weaker preference than <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> for laying eggs on substrates containing all three primary fruit sugars: sucrose, fructose, and glucose. Major subsets of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> taste sensilla have lost electrophysiological responses to sugars. Expression of several key sugar receptor genes is reduced in the taste organs of <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. By contrast, certain mechanosensory channel genes, including <italic>no mechanoreceptor potential C</italic>, are expressed at higher levels in the taste organs of <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, which has a higher preference for stiff substrates. Finally, we find that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> responds differently from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to combinations of sweet and mechanosensory cues. Thus, the two species differ in sweet sensation, mechanosensation, and their integration, which are all likely to contribute to the differences in their egg-laying preferences in nature.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic></kwd><kwd>sugar sensation</kwd><kwd>mechanosensation</kwd><kwd>egg-lying</kwd><kwd>ripe fruit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01 DC020145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dweck</surname><given-names>Hany KM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32DC019302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Talross</surname><given-names>Gaëlle JS</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM128670</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gendron</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC02174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlson</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC04729</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlson</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC011697</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlson</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic>, which lays eggs on ripe fruits, differs from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> in sweet sensation, mechanosensation, and their integration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic>, commonly known as the spotted wing <italic>Drosophila</italic>, is a major agricultural pest of soft fruits, including strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burrack et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mazzi et al., 2017</xref>). It invaded the continental United States in 2008 and is now found in at least 52 countries worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreazza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calabria et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dos Santos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hauser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ørsted et al., 2019</xref>). Efforts to control its damage to fruit production have relied largely on insecticides, and improved means of control are critically needed.</p><p><italic>D. suzukii</italic> is destructive due to its unusual egg-laying preference. Most <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, including <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, prefer to lay eggs on fermenting fruits. By contrast, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has an egg-laying preference for ripe, intact fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>D. suzukii</italic> females have an enlarged saw-like ovipositor that can pierce the skin of intact fruits and insert eggs underneath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poyet et al., 2015</xref>). However, little is known about the sensory mechanisms underlying their different egg-laying preference. <italic>D. suzukii</italic> provides an excellent opportunity for comparative studies of how sensory systems evolve, taking advantage of the vast accumulated knowledge and genetic tools of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p><p><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> females select egg-laying sites by evaluating many cues, which inform them of nutrients, microbes, predators, and other flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ebrahim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stensmyr et al., 2012</xref>). Multiple sensory modalities are used: long-range localization of appropriate sites relies mainly on olfaction and vision, whereas close-range decisions rely on contact-dependent gustatory and mechanosensory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Markow, 2019</xref>).</p><p>As fruits progress through stages of ripening and fermentation, they undergo many changes, including alterations in softness, sugar content, acidity, and odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dudley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hidalgo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paul and Pandey, 2014</xref>). A priori, any of these changes could serve as fruit stage indicators for the fly, and alterations in the sensation of any could contribute to the unusual egg-laying preference of <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. A pioneering study showed elegantly that changes in olfactory and mechanosensory responses contribute to the shift, but left open the possibility that other changes might contribute as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karageorgi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Taste systems evaluate the nutrient content and toxicity of potential food sources, and gustation is crucial in the egg-laying decisions of a variety of insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joseph and Carlson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Montell, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scott, 2018</xref>). Some gustatory cues are thought to potentially influence <italic>D. suzukii</italic>’s behavior. <italic>D. suzukii</italic>’s egg-laying preference has been found to correlate with the phosphorus content of fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Olazcuaga et al., 2019</xref>), and the protein:carbohydrate ratio may be another cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silva-Soares et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Young et al., 2018</xref>). A recent study found a difference between <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> in egg-laying preference for high sucrose concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durkin et al., 2021</xref>). An extensive behavioral, electrophysiological, and molecular analysis of taste organs recently showed that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> sense bitter compounds differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dweck et al., 2021</xref>), inviting a comparable comparison of the sensation of other salient taste cues.</p><p>Here, we investigate the sensation of sugars in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and its contribution to the shift in egg-laying preference toward ripe fruit. Sugars are ubiquitous in fruits, are a major energy source for flies, and undergo changes in concentration during fruit ripening. As a fruit becomes increasingly overripe and its surface deteriorates, the accessibility of its sugars to a fly may also change. We provide evidence that a change in sugar sensation contributes to the difference in oviposition preference between <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. We show that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has a weaker egg-laying preference than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> for sweeter substrates, that a number of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> taste sensilla have lost electrophysiological responses to sugars, and that a number of sugar receptors are expressed at lower levels in the taste organs of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> than in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. We confirm earlier reports that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have different preferences for substrate stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durkin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karageorgi et al., 2017</xref>) and find that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has higher expression of the mechanosensory channel <italic>no mechanoreceptor potential C</italic> (<italic>nompC</italic>) in its taste organs. We investigate the integration of sugar and mechanosensory cues and find that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> respond differently to combinations of sweetness and stiffness in egg-laying behavior. Thus, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> differ in sweet sensation, mechanosensation, and their integration, all of which are likely to contribute to their natural preferences for ripe and overripe fruits, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Taste contributes to the difference in egg-laying preference between the two species</title><p>We first wanted to confirm that differences in the taste responses of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii</italic> contribute to their differences in egg-laying preference for ripe vs. overripe strawberry. We tested their preferences in a two-choice egg-laying paradigm in which the flies could lay eggs on purées of either ripe or overripe strawberry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To minimize visual cues, the assay was performed in the dark; to minimize mechanosensory cues, equivalent concentrations of agarose were added to each purée; to minimize olfactory cues, we surgically removed the olfactory organs—the antennae and maxillary palps—from the flies. Deprived of these other cues, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> showed a robust preference for the overripe purée, while <italic>D. suzukii</italic> did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Our findings are consistent with results found using a different egg-laying paradigm in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). The authors of that study speculated that the interaction between taste and mechanosensory input could provide a substrate for evolving different texture selectivity, a notion that can be addressed by testing <italic>D. suzukii</italic>.</p><p>We gave <italic>D. suzukii</italic> the same choices of stiffness and again found no preference in the presence of 100 mM sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). However, unlike <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, at lower sugar concentrations, a preference for the softer substrate did not emerge; in fact at the lowest concentration, the flies showed a preference for the harder substrate (p&lt;0.05).</p><p>These results concern the effect of sugar on the preference for stiffness. We next asked about the effect of stiffness on the preference for sugar. Specifically, we wondered if the dramatic differences between the two species in sugar preferences examined on hard substrates (1% agarose; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, shown again for convenience as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) would also be observed on softer substrates (0.5% agarose). They were not, in that the responses of the two species were indistinguishable in all but one case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>We then extended these results by choosing the most dramatic difference between the two species, the preference for 100 mM sucrose vs. 30 mM sucrose at 1% agarose, and asking how this preference changed when the sweeter substrate was also harder. In the case of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the preference for the sweeter substrate vanished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In the case of <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, the opposite result occurred: a preference for the sweeter substrate emerged. In other words, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> preferred the sweeter substrate unless it was harder. <italic>D. suzukii</italic> preferred the sweeter substrate only when it was harder.</p><p>Finally, we aimed to provide a choice between combinations of sweetness and stiffness that may more closely resemble the choice these species make in nature: between a soft overripe fruit that offers access to sugars and a hard ripe fruit whose surface limits access to sugars. Flies may have exposure to higher sugar concentrations in the exposed pulp of certain overripe fruits than on the exterior surface of certain intact, ripe fruits, where they are separated from the interior by a skin. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> showed a dramatically stronger preference for the softer, sweeter substrate than <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These results support the conclusion that response to the combination of sweetness and stiffness, along with responses to other sensory cues, contributes to the egg-laying preference shift of <italic>D. suzukii</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Differences in sugar sensation between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii</italic></title><p>We have found a constellation of behavioral, physiological, and molecular differences between sugar sensation in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, which lays eggs on ripe fruit, and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, which lays eggs on overripe fruit.

Differences between species were found for all three of the primary fruit sugars: sucrose, fructose, and glucose. Several concentration differences were assessed for each sugar. The selected concentrations were intended to simulate choices that the flies make in nature.</p><p>We acknowledge that it is difficult to determine with confidence the levels of sugars that flies encounter in their natural environment. Estimates vary with the fruit, the cultivar, and the ripening stage. Different studies have arrived at different conclusions about relative levels of sugar in ripe vs. overripe fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dudley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hidalgo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Littler et al., 2022</xref>). In any case, sugar concentrations are typically measured in entire, homogenized fruits. In the case of ripe strawberry, sucrose concentrations on the order of 20 mM to 60 mM have been estimated, with glucose and fructose likely ranging from 110 mM to 170 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paparozzi et al., 2018</xref>). These concentrations are within the dynamic range of taste neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hiroi et al., 2004</xref>). However, these interior concentrations are likely to exceed those on the exterior surface of ripe strawberries, which is separated from the interior by a skin.</p><p>Consistent with the reduced behavioral preferences, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> shows reduced physiological responses. In the case of sucrose, all S sensilla of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> show robust responses to a 100 mM concentration. By contrast, most S sensilla on the <italic>D. suzukii</italic> labellum show no response. Leg sensilla of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> responded to sucrose, but dose-response analysis of the f5s sensillum of the leg showed that the response was lower than in its <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> counterpart to higher concentrations of sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Fructose elicited no responses from any labellar sensilla in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> at a 100 mM concentration. By contrast, all L sensilla of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> responded. Responses of leg sensilla to fructose in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> were similar to those of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. We note that the contributions of sugar neurons in the leg have recently been shown to differ from those of the labellum in driving oviposition behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Glucose responses were similar between the two species. The weaker behavioral responses to glucose observed in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> could derive from weaker responses of untested taste neurons. Multiple taste organs, including the pharynx as well as the labellum and legs, contribute to oviposition behavior; sensory neurons of the ovipositor appear to play an important role as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joseph and Heberlein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). The weaker behavioral response to glucose in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> could also arise from differences in central processing of glucose signals. It will be interesting to determine if there are differences in the connectivity of taste circuits in the two species. Alternatively, taste projection neurons in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> could have a reduced dynamic range, saturate at lower levels of receptor neuron firing, and be less able to distinguish among higher sugar concentrations.</p><p>Consistent with the reduced physiological responses, the expression levels of sugar receptor genes were reduced in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. Particularly, striking was <italic>Gr64d</italic>, whose expression was undetectable in the <italic>D. suzukii</italic> leg and severely reduced in the labellum. Expression of two other sugar receptor genes was also reduced in both organs in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, as determined by RNAseq and confirmed by RT-qPCR. Four additional sugar receptor genes were found reduced in the <italic>D. suzukii</italic> labellum.

Particularly, striking was <italic>nompC,</italic> which was expressed at higher levels in both legs and labellum of <italic>D. suzukii. nompC</italic> is required for the detection of food texture in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2017</xref>). Perhaps its greater expression in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, which could produce either an increase in the number of cells expressing <italic>nompC</italic> or the number of channels per cell, either of which could in turn produce greater activation of a circuit that contributes to the preference of this species for greater stiffness. Sensory evaluation of stiffness, however, is complex: a study of oviposition preferences in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> showed a role for <italic>Tmc</italic> in the discrimination of subtle stiffness differences and <italic>Piezo</italic> in the discrimination of mild stiffness differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).

A comparative analysis of their regulatory regions in these and other species might, for example, reveal the loss or gain of enhancer activity in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. The history of the evolutionary changes we have found could be interesting. Of the three S sensilla that have retained sucrose response in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, two of them, S3 and S7, are distinct from other S sensilla in their bitter responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dweck et al., 2021</xref>); perhaps S3 and S7 develop via a program that is less vulnerable to the change that eliminated sucrose response in other S sensilla.</p><p>An important direction for future investigation will be to determine whether the oviposition and mechanosensory preferences of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> can be altered by increasing the expression of sugar receptors, decreasing the expression of mechanosensory receptors, or by manipulating the activity of the neurons in which they are expressed. We note that in addition to changes in levels and patterns of gene expression, sensory function may also evolve by virtue of changes in the primary sequence of receptors and channels, e.g., <italic>Ir75b</italic> in <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prieto-Godino et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Integration of sweet taste and mechanosensation in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii</italic></title><p>Having first examined sweet taste and mechanosensation separately, we then studied them together. We found that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> responds differently than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to combinations of sweetness and hardness. Among the principal findings were: (i) when sugar concentrations were progressively reduced, a preference for stiffness emerged in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, while a preference for softness emerged in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>); (ii) most of the differences in sugar preference that were observed between the two species at high stiffness were lost at lower stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>); (iii) in a test of sweet preference, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> preferred the sweeter substrate unless it was harder, whereas <italic>D. suzukii</italic> preferred the sweeter substrate only when it was harder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>); (iv) <italic>D. suzukii</italic> showed a dramatically lower preference than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> for substrates that are sweeter and softer, a combination chosen to represent the niche in which <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, but not <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, prefers to lay eggs.</p><p>The different responses of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to combinations of sweetness and hardness could have evolved via a variety of mechanisms. Recent studies in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have identified a number of different receptors, neurons, and mechanisms that may have undergone modification to promote evolutionary shifts in the preference of <italic>D. suzukii</italic>.</p><p>First, taste sensilla contain several neurons, most of which are gustatory but one of which is mechanosensory and expresses <italic>nompC</italic>, a gene required for texture discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2017</xref>). Activation of this mechanosensory neuron suppresses presynaptic calcium responses of sweet-sensing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeong et al., 2016</xref>). This mechanism could help explain our finding that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> showed no oviposition preference for 100 mM sucrose vs. 30 mM sucrose when the 100 mM sucrose substrate was much harder, that is, 1 vs. 0.25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). It is conceivable that activation of the mechanosensory neuron by the harder substrate suppressed the sugar neuron, effectively reducing the perceived sweetness and thereby the appeal of the harder substrate to <italic>D. melanogaster. D. suzukii</italic>, by contrast, preferred the sweeter substrate even when it was much harder.</p><p>Second, a study of egg-laying preferences in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> supported another mechanism of integration, in which activation of sugar neurons enhances the output of mechanosensitive neurons that express the TMC protein, inhibiting the discrimination of hardness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). This mechanism depends on TMC.</p><p>Third, besides the mechanosensory neurons located in sensilla, the labellum of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> also contains a pair of intriguing multidendritic neurons that innervate the base of many taste hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). These neurons are activated by force and orchestrate different feeding behaviors according to the intensity of the force. This pair of neurons also depends on the TMC protein.</p><p>It is striking that all three of these mechanisms seem likely to rely on the <italic>nompC</italic> or <italic>Tmc</italic> genes, both of which are upregulated in the taste system of <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, compared to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. It is conceivable that the upregulation of these genes contributes to the evolutionary plasticity of circuits that control egg-laying decisions in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>.</p><p>While all three of these mechanisms are based on peripheral neurons, there may also be modification of sensory integration in the CNS of <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. We note with interest the identification in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> of second-order sweet gustatory projection neurons whose presynaptic terminals map to the antennal mechanosensory and motor center in the brain, suggesting the integration of taste and mechanosensory signals at this level as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kain and Dahanukar, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In summary, combinations of sweetness and hardness are evaluated differently by the two species. There are a variety of mechanisms that could contribute to this difference, and further studies will be required to delineate whether particular mechanisms have been modified to promote the exploitation of a new niche by <italic>D. suzukii</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Evolution of the taste system in the oviposition shift of <italic>D. suzukii</italic></title><p>In a recent study, we found that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has lost behavioral response to bitter compounds, has lost 20% of the bitter-responding sensilla from the labellum, and has reduced expression of certain bitter-sensitive Gr receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dweck et al., 2021</xref>). A simple interpretation of the loss of bitter response in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> was that it reduced detection of deterrent bitter compounds in ripe fruit, contributing to a shift toward oviposition on them. In the present study, we have shown that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> also has a reduced behavioral response to sugars, a loss of physiological responses to sugars, and reduced expression of receptors for sugars, relative to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p><p>The reduction in both bitter and sugar responses is consistent with an even simpler interpretation that many of the taste cues that guide the egg-laying decisions of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are less salient to <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, as if <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is more reliant on gustatory information in selecting egg-laying sites. Whereas <italic>D. suzukii</italic> lays eggs in ripe, intact fruits, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lays eggs on fruits that vary widely in their degree of decomposition and microbial growth. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> thus encounters an immense variety of nutrients and toxins while searching for egg-laying sites, and gustation may be critical in evaluating their enormous chemical complexity. There may be great selective pressure on the taste system of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to interpret their chemical composition and help distinguish those sites that are most conducive to the survival of offspring.</p><p>Consistent with this interpretation, when olfactory, mechanosensory, and visual input were eliminated, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> showed a stronger egg-laying preference for overripe vs. ripe strawberry purée than <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; note that we expect a ripe purée to contain more sugar than the skin of a ripe fruit, and thus, the preference for overripe fruit may be greater in the field than in this experiment for both fly species). These results support the interpretation that taste cues drive circuits that play a major role in activating egg-laying behavior in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> but that this role has been diminished in the evolution of <italic>D. suzukii</italic>.</p><p>In animal evolution, there are interesting examples of the gain of sweet taste, as in hummingbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldwin et al., 2014</xref>), and of the loss of sweet taste, as in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Sweet taste has been diminished in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> compared to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> with respect to the parameters considered in this study, but it has certainly not been eliminated: a number of its sensilla show sugar responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and <italic>D. suzukii</italic> prefers to lay eggs on 100 mM concentrations vs. 0 mM concentrations of all three sugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). However, when the choices were less extreme, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> did not show a preference, as if it were satisfied with a low concentration and did not distinguish between concentrations above a certain threshold.</p><p>There may be selective pressure to retain some degree of sweet taste in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> for several purposes. First, sweet taste may help flies distinguish between ripe fruits and underripe fruits, which may have even less sugar on their skins than ripe fruits. Second, sweet taste may inform other kinds of decisions, including feeding decisions. Sugars are nutritious, and <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, like other flies, needs energy sources.</p><p>Our data are also consistent with more complex models for the role of sugar sensation in the shift of oviposition preference in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. We have directly examined the electrophysiology and receptor gene expression of peripheral taste organs but not of taste projection neurons or any other neurons in the taste circuit. It is entirely plausible that the primary sensory representation of sugars is transformed in different ways at higher levels in the circuitry of the two species. Our study lays a foundation for further research into the role of sugar sensation in the adaptation of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to its niche.</p><p>In a larger sense, the oviposition decisions of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> are likely driven by a wide variety of cues detected by multiple sensory modalities. Much remains to be learned about the identity and concentration of these cues, as well as about the receptors, neurons, and circuits by which they drive egg laying. Further research into the egg-laying shift of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> may provide insight into mechanisms of sensory system evolution and at the same time have translational implications. Cues that attract <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and promote egg laying could be incorporated into decoys that might contribute to efforts to relieve the burden of this invasive pest on global fruit production.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks</title><p>Flies were reared on standard cornmeal-agar medium (Archon Scientific) at 25°C and 60% relative humidity in a 12:12 hr light-dark cycle. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Canton-S (CS) flies were used for electrophysiological recordings and behavioral assays.

Residual phenol was removed with chloroform. RNA was then precipitated with isopropanol. Libraries were prepared using KAPA mRNA HyperPrep Kit (Kapa Biosystems) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 or NovaSeq sequencers by the Yale Center for Genome Analysis. Four biological replicates were produced for each species. 30–60 million 75 bp or 100 bp paired-end reads were obtained per sample.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that the paper was exciting and of potential interest to sensory neuroscientists and evolutionary biologists. Several interesting adaptations were observed in D. Suzuki which could account for behavioral differences in this species. However, it remains unclear whether molecular/physiological changes account for observed behavioral effects. After discussion a couple of additional experiments highlighted below would strengthen links across the paper, and reviewer comments are also pasted in full.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please note experiments to explore functional changes in mechanoreceptors as detailed by reviewer #3.</p><p>2) See control related to olfactory organ removal of Reviewer #2, comment 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a nice, descriptive, and clearly written study which describes behavioral changes in D. Suzuki, and provides possible underlying mechanisms related to changes in receptor expression levels and electrophysiological responses. A major limitation is that causative manipulations are lacking- are the molecular changes observed sufficient to explain the behavioral shift? I realize the challenge of performing manipulation experiments in D. Suzuki, but without such experiments the paper is fairly speculative. There are alternative explanations which are discussed but not investigated- such as changes in sweet-responsive neural circuits that could account for behavioral differences, or receptor mutations that could account for electrophysiological/behavioral differences.</p><p>In addition to these salient issues, there are a few smaller improvements that could tighten the paper.</p><p>- Do changes in receptor expression account for altered electrophysiological responses? For example, is expression of a fructose receptor lost from L sensilla, or sucrose receptors from particular S sensilla? The persistent glucose responses would seem to indicate that another (perhaps more central as mentioned) adaptation is at play.</p><p>- The authors observe identical electrophysiological responses in leg sensilla (Figure 3), despite altered receptor expression (Figure 4). This would seem to call the importance of receptor expression level differences into question, but this should at least be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an interesting and well-executed study. I only have a few suggestions for improvement.</p><p>1) Figure 1B: With their olfactory organs removed, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> prefer laying eggs on overripe fruit puree, while D. suzukii lay similar numbers of eggs on both the ripe and overripe substrates. Is this indifference by D. suzukii due to the removal of the olfactory organs? Would intact D. suzukii prefer the ripe option? It would be helpful to establish some condition in which D. suzukii prefers the ripe puree over the overripe puree.</p><p>2) Another mechanosensory channel expressed in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> labellum is tmem63. Was this gene detected in the transcriptome analyses?</p><p>3) Supp. Figure 1: Add a legend to the figure for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (orange) and D. suzukii (blue).</p><p>4) The Discussion wanders a bit. The presentation would be improved by the addition of subheadings.</p><p>5) It is noteworthy that the sugar sensitivity of the labellar but not the leg sensilla are reduced in D. suzukii.

We have addressed the comments as detailed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a nice, descriptive, and clearly written study which describes behavioral changes in D. Suzuki, and provides possible underlying mechanisms related to changes in receptor expression levels and electrophysiological responses. A major limitation is that causative manipulations are lacking- are the molecular changes observed sufficient to explain the behavioral shift? I realize the challenge of performing manipulation experiments in D. Suzuki, but without such experiments the paper is fairly speculative. There are alternative explanations which are discussed but not investigated- such as changes in sweet-responsive neural circuits that could account for behavioral differences, or receptor mutations that could account for electrophysiological/behavioral differences.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asks an important question: &quot;are the molecular changes observed sufficient to explain the behavioral shift?&quot; Since, as the reviewer notes, it's challenging to address this question in <italic>D. suzukii,</italic> we made it a high priority to address it in <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> We found that a reduction in the expression of Gr sugar receptors, via genetic deletion, caused a shift in the preference of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> from overripe toward ripe fruit (Figure 1C). We feel that this result provides strong support for the notion that reduction in the expression of Gr sugar receptors could likewise contribute to a shift in preference toward ripe fruit in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>.</p><p>We note that there are a number of other examples in which loss of Gr expression causes a shift in behavioral preferences of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<italic>e.g.</italic> Dahanukar <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>Nat. Neurosci.</italic> 2001; Dweck <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>eLife</italic> 2021).</p><p>We do not claim that these molecular changes account entirely for the behavioral shift. In fact, we believe that a variety of changes at different levels of organization, ranging from the structure of the receptors to the organizations of neural circuits, are all likely to contribute to the evolutionary shift in preference.</p><p>We have added to the Discussion the following statement: &quot;An important direction for future investigation will be to determine whether the oviposition and mechanosensory preferences of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> can be altered by increasing the expression of sugar receptors, decreasing the expression of mechanosensory receptors, or by manipulating the activity of the neurons in which they are expressed.&quot;</p><p>We hope that when genetic manipulation of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> becomes more convenient that our study will provide a strong foundation for investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to these salient issues, there are a few smaller improvements that could tighten the paper.</p><p>- Do changes in receptor expression account for altered electrophysiological responses? For example, is expression of a fructose receptor lost from L sensilla, or sucrose receptors from particular S sensilla? The persistent glucose responses would seem to indicate that another (perhaps more central as mentioned) adaptation is at play.</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> there is ample precedent for losses of particular receptors that cause losses of electrophysiological response in particular sensilla (<italic>e.g.</italic> Dweck <italic>et al., Current Biology</italic> 2000; Dahanukar <italic>et al., Nat. Neurosci. 2001</italic>).</p><p>In <italic>D. suzukii,</italic> it is difficult to attribute losses of electrophysiological responses to reductions in specific receptors. We do not have a receptor-to-sensillum map in this species, so we do not know which receptors are lost from which sensilla.</p><p>We hope that our results will contribute to efforts to understand taste coding and its evolution in flies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors observe identical electrophysiological responses in leg sensilla (Figure 3), despite altered receptor expression (Figure 4). This would seem to call the importance of receptor expression level differences into question, but this should at least be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The electrophysiological responses to 100 mM concentrations of sucrose, fructose and glucose in the legs of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> look similar to those of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> in Figure 3M,N,O; however, they are not identical. For example, the dose-response curve in Figure 3—figure supplement 1E shows that the response of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to sucrose is in fact lower at 60 mM and 100 mM concentrations. We have added a statement to the Discussion clarifying this point: &quot;Leg sensilla of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> responded to sucrose, but dose-response analysis of the f5s sensillum of the leg showed that the response was lower than in its <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> counterpart to higher concentrations of sucrose (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E).&quot;</p><p>In a more general sense, some of the spike rates in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> might be higher, and perhaps elicit a different behavioral preference, if <italic>Gr64a, Gr64d,</italic> and <italic>Gr64e</italic> were expressed at the same level as they are in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an interesting and well-executed study. I only have a few suggestions for improvement.</p><p>1) Figure 1B: With their olfactory organs removed, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> prefer laying eggs on overripe fruit puree, while <italic>D. suzukii</italic> lay similar numbers of eggs on both the ripe and overripe substrates. Is this indifference by <italic>D. suzukii</italic> due to the removal of the olfactory organs? Would intact <italic>D. suzukii</italic> prefer the ripe option? It would be helpful to establish some condition in which D. suzukii prefers the ripe puree over the overripe puree.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new results showing that intact <italic>D. suzukii</italic> with olfactory organs prefer the ripe option, in two different assays, with two different sources of strawberry, and with strawberries in two different states of intactness (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We note that it is difficult to examine the role of olfaction in a third assay, the single-fly oviposition assay used in Figure 1, because olfactory cues are expected to equilibrate in the small volume of a Petri dish over the long course (48h) of the assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another mechanosensory channel expressed in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> labellum is tmem63.

Yes, <italic>tmem63</italic> is detected in both leg and labellar transcriptomes, and in fact is expressed at higher levels in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> in both cases. We've now added <italic>tmem63</italic> to Figures 6C and D, and have added mention of it to the text. We've also changed &quot;CG11210&quot; to &quot;tmem63&quot; in the Supplementary Files.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Supp. Figure 1: Add a legend to the figure for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (orange) and D. suzukii (blue).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks; we've now fixed this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Discussion wanders a bit.

We think this phenotype is informative and have included the egg numbers in such cases:</p><p>i) In Figure 5B, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> laid fewer eggs than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> in the experiment with trehalose. This result suggests that trehalose is a less potent egg-laying stimulus for <italic>D. suzukii</italic> than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Both the difference in oviposition preference and the difference in number of eggs laid between the two species could potentially result from the lower expression of <italic>Gr5a</italic> in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>.</p><p>ii) In Figure 6A, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> laid the fewest eggs on the softest substrate, whereas <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> laid the fewest eggs on the hardest substrate. These results as well as the results of the two-choice preference assay (Figure 6B) likely reflect the opposing preferences of these two species for substrate hardness. In all other cases, we did not observe differences between <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> in numbers of eggs laid.</p><p>We note that in Figure 1C, the <italic>D. melanogaster Gr</italic> octuple sugar mutant without olfactory organs laid fewer eggs than the control.

We have previously shown (Dweck <italic>et al., eLife</italic> 2021, Figure 2) that the oviposition preference for overripe strawberry purée depends on bitter reception, and we imagine that other taste cues play an important role as well.</p><p>The single remaining <italic>Gr</italic> is <italic>Gr43a,</italic> which detects fructose. We tested the octuple sugar mutant in the single-fly egg-laying preference and found that it laid very few eggs (&lt;3 eggs/plate) when given a choice of either 100 mM fructose vs plain medium or 100 mM sucrose vs plain medium. These results suggest that this single remaining sugar <italic>Gr</italic> is not sufficient to drive egg laying on sugar-containing substrates.</p><p>We carefully removed both antennae and maxillary palps of flies, discarding those in which even a small part of an antenna or maxillary palp remained; thus we think olfactory function was completely ablated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It's likely that changes at multiple levels of sensory processing mediate the altered substrate preferences but it would be useful to directly test the role of expression levels of mechanosensors in mediating stiffness preference.

The key experiment is whether reduction in the level of nompC in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> reduces its preference for stiff substrates. Constructing the strains to address this problem rigorously, however, is difficult. We agree with the reviewer's suggestion that this project is outside the scope of this study.</p><p>We have added to the Discussion a statement that an increase in nompC expression &quot;could produce either an increase in the number of cells expressing <italic>nompC</italic> or the number of channels per cell, either of which could in turn produce greater activation of a circuit that contributes to the preference of this species for hardness&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show that sugar-sensing Grs show similar response properties in Supplemental Figure 2.
