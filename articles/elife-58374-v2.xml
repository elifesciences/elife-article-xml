marker that is normally silenced prior to birth. High <italic>SOX11</italic> levels in breast tumours are significantly associated with distant metastasis and poor outcome in breast cancer patients. Here, we show that SOX11 confers distinct features to ER-negative DCIS.com breast cancer cells, leading to populations enriched with highly plastic hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal cells, which display invasive features and alterations in metastatic tropism when xenografted into mice. We found that SOX11+DCIS tumour cells metastasize to brain and bone at greater frequency and to lungs at lower frequency compared to cells with lower SOX11 levels. High levels of SOX11 leads to the expression of markers associated with mesenchymal state and embryonic cellular phenotypes. Our results suggest that SOX11 may be a potential biomarker for breast tumours with elevated risk of developing metastases and may require more aggressive therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SOX11</kwd><kwd>DCIS</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>MEX3A</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009794</institution-id><institution>Breast Cancer Now</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme Funding to the Breast Cancer Now Toby Robins Research Centre</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oliemuller</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsang</surname><given-names>Siu Man</given-names></name><name><surname>Muirhead</surname><given-names>Gareth</given-names></name><name><surname>Noor</surname><given-names>Farzana</given-names></name><name><surname>Haider</surname><given-names>Syed</given-names></name><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>Beatrice A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRUK: A21855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Foo</surname><given-names>Shane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Spanish Ministry of Education and Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2017-84934-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vivanco</surname><given-names>Maria dM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Government of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Trade</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KK-2018/00054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aurrekoetxea-Rodríguez</surname><given-names>Iskander</given-names></name><name><surname>Vivanco</surname><given-names>Maria dM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SOX11+ breast tumours display reactivated embryonic developmental signalling and organogenetic features and are at elevated risk of developing metastases, so may benefit from more aggressive therapies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SOX11 is an embryonic mammary factor that is not expressed in normal breast epithelial cells after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wansbury et al., 2011</xref>). However, <italic>SOX11</italic> is expressed in many triple negative and HER2+ invasive breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wansbury et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>SOX11</italic> expression in invasive breast cancer is associated with increased distant metastasis formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliemuller et al., 2017</xref>). Inhibition of <italic>SOX11</italic> by siRNA suppressed growth and proliferation of ER- breast cancer cell lines, but had no significant effect on growth and proliferation of ER+ breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shepherd et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>SOX11</italic> repression using siRNA reduced both cell migration and invasion in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cell lines, supporting a role for SOX11 in promoting breast cancer progression. In addition, <italic>SOX11</italic> inhibition in MDA-MB-468, a BLBC line, resulted in reduced expression of <italic>FOXC1</italic>, <italic>CCNE1</italic>, <italic>KRT14</italic>, <italic>MIA and SFRP1</italic>, all of which are PAM50 genes that are highly expressed in BLBC. This finding suggests SOX11 may modulate key features of basal-like cancer cells, including Keratin 14 expression, a marker expressed by basal cells and some luminal cells within the terminal ductal lobular unit, where many breast cancers arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gusterson and Eaves, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our previous studies showed that when constitutively expressed by the human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A, SOX11 increased the number of basal/myoepithelial clones formed in standard colony-formation assays and led to increased mammosphere formation, suggesting that SOX11 can modulate mammary progenitor features and stem cell activity when expressed in mature postnatal mammary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliemuller et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, we also showed that SOX11 promotes invasive transition of DCIS.com cells that were injected into the mammary duct to mimic formation of DCIS-like lesions within the mammary duct prior to progression to invasive state and tumour formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliemuller et al., 2017</xref>). Expression of SOX11 in preinvasive breast lesions and potential sites of microinvasion in samples from DCIS cases supports a role for SOX11 in promoting in situ to invasive breast carcinoma transition. These findings led us to hypothesise that reactivation of embryonic mammary developmental programmes mediated by SOX11 in postnatal breast epithelial cells would promote invasive progression of pre-invasive DCIS breast lesions and acquisition of features associated with poor patient outcome, including formation of distant metastasis.</p><p>Therefore, to further explore the role of SOX11 in regulating cancer stem cell (CSC) states and to determine whether SOX11 promotes metastatic dissemination of invasive breast cancer cells, we have created an inducible model to study the roles of SOX11 in progenitor/stem cell regulation and breast cancer progression in vitro and in vivo. In the model described here, SOX11 is expressed at higher levels in DCIS.com cells driven from the EF1A promoter after induction with doxycycline (DOX), when compared to another model we have previously used to study DCIS progression, in which low levels of SOX11 expression is constitutively driven by the CMV promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliemuller et al., 2017</xref>). In the inducible model presented here, SOX11 expression confers epithelial/mesenchymal hybrid state, features typical of embryonic mammary cell phenotypes, and influences organ-specific metastatic tropism to breast cancer cells. Finally, we also identify several novel SOX11 targets, many of which are highly correlated with <italic>SOX11</italic> expression in primary breast cancers and breast cancer metastases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inducible expression of SOX11 leads to changes in stem cell profiles of DCIS.com cells</title><p>To investigate the role of SOX11 in breast cancer progression, we used the pINDUCER21 system to stably transduce DCIS.com cells, an invasive cell line from the MCF10A breast cancer progression series, so that SOX11 was expressed only when induced with Doxycycline (DOX) (referred to as iSOX11 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>).

CSCs are subpopulations of cancer cells sharing similar characteristics as normal stem or progenitor cells such as self-renewal ability and multi-lineage differentiation to drive tumour growth and heterogeneity. ALDH1 and CD24 are widely used CSC markers in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). A higher proportion of CD24+ and ALDH+ cells are detected in iSOX11 cells compared to control iEV cells (DCIS.com cells stably transduced with pINDUCER21 empty vector and induced with DOX) by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). Moreover, CD24 expression levels were significantly increased in a DOX dose-dependent manner in iSOX11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). CD24 is predominantly located in the membrane and CD24 was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction of both iEV and iSOX11 cells, and also detected in the nuclear fraction of iSOX11 cells, which has been previously reported in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duex et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>When cells were grown on collagen, we detected loss of membranous E-Cadherin localisation and acquisition of N-Cadherin expression in iSOX11 cells and formation of bud-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>). Nuclear expression of N-Cadherin has been reported previously, primarily in poorly differentiated breast tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rezaei et al., 2012</xref>). We also detected a significant increase in iSOX11 cells expressing Vimentin by western blotting; increased Vimentin was detected in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction. Vimentin was not observed in the nucleus of cells grown in the same conditions when stained by immunofluorescence, suggesting that the nuclear fraction contains proteins attached to the external part of the nuclear envelope since both Lamin B and Vimentin are known to associate with the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Georgatos and Blobel, 1987a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Georgatos and Blobel, 1987b</xref>). We assessed the expression of markers associated with mammary epithelial and mesenchymal states in iEV and iSOX11 as well as non-induced (denoted ni) niEV and niSOX11 DCIS cells. K5, K8, and VIM levels are elevated in iSOX11 cells compared to iEV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

We detected significant increases in expression of both luminal (K8) and basal (K14, SMA) lineage markers in SOX11-expressing spheroids as well as a significant increase in cells co-expressing markers of both lineages, which is suggestive of embryonic mammary phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DCIS cells expressing SOX11 grow more slowly and form more invasive spheroids</title><p>Reduced cell growth was detected in iSOX11 cells compared to control iEV cells grown in both 2D or as spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>).

To explore whether sustained reactivation of SOX11 promotes tumour progression, we assessed features of iSOX11 spheroids. Spheroids formed from iSOX11 DCIS cells were smaller and formed a higher number of peripheral microspheres than iEV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When overlaid with Collagen I, spheroids formed from iSOX11 cells are more invasive compared to iEV, niEV, and niSOX11 control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Tumours that formed after mammary fat pad xenografts of iSOX11 cells were smaller than iEV tumours when mice were fed chow with moderate levels (200 or 625 ppm) of DOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). Despite their smaller volume, tumours originated from cells with high SOX11 levels displayed greater bioluminescence than control tumours, suggesting iSOX11 tumours contained more viable cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). IHC staining of mammary tumours was performed to detect Cleaved Caspase 3 (CC3). Larger necrotic and CC3+ (apoptotic) areas were observed in the EV tumour tumours and niSOX11 tumours when compared to the iSOX11 tumours, which showed little central necrosis and fewer CC3+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). We also observed that extremely small and less luminescent tumours were formed in mice xenografted with iSOX11 cells, compared to control cells that were fed higher levels (1250 or 2000 ppm) of DOX-chow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Higher levels of CC3 were detected in these iEV tumours, which displayed central necrosis, whilst almost no CC3 or necrosis was detected in iSOX11 tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Tumours formed from iSOX11 DCIS cells grew out quickly when (1250 or 2000 ppm) DOX-chow was replaced with normal chow, suggesting that high levels of SOX11 could keep tumours in a non-proliferative state and that upon DOX withdrawal, proliferation resumed and the ostensible quiescent state is a reversible condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>When injected directly into the mammary duct, iSOX11 DCIS cells formed slightly larger tumours, with similar bioluminescence levels as iEV tumours, which indicates the microenvironment highly influences behaviour of SOX11+ tumour cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–K</xref>). A greater proportion of mammary tumours formed from iSOX11 cells expressed moderate to high levels of ALDH1 (6/6) compared to control tumours (1/8). In addition, CD24+ cells were observed at greater frequency in iSOX11 tumours compared to control tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Of note, we observed nuclear CD24 staining in iSOX11 tumour cells, but not in iEV, niEV, or niSOX11 tumours, in line with the observed in vitro result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

CDH2 is a predictive biomarker for distant metastasis in early-stage breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleskandarany et al., 2015</xref>), that is commonly detected in breast cancer cells and provides a mechanism for transendothelial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qi et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Micrometastasis to brain is detected in ~30% of mice within 1 month of xenografting DCIS cells induced to express high levels of SOX11. <italic>SOX11</italic> is amplified and overexpressed in ~30% of brain metastases in a recent study of a small cohort of breast cancer patients that were profiled using an integrated genomic and transcriptomic analysis of fresh frozen tumour samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saunus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saunus et al., 2015</xref>) and highly expressed by ~30% of BCBM in another independent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varešlija et al., 2019</xref>). Our finding that iSOX11 mammary tumours spontaneously metastasize to the brain is clinically relevant.</p><p>We have identified a number of genes that are regulated by SOX11 in our mouse models of breast cancer that are also associated with SOX11 expression in both primary breast cancer and breast cancer brain metastasis. A number of these, such as <italic>TUBB3</italic>, encode targetable molecules that are being used in novel pharmacogenetic approaches in combination with other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karki et al., 2013</xref>). Others, such as MEX3A, may provide novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bufalieri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). MEX3A controls the polarity and stemness and affects the cell cycle of intestinal epithelial cells through the downregulation of the mRNA encoding the CDX2 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pereira et al., 2013</xref>) and, in addition, exhibits a transforming activity when overexpressed in gastric epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>). The intestine has a reservoir of quiescent stem cells that are resistant to chemotherapy that are marked by Mex3a and are multipotent so have the capacity to produce any kind of intestinal cell and contribute to tumour heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barriga et al., 2017</xref>). MEX3A may mark a rare mammary stem cell in the human breast that could escape traditional chemotherapy treatments, but this remains to be demonstrated.</p><p>The analysis of co-occurrence of <italic>SOX11</italic> with <italic>MEX3A</italic> and <italic>TUBB3</italic> in breast cancers profiled in TCGA suggests that <italic>MEX3A</italic> is expressed predominantly in samples with higher levels of <italic>SOX11</italic>. The differences in cell growth observed both in vitro and in vivo with increasing levels of SOX11 suggest a dose-dependent regulation of SOX11 downstream targets and/or a possible post-translational modification. Also, the discrepancies between the tumour size observed after xenografting iSOX11 cells via the mammary fat pad model and the MIND model, as well as the finding that EGF can decrease MEX3A levels, suggest an influence of microenvironmental factors on SOX11 tumour cell behaviour. This is in agreement with differential expression of <italic>TUBB3</italic> and <italic>MEX3A</italic>, depending if DCIS-SOX11 cells were xenografted in the mammary fat pad or via MIND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliemuller et al., 2017</xref>). Together, this data suggests it may be necessary to classify SOX11+ tumours, depending on SOX11 expression level, as well as the expression of its effectors in order to stratify breast cancer patients. The subcellular localisation of SOX11 can be informative for cancer classification since high SOX11 mRNA levels and detection of the nuclear protein are reliable markers of mantle cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mozos et al., 2009</xref>). During neurogenesis, SOX11 is detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balta et al., 2018</xref>). Phosphorylation of specific serine residues can modulate SOX11 subcellular localisation and prevent its nuclear localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balta et al., 2018</xref>). We have not determined whether SOX11 localises to the cytoplasm, as well as the nucleus, in breast cancer case samples, and if SOX11 localisation could be useful for classification of breast cancers.</p><p>SOX11+ breast cancer cells express markers indicative of phenotypic plasticity and have a high tendency to undergo metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O'Brien-Ball and Biddle, 2017</xref>). Together, these data suggest that patients whose DCIS and primary breast cancers express high levels of <italic>SOX11</italic> are among a high-risk metastasis subgroup that should be considered for aggressive therapies in neo-adjuvant settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

The next day, media was replaced with fresh media.</p><p>Flow cytometry analyses and fluorescence‐activated cell sorting (FACS) Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity was measured with the Aldefluor assay (StemCell Technologies, Cambridge, UK) as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliemuller et al., 2017</xref>). Cells were also co‐stained with Aldefluor and anti‐CD24–PE–Cy7 (561646) (1:100) and anti‐CD44–APC (559942) (1:20) (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). A BD FACS LSRII flow cytometer was used and samples were analysed with BD FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences). mCherry+ DCIS cells from the tumours in the tail vein xenograft experiments were sorted by a FACSAriaIII (BD). FACSAriaIII was used for clonogenic and mammosphere assays that required plating single cells per well. Living and dead cells were distinguished with DAPI 1:5000. Cell cycle analysis was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zvelebil et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>PKH staining</title><p>two × 10<sup>−6</sup> DCIS-LacZ or DCIS-SOX11 cells were resuspended in Diluent C and stained with PKH26 Dye Solution to a final concentration of 5 mM following the manufacturer’s protocol (MINI26, Sigma). After confirming by flow cytometry that the 100% of the population stained, spheres with 5000 cells were formed in ultra-low attachment 96-well plates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Animal experiments</title><p>All animal work was carried out under UK Home Office project and personal licenses following local ethical approval from The Institute of Cancer Research Ethics Committee and in accordance with local and national guidelines. For xenograft tumour assays, DCIS.com labelled with Luc2-mCherry and stably transduced with empty vector (EV) control or SOX11 (in pInducer21 backbone) were resuspended in PBS for implantation into female NSG-Foxn1<sup>null</sup> mice. 1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/site in both sides were injected in each mammary fat pad number 4 and 2.0 × 104 cells/site into the mammary duct via the nipple of mammary gland number four as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliemuller et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Intracranial injections were performed using a stereotaxic frame by injecting 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> cells (Stoelting, Wood Lane, IL, USA) into the striatum (2 mm right from the midline, 2 mm anterior from bregma, 3 mm deep). Six NSG-Foxn1null mice were used per for each condition.</p><p>For tail vein injections, the mice were placed into a hot box set at 38°C for up to 5 min, to dilate the tail veins. The mice were then placed into a restrainer, the lateral tail vein identified, and 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were slowly infused (over 30 s) through the tail vein using a venoflux 25 g butterfly needle. Before treatment, mice used were randomised in groups based on their weight.</p><p>For the doxycycline induction experiments using iSOX11 or iEV, a week before the injections, the animals injected with transduced cells were separated into two cohorts and maintained with or without chow containing doxycycline (0.2 g/kg, 0.625, 1.250 or 2.0 g/kg from Envigo) for the duration of the experiment.</p><p>For in vivo imaging, mice were injected with 200 μl of luciferin (XenoLight D-Luciferin Potassium Salt, Perkin Elmer, 30 mg/mL). After 5 min, the mice were anaesthetised with isoflurane and the bioluminescence was measured at least at three different time points on an IVIS Lumina imaging systems (Perkin-Elmer). For ex vivo imaging, the organs were resected and imaged for 3 min to detect any signal. In the analysis, identical square regions of interest (ROI) were drawn around tumours to measure total and average bioluminescence signal.</p><p>Tumour dissociation iSOX11 or iEV cells from brain, bone and lung metastasis were isolated with a cell dissociation kit following the manufacturer instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and using the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator with Heaters and its 37°C_h_TDK_3 protocol. To select human cells and discard murine cells, the result of this dissociation was FACS sorted in a FACSAriaIII and mCherry+ cells were selected and grown in normal DCIS media.</p><p>RNA sequencing cDNA library preparation was carried out at Oxford Genomics Centre, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics using PolyA+ RNA enrichment method for total RNA from cultured cells. mRNA fraction was selected from the total RNA before conversion to cDNA. Second strand cDNA synthesis incorporated dUTP. The cDNA was end-repaired, A-tailed and adapter-ligated. Prior to amplification, samples underwent uridine digestion. The prepared libraries were size selected, multiplexed and quality checked before paired end sequencing over four lanes of a flow cell.</p><p>Sequence files were trimmed by the use of trim_galore (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/</ext-link>) with default settings. Trimmed data were separately mapped to the GRCh38 and GRCm38 genome assemblies by the use of hisat2 (v2.0.5) with options ‐‐sp 1000,1000 ‐‐ omixed‐‐no‐discordant, and were filtered to remove non‐primary alignments. Species‐specific read sets were generated by removing any read that produced a valid alignment in both human and mouse from the results for both species. The remaining data were imported into SeqMonk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/</ext-link>) with a filter of mapping quality (MAPQ) score ≥20. Reads were quantified over the transcript set from Ensembl v78 with annotated mis‐spliced, pseudogene and unannotated transcripts removed. Initial quantification was raw read counts from the opposing strand to the transcript, with all exons for each gene being collated into a single measure. This allowed gene‐level differential expression to be assessed by the use of DESeq2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html">https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html</ext-link>), with a cutoff of a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>The current work builds on previous work by these authors identifying a role for <italic>SOX11</italic> in promoting invasive and metastatic properties to breast epithelial cells.

The authors thoroughly dissect a <italic>Sox11</italic>, <italic>TUBB3</italic> and <italic>Mex3A</italic> pathway and demonstrate control by these genes of breast cancer cell phenotype, proliferation and most importantly metastatic behavior and tropism. They trace this regulatory pathway in a scholarly fashion by upregulating and downregulating expression of these genes in DCIS.com a relevant breast cancer cell line to show that Sox 11 enhances breast cancer cell quiescence and viability, augments expression of both basal and luminal keratins as well as mesenchymal factors vimentin and N-cadherin and reduces and alters localization of epithelial adhesion molecules, E-cadherin and EpCam. This manuscript clarifies the mechanism behind <italic>SOX11</italic> association with brain and bone metastatic tropism and consequent poor outcome in humans. I believe the paper is acceptable as is and will be of interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58374.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Controls are lacking or inappropriate in some figures and need to be amended – for example, please justify the use of the pooled control lines in Figure 3, provide blots for SOX11 in all control lines, provide a blot for TUBB3 knockdown etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the controls used comparison in the legend for Figure 3.

We decided to make the inducible model since the previous constitutive CMV-driven <italic>SOX11</italic> was expressed at very low levels and was not detected at the levels we observed in DCIS case samples (Oliemuller, 2017). Staining with <italic>SOX11</italic> by IHC shows comparable expression levels in the <italic>iSOX11</italic> mouse tumours (Figure 2—figure supplement 4) and in both pure DCIS and mixed cases samples (Figure 1C) where predominantly nuclear <italic>SOX11</italic> is detected. In neither case, is cytoplasmic <italic>SOX11</italic> staining obvious. The staining of <italic>iSOX11</italic> cells by IF with <italic>SOX11</italic> (Figure 1B) shows predominantly nuclear staining and very little is detected in the cytoplasm. In addition, our analysis of <italic>SOX11</italic> expression levels in breast cancers shows that some clinical samples express very high levels of <italic>SOX11</italic> whilst others express lower levels of <italic>SOX11,</italic> in line with our two models.

CD24 has indeed been reported by many groups to be low in breast CSCs in past studies. It has recently been suggested that breast cancers that have been classified as CD24 low by FACs may have nuclear CD24 localisation (see Deux citation in the Results). It is clear that CD24+ breast cancer cells have a role in breast cancer and present treatment opportunities based on immunotherapy (see Barkal citation). The role of CD24 as a cancer stem cell marker is not entirely clear in our study so we have downplayed the CSC section, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The work on EMT genes seems to form a separate stream of work.

RNA sequencing was performed (see Supplementary file 1 and Figure 3). In the Results, we have added that RNA-sequencing detected significant upregulation of <italic>CDH2</italic> (<italic>N-CADHERIN</italic>) in both 2D and 3D conditions. Gene expression analysis by RNA sequencing of cells grown in 2D and 3D as spheroids did not detect significant changes in <italic>CDH1</italic> (E-Cadherin) or <italic>VIM (Vimentin)</italic> levels. Until robust markers of quiescence are established, and other experimental data are performed, it will not be clear if quiescence, senescence or other process such as dormancy are involved. We have stated this in the Discussion: <italic>MEX3A</italic> may mark a rare mammary stem cell in the human breast that could escape traditional chemotherapy treatments, but this remains to be demonstrated.</p></body></sub-article></article>
