Although active centromeric transcription has been documented for over a decade, the role of centromeric transcription or transcripts has been elusive. Here, we report that centromeric α-satellite transcription is dependent on RNA Polymerase II and occurs at late mitosis into early G1, concurrent with the timing of new CENP-A assembly. Inhibition of RNA Polymerase II-dependent transcription abrogates the recruitment of CENP-A and its chaperone HJURP to native human centromeres. Biochemical characterization of CENP-A associated RNAs reveals a 1.3 kb molecule that originates from centromeres, which physically interacts with the soluble pre-assembly HJURP/CENP-A complex in vivo, and whose down-regulation leads to the loss of CENP-A and HJURP at centromeres. This study describes a novel function for human centromeric long non-coding RNAs in the recruitment of HJURP and CENP-A, implicating RNA-based chaperone targeting in histone variant assembly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03254.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03254.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03254.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Before a cell divides, it copies its chromosomes. Initially, the two copies of each chromosome remain linked via their centromeres. These regions also serve as the attachment sites for the proteins that pull these two copies apart, and eventually segregate the chromosomes equally between the two newly formed cells.</p><p>Chromosome segregation is the main function of centromeres; and in most organisms, the DNA in these regions is highly repetitive and is not thought to encode any proteins. However, it has been observed that cells need enzymes called RNA polymerases—which transcribe stretches of DNA into RNA molecules—to be able to separate the copies of their chromosomes correctly. This suggests that RNAs transcribed from centromeres might be required for cell division, but the identity and function of these RNAs remained elusive.</p><p>Quénet and Dalal have now discovered that an RNA polymerase localizes to the DNA in human centromeres and produces RNA molecules during the early stages of the cell cycle. Two proteins—one called CENP-A and another that functions as its chaperone—that normally bind to the centromere and determine its structure were found less often in this region of the chromosome if the activity of the RNA polymerase was inhibited. Quénet and Dalal identified a specific RNA molecule that is transcribed from the centromeric DNA, which directly binds to the CENP-A protein and its chaperone before CENP-A is assembled onto the centromeric DNA. Reducing the levels of this RNA within the cells made them unable to separate their chromosomes correctly during cell divisions. Quénet and Dalal also demonstrated that this centromeric RNA is needed to specifically target both the CENP-A protein, via its chaperone, to the centromere.</p><p>The findings of Quénet and Dalal demonstrate that RNAs produced from a specific part of the chromosome can help target DNA-binding proteins back to that region's DNA sequence. Following on from this work, the next challenge will be to determine if other RNA molecules are used for the same purpose in humans and other species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03254.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03254.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>histone variants</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>centromeres</kwd><kwd>CENP-A</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>lncRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Cancer Research, Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dalal</surname><given-names>Yamini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A non-coding RNA-based targeting mechanism could potentially epigenetically maintain specialized chromatin structures, such as the centromere, in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Specialized chromatin domains called centromeres play an essential role in chromosome segregation, serving as a platform for kinetochore complex formation, which in turn binds spindle microtubules at mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Verdaasdonk and Bloom, 2011</xref>). Although centromeric DNA sequence is not uniform across species, centromere function is conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sullivan, 2009</xref>). In humans, AT-rich 171 bp α-satellite repeats lacking any known genes are the primary DNA component of the centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Waye and Willard, 1987</xref>). Centromeres are characterized by the presence of the centromeric histone H3 variant (CENH3/CENP-A in human). Centromeric chromatin has long been considered heterochromatic, despite exhibiting a bivalent organization with heterochromatin-like post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as H3 and H4 hypo-acetylation, and transcription-coupled PTMs, including dimethylation on H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sullivan and Karpen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). The function of such bivalent modifications has remained mysterious. Indeed, despite the common assumption that centromeres are largely dormant, a number of recent studies have pointed to the importance of transcription at centromeres in multiple organisms, which appears to be essential for the maintenance of centromere integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hall et al., 2012</xref>). Chemical inhibition of either RNA Polymerase I (RNAPI), or RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII), results in loss of the inner kinetochore protein CENP-C, and in chromosome mis-segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2012</xref>). Centromeric RNA components also seem to contribute to the structural integrity of the mitotic centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wong et al., 2007</xref>). However, the exact timing of centromeric transcription, the polymerase involved, the identity of centromeric RNAs and their precise role in maintaining native centromere integrity in human cells has been elusive.</p><p>In this study, we report that centromeric RNAs play a critical role in the maintenance of the human centromere in vivo. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP), and immunofluorescence (IF) on chromatin fibers, we find that RNAPII, in conjunction with TATA-box binding protein (TBP) localizes to, and actively transcribes native human centromeres from late mitosis to early G1 (eG1). Biochemical purification and sequencing of the RNA associated with human centromeric chromatin at eG1 reveals a 1.3 kb long transcript. This RNA physically interacts with CENP-A and its chaperone HJURP (Holliday junction recognition protein) in the pre-assembly soluble state in vivo. Targeted sequence-specific knockdown of the transcript results in the formation of multipolar spindles and lagging chromosomes in subsequent mitoses, leading to chromosome instability. IF analysis of centromeric chromatin fibers demonstrates that these cellular and nuclear phenotypes arise specifically from the abrogation of CENP-A and HJURP localization to the centromere. Together, our data describe a direct physical role for a centromeric long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in HJURP targeting, subsequent CENP-A loading, and the maintenance of centromere integrity. Our study supports the possibility that an lncRNA-based mechanism is involved in targeting CENP-A and its chaperone HJURP to the centromere.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNAPII is associated with native human centromeres at eG1</title><p>Centromeric transcription has been previously described in human cells, and RNAPII has been implicated in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Saffery et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2012</xref>).

In order to achieve this, we extracted chromatin from non-synchronized cells after a short MNase digestion, to obtain long chromatin arrays that are rich in tri-, tetra-, and penta-nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). From this input chromatin, centromeric chromatin was immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against either CENP-A, or the inner kinetochore protein CENP-C or no antibody (mock IP). The mock IP control shows no enrichment of any of the centromeric proteins tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). As expected, Western blots revealed reciprocal co-purification of CENP-A and CENP-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left and middle panels). RNAPII and its partner TBP also co-purified with CENP-A and CENP-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left and middle panels). To further establish an interaction between RNAPII and centromeric proteins, we performed the reciprocal experiment, precipitating RNAPII<sup>S2P</sup> from solubilized chromatin, and testing for centromeric partners. While Western blots revealed little or no interaction of RNAPII with CENP-C, a robust and reproducible binding of RNAPII to TBP and CENP-A was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel). Thus, active RNAPII machinery is physically associated with CENP-A chromatin at eG1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RNAPII transcribes native human centromeres at late mitosis-eG1</title><p>Recent studies have indicated that RNAPII transcribes centromeres at mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2012</xref>). However, our RNAPII localization data above showed RNAPII enrichment occurs primarily at eG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To examine the consequence of eG1 RNAPII localization at centromeres, HeLa cells were synchronized at G2, mitosis and eG1, and briefly treated (2 hr) with drugs to specifically block either RNAPI (actinomycin D) or RNAPII (α-amanitin) activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bensaude, 2011</xref>).

A logical prediction arising from these data is that centromeric transcripts might physically associate with the soluble pre-assembly HJURP/CENP-A complex in vivo. Indeed, computational RNA-binding prediction algorithms revealed potential RNA binding residues in both HJURP and CENP-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).

This sequencing approach was moderately successful, yielding one sequence of ∼665 nucleotides (cenRNA#1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This RNA sequence is unique and contains four semi-regularly spaced 28-bp repeats with a weak homology to the canonical CENP-B box (data not shown), but does not map to the currently annotated human genome sequence, to any other organisms, or to plasmids. Since most human centromeres remain intractable to complete sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lander et al., 2001</xref>), this outcome is not entirely surprising. We were unable to detect cenRNA#1 directly on Northern blots, presumably due to its low abundance or due to its instability. Therefore, to directly reveal the genomic origin of the sequenced RNA, we converted it to a DNA FISH probe (cenRNA#1<sup>DNA</sup>). We next either performed control IF/FISH using the Xist locus (Xist<sup>DNA</sup>, on the q-arm of the X-chromosome) and CENP-A, IF/FISH with cenRNA#1<sup>DNA</sup> and CENP-A, or IF/double-FISH with CENP-A, cenRNA#1<sup>DNA</sup> and centromeric α-satellite probes, on chromatin fibers. As expected, control IF/FISH between Xist<sup>DNA</sup> and CENP-A yielded no appreciable signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, about half the CENP-A, or centromeric α-satellite stained fibers, contain the cenRNA#1<sup>DNA</sup> signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left vs right, quantification below panel). This result is consistent with the fact that centromeric α-satellite DNA sequences are not strictly conserved across all human centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lander et al., 2001</xref>).

We were curious whether the loss of centromeric transcripts directly abrogated CENP-A and HJURP localization at centromere. Because the loss of centromeric transcripts resulted in reduced cell density and mitotic defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), there were insufficient cells for biochemical experiments. Thus, we turned to chromatin fibers to investigate this issue. After synchronization at eG1, chromatin fibers were isolated from shRNA<sup>scram</sup> cells, or the few remaining of shRNA<sup>sat</sup>-transfected cells, and stained for RNAPII and centromeric proteins. In both, shRNA<sup>scram</sup>- or shRNA<sup>sat</sup>-transfected cells, RNAPII<sup>S2P</sup> remains associated with centromeric chromatin fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, first top panel), confirming that RNAPII localization and transcription of centromeres are independent of centromeric transcripts.

In this study, we investigated the mechanistic contribution of transcription, and centromeric transcripts, to centromeric integrity. We show that RNAPII and TBP are loaded onto and transcribe human centromeric chromatin at eG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This cell cycle regulated centromeric transcription is required for the synthesis of centromeric RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Biochemical purification and analysis reveal a 1.3 kb transcript which is physically associated with CENP-A and HJURP in the soluble pre-assembly state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Targeted destruction of this centromeric RNA leads to the loss of centromere integrity and subsequent mitotic and cellular defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which are mechanistically underpinned by the loss of HJURP and CENP-A recruitment to centromeres at eG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Altogether, these data reveal a hitherto unsuspected function for lncRNAs in RNA-dependent chaperone targeting to centromeres in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Several specific questions arise from our observations. First, no active genes have ever been described in human centromeres, making the identification of RNAPII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Saffery et al., 2003</xref>) and TBP at the centromere surprising. Because the repetitive nature of centromeric α-satellite DNA has thus far disallowed complete sequencing, successful annotation of transcriptional motifs that may exist in human centromeres remains to be accomplished. Our data show that centromeric transcription is an event integral to the epigenetic maintenance of centromere integrity, and discovering precisely where such motifs lie within active centromeres is an exciting avenue of research.</p><p>Second, our functional characterization of a 1.3 kb centromeric lncRNA deriving from centromeric transcription reveals its interaction with CENP-A and HJURP at eG1. Specific depletion of centromeric α-satellite transcripts affects the recruitment of both CENP-A and HJURP proteins, directly implicating centromeric RNA in CENP-A and HJURP targeting onto centromeres at eG1. We note that previous data have shown that HJURP loading is also dependent on its interaction with the Mis18 complex, in a CDK1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnhart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moree et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Muller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). However, mutations of CDK1-phosphorylated sites in HJURP only partially abrogate its recruitment in vivo, highlighting the existence of other hitherto unknown CENP-A loading factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate centromeric lncRNAs are, in fact, the missing factor. Thus, of immediate interest is the elucidation of the structure of the 1.3 kb centromeric RNA with its cognate binding domains in CENP-A and HJURP.</p><p>Third, the exact molecular process involved in targeting lncRNA-nucleoprotein complexes to centromeres is an unexpected and novel avenue to pursue. For example, whereas it is well known that Xist RNA binds its cognate DNA locus only in <italic>cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Plath et al., 2002</xref>), it is unknown if centromeric transcripts can bind in <italic>cis</italic> solely to the centromere of origin, or in <italic>trans,</italic> across all centromeres. An attractive possibility is centromeric RNAs originate from multiple centromeres and serve a redundant function to ensure accurate targeting of CENP-A/HJURP to homologous centromeres.</p><p>Fourth, our study has potential evolutionary implications. Prior studies have described RNA originating from centromeres in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouzinba-Segard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carone et al., 2009</xref>). In mouse cells, a 120 nucleotide minor satellite RNA is associated with centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouzinba-Segard et al., 2006</xref>), and in tammar wallaby, centromeric transcription results in the production of ∼40 nucleotides crasiRNAs (centromere repeats-associated short interacting RNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lindsay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carone et al., 2013</xref>). A logical explanation for the difference in size of ncRNAs generated in different organisms may be the divergent nature of the centromeric DNA sequences across species, which in turn may lead to divergence in the type of centromeric RNAs produced. However, despite this difference, over-expression or down-regulation of mouse minor satellite RNA, or crasiRNAs in tammar wallaby, or the 1.3 kb centromeric human RNA identified in our study, leads to similar cellular and mitotic defects. Our data reveal that such RNAs generated from human centromeric transcription bind HJURP and CENP-A in the soluble form and that mitotic loss seen in cells depleted of these lncRNAs is specifically linked to abrogation of HJURP-mediated targeting of CENP-A. Thus, our data suggest an evolutionarily conserved basis for the phenomena of centromeric transcription seen in other organisms. We speculate that accurate CENP-A targeting onto active centromeres probably requires a ‘dual-lock’ system, coupling chromatin-bound centromeric factors (such as Mis18), which facilitate cell-cycle regulated centromeric transcription, which in turn results in the production of a lncRNA/CENP-A/chaperone complex that can effectively target CENP-A back to pre-existing active centromeric sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that transcription-coupled, chaperone-mediated histone variant assembly governs much of chromatin biology.

To perform qtPCR, complementary DNAs (cDNAs) samples were prepared using the iQ SYBR Green supermix (#170-8880; Biorad) following manufacturer's protocol. Control reactions without the cDNA were performed to rule out non-specific amplification. The qtPCR was run on Step one plus Real time PCR system (Applied Biosystem, Grand Island, NY). Primer sequences are available on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p><p>The comparative cycle threshold (C<sub>T</sub>) method was used to analyze the expression level of α-satellite transcripts.

After a full discussion of the study and the reviews, I am happy to report that the reviewers and the BRE member found the study of great interest to the journal, and therefore, we are happy to consider a revised manuscript addressing the following issues. I have also included the full-reviewers' comments at the bottom of this letter, which contain minor issues and textual modifications that need to be addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>1) Your report of the 665 bp portion of the 1.3 kb sequence lacks alpha satellite, even though it was picked up on a Northern blot using alpha satellite as probes. Please provide more details concerning the probe and also repeat a Northern that is reprobed with this 665-bp sequence to determine whether the sequence identified is actually present in the RNA. This point needs to be clarified for our reviewers and readership.</p><p>2) Provide negative and positive controls for the experiments as suggested by all three reviewers (the detailed reviews are included below).</p><p>3) Provide quantification for the results for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3 fig4 fig6">Figures 1a, 3c, 4c, and 6</xref>.</p><p>4) Identify the genomic region from where the centromeric RNA originates. One reviewer has suggested that you could clone the full length RNA, and validate more carefully its implication in CENP-A deposition (further information regarding the reviewer's suggestion is included below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p>How typical centromeres, such as those of humans, are targeted for function remains poorly understood. Whereas it might be assumed that alpha satellite is necessary and sufficient, because all human centromeres are embedded in alpha satellite, the occurrence of neocentromeres implies that alpha satellite is not sufficient for localization of the centromere foundation protein, the histone H3 variant CENP-A. A chaperone protein, HJURP, has been identified as being a requirement, and it is known that at least some alpha satellite sequences are transcribed, but these finding do not provide a clue as to how centromeres are maintained throughout the cell cycle. Now the authors show that transcription during early G1 is necessary for correct localization of CENP-A and describe an RNA sequence component of the CENP-A assembly complex that is required for normal centromere function. The data supporting these major novel points are convincing, making this study an exciting advance in understanding how centromeres are maintained.</p><p>Although the importance of the central findings justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, there were some issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) The authors report that a search for a 665 bp portion of the 1.3 kb sequence failed to find it in the human or any other genome. Oddly, this portion lacks alpha satellite, even though it was picked up on a Northern blot using alpha satellite as probe. Some details are needed concerning exactly what the probe was. It would seem surprising if the 665-bp sequence is also absent from human short-read archives, as there is no reason to expect there to be a bias against a centromere-linked sequence in unassembled short reads produced from whole genomic DNA. If the sequence is not also found there, then some rational explanation for the phantom nature of this sequence would be welcome. For example, perhaps it derives from an as-yet unidentified endogenous RNA virus particle. In any case, the Northern should be reprobed with this 665-bp sequence to determine whether the sequence identified is actually present in the RNA.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>: All 3 IPs show enrichment relative to Input and Unbound. A negative control is needed for this experiment to verify that some of the enrichment isn't a technical artifact, such as background chromatin preferentially sticking to beads or some other systematic bias.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>This manuscript presents an interesting idea, namely that a long noncoding RNA associates with HJURP and CENP-A and facilitates CENPa nucleosome assembly in early G1. I think the idea is consistent with the data, but I think there are many aspects of the experiments that could be significantly improved to be more convincing. In general, the experiments need more controls and quantification to be interpretable.</p><p>1) It’s not clear if the shRNAs actually target the novel RNA sequence that the authors identified, they target a-sat which colocalizes with the novel RNA sequence. This seems like a crucial piece of data. Why not design a shRNA to knock down the identified RNA sequence, show it is depleted by northern, and then perform the functional assays? The significance of the sequence identified is otherwise unclear.</p><p>2) No negative controls for the western blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>. Also, there are multiple bands detected for CENP-C and TBP, which bands are the relevant bands?</p><p>3) No positive control for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</xref> (-RNAse).</p><p>4) Background is too high in mock IP <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4–figure supplement 4</xref> to know if there is any significant pull down in the mock IPs.

In the figure legends, there are indications of repeats and number of fibers, but there is no quantification of the results for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3 fig4 fig6">Figures 1a, 3c, 4c, and 6</xref>. Colocalization is very difficult/impossible to see in the figures as presented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p>In this study, Quenet and Dalal investigated the mechanism of human CENP-A deposition at centromeres during early G1 phase of the cell cycle. Using immuno-precipitation and chromatin fibers imaging, they were able to identify a single 1.3 kb centromeric RNA that is claimed to play a critical role in CENP-A targeting and deposition at centromeres. The identified RNA molecule interacts with the soluble pre-assembly HJURP and CENP-A complexes in vivo. Its down-regulation is suggested to result in the loss of CENP-A and HJURP from centromeres and to subsequent chromosome instability. The 1.3 kb molecule is transcribed by RNA Polymerase II from centromeric DNA. Accordingly, inhibition of RNA Polymerase II transcription abrogates the recruitment of both CENP-A and its chaperone HJURP to centromeres.</p><p>Overall, I think this work provides some interesting observation but they are too preliminary and contradictory to deserve publication in the present form. The authors need to seriously revise the paper, strengthen the biochemistry experiments and to validate their model in vivo and in vitro.</p><p>The manuscript in its present form exhibits several caveats. The most important issues are listed below:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the Western Blot. The signal with the anti-CENP-C antibody is very weak (just slightly above the background). The authors should present a more convincing blot.</p><p>2) Mounting evidence supports the hypothesis that an RNA component is involved in centromere function; although how RNAs participate in centromere formation in mammals has remained unknown. This study identifies a novel RNA component but fail to provide convincing evidence for its implication in CENP-A deposition. The proposed model for RNA guided CENP-A deposition is interesting but the identified 1.3 kb RNA molecule is very questionable. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the size of the RNA identified in the HJURP complex (1.3 Kb) is different from the one identified in the CENP-A complex (1.1 Kb). How do the authors explain this discrepancy?</p><p>3) To be convincing, the authors need to identify the genomic region from where this centromeric RNA originates. They should clone the full length RNA and validate more carefully its implication in CENP-A deposition. The two shRNAs presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are useless since they were designed against the α-satellite RNA and not against the 1.3 Kb RNA identified in this study. What is the relationship between α-satellite RNA and the 1.3 Kb RNA? Why the authors are not able to detect the association of CENP-A with α-satellite RNA as previously described by others (Ferri et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Aug;37(15):5071-80 ; Wong et al., Genome Res. 2007;17:1146-1160).</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> predicts the presence of several RNA binding motifs in HJURP and CENP-A but fail to provide a single experimental evidence for such interaction. The authors should reconstitute this interaction in vitro and map the interaction motifs either in CENP-A or HJURP. They should next mutate these motifs and validate their functional relevance in vivo.</p><p>5) Is it possible that the overexpression of the 1.3 kb RNA affects the centromere function and CENP-A deposition?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03254.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the senior editor and all 3 reviewers for their positive comments and excellent experimental suggestions, both of which helped us strengthen the conclusions of our manuscript, namely that cell-cycle regulated non-coding 1.3kb centromeric RNAs participate in targeting HJURP and CENP-A to the human centromere, and that one such CENP-A-associated lncRNA (cenRNA#1) is important for cell integrity.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p><italic>[…] Although the importance of the central findings justify publication in eLife, there were some issues that need to be addressed</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) The authors report that a search for a 665 bp portion of the 1.3 kb sequence failed to find it in the human or any other genome.

We note that DNA FISH experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) demonstrate the centromeric origin of cenRNA#1, which we originally cloned from CENP-A IPs. The logical assumption we made is that this transcript is one of the 1.3 kb RNA species observed by Northern blot using centromeric α-satellite probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>However as the reviewer notes, the identified CenRNA#1 is curious because no significant alignment to the current human genome build can be detected (nor to any other DNA sequences extant in the literature). Similarity to α-satellite and chromosome X-HOR is just under the 60% cutoff used in Hasson et al. (2013) (53 and 55%, respectively). However, a weak similarity to canonical CENP-B box has been observed within this sequence for four periodically spaced 28-bp repeats (data not shown). Thus, the lack of robust identification of this sequence relative to known centromeric sequences remains a major puzzle.</p><p>There are several possibilities that might contribute to this issue:</p><p>i) Low frequency centromeric repeats from which cenRNA#1 arises were either not enriched efficiently in the Hasson et al study (peak calling relies on tag densities above a certain cutoff, and different CENP-A antibodies have variable specificities (<italic>Gill, Walkiewicz et al, in revision</italic>));</p><p>ii) As the reviewer suggests, this RNA arises from currently unidentified low frequency centromeric sequences.</p><p>iii) The RNA is spliced, but we think this unlikely.</p><p>iv) The RNA is unstable, making full cloning technically challenging .</p><p>We probed Northern blots with the cenRNA#1 sequence, and despite our best efforts were unable to obtain a robust signal. This supports the possibility that full length cenRNA#1 is either at low abundance or is unstable. Instability in the full-length construct could also explain why alpha-satellite consensus sequence (through which the cenRNA was cloned) are lacking in the 665bp. Thus, we specifically state in the main manuscript that we were unable to detect this RNA using Northern blots.</p><p>Importantly, reviewer comments prompted us to directly assay the functional biological relevance of cenRNA#1 by performing a targeted knockdown using shRNA<sup>CEN#1</sup> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). Reassuringly, after shRNA<sup>CEN#1</sup>treatment, cells display far lower density (reduced by 70%), and abnormal morphology, with very few mitotics relative to control shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>). This phenotype is reminiscent to cells depleted of all centromeric α-satellite transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Combined with the DNA FISH experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), this new piece of data lends support to the interpretation that cenRNA#1 is indeed involved in centromeric integrity. Further genetic and biochemical characterization of cenRNA#1, and other cenRNAs is currently a major effort in the lab.</p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref><italic>: All 3 IPs show enrichment relative to Input and Unbound.

These phenotypes are similar to those we obtained with the total centromeric α-satellite RNA knockdown.

However, quantification of the immuno-fluorescent signal on chromatin fibers is unlikely to be informative as the signal intensity often varies from one experiment to another.

This is why we quantified CENP-A and CENP-B signals on whole cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and not on chromatin fibers. We suggest a more meaningful measure is the number of analyzed centromeric chromatin fibers that display a particular phenotype, thus yielding a quantifiable index of the robustness of the given observation.

The authors should present a more convincing blot</italic>.</p><p>Several CENP-C antibodies were tested, but none of them gave us a better result than the one presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Although the CENP-C signal is admittedly, weak, this result is reproducible, and therefore we are convinced by our interpretation.</p><p><italic>2) Mounting evidence supports the hypothesis that an RNA component is involved in centromere function; although how RNAs participate in centromere formation in mammals has remained unknown. This study identifies a novel RNA component but fail to provide convincing evidence for its implication in CENP-A deposition. The proposed model for RNA guided CENP-A deposition is interesting but the identified 1.3 kb RNA molecule is very questionable. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref><italic>, the size of the RNA identified in the HJURP complex (1.3 Kb) is different from the one identified in the CENP-A complex (1.1 Kb). How do the authors explain this discrepancy</italic>?</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the observed difference in size results from a “smiling” migration, that is evident upon looking at the standard ladder at the far right (three ladders were used in this experiment, and we cropped out the one to the right in the initial version of the manuscript). Thus, there is no discrepancy in the size of the RNA identified in the HJURP complex and in the CENP-A complex. Both are ∼1.3 kb long.</p><p><italic>3) To be convincing, the authors need to identify the genomic region from where this centromeric RNA originates. They should clone the full length RNA and validate more carefully its implication in CENP-A deposition. The two shRNAs presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>are useless since they were designed against the α-satellite RNA and not against the 1.3 Kb RNA identified in this study. What is the relationship between α-satellite RNA and the 1.3 Kb RNA? Why the authors are not able to detect the association of CENP-A with α-satellite RNA as previously described by others (Ferri et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Aug;37(15):5071-80 ; Wong et al., Genome Res. 2007;17:1146-1160)</italic>.</p><p>Using RNA-immuno-precipitation followed by Northern blot, we revealed an interaction between CENP-A and 1.3kb RNAs which are detected by centromeric α-satellite primers. These data suggest that in human cells this histone variant binds α-satellite RNAs whose size is 1.3 kb, as previously described by Ferri <italic>et al.</italic> in mouse cells (Nucleic Acids Research, 2009). To the best of our knowledge, Wong et al. (Genome Research, 2007) did not revealed an association of CENP-A and α-satellite RNA, but instead used CENPC, INCENP and α-satellite transcript. We did not test this possibility in our model, as we focused on the role of centromeric transcript in CENP-A and HJURP localization at centromeres.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig7">Figures 5 and 7</xref> show the importance of these centromeric α-satellite transcripts in the targeting of CENP-A and HJURP, as their down-regulation affects the centromeric localization of these two proteins. These data are key results, because they show, for the first time, the importance of centromeric RNAs in CENP-A and HJURP targeting.</p><p>In order to better characterize these transcripts, we sequenced RNAs co-purified with CENP-A, and identified one sequence (cenRNA#1). We agree with Reviewer 2 and 3 that showing it is involved in cell integrity, is important. We provide this experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>, designing an shRNA against cenRNA#1, and observing dramatic loss of cell density (by 70%), and abnormal cell morphology. We also see the number of mitotic cells is reduced in cells transfected with shRNA<sup>cenRNA#1</sup> (data not shown). Ongoing studies are focused on a complete biochemical and genetic characterization of this and other ncRNAs associated with CENP-A, but this is outside the scope of this initial first description of RNA involvement in CENP-A/HJURP deposition.</p><p><italic>4)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 2</italic></xref> <italic>predicts the presence of several RNA binding motifs in HJURP and CENP-A but fail to provide a single experimental evidence for such interaction. The authors should reconstitute this interaction in vitro and map the interaction motifs either in CENP-A or HJURP. They should next mutate these motifs and validate their functional relevance in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We agree with Reviewer 3 about the importance of <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization of RNA–CENP-A and RNA-HJURP interaction. Indeed, we are very excited about these next series of experiments. However, we believe this set of experiments constitutes an obvious follow-up project, and is outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) Is it possible that the overexpression of the 1.3 kb RNA affects the centromere function and CENP-A deposition</italic>?</p><p>Several lines of evidence in the literature suggest that the expression level of centromeric RNAs in essential for the integrity of the centromere (for review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hall et al. 2012</xref>). For instance, Bouzinba-Segard et al. (PNAS, 2006) showed the forced accumulation of the mouse centromeric repeat transcripts (120 nucleotide long) leads to chromosome missegregation. In addition, it has been shown using human artificial chromosome, the alteration of the post-translational modifications associated with centromeres, may increase or decrease the level of transcription at this chromatin domain. In both situations, the structure and function of centromere are affected (<italic>e.g.</italic>, chromosome missegregation, loss of centromeric proteins) (Bergmann et al., EMBO J. 2011, Bergmann et al., Chromosome Research 2012). However, the over-expression of centromeric RNAs observed after stress suggests this alteration may also be a response to environmental conditions (Jolly et al., JCB 2004, Bouzinba-Segard et al., PNAS, 2006). Indeed, the over-expression of cenRNAs is currently being analyzed in the lab, but is outside the scope of this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
