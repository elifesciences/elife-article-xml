in a hand-over-hand fashion. The ATP hydrolysis cycles of its two heads are maintained out of phase by a series of gating mechanisms, which lead to processive runs averaging ∼1 μm. A key structural element for inter-head coordination is the neck linker (NL), which connects the heads to the stalk. To examine the role of the NL in regulating stepping, we investigated NL mutants of various lengths using single-molecule optical trapping and bulk fluorescence approaches in the context of a general framework for gating. Our results show that, although inter-head tension enhances motor velocity, it is crucial neither for inter-head coordination nor for rapid rear-head release. Furthermore, cysteine-light mutants do not produce wild-type motility under load. We conclude that kinesin-1 is primarily front-head gated, and that NL length is tuned to enhance unidirectional processivity and velocity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07403.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07403.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07403.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In cells, molecules are moved from one location to another by motor proteins. Kinesins are a large family of such motors that transport their cargos along long filaments known as microtubules. Most kinesin molecules are formed from two identical protein chains. Each chain has a motor region at one end (called the head) that can attach to microtubules. The other end of each protein chain wraps around its partner to form a common stalk region (called the tail) that links to the cargo being carried.</p><p>The two kinesin heads are connected to the tail via a ‘neck linker’ region, and they advance along the microtubule in strict alternation, similar to the way our legs move when walking. During each step, the front head remains tightly associated with the filament as the trailing head releases itself, advances beyond the front head, and reattaches to become the new leading head. The two heads need to coordinate their activities, so that at any given time, they're not at the same stage in the process. For example, if both heads remained bound to the microtubule at the same time, the motor would not be able to advance. If they both released, the motor would fall off the filament and diffuse away. However, the process by which the heads coordinate is not fully understood, and different models for how this process works have been proposed.</p><p>Now, Andreasson, Milic et al. have examined the role played by the neck linker in coordinating the motor's movement using a technique known as ‘optical trapping’. The experiments involved attaching microscopic beads to the motor proteins, which serve as markers that can be tracked. The beads can also be used to exert controlled forces on the kinesin molecules, to see how they respond to different loads.</p><p>Andreasson, Milic et al. extended the length of neck linker by inserting extra amino acids (which are the building blocks of proteins) into this region of the protein. It was found that kinesins can still walk even when each neck linker was extended by up to six additional amino acids. However, introducing even a single amino acid into the linker relaxed the normal tension that exists between the heads when these are both bound to the filament. This resulted in slowed speeds, shorter distances of travel, and less ability to sustain loads. The experimental results suggest that the length of the neck linker in naturally occurring kinesins may be optimized to support maximum movement. Based on their data, Andreasson, Milic et al. propose a general framework for understanding the communication that needs to take place between the heads in order to walk in a coordinated manner. Further work is required to understand if motor proteins other than kinesins can also be understood with this same framework.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07403.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07403.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>optical trap</kwd><kwd>molecular motor</kwd><kwd>single molecule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R37GM051453</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Block</surname><given-names>Steven M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM076476</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hancock</surname><given-names>William O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A general framework for gating reveals that inter-head tension is not essential for coordinating kinesin stepping, and that neck-linker length is tuned to enhance processivity and velocity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinesin-1, hereafter referred to simply as kinesin, is an ATP-driven, dimeric motor protein that facilitates the unidirectional transport of intracellular cargo along microtubule (MT) filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vale et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Howard et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Block et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hackney, 1995</xref>). Each kinesin dimer is composed of a pair of identical catalytic motor domains, or heads, which are connected to a common, coiled-coil stalk by a ∼14-amino-acid-long sequence known as the neck linker (NL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kozielski et al., 1997</xref>). Kinesin translocates towards the plus-ends of MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Svoboda et al., 1993</xref>) via an asymmetric hand-over-hand mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asbury et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yildiz et al., 2004</xref>), hydrolyzing one molecule of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hua et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schnitzer and Block, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coy et al., 1999</xref>) for each 8.2-nm step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Svoboda et al., 1993</xref>) the motor takes. The biochemical states associated with each kinesin head during stepping are coupled to mechanical transitions in an overall mechanochemical cycle: biochemical events modulate the affinities of heads to the MT and influence mechanical transitions, and mechanical states, in turn, influence the rates of biochemical processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block, 2007</xref>).</p><p>During the mechanochemical cycle, each kinesin head transitions between one or more states that are strongly bound to the MT (the ATP-containing state, and also the no-nucleotide state), and one or more states that are weakly bound to the MT (the ADP-containing state) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block, 2007</xref>). A simplified version of this cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) may arbitrarily be taken to begin with the one-head-bound (1-HB), ATP-waiting state [α], where the nucleotide-free front head is strongly bound to the MT while the rear, ADP-bound tethered head remains unbound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hackney, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asenjo and Sosa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guydosh and Block, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toprak et al., 2009</xref>). Following ATP binding to the MT-bound head, the NL of its motor domain undergoes a structural reconfiguration and forms a β-sheet with the head, in a process termed <italic>NL docking</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schnitzer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rosenfeld et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asenjo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tomishige et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khalil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sindelar and Downing, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>). NL docking shifts the position of the tethered head towards the MT plus-end, beyond the position of the bound head [β<sub>1</sub>, β<sub>2</sub>]. Recent work has suggested that NL docking may occur in two stages: first, ATP binding induces a load-dependent mechanical transition, leading to partial NL docking [β<sub>1</sub>], whereas subsequent ATP hydrolysis completes the docking and enables the tethered head to bind the MT [β<sub>2</sub>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Milic et al., 2014</xref>). Once the bound head hydrolyzes ATP, fully docks its NL, and the tethered head binds the MT, the motor enters a mechanically strained, two-heads-bound (2-HB) state [γ] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yildiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gennerich and Vale, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, rear-head release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klumpp et al., 2004</xref>) completes the step and returns the motor to its initial 1-HB waiting state [α], primed to begin the cycle anew, after having translocated forward by one step (8.2 nm) along the MT. The processivity of kinesin—evinced by the ability of a single dimer to undergo &gt;100 consecutive stepping cycles before dissociation—relies upon a tight coordination of the biochemical and mechanical events, collectively known as <italic>gating mechanisms</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block, 2007</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07403.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A general gating framework based on mechanical states of dimeric motors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The kinesin mechanochemical cycle. Kinesin starts from the one-head-bound (1-HB) ATP-waiting state [α], characterized by a strongly bound, nucleotide-free (Ø) front head (red) and an unbound, ADP-containing tethered head (blue). ATP binding induces a force-dependent transition involving partial NL docking, shifting the tethered head past the bound head [β<sub>1</sub>]. ATP hydrolysis completes NL docking and facilitates tethered-head binding [β<sub>2</sub>]. At this point, kinesin may access a dissociated state [Off], induced by premature phosphate release from the bound head, leading to dimer detachment. However, if the tethered head reaches the forward MT binding site and completes the step before the bound head can dissociate, kinesin enters the two-heads-bound (2-HB) state [γ]. Rear-head release returns the dimer to the ATP-waiting state [α], having moved forward by 8.2 nm. (<bold>B</bold>) A simplified general gating framework, based on the cycle in (<bold>A</bold>). Stepping, binding, and unbinding gates are shown with associated rate constants between each of the three gated states, [A], [B], and [C]. The cycle begins at the 1-HB ATP-waiting state [A], where the stepping gate promotes processivity by inhibiting rear-head (blue) rebinding and premature bound-head (red) release. Following a force-dependent step that shifts the tethered head past the bound head [B], the binding gate promotes binding of the tethered head at the forward MT binding site while inhibiting release of the bound head. Also shown is a competing dissociated state [Off], arising from premature release of the bound head from the 1-HB state, accessible from either [A] or [B]. Tethered-head binding leads to the 2-HB state [C], where the unbinding gate promotes rear-head release while inhibiting front-head release, returning the motor to the start of the cycle [A].</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07403.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07403.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07403-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>We note that the term ‘gating’ encompasses any mechanism where the state of one head influences its partner in such a way as to ensure that the mechanochemical cycles of the heads are maintained out of phase, leading to alternate-head stepping. This term includes, but is not limited to, mechanisms that modulate detachment rates, alter nucleotide affinities, and affect ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Block et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hackney, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vale et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hua et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schnitzer and Block, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hancock and Howard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block, 2007</xref>).</p><p>To establish a general framework for gating in the kinesin cycle, we begin by recognizing that the kinesin dimer transitions through a fixed series of 1-HB [A, B] and 2-HB [C] states during each cycle, where the unbound (tethered) head of a 1-HB motor may be positioned either predominantly behind [A] or in front of [B], the MT-bound head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since dissociation from the 2-HB state [Off] necessarily requires passage through a 1-HB intermediate, processive cycling can be distilled into the following set of three gating properties which, taken all together, promote forward stepping while suppressing dissociation:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>i. The MT-bound head must remain attached in any 1-HB state.</p></list-item><list-item><p>ii. When the motor is in either a 2-HB state or in a 1-HB state where the tethered head is behind the MT-bound head, the unbinding of the rear head should be promoted (or maintained, if already unbound).</p></list-item><list-item><p>iii. When the motor is in either a 2-HB state or in a 1-HB state where the tethered head is in front of the MT-bound head, the binding of the front head should be promoted (or maintained, if already bound).</p></list-item></list></p><p>Taken together, these principles lead to the mechanical gating framework presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Starting from a 1-HB state, with the tethered head positioned behind the MT-bound head [A], unidirectional processivity necessitates a <italic>stepping gate</italic> that stabilizes binding by the front head while inhibiting any rebinding by the rear head. Following a structural transition that shifts the tethered head beyond the bound head [B], a <italic>binding gate</italic> acts to promote tethered-head binding at the forward site, while preventing premature unbinding of the rear head, which would otherwise lead to dissociation [Off]. Once the tethered head binds successfully, and the motor achieves the 2-HB state [C], an <italic>unbinding gate</italic> is required to retain the front head on the MT, while promoting the release of the rear head. Finally, rear-head release completes the cycle, returning the motor to its initial state [A], but advanced by one step. We note that this abstraction is agnostic with respect to the biochemical state associated with each mechanical transition. However, precisely because these biochemical states are unspecified, this general framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) can be applied not only to kinesin but also to other processive, two-headed motors that may couple mechanical and biochemical states differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gennerich and Vale, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kull and Endow, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cleary et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used the gating framework to guide an investigation of the role of the NL domain in determining kinesin processivity, which remains incompletely understood, despite considerable research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hackney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yildiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shastry and Hancock, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>). Because intramolecular forces within the kinesin dimer are thought to be transmitted through the NL of each head, the NL domain is well situated to play a role in gating. Consistent with this, extending the NL by mutation has previously been shown to affect kinesin processivity, velocity, and stepping behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hackney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yildiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shastry and Hancock, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>). In principle, perturbing the properties of the NL by inserting additional amino acids (AA) at the junction of the NL domain and the coiled-coil stalk could affect some, or all, of the gates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. When kinesin is in its 1-HB state [A, B], the NL might serve to suppress rear-head rebinding in the ATP-waiting state [A], as part of the stepping gate, or to promote tethered-head binding (following NL docking) in the bound head [B], as part of the binding gate. When kinesin is in a 2-HB state [C], the NL can transmit inter-head tension, affecting the unbinding gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guydosh and Block, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yildiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hariharan and Hancock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shastry and Hancock, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>). The unbinding gate may act through (i) <italic>front-head gating</italic>, where biochemical events on the front head are suppressed until the rear head has a chance to detach (candidate mechanisms include the suppression of ATP hydrolysis in the front head, reduced ATP binding arising from inter-head tension, or reduced ATP binding caused by the rearward-pointing configuration of the NL), or through (ii) <italic>rear-head gating</italic>, where the rear-head release rate is accelerated by the inter-head tension, or (iii) some combination of the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block, 2007</xref>). Because inter-head tension is directly controlled by the length of the NL domain, an understanding of the relationship between NL length and the unbinding gate is central to evaluating tension-based gating models.</p><p>The predominant mechanism for gating used by kinesin has been the subject of some controversy.

The conversation about kinesin gating has heretofore focused on how inter-head coordination might be achieved from the 2-HB state, that is, from the unbinding gate. Comparatively little attention has been paid to gating at other points of the kinesin cycle, specifically at the stepping and binding gates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and quantitative measures of the competing rates responsible for gating have been notably lacking. Here, we examine the quantitative contribution of each of the three gates to maintaining unidirectional processivity by assessing the effects of NL length on kinesin motility, and attempt to reframe the discussion of gating from a debate about front- vs rear-head gating at the 2-HB state to a more unified view that admits to gating at multiple states of the mechanochemical cycle, both 1-HB and 2-HB. Towards that end, we examined a series of truncated <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinesin constructs (DmK) containing NLs that were extended incrementally, from 1 to 6 AA (DmK-1AA to DmK-6AA), using a combination of single-molecule optical trapping and bulk fluorescence approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Kinesin maintains a stable, one-head-bound ATP-waiting state with as many as three extra amino acids in its neck linker</title><p>Our first experiments were designed to probe the influence of NL length on the <italic>stepping gate</italic>, which might contribute to unidirectional processivity by suppressing the rebinding of the ADP-bound tethered head while the motor is in the ATP-waiting state [A] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To investigate the influence of NL length on this rebinding, we performed a series of half-site ADP release experiments using mantADP, a fluorescent ADP analog, on a set of truncated constructs with extended NL domains. Because free kinesin heads in solution have a high affinity for ADP, whereas MT-bound heads exhibit a substantially lower affinity, the release of mantADP from kinesin heads serves as a proxy for the binding of free heads to MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hackney, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilbert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hackney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>). Binding was assayed by pre-incubating motors in mantADP and subsequently monitoring the MT-stimulated decay of fluorescence upon the introduction of MTs via stopped-flow. Wild-type (WT) <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinesin (DmK-WT), as well as constructs with NLs extended by up to 3 AA, displayed a 50% reduction in fluorescence following the addition of MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with being in a 1-HB state, where only one of the two heads is bound to the MT and releases mantADP. By contrast, constructs with NL inserts consisting of 4, 5, or 6 AA exhibited progressively greater drops in fluorescence upon the addition of MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These decreases correspond to 16% of DmK-4AA, 38% of DmK-5AA, and 65% of DmK-6AA motors releasing mantADP from both heads, respectively. In principle, the increased mantADP release could arise from (i) the additional NL length facilitating transient rear-head rebinding events, (ii) more motors adopting a stable 2-HB ATP-waiting state, or (iii) some combination of both. These findings are consistent with previous work, which has also reported a ∼50% fluorescence decrease for WT kinesin, and a nearly 100% fluorescence decrease for constructs carrying a 6-AA NL insert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hackney, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hackney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>). Additional mantADP exchange experiments—where the frequency of transient rear-head interactions with the MT was assessed based on the effective rate of mantADP exchange at the rear head—revealed an order-of-magnitude increase relative to WT kinesin once the NL domain was extended by 4 or more AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Taken all together, these results indicate that kinesin can maintain a stable, 1-HB ATP-waiting state with up to 3 additional AA in its NL, but that extending the NL by 4 AA or more leads to an abrupt increase in rebinding of the rear-head to the MT.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07403.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Kinesin with as many as 3 AA inserted in the NL maintains a 1-HB ATP-waiting state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Half-site mantADP release measurements as a function of NL insert length (mean ± SE; <italic>N</italic> = 3).

Under unloaded conditions, DmK-6AA was capable of taking several dozen consecutive forward steps, on average, before dissociating, indicating that kinesin retains significant processivity with as many as 6 AA introduced into its NL. In the presence of forces applied either against (hindering loads) or along (assisting loads) the direction of kinesin motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <italic>inset</italic>), the differences in processivity among constructs with differing NL lengths were substantially more pronounced under hindering forces than under assisting forces. Although the unloaded run lengths for DmK-WT and DmK-1AA differed by a factor of 3, the differences in run length between these constructs under assisting loads were comparatively minor. A gradual, exponential decrease in run length was observed for all constructs under increasing hindering loads, but the application of even a small assisting force (+2 pN) abruptly reduced the run length for both the WT and NL-mutant constructs. Based on exponential fits to the mean run lengths as a function of applied load, the characteristic distance parameter for the force dependence of run length, δ<italic><sub>L</sub></italic>, was nearly an order of magnitude greater under hindering-load conditions than under assisting-load conditions for all constructs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

As discussed previously, the unbinding gate might consist of a rear-head gating mechanism, where the inter-head tension enhances the rate of rear-head release. If detachment of the trailing head is accelerated by inter-head tension, then extending the NL would be expected to relieve the tension and decrease the rear-head release rate, thereby reducing the overall rate at which kinesin proceeds around the reaction cycle. To explore the effect of inter-head tension on rear-head gating, we performed single-molecule measurements of the velocity of our kinesin constructs as a function of load.</p><p>Both WT and mutant constructs exhibited a force–velocity relationship that is highly asymmetric with respect to the direction of the applied load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Block et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block, 2007</xref>).

In contrast to DmK-WT, which is not sped up by assisting loads, the reduction in unloaded velocity produced by NL extension could be recovered by applying larger assisting loads (∼20 pN). These data are consistent with the explanation that inter-head tension, which can promote rear-head release, is effectively abolished by extending the NL past its WT length, but that the reduced tension can be restored by applying assisting load, which places differential stress on the rear head. However, the finding that assisting load fails to appreciably increase the WT velocity suggests that the rate of rear-head release by WT kinesin must be substantially higher than the rate-limiting step(s) of the mechanochemical cycle. If the rate of rear-head release were instead rate-limiting, then any acceleration of that step would have manifested as an increase in motor velocity.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07403.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Assisting load can rescue the velocity of mutants with extended NLs.</title><p>Velocity (mean ± SE; <italic>N</italic> = 49‒818) as a function of force for constructs (solid circles; color-coded according to the legend).

With the derived values for <italic>F</italic><sub>i,WT</sub> and the load-dependence of rear-head unbinding, δ<sub>3</sub>, the expression for <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub> shows that inter-head tension alone is capable of increasing the rate of rear-head release by an order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

Previous work has shown that the main force-dependent transition occurs from a 1-HB state after ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schnitzer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Block et al., 2003</xref>). The velocity decrease under hindering loads is associated with this transition, which we model as <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>, with a correspondingly large distance parameter (δ<sub>1</sub> ≥ 4 nm; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), equivalent to nearly half the size of the kinesin step. This transition becomes rate limiting at moderate hindering loads, and will therefore dominate any other possible force-dependent steps at high loads. Under assisting loads, <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> is exceedingly fast (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) and does not appreciably contribute to the completion time of the overall cycle—and therefore to the velocity—in this regime. However, for the mutant constructs, we are able to detect a second force-dependent contribution that is manifested as increased velocity under assisting loads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This force dependence, δ<sub>3</sub>, is necessarily linked to some motion of the motor, and the load dependence of the associated rate, <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>, could be attributed either to rear head release when kinesin is in the 2-HB state or to binding of the forward-positioned tethered head of a 1-HB motor. We strongly favor the former possibility, because it also helps to explain the observed decrease in run length under assisting load, as well as the force dependence of exponential fits to the run length data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Put another way, if load-dependent rate <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub> was instead to correspond to tethered-head binding, then an increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub> under assisting load would increase the likelihood of completing a step, and thereby increase run lengths in this force regime, contrary to observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

In particular, CL constructs have been developed to attach fluorescent labels, and it has been commonly assumed that such motors exhibit WT behavior, based on the similarity of their velocities measured under unloaded conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rice et al., 1999</xref>). Here, we assayed the velocity of a widely used truncated human CL construct (HsK-CL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rice et al., 1999</xref>) and a <italic>Drosophila</italic> CL construct (DmK-CL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fehr et al., 2009</xref>) over the full range of forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Under hindering loads, both HsK-CL and DmK-CL were appreciably slower, and also more sensitive to load, than either DmK-WT or the corresponding truncated human construct, HsK-WT. For the case of the human CL construct, the entire shape of the force–velocity relation is affected, because this motor can be sped up under assisting loads by as much as 200 nm/s. WT motors do not exhibit this effect, and it suggests that important steps in the mechanochemical cycle have been altered in the mutant.</p><p>Both CL constructs carry, among other changes, a point mutation of a conserved cysteine in the NL domain, namely C338S in DmK-CL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fehr et al., 2009</xref>) and C330S in HsK-CL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rice et al., 1999</xref>). We determined the force–velocity curve for a <italic>Drosophila</italic> construct containing only the C338S mutation (DmK-C338S). Comparison shows that this single mutation can account for some, but not all, of the change in force dependence under hindering loads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This indicates that a single CL mutation in the NL cannot alone account for the differences between WT and CL motors.</p><p>Although the force–velocity curves for DmK-WT and HsK-WT are practically indistinguishable, extending the NL of these motors by 6 AA, using either the sequence LQASQT or AEQKLT, showed that with the same insert sequences, human constructs were systematically slower than the corresponding <italic>Drosophila</italic> constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). Furthermore, NL extensions based on AEQKLT produced motors that were slower than the corresponding constructs based on LQASQT, for both DmK and HsK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>). These findings indicate that the sequences of the inserts play some role in determining motor velocity. Nevertheless, regardless of species or insert sequence, none of the mutants with extended NL domains that retained their native cysteine residues exhibited either processive backstepping under superstall loads or velocities surpassing the WT under assisting loads. We note that because DmK-CL requires two mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fehr et al., 2009</xref>), whereas HsK-CL necessitates seven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rice et al., 1999</xref>)—only one of which is common between the two constructs—a more direct comparison of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human CL constructs with extended NL domains is not practical.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The stepping gate, which prevents rear-head rebinding in the ATP-waiting state, is not strongly dependent on neck linker length</title><p>The extent of mantADP release by the rear head while kinesin is in the ATP-waiting state [A] sheds light on the role of NL length in inhibiting rear-head rebinding, an essential feature of the stepping gate. Because WT and mutant constructs with as many as three additional AA in the NL can maintain a stable 1-HB ATP-waiting state, our results show that the stepping gate is not strongly influenced by NL length. Although the stepping gate is clearly compromised in constructs with longer NL inserts (4–6 AA), a substantial portion of the population retains mantADP in its rear head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that gating is not abolished even in these motors. This notion is reinforced by results showing that mantADP exchange rates for the extended-NL mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) are several orders of magnitude lower than MT-stimulated ADP release rates by WT monomers, or ATP-stimulated ADP release rates by MT-bound WT dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hackney, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hackney et al., 2003</xref>).

Evidently, the binding gate is substantially more effective at maintaining processivity under unloaded or hindering-force conditions than under assisting-load conditions. Assisting loads as low as 2 pN produced a dramatic reduction in the run length, suggesting that any mechanism responsible for the binding gate becomes ineffective when kinesin is subjected to forces aligned with its overall motion. We note that models of transport by multiple kinesin motors have not yet taken load asymmetry into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klumpp and Lipowsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muller et al., 2008</xref>), but it may be important to do so explicitly, given the magnitude of the effect.</p><p>Here, we found that lengthening the NL by a single AA significantly decreased the unloaded run length, whereas further NL extensions led to negligible additional reductions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

We conclude that the length of the wild-type NL domain may be near optimal for maximizing motor processivity.</p><p>We speculate that the decrease in run length associated with extended NLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) arises from the corresponding increase in the diffusive space that the tethered head must explore before reaching its next MT binding site. Enlarging that space extends the time that the tethered head takes to reach the forward site, thereby increasing the probability that the partner head may release the MT prematurely, enhancing dimer dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This proposal is also consistent with the effect of added P<sub>i</sub> in increasing the processivity of DmK-WT and DmK-6AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>): P<sub>i</sub> acts to stabilize the bound head, thereby reducing dimer dissociation. The finding that normalized run lengths for the NL constructs were identical under all conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) suggests that the rates of any biochemical events associated with the bound head, when the kinesin cycle is at the binding gate, are independent of the NL length. The absolute run lengths measured for DmK-6AA were systematically lower than those of the WT motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), as anticipated from the increased time required for the tethered head to reach the forward MT binding site.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Inter-head tension maximizes kinesin velocity</title><p>Extending the NL by a one AA reduced kinesin velocity under all loads, whereas additional NL extensions, up to 6 AA, produced force–velocity curves that were indistinguishable from DmK-1AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We surmise that inserting a single AA into the NL introduces sufficient slack into the inter-head linkage that any further extensions become superfluous. A relatively high inter-head tension (26 ± 3 pN; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) may be advantageous in tuning WT kinesin for increased velocity. However, because constructs with up to 6 AA inserted in the NL retained significant functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we infer that inter-head tension plays only a modulatory role in kinesin motility, a conclusion that gains support from the modeled force–velocity relations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The fit parameters indicate that WT levels of inter-head tension can amplify the rate of rear-head release by an order of magnitude beyond its unloaded rate. However, because this unloaded rate is already more than double the rate of the hydrolysis-associated events of the kinesin cycle, <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>, the rate-determining step of the full cycle cannot be rear-head release. We find instead that the 2-HB state of kinesin is primarily <italic>front-head gated</italic>, in the sense that the kinetic cycle of the front head is slowed while the rear head remains MT-bound. Put another way, the gating mechanism responsible for processivity in the 2-HB state does not require inter-head tension, but rather occurs through a modulation of the rates of biochemical processes occurring at the front head, including ATP hydrolysis, and possibly productive ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Inter-head tension impairs, rather than aids, the unbinding gate in kinesin</title><p>Although an inter-head tension of 26 pN can enhance rear-head release 10-fold, unbinding measurements performed under hindering loads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>)—which serve as a proxy for front-head detachment rates at the unbinding gate [C]—reveal that such an inter-head tension would be expected to enhance front-head release 50-fold.

This conclusion seemingly runs contrary to previous publications, implicating inter-head tension as the preferred gating mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guydosh and Block, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toprak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shastry and Hancock, 2011</xref>). However, as we have previously argued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>), results from the earlier studies can be reconciled with our own by invoking a front-head gating mechanism for kinesin where it is the <italic>spatial orientation</italic> of the NL (i.e., pointing forward in the docked state and rearward when undocked), rather than inter-head tension, per se, that facilitates coordination of biochemical states, as discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asenjo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hahlen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>). In WT kinesin, an essential difference between the 2-HB state [C] and the 1-HB state with the tethered head positioned in front of the bound head [B] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) is that inter-head tension can develop only when both heads are strongly bound. Although tension may accelerate the rear-head release, no increase in this rate is necessary for gating, so long as the biochemical events in the front head of a 2-HB motor cannot proceed. In other words, gating at the 2-HB state may be accomplished not by accelerating rates associated with the rear head, but by inhibiting—via the spatial orientation of the NL—the ATP hydrolysis cycle at the front head, until the rear head detaches.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Motility properties of kinesin constructs with extended neck linkers depend on species, insert sequence, and cysteine-light mutations</title><p>Evidently, the species of origin, the mutation of cysteines in the catalytic domain, as well as the sequence and length of the NL, can individually affect kinesin motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–F</xref>).

Based on these findings, we conclude that the processive backstepping behavior of HsK-CL-6AA arises from some combination of NL extension and the introduction of one or more of the seven mutations used to produce human CL kinesin. Further work will be required to understand the detailed basis of any such effects.</p><p>Although we stress that our specific findings on kinesin gating, together with the general gating framework presented here, are not based on data from CL mutants, numerous publications have made extensive use of these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Case et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tomishige and Vale, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peterman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rosenfeld et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sosa et al., 2001</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55"/>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sindelar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asenjo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rice et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Naber et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2003b</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48"/>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yildiz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asenjo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Milescu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tomishige et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mori et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sindelar and Downing, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Verbrugge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dietrich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yildiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asenjo and Sosa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toprak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Verbrugge et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2009c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Naber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mattson-Hoss et al., 2014</xref>). In light of the unusual behavior displayed by certain CL mutants, it remains to be determined which previous findings are applicable to kinesin in its WT form. To avoid artifacts in future work, it would be prudent to explore alternative linking chemistries for site-specific labels that do not require the elimination of native cysteine residues. Furthermore, wild-type behavior for mutant constructs should no longer be assumed simply on the basis of their unloaded velocities or ATP hydrolysis rates.</p><p>The force-dependent velocities for the various <italic>Drosophila</italic> constructs with NL extensions (DmK-1AA through DmK-6AA) were apparently independent of the sequence used to extend the NL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, different 6-AA NL insert sequences (LQASQT vs AEQKLT) exhibited different motile properties in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C‒F</xref>). The reason for these differences is unclear, but we conjecture that it may be due to the presence of the positively charged lysine in the AEQKLT insert. In all constructs, NL extensions were introduced at the junction of NL and the stalk to minimize any disruption to the interaction between the remaining, native NL sequence and the catalytic head domain. It is conceivable that insertions at this position nevertheless affect kinesin in some ways beyond the reduction in tension arising from increased NL length, but we consider that possibility less likely, because the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 2‒5</xref> can be well modeled by mechanical effects. We also favor the explanation that extensions of the NL lead to negligible inter-head strain in the 2-HB state, because extensions from 1 to 6 AA increase the NL length by over 30%, yet generate no corresponding change in velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The gating framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and associated conclusions would remain intact even in the presence of residual inter-head tension in mutants, however. In that case, the value for inter-head tension in the WT (<italic>F</italic><sub>i,wt</sub>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) would be interpreted as the increase in tension (relative to the mutants) produced by its shorter NL.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Neck linker length in wild-type kinesin has been optimized to maximize both unidirectional processivity and velocity</title><p>The general framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) provides a structure for evaluating the relative contributions of individual gates to the kinesin cycle. Because the rate of unbinding of the front head increases faster than that of the read head under increasing inter-head tension, the unbinding gate functions most efficiently at lower tension, or in its absence. Extensions of the NL abolished inter-head tension in kinesin, yet motors remained active, albeit at reduced speeds, and their stepping gates remained fully functional, suppressing rear-head rebinding even in constructs with NLs lengthened up to three AA. These considerations, taken on their own, suggest that NL extensions from 1 to 3 AA might lead to more effective gating, and consequently to greater processivity. Instead, the most pronounced effect of NL extension was a dramatic decrease in processivity. An explanation is that the dominant effect of lengthening the NL is to compromise the binding gate, and that the deleterious effect of NL length at this gate outweighs any compensating effects of reduced inter-head tension at the unbinding gate. We conclude that the key role played by NL length in kinesin gating is twofold: (1) to enhance processivity by facilitating binding of the tethered head to the forward MT site at the binding gate, and (2) to increase velocity by accelerating rear-head release from the 2-HB state at the unbinding gate.</p><p>In general, the kinesin-1 nanomechanical properties appear to be selected for processivity and velocity. Other cytoskeletal motors, including members of the kinesin, myosin, and dynein superfamilies, may be optimized to emphasize different combinations of useful characteristics, including stall force, load-bearing ability, velocity, processivity, directionality, or the ability to work cooperatively in groups, depending upon their roles in cells. Using the general gating framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the strategies adopted to optimize for a specific functionality could be characterized in terms of the extent to which each gate contributes to the overall cycle of a given motor. Because gating considerations unify the coupling of biochemical states and mechanical events, these may be of value in framing future investigations, as well as in re-evaluating previous work, on how dimeric motors are coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gennerich and Vale, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kull and Endow, 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Kinesin expression and purification</title><p>All <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> recombinant constructs, with the exception of CL mutants, were derived from a truncated sequence, comprising the first 559 AA of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinesin-1 heavy chain (KHC) with eGFP and a 6xHis-tag engineered at the C-terminus, hereafter referred to as DmK-WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shastry and Hancock, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Milic et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Andreasson et al. provides significant new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the highly processive motion of the microtubule-based motor protein, Kinesin-1. The presented results will likely cause a paradigm shift in the motor field as to how kinesin achieves its remarkable processivity. However, several points require additional clarifications. Please also consider the suggestions of the reviewers aimed at making the paper more clear for the general audience.</p><p>Specific comments and suggestions:</p><p>1) It would greatly help the readers who have not closely followed the field to explain in the Introduction what are the current models and controversies in the field, and which specific questions/controversies the authors are resolving in this study.</p><p>2) Interpretation of the results with the neck linker mutations: it is surprising that the different-length neck-linker mutants (which have in fact quite different AA's used as inserts) behave so similar. E.g. run lengths are basically indiscernible within experimental uncertainty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is even more striking for the velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This is rather surprising, given the quite large discrepancy for the two different 6AA inserts (both for fly and human kinesin) presented in the supplement. It would be important that the authors comment on this (they are, rightly, stringent to previous work using cysteine light constructs, so for this particular aspect more explanation would be in place). In this context, is the interpretation of the effect of different insertions only in terms of neck linker length and the reduction of inter-head tension fully justified? Is it possible that the conformational changes in the neck linker induced by the insertions play a role? Is it possible that inter-head tension is maintained to some extent in all mutants, and this explains why the constructs with up to 6 AA inserted retain significant functionality? Some additional discussion would be very helpful here.</p><p>3) The authors refer only once to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yildiz et al. 2008</xref>, a manuscript that describes quite similar kinesin constructs, but (mainly) using cysteine-free constructs. This last aspect is likely the reason why these data are not really discussed in detail. Surprisingly, the fluorescence polarization measurements of Asenjo et al. are mentioned and used as support for the observations / conclusions. Asenjo et al. also used a (maybe slightly different) cysteine light kinesin. It would be important to justify why certain published data are used for comparison and why other data are not.</p><p>4) Some additional explanations will be useful on the sentence “…the finding that assisting load fails to appreciably increase the WT velocity suggests that the rate of rear-head release by WT kinesin must be substantially higher than the rate-limiting step(s) of the mechanochemical cycle.” There are clarifications of this point in the Discussion, but here a bit more explanation might help.</p><p>5) In the subsection headed “The force-dependence of kinesin mutants with extended neck linkers can be accounted for by a minimal 3-state model”, the choices made for the model (which rates are force dependent, which are not, which ones are dependent on inter-head strain) could be explained in more detail. No alternative model is presented, please explain why this is the only one that makes sense and is worthy of trying. More explanation might help to get the point across.</p><p>6) The authors propose that the spatial orientation of the neck linker rather than inter-head tension facilitates the coordination of biochemical states (in the subsection entitled “Inter-head tension impairs, rather than aids, the unbinding gate in kinesin”). It would be nice to explain better what determines in this model the distinction between 2-HB state and 1-HB state with the tethered head positioned in front of the microtubule-bound head. Which signal accelerates the unbinding of the rear head upon binding of the leading head if tension is not involved and the neck linker has the same orientation in the 1-HB and 2-HB state?</p><p>7) It seems strange that results of the Supplementary file 1 are not properly incorporated into the paper. The authors present a harrowing finding, very important to the motor field: they show that commonly used cysteine-light kinesin mutants show indeed quite defective motility behavior, at least when studied in detail (force-dependent run-length, resolving individual steps). This is a very important finding that needs to be shared with the field (and should be a warning for anybody working with cysteine-light mutants!). It would be preferable if these results were properly incorporated in the Abstract and the main flow of the paper, so that they would become more visible. The authors should also explain better how these results affect their own as well as previously published conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07403.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It would greatly help the readers who have not closely followed the field to explain in the Introduction what are the current models and controversies in the field, and which specific questions/controversies the authors are resolving in this study</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion, and we have revised the manuscript to improve the contextualization of our work for the non-specialist.

Asenjo et al. also used a (maybe slightly different) cysteine light kinesin. It would be important to justify why certain published data are used for comparison and why other data are not</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their comment. With all respect, we cited the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yildiz et al. 2008</xref> paper four times (and not “only once”) in our original manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we now cite it eight times. We also note that we cited three papers by Asenjo et al., one of which (Asenjo et al., Nat. Struct. Biol., 2003) is used to support the notion that kinesin is gated by the spatial orientation of the neck linker. As the reviewers correctly note, the 2008 study by Yildiz and coworkers adopted a similar strategy, probing gating through the use of kinesin constructs with extended neck linkers. A central conclusion by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yildiz et al. (2008)</xref>, along with related work (Yildiz et al., Science, 2004), is that the ATP-waiting state of the kinesin dimer is a two-heads-bound state (2-HB). However, at least three subsequent publications, only one of which was published by my group, have argued that this conclusion is erroneous, and that the ATP-waiting state is, in fact, a one-head-bound state (1-HB) instead (Asenjo and Sosa, PNAS, 2009; Guydosh and Block, Nature, 2009; Toprak et al<italic>., PNAS,</italic> 2009). The discrepancy in conclusions here might be attributable to the cysteine-light constructs employed by Yildiz et al<italic>.</italic>, just as the reviewers implies. However, it may equally well be due to their use of non-physiological, low-salt conditions that are known to enhance electrostatic interactions between the rear head of kinesin and the microtubule, as previously suggested by Shastry and Hancock (Curr. Biol., 2010). We recognize that the three papers that we cited from the Sosa group (Asenjo et al., Nat. Struct. Biol., 2003; Asenjo et al., Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol., 2006; Asenjo and Sosa, PNAS, 2009) also used similar constructs and buffer conditions as the fluorescence experiments of Yildiz and coworkers. However, unlike Yildiz et al<italic>.</italic>, the fluorescence polarization measurements carried out by Sosa et al<italic>.</italic> allowed them to disambiguate the 2-HB state, where the rear head is bound to the microtubule, from the 1-HB state, where the rear head may, on average, be situated near the microtubule without being bound to it.</p><p>In our opinion, any conclusions regarding the ATP-waiting state, based either on inter-head distance or the position of the tethered head, are likely to be untrustworthy from those studies that employ buffers at very low ionic strength. Clearly, kinesin molecules do not operate in cells under such extremes. Some labs have resorted to using low-<italic>Z</italic> buffers because these greatly increase kinesin processivity (by electrostatically preventing kinesin-microtubule dissociation), resulting in longer run lengths that are more conveniently measured. However, there is a concern that this is artifactual. We agree that understanding the salient differences among the various study conditions is important, but we feel that a detailed digression on these issues in our own manuscript would (1) require too much space and (2) detract from our main point, which is the presentation of a general framework for gating. This is a topic that would be better dealt with in a critical review of the field, where such comparisons are more appropriate.</p><p><italic>4) Some additional explanations will be useful on the sentence “…the finding that assisting load fails to appreciably increase the WT velocity suggests that the rate of rear-head release by WT kinesin must be substantially higher than the rate-limiting step(s) of the mechanochemical cycle.” There are clarifications of this point in the Discussion, but here a bit more explanation might help</italic>.</p><p>We’ve accepted the reviewers’ suggestion to provide more explanation at this point, prior to the Discussion, and we therefore added a sentence at the end of the paragraph in question. That said, we would prefer not to get too far ahead of ourselves, and prefer to defer additional interpretations of the data to the Discussion section of the paper, which is the more conventional way of presenting things. Doing so allows us to discuss these particular findings in the context of the remainder of the dataset and other findings, together with a model that accounts quantitatively for the observations.</p><p><italic>5) In the subsection headed “The force-dependence of kinesin mutants with extended neck linkers can be accounted for by a minimal 3-state model”, the choices made for the model (which rates are force dependent, which are not, which ones are dependent on inter-head strain) could be explained in more detail. No alternative model is presented, please explain why this is the only one that makes sense and is worthy of trying. More explanation might help to get the point across</italic>.</p><p>In our revised manuscript, we’ve significantly expanded the text at this point to explain our choices in detail. However, we note here that there is no such thing as a unique model for kinesin motor motility. Furthermore, it is not practical to model a two-head walk with any fewer than three states. Although more complex models may always be advanced that incorporate additional features and states, we contend that the three-state model represents the minimal one that’s able to capture the most important features of the data.</p><p><italic>6) The authors propose that the spatial orientation of the neck linker rather than inter-head tension facilitates the coordination of biochemical states (in the subsection entitled “Inter-head tension impairs, rather than aids, the unbinding gate in kinesin”). It would be nice to explain better what determines in this model the distinction between 2-HB state and 1-HB state with the tethered head positioned in front of the microtubule-bound head. Which signal accelerates the unbinding of the rear head upon binding of the leading head if tension is not involved and the neck linker has the same orientation in the 1-HB and 2-HB state?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment, and we’ve adjusted the manuscript accordingly. Gating is best appreciated in the context of a competition between two rates. In the 2-HB state, it’s a competition between the unbinding of the rear head vs. unbinding of the front head. In this case, although tension is certainly present in the 2-HB state for wild-type kinesin, it is the inhibition of the front head, and not the acceleration of rear-head release, that supplies the strong bias for rear-head detachment, leading to forward stepping. In the 2-HB state, it is the orientation of the NL, rather than any inter-head tension, that primarily leads to unidirectional motion along the microtubule. These are two of the key conclusions of our study, in fact. These conclusions are supported strongly by the data we present here, and they are further corroborated by evidence previously published by my group, as well as several others (which we cite). However, our conclusions do run contrary to other published findings, particularly those of the Vale and Yildiz groups (which we also cite). That said, we feel that the quality (and extent) of our data speaks for itself, and is more persuasive. Furthermore, in light of our findings about artifacts that can be produced by the use of human cys-light mutants, we feel that some of the earlier work will need to be re-examined with a closer eye (please see the next point).</p><p><italic>7) It seems strange that results of the Supplementary file 1 are not properly incorporated into the paper. The authors present a harrowing finding, very important to the motor field: they show that commonly used cysteine-light kinesin mutants show indeed quite defective motility behavior, at least when studied in detail (force-dependent run-length, resolving individual steps). This is a very important finding that needs to be shared with the field (and should be a warning for anybody working with cysteine-light mutants!). It would be preferable if these results were properly incorporated in the Abstract and the main flow of the paper, so that they would become more visible. The authors should also explain better how these results affect their own as well as previously published conclusions</italic>.</p><p>We’re gratified to learn that the reviewers found our results on the unusual properties of cysteine-light mutants to be interesting and worthwhile. Yes, this study has become something of a cautionary tale for all who work with such mutants under the assumption that they exhibit wild-type behavior<italic>.</italic> We agree that it is necessary and important to get the word out about this. We’d initially relegated the sections on cysteine-light mutants to the Supplementary file, in order to not detract from our main story about kinesin gating. But, in response to the reviewers’ comments, we’ve now adjusted the manuscript to fully re-integrate the text previously found in Supplementary file 1 into the main paper, with some minor modifications. The previous Results section of Supplementary file 1 is now found at the end of the Results section of the main text. The previous Discussion section of Supplementary file 1 is now the penultimate subsection of Discussion in the main text (and also includes additional text to address Point 2 above). We take up the reviewers’ suggestion to explain how the cysteine-light results might affect the conclusions we’ve advanced, and include extensive references to the previous literature that used these. To that end, we’ve also added a brief paragraph towards the end of our discussion of these findings, commenting on how our results speak to existing body of kinesin literature. We’ve also modified the Abstract to mention the cysteine-light results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
