success of social insects and leads to division of labor among colony members. Response thresholds to task-specific stimuli are thought to proximally regulate behavioral specialization, but their neurobiological regulation is complex and not well understood. Here, we show that response thresholds to task-relevant stimuli correspond to the specialization of three behavioral phenotypes of honeybee workers in the well-studied and important <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> and <italic>Apis cerana</italic>. Quantitative neuropeptidome comparisons suggest two tachykinin-related peptides (TRP2 and TRP3) as candidates for the modification of these response thresholds. Based on our characterization of their receptor binding and downstream signaling, we confirm a functional role of tachykinin signaling in regulating specific responsiveness of honeybee workers: TRP2 injection and RNAi-mediated downregulation cause consistent, opposite effects on responsiveness to task-specific stimuli of each behaviorally specialized phenotype but not to stimuli that are unrelated to their tasks. Thus, our study demonstrates that TRP signaling regulates the degree of task-specific responsiveness of specialized honeybee workers and may control the context specificity of behavior in animals more generally.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Apis mellifera</italic></kwd><kwd>social evolution</kwd><kwd>division of labor</kwd><kwd>animal behavior</kwd><kwd>specialization</kwd><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970428</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAAS-ASTIP-2015-IAR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jianke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Project for Upgrading the Beekeeping Industry of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jianke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009997</institution-id><institution>Earmarked Fund for Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CARS-44</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jianke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011862</institution-id><institution>University of North Carolina at Greensboro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rueppell</surname><given-names>Olav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neuropeptide tachykinin signaling acts as master regulator of behavioral specialization in honeybees by differentially modulating worker responsiveness to task-specific stimuli.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Behavioral responses of animals to external and internal stimuli have evolved to optimize survival and reproduction under average circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darwin, 1859</xref>). However, environmental and interindividual variability commonly causes deviations from the average, resulting in selection for context-specific and condition-dependent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dall et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolnick et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">West-Eberhard, 1989</xref>). Such plasticity is limited and evolutionary constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold, 1992</xref>) of behavior occurs in the form of behavioral syndromes: differences among individuals that manifest across different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sih et al., 2004</xref>). Advantages of behavioral plasticity and specificity have been documented in many systems and some neuroendocrine mechanisms have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">OâConnell and Hofmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). However, neural mechanisms that allow the sophistication of behavioral repertoires by regulating the contextÂ specificity of behavioral responses remain insufficiently understood.</p><p>Behavioral regulation is particularly important in social species in which social interactions provide a high diversity of behavioral context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oliveira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gronenberg and Riveros, 2009</xref>). Social evolution also allows individuals to restrict their behavioral repertoires through temporal or permanent behavioral specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oster and Wilson, 1978</xref>). This specialization and the resulting division of labor are believed to be major contributors to the successful colony life of many social insects despite its potential costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jeanson and WeidenmÃ¼ller, 2014</xref>). Advanced social evolution thus allows interindividual plasticity to replace individual behavioral plasticity. Nevertheless, the principal problem of behavioral plasticity across different contexts remains the same, and social insects can be constrained in their behavioral evolution by correlated selection responses across different behaviors or castes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rueppell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jandt et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Behavior often occurs in response to a specific stimulus exceeding an individualâs specific response threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tinbergen, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mayr, 1974</xref>). Response thresholds depend on internal physiological states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ricklefs and Wikelski, 2002</xref>) and translate the value of perceived stimuli into probabilities of behavioral responses and vary among individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scheiner et al., 2004</xref>). In social insects, individual variation in response thresholds is linked to division of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Theraulaz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beshers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Robinson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schulz et al., 2002</xref>), and numerous studies have characterized this link across multiple levels of biological organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scheiner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Page et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson, 2010</xref>). The Western honeybee (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) is the most-studied social insect model. Many aspects of its division of labor are driven by a lifelong behavioral ontogeny, leading to ageÂ polyethism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seeley, 1982</xref>). Young bees perform numerous inside tasks, most prominently brood care in form of alloparental nursing behavior, before transitioning to a mix of other in-hive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson, 2008</xref>). Similar to the highlyÂ specialized nursing stage, the final behavioral state of older bees as outside foragers is almost exclusive of other tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seeley, 1982</xref>). Moreover, foragers often specialize on collecting only one of the principal food sources, pollen or nectar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Page et al., 2000</xref>). Specialized nurseÂ beesÂ (NBs), nectar foragersÂ (NFs), and pollen foragersÂ (PFs) are also found in the closelyÂ related Eastern honeybee, <italic>Apis cerana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ji et al., 2020</xref>), thus offering a suitable parallel system for our study.</p><p>The behavioral specialists of NBs, NFs, and PFs exhibit pronounced differences in their responsiveness to task-related stimuli. Responsiveness to brood pheromones peaks at typical nursing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pankiw, 2004</xref>). In contrast, foragers have a lower response threshold to sugars and light than nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeÄirmenci et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Shahar et al., 2003</xref>). Among foragers, pollen specialists exhibit higher responsiveness to sucrose and pollen stimuli than NFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Page et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pankiw and Page, 1999</xref>). Response thresholds can be quantified based on the honeybeesâ reflexive extension of their proboscis in response to stimuli, such as sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scheiner et al., 2004</xref>). The spontaneous proboscis extension reflex (PER) to sucrose has been expanded to other stimuli that bees spontaneously respond to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nicholls and de Ibarra, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2020</xref> and conditioned stimuli to which no spontaneous responses occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giurfa and Sandoz, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Response thresholds can be modified by biogenic amines, and dopamine, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine, octopamine, and tyramine have been implicated in the regulation of different behaviors of worker bees although the mechanisms are not entirely clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schulz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scheiner et al., 2006</xref>). Few studies have addressed the role of neuropeptides although they are a diverse group of neurotransmitters that can also act as neurohormones on distal targets to coordinate a wide range of internal states and behavioral processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">NÃ¤ssel, 2002</xref>). Neuropeptides are intimately involved in food perception and social interaction of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schoofs et al., 2017</xref>), two processes that are central to division of labor in social insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ament et al., 2010</xref>). Neuropeptides mediate pheromonal effects on physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shankar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gendron et al., 2014</xref>) and usually exhibit a high degree of specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taghert and Nitabach, 2012</xref>). Therefore, neuropeptides are prime candidates for mediating the independent adjustment of socially relevant response thresholds and they have been implicated in honeybee worker specialization and division of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ji et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brockmann et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>More than 100 mature neuropeptides derived from 22 protein precursors have been identified in the Western honeybee, <italic>A. mellifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boerjan et al., 2010</xref>). Several neuropeptides, including allatostatin, leucokinin, and tachykinin-related peptides (TRPs), may be involved in the control of social behavior of <italic>A. mellifera</italic> and the closely related <italic>A. cerana</italic>, such as aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pratavieira et al., 2018</xref>), foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ji et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brockmann et al., 2009</xref>), brood care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2015</xref>), and possibly a wide array of other behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pratavieira et al., 2014</xref>). However, most of these results are based on correlations between behavior and neuropeptide expression, and more detailed studies are needed to understand the causal roles of neuropeptides in the behavioral specialization among honeybee workers.</p><p>Here, we report the results of a comprehensive study to test the hypothesis that neuropeptides regulate the division of labor in honeybees. We initially compared response thresholds to task-relevant stimuli among behaviorallyÂ defined worker groups (NBs, NFs, PFs) of the two closely related honeybee species <italic>A. mellifera</italic> and <italic>A. cerana</italic>. These response thresholds were correlated with neuropeptide expression levels, especially TRPs, suggesting a role of TRPs in worker specialization. Based on these results, we demonstrated in a series of TRP injections and RNAi-mediated knockdown of the <italic>TRP</italic> and its receptor (<italic>TRPR</italic>) a causal role of this pathway in modulating different response thresholds in a task-specific manner. We characterized the TRP signaling pathway molecularly by studying the TRPR properties and the important downstream events of cAMP and calcium accumulation and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in cell culture. Finally, we confirmed this connection in vivo by demonstrating corresponding effects of TRP injections and RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>TRP</italic> and <italic>TRPR</italic> on ERK phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The task-specific responsiveness of worker bees showed significant variations between behavioral phenotypes and the two honeybee species</title><p>Based on the response threshold model for division of labor, we initially studied the responsiveness of three different behavioral phenotypes to three different task-relevant stimuli in <italic>A. mellifera</italic> and <italic>A. cerana</italic> using the PER assay.

The success of social insects is partly due to their efficient division of labor, a form of behavioral plasticity among instead of within individuals. In this study, we demonstrated that the responsiveness to task-relevant stimuli correlates with behavioral specialization in two different honeybee species. Through parallel characterization of the neuropeptidome, we identified two tachykinin-related peptides (TRP2 and TRP3) as putative mechanism to adjust task-specific response thresholds and thus proximally guide division of labor. Subsequently, we characterized the molecular action of TRP2 and TRP3 in cell culture by verifying their binding to their membrane-bound receptor and demonstrating activation of multiple downstream signaling mechanisms. Finally, we verified causal involvement of TRP signaling in modulating task-specific behavioral response thresholds through complementary outcomes of TRP2 injection and RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>TRP</italic> and <italic>TRPR</italic>: while injection decreased task-specific responses, downregulation of TRP or TRPR increased the same specific responses. Thus, we present a mechanism that tunes the behavioral responsiveness of animals to specific stimuli compared to others. We use behaviorally specialized honeybee workers as models but hypothesize that this function of TRP signaling could be more widely conserved to adjust the contextÂ specificity of behavioral responses in animals.</p><p>Among all the signaling molecules in the nervous system, neuropeptides represent the largest and most diverse category and are crucial in orchestrating various biological processes and behavioral actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burbach, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">HÃ¶kfelt et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, we quantitatively compared the entire neuropeptidome among three behavioral worker phenotypes of AML and ACC without an aÂ priori assumption. In addition to discovering several new neuropeptides from the ACC and AML brain, we identified TRP2 and TRP3 as candidates. TRPs have been associated with the modulation of appetitive olfactory sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Winther et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gui et al., 2017</xref>), foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pratavieira et al., 2018</xref>), sex pheromone perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shankar et al., 2015</xref>), and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>). Particularly in honeybees, <italic>TRP</italic> is preferentially expressed in the mushroom body and some neurons scattered in the antennal and optic lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Takeuchi et al., 2004</xref>), and some expression has also been found in antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jain and Brockmann, 2020</xref>). These expression patterns are consistent with our hypothesis that TRPÂ signaling may be modulating behavioral responsiveness due to various inputs. Although specific knockdown of TRPs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has revealed spatially variable effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">NÃ¤ssel et al., 2019</xref>), the changes in response thresholds that we found are most likely due to systemic manipulation of TRP or TRPR levels. Global TRP expression in the honeybee worker brain also increases during the transition from nursing to foraging, further implicating it in the regulation ofÂ honeybee social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pratavieira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Takeuchi et al., 2003</xref>). The spatiotemporal expression of <italic>TRPR</italic> remains to be explored in <italic>A. mellifera</italic> and <italic>A. cerana</italic>, but the specific functions that have been linked to specific neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ki et al., 2015</xref>) suggests that this information is critical for more detailed mechanistic models of the behavioral effects of tachykinin in honeybees.</p><p>In our study, only expression of TRP2 and TRP3 varied consistently among behavioral phenotypes of AML and ACC. In both species, TRP2 and TRP3 were most abundant in the brain of NFs, followed by PFs, and finally NBs. This is consistent with the very specific responsiveness of NBs to brood stimuli observed in our PER experiments, while the responsiveness of PFs and NFs was successively less specific: PFs responded specifically to two stimuli, while NFs did not show specifically strong responses to any stimuli. Moreover, the comparison between AML and ACC indicated higher TRP2 and TRP3 abundance in ACC in each behavioral phenotype, commensurate with the less specific PER responsiveness in ACC compared to AML. A few other neuropeptides, such as apidaecins, diuretic hormone, and prohormone-3, showed somewhat similar expression patterns in both species, but none of these was as tightly correlated to behavioral responsiveness and none has previously been connected with behavioral regulation in insects or other animals. Therefore, the TRPs were chosen as candidates of the control of honeybee division of labor for subsequent functional tests and molecular characterization.</p><p>The action of most insect neuropeptides is mediated by binding to GPCRs and often involves cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> as second messengers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauser et al., 2006</xref>). The TRPR is activated by TRPs triggering intracellular cAMP accumulation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in fruit flies and silkworms (<italic>Bombyx mori</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birse et al., 2006</xref>), while no cAMPÂ responses were discovered in stable flies (<italic>Stomoxys calcitrans</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Poels et al., 2007</xref>). The results of our peptide-based binding assays functionally confirmed that the honeybee TRPR is indeed the receptor for TRP2 and TRP3. The subsequent functional assays revealed that TRP signaling results in a dose-dependent increase in both intracellular cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Together, these results indicate that TRPs can activate TRPR and trigger second messengers to regulate downstream functions. TRP2 displayed a higher affinity to TRPR and induced higher cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling than TRP3, leading us to focus on TRP2 in the later in vivo experiments. Moreover, TRP signaling is sensitive to G<sub>Î±s</sub> activation and is significantly blocked by G<sub>Î±q</sub> and PKA inhibitors, suggesting both G<sub>Î±s</sub> and G<sub>Î±q</sub> are involved in TRP signaling in honeybees. Many GPCRs are able to induce mitogen-activated protein kinaseÂ cascades via cooperation of G<sub>Î±s</sub>, G<sub>Î±q</sub>, and G<sub>Î±i</sub> signals, leading to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which plays critical roles in diverse biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rozengurt, 2007</xref>). Our results indicate that honeybee TRP signaling mediates phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in both HEK293 and Sf21 cells. In addition, ERK1/2 activation was significantly inhibited by the PKA, PKC, and MEK inhibitors, which is in line with the observation of intracellular cAMP accumulation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization. Thus, honeybees seem to be very similar to silkworms with regard to the involvement of the G<sub>Î±s</sub>/cAMP/PKA and G<sub>Î±q</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKC signaling pathways in the regulation of TRP-induced ERK1/2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that the honeybee TRPR is specifically activated by TRPs, eliciting intracellular cAMP accumulation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, and ERK phosphorylation by dually coupling G<sub>Î±s</sub> and G<sub>Î±q</sub> signaling pathways.</p><p>Our in vitro and in vivo demonstrations that TRP signaling activates the ERK pathway indicated that the basic signaling mechanisms are conforming to the general patterns in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Werry et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, our behavioral results may extend to other species. ERK links TRP signaling also to the insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) pathway. IIS is controlled by neuropeptides through ERK in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2008</xref>), and this connection in honeybees ties TRP back to the age-based division of labor among workers: IIS influences the timing of the behavioral maturation of honeybee workers and brain <italic>AmIlp1</italic> is significantly higher expressed in foragers than nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ament et al., 2008</xref>), consistent with our finding that TRPs are higher in foragers than nurses. Numerous other physiological changes accompany the transition from in-hive nurses to foragers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scheiner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robinson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toth and Robinson, 2005</xref>, and our results integrate TRPs as the most important neuropeptides into the regulation of the behavioral ontogeny of honeybee workers and potential feedback loops to the modulation of behavioral response thresholds. The specialization of NFs and PFs has also been linked to IIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hunt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) and explained by differences in sucrose response thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pankiw and Page, 2000</xref>). Our findings here may connect the differences in response thresholds and IIS mechanistically through the TRP and ERK signaling pathways.</p><p>The PER paradigm is wellÂ suited to test behavioral response thresholds and has been used for over 50 years in honeybees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giurfa and Sandoz, 2012</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, we found PFs to be more responsive to sucrose than NFs and NBs in <italic>A. mellifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Page et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, we found corresponding differences between these behavioral groups in the closely related <italic>A. cerana</italic>. The PFâs responsiveness to low sucrose concentrations might also make them more responsive to pollen, but the causation of the PER to pollen is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">GrÃ¼ter et al., 2008</xref>) and other components of pollen may functionally distinguish pollen from sucrose responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nicholls and de Ibarra, 2013</xref>). Our results support the view that pollen and sucrose are distinct stimuli: While our experimental manipulations of TRP signaling altered the responsiveness of PFs to pollen and sucrose, only responsiveness to sucrose was affected in NFs and only responsiveness to larvae was affected in NBs. The functional significance of the PER in response to larvae is currently unclear, but we show that it is specific to nurses and it has previously been linked to brood provisioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, our diverse PER results in two species comprehensively support the hypothesis that task-specific response thresholds guide behavioral specialization, leading to division of labor among honeybee workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Theraulaz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beshers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Robinson, 1992</xref>).</p><p>TRPs may adjust specific sensory neural circuits, potentially acting in concert with other neuromodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kahsai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jung et al., 2013</xref>). However, we have currently no evidence to support the hypothesis of different molecular TRP actions in different stimulus-response pathways (cf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ki et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we have to restrict our conclusion to the simple hypothesis that TRP signaling decreases task-specific response thresholds of behavioral specialists without affecting non-task-related thresholds: It decreases pollen and sucrose responsiveness in PFs, sucrose responsiveness in NFs, and responsiveness to larvae in NBs. TRP signaling in honeybees may thus be a general regulator of how task-specific stimuli are weighted relative to others and consequently how specialized behavioral specialists are (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This effect translates to different degrees of division of labor in social insect colonies and may control the contextÂ specificity of behavioral responses in animals more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sih et al., 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Conceptual model representation the TRPÂ signaling effect.</title><p>Worker honeybees specialize into nurse bees, pollen foragers, and nectar foragers through various influences and display task-specific response thresholds to brood (blue bar), pollen (orange bar), and nectar (yellow bar) stimuli.

This study demonstrates the task-specific response thresholds and how TRP/TRPR signaling affects these thresholds. The predicted behavioral effects of increasing (high) or decreasing (low) the specialization of the behavioral phenotypes remains to be demonstrated.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64830-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Although AML and ACC are close relatives with similar basic biology, some behavioral differences have evolved since their speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oldroyd and Wongsiri, 2009</xref>). AML and ACC share the age-based division of labor, with younger bees specializing on nursing before maturing to foraging activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hepburn and Radloff, 2011</xref>) and ACC foragers also specialize in nectar or pollen collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ji et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rueppell et al., 2008</xref>) similar to AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Page et al., 2000</xref>). Accordingly, we found the main differences of stimulus responsiveness and TRPs' expression among worker phenotypes conserved. However, ACC exhibited less responses to the task-specific stimuli than AML. Consistent PER differences in AML and ACC between NFs and PFs and a generally lower responsiveness of ACC have been identified before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), but the biological interpretation has remained unclear. It is possible that the species differences arise due to methodological bias, favoring AML performance in PER assays. However, our study offers the alternative explanation that ACC workers are less specialized than AML workers due to higher TRP signaling. Lower innate specialization may accompany better learning of ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qin et al., 2012</xref>), facilitating its more opportunistic worker task allocation and resource exploitation than AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tan et al., 2008</xref>). These alternative life history strategies are plausible, given the typical differences in colony size and habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sih et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ruttner, 1988</xref>). All three worker phenotypes of ACC exhibited higher levels of TRPs than their AML counterparts, but functional verification at the level of colony phenotypes will be required to unambiguously link TRP signaling to such interspecific differences in life history.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

apiary of the Institute of Apicultural Research at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing. Three colonies of each species with mated queens of identical age were selected as experimental colonies, and before experiments the colonies were equalized in terms of adult bee population, brood combs, and food storage. Frames containing old pupae (1â2 days before emergence) were put into an incubator (34Â°C and 80% relative humidity) for eclosion. Newly emerged worker bees were paint-marked on their thoraxes and placed back into their parent colonies. Ten days later, marked bees that had their head and thorax in open brood cells while contracting their abdomen for more than 10 s were collected as NBs. Twenty days after eclosion, marked bees were collected during early morning (between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.) in good weather conditions during the blooming period of black locusts (<italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> L.) as forager bees. The entrance to the hives were blocked to facilitate collecting. Bees flying into the hive with pollen loads were collected as PFs, returning foragers without pollen loads were collected as NFs. The experimental design of six groups (three behavioral phenotypes in two species) was used to compare responsiveness to task-specific stimuli ('Comparative PER experiments' section) and to relate these phenotypes to differences in the brain neuropeptidome ('QuantitativeÂ comparisons of brain neuropeptidomes'Â section).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Comparative PER experiments</title><p>To investigate the responsiveness of different worker bee behavioral phenotypes (NBs, PFs, and NFs of AML and ACC) to different stimulus modalities (sucrose solution, pollen, and larva), series of PER experiments were performed. One hundred bees of each behavioral phenotype were collected from each experimental colony in the morning, transferred to the laboratory and narcotized on ice, then harnessed using a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang and Tan, 2014</xref>). All harnessed bees were fed to satiation with 50% sucrose solution and placed in a dark incubator (20Â°C and 65% relative humidity) overnight. After 24 hr, all surviving bees were assayed for their PER following the methodology of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Page et al., 1998</xref>. Each stimulus was assessed independently with a new set of bees.</p><p>To investigate the sucrose responsiveness, bees were assayed using an ascending order of sucrose concentrations: 0.1%, 0.3%, 1%, 3%, 10%, and 30% (weight/weight). A small droplet of each solution was touched to the beesâ antennae for 3 s and the extension of the proboscis was monitored during this time. The interval between each sucrose solution trial was 5 min to exclude sensitization or habituation effects. The total number of PER responses after stimulation with the six different sucrose concentrations was combined into an SRS of a bee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pankiw et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scheiner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scheiner et al., 2003</xref>). The SRSs of the three behavioral phenotypes in the same species were compared using Kruskal-Wallis tests with Bonferroni correction. Pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests were used for comparing the same phenotype from two honeybee species. The sucrose responsiveness for specific sucrose concentrations was further compared between different groups with independent chi-square tests.</p><p>To test pollen stimulation, fresh pollen loads that had been removed from the leg of randomly selected PFs of the test group were used: AML were tested with pollen collected by AML foragers and ACC with pollen collected by ACC foragers. These loads contained a mixture of different pollen, predominated by black locust (<italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic>). As a control for mechanical stimulation, each bee had both antennae first touched with a piece of filter paper and spontaneous responders were excluded. Subsequently, both antennae of each bee were gently touched with a pollen load and PER responses were recorded. The pollen responsiveness was compared with independent chi-square tests between different groups.</p><p>To test responsiveness to larva, 1-day-old larvae from each honeybee species were collected, briefly rinsed in distilled water to remove royal jelly residue and dried on a filter paper. As before, both antennae of bees were touched with a piece of filter paper first and spontaneous responders were excluded, then PERs in response to a larva touching the antennae were recorded. The responsiveness to larvae was compared with independent chi-square tests between different groups. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS StatisticsÂ 20.0 (IBM, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Quantitative comparisons of brain neuropeptidomes</title><p>To explore brain neuropeptide functions in behavioral regulation, a label-free quantitative strategy was employed to compare neuropeptidomic variations between behavioral phenotypes and the two honeybee species. Three independent biological replicate samples (120 beesÂ perÂ sample) of NBs, PFs, and NFs of both AML and ACC (18 samples total) were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Individual brains were carefully dissected from the head capsule while remaining chilled on ice, and the dissected brains were frozen at â80Â°C until neuropeptide extraction.</p><p>The brains were homogenized at 4Â°C by using a 90:9:1 solution of methanol, H<sub>2</sub>O, and acetic acid. The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. The resulting supernatant containing the neuropeptides was collected and dried. The extracted neuropeptide samples were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid in distilled water, and the peptide concentration was quantified using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Buï¬er A (0.1% formic acid in water) and buï¬er B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) were used as mobile phase buffers. Neuropeptides were separated using the following gradients: from 3% to 8% buffer B in 5 min, from 8% to 20% buffer B in 80 min, from 20% to 30% buffer B in 20 min, from 30% to 90% buffer B in 5 min, and remaining at 90% buffer B for 10 min. The eluted neuropeptides were injected into the mass spectrometer via a nano-ESI source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Ion signals were collected in a data-dependent mode and run with the following settings: full scan resolution at 70,000, automatic gain control (AGC) target 3Â ÃÂ 10<sup>6</sup>; maximum inject time (MIT) 20 ms; scan range m/z 300â1800; MS/MS scans resolution at 17,500; AGC target 1Â ÃÂ 10<sup>5</sup>; MIT 60 ms; isolation window 2 m/z; normalized collision energy 27; loop count 10; and dynamic exclusion:charge exclusion: unassigned, 1, 8,Â &gt;8; peptide match preferred; exclude isotopes on; dynamic exclusion: 30 s. Raw data were retrieved using Xcalibur 3.0 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p><p>The extracted MS/MS spectra were searched against a composite database of <italic>A. mellifera</italic> (23,491 protein sequences, downloaded from NCBI on July 2018) or <italic>A. cerana</italic> (20,934 protein sequences, downloaded from NCBI on July 2018) using in-house PEAKS 8.5 software (Bioinformatics Solutions, Canada). Amidation (A, â0.98) and pyro-glu from Q (P, â17.03) were selected as variable modifications. The other parameters used were: parent ion mass tolerance, 20.0 ppm; fragment ion mass tolerance, 0.05 Da; enzyme, none; maximum allowed variable PTM per peptide, 2. A fusion target-decoy approach was used for the estimation of the false discovery rate and controlled atÂ â¤1.0% (â10 log pâ¥20.0) both at protein and peptide levels. Neuropeptide identifications were only used ifÂ â¥2 spectra were identified in at least two of the three replicates of each sample type.</p><p>Quantitative comparison of brain neuropeptidomes was performed by the label-free approach in PEAKS Q module. Feature detection was performed separately on each sample by using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The features of the same peptide from different samples were reliably aligned together using a high-performance retention time alignment algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Peptide features were considered significantly different between experimental groups if pairwise p&lt;0.01 and fold changeÂ â¥1.5. A heat map of differentially expressed proteins was created by Gene cluster 3.0 using the unsupervised hierarchical clustering, and the result was visualized using Java Tree view software.

The primers used for qPCR are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>.</p><p>After determination of knockdown efficiencies (see 'Results'Â section), 24 hr post-injection was chosen as the timeÂ point to study the PER effects of dsRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>TRP</italic> and <italic>TRPR</italic>. About 200 bees of each behavioral phenotype (NBs, PFs, and NFs of AML) were collected in the morning, harnessed, and remained in a dark incubator to acclimatize. After 30 min, all surviving bees of each behavioral phenotype were evenly divided into three groups, injected with ds<italic>TRP</italic>, ds<italic>TRPR</italic>, and ds<italic>GFP,</italic> and kept as described above. After 24 hr, all surviving bees were assayed for their PER to stimulations of sucrose solution, pollen, or larvae as described in 'Comparative PER experiments' section. Each stimulus was assessed with a new set of bees containing about 55 individuals for each treatment group (ds<italic>TRP</italic>, ds<italic>TRPR</italic>, and ds<italic>GFP</italic>). The SRSs of the <italic>TRP</italic>-knockdown<italic>, TRPR</italic>-knockdown, and control groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis tests with Bonferroni correction for each behavioral phenotype separately. The sucrose responsiveness was further compared between the different groups at the same sucrose concentration with independent chi-square tests. The responsiveness to pollen and larvae was compared between the <italic>TRP</italic>Â knockdown<italic>, TRPR</italic>Â knockdown, and control groups using independent chi-square tests for each behavioral phenotype separately. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Statistics 20.0 (IBM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Effects of TRP2 injection and RNAi-mediated downregulation of <italic>TRP</italic> and <italic>TRPR</italic> on ERK signaling in honeybee workers</title><p>To test whether manipulating TRP/TRPR signaling has effect on honeybee ERK signaling, a group of 10 individual worker bees were collected from each injection group (ddH<sub>2</sub>O, TRP2, ds<italic>TRP</italic>, ds<italic>TRPR</italic>, and ds<italic>GFP</italic>) to compare ERK phosphorylation levels. Three independent replicate groups per condition were collected and Western blot analyses were performed: Honeybee brains were carefully dissected and frozen at â80Â°C until protein extraction. Brain protein extractions were carried out according to our previously described method with some modifications. Briefly, the larvae were homogenized with lysis buffer (LB, 8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mM Tris-base, 30 mM dithiothreitol). The mixture was homogenized for 30 min on ice and sonicated 20 s per 5 min during this time, then centrifuged at 12,000 g and 4Â°C for 10 min. Ice-cold acetone was added to the collected supernatants, and then the mixture was kept on ice for 30 min for protein precipitation. Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g and 4Â°C for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellets were resolved in LB and kept at â20Â°C for further use. Western blot analyses were performed as described inÂ 'TRP/TRPR signaling targets: cAMP, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and ERK'Â section.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

The authors identify tachykinin signaling through a neuropeptidomics approach and verify its role in modulating behavior through an in vivo gain-of-function as well as loss-of-function analysis. They find that Tachykinin signaling reduces the response of bees to their task-specific stimuli, and its absence enhances it.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Regulation of Behavioral Specialization: Tachykinin Inhibits Task-Specific Behavioral Responsiveness in Honeybee Workers&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Sonia Sen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Olena Riabinina (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>We have a few major concerns/comments that the authors need to consider, these are listed below:</p><p>There were issues with the writing that would help the reader.</p><p>Abstract and Introduction: These are written in overly general terms. There are some really nice ideas about behaviour, response threshold, and constraints on them that might be lost on the non-specialist reader. Some specific points that need addressing are:</p><p>A rationale for studying neuropeptides and choosing exactly these two species.</p><p>Some information on signalling pathway characterised in the cell culture experiments so that experiment are understood more easily.</p><p>Support for statements with relevant examples. For example, in line 96 â &quot;two honeybee species&quot; â what species exactly?</p><p>Results: This section would be greatly improved if the authors put their findings in context with a motivation and a brief description of the approach taken at the top of each section. For example, what are the implications of the findings described in 2.1? How do they lead the authors to the experiments done in 2.2? It would also help to have a brief concluding summary of finding at the end of each section.</p><p>Discussion: In our opinion, a clearer discussion around the function of tachykinin signalling in behavioural specialization in honey bees is needed. Specifically:</p><p>Do their results indicate that tachykinin has any causal function in behavioural specialization? If they are suggesting that it does, they might have tested whether changes in tachykinin signaling make nectar foragers to pollen foragers or vice versa? (We are not asking for these experiments, however.)</p><p>Do the specific responses of nurse bees, pollen and nectar foragers depend on different levels of tachykinin or a different spatial expression of the tachykinin receptor? Here the authors might discuss published findings.</p><p>If &quot;Response thresholds can be modified by biogenic amines, and dopamine, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine, octopamine, and tyramine have been implicated in the regulation of different behaviours of worker bees&quot;, what might their functional role be? To be more precise, tyramine and recently leucokinin have been shown to affect sucrose response thresholds in pollen and nectar foragers in similar ways than tachykinin (see: Scheiner et al., 2013; Scheiner et al., 2017; Thamm et al., 2017; Ji et al., 2020). What is their function? The question to be discussed is: Are the response thresholds regulated by one or many neuromodulators, and if so, how might they differ in their function?</p><p>The authors should include a discussion of the results of a recently published study that found that the leucokinin receptor is also involved in sugar-response threshold and the division of labor between pollen and nectar foragers in <italic>Apis cerana</italic> (Ji et al., 2020).</p><p>We had difficulty with the figures in general. They are very small making it hard to tell the difference between squares, circles and triangles or indeed their colours. The axis labels are also very small. Perhaps the authors could use R.Graphics to improve the figures and make them sharper.</p><p>There are also some points related to the figures. These are:</p><p>Please plot individual data points as well as the bars (instead of only the bars) in bar graphs.</p><p>Figure 1B â how many bees were used here?</p><p>There is inconsistency in using abbreviation for bee groups.</p><p>Figure 2: is there some better way to show significant differences instead of table next to heatmap?</p><p>Include in every figure legend which species and TRP are used</p><p>Figure 3: what is log (M)?</p><p>We found the biochemistry to be distracting to the story line. The authors could move it into the supplementary figure or condensing it to a single figure at the end of the behavioural manipulation. This would retain focus on the behaviour, which we found to be the most interesting part of this manuscript. They might also want to consider bringing the verification of RNAi up to the main manuscript.</p><p>Finally, if possible, the authors could consider exploring the expression of the TRP receptor. Since TRP is likely uniformly distributed, its differential action is likely due to regionalised expression of the receptors. It would be interesting to see if, for example, nurse bees show tachykinin receptor expression in a different group of antennal sensory neurons than pollen and nectar foragers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64830.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>We have a few major concerns/comments that the authors need to consider, these are listed below:</p><p>There were issues with the writing that would help the reader.</p><p>Abstract and Introduction: These are written in overly general terms.

Here the authors might discuss published findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the important idea that the spatial expression of the receptor could play a very important role for controlling the specificity of TRP effects in different behavioral phenotypes. However, it is important to note that the overall effect of TRP signaling (to reduce the heightened responsiveness of behavioral specialists to their respective stimuli) is dependent on the overall level of TRP (as indicated by systemic injection and RNAi).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If &quot;Response thresholds can be modified by biogenic amines, and dopamine, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine, octopamine, and tyramine have been implicated in the regulation of different behaviours of worker bees&quot; (line 76-78), what might their functional role be?

What is their function? The question to be discussed is: Are the response thresholds regulated by one or many neuromodulators, and if so, how might they differ in their function?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we do not have a sufficient mechanistic understanding to characterize the detailed roles of the biogenic amines and how they relate to neuropeptide action in honey bees. However, our central finding of this study is that TRP signaling seems to decrease (if active) or increase (if inactive) other factors that determine response thresholds. While some connections between response thresholds and biogenic amines or neuropeptides have been demonstrated, the determination of response thresholds is likely complex and we prefer to not include too much speculation about mechanistic interactions. Instead, we provide now a broad conceptual model that highlights the important findings of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should include a discussion of the results of a recently published study that found that the leucokinin receptor is also involved in sugar-response threshold and the division of labor between pollen and nectar foragers in Apis cerana (Ji et al., 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this great study, which was published after our submission and complements our finding about the significance of neuropeptide modulation of behavioral specialization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We had difficulty with the figures in general.

We hope that these are acceptable, even though âRâ might be preferred.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are also some points related to the figures. These are:</p><p>Please plot individual data points as well as the bars (instead of only the bars) in bar graphs.</p></disp-quote><p>The bar graphs that depict a proportion cannot meaningfully enhanced by plotting individual data points (Figure 1C, 1D and 3C, 3D).

The verification of the RNAi efficacy is included in this section 2.3 (which we now make clearer). The demonstration that TRP2-injection and RNAi of TRP and TRPR affects ERK signaling in-vivo (2.5) represents an independent verification of the biochemical results (that were worked out in cell culture; 2.4) to explain the results from 2.3. Thus, we prefer to keep these experiments/results as the final section (2.5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, if possible, the authors could consider exploring the expression of the TRP receptor.

However, we consider this a future study that exceeds the scope of this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
