In mouse embryos that lacked Frizzled3, the motor nerves that control breathing and limb movements were thinner than those in normal mice. In the mutant animals, many motor axons failed to form connections with their targets.

These circuits are produced by precisely orchestrated patterns of neuronal proliferation, migration, and differentiation, and by the establishment of specific synaptic connections between neurons and their targets. For neurons with distant targets, making the appropriate connections depends on accurate long-range navigation by their growing axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dickson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O’Donnell et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Motor neurons represent an attractive system in which to study axonal growth and guidance because motor axons generally grow over great distances along highly stereotyped pathways. Motor neurons in the brainstem extend their axons within cranial nerves to control muscles involved in feeding, facial expression, and eye, neck, and head movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guthrie, 2007</xref>). Motor neurons in the spinal cord are arranged in longitudinal columns along the rostrocaudal axis, and the neurons in different columns innervate distinct peripheral targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Landmesser, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonanomi and Pfaff, 2010</xref>). Spinal motor neurons in the lateral motor column (LMC) innervate the limbs and are therefore present only at brachial and lumbar levels. The LMC is divided into lateral (LMC<sub>L</sub>) and medial (LMC<sub>M</sub>) divisions, which innervate, respectively, the dorsal and ventral limb musculature.</p><p>For motor axons that innervate the limb musculature, different signaling systems—including the Cxcl12/Cxcr4, GDNF/Ret, Ephrin/Eph, and Semaphorin/Neuropilin (Npn) systems—provide information at different decision points during axonal navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Helmbacher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lieberam et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kramer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luria et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonanomi et al., 2012</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonanomi and Pfaff, 2010</xref>). Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signaling is required for the initial emergence of motor axons from the ventral face of the spinal cord, with ventral axons expressing the Cxcr4 receptor and thereby conferring responsiveness to Cxcl12, which is produced by the adjacent mesenchyme. Sema3A, which is produced throughout the limb bud mesenchyme, acts on Npn1-expressing motor axons shortly after these axons emerge from the spinal cord to control the timing of outgrowth and axon fasciculation; and Sema3F, which is produced in the dorsal limb mesenchyme, repels Npn2-expressing LMC<sub>M</sub> axons to promote a ventral trajectory. The dorsal/ventral decision is also controlled by cooperative and mutually reinforcing interactions between Ephrin/Eph and GDNF/Ret signaling. GDNF, which is produced in the dorsal limb bud, attracts LMC<sub>L</sub> axons, which express high levels of the Ret receptor. Ephrin-A, which is produced in the ventral limb bud, repels LMC<sub>L</sub> axons, which express EphA4. At present, the signaling pathways that determine more distal axon branching patterns and control the specificity of nerve-muscle recognition remain largely unknown.</p><p>The experiments described here reveal an important role for Frizzled signaling in motor axon growth. Frizzled receptors are found throughout the animal kingdom and mediate at least three distinct types of signaling: (1) canonical signaling, in which Wnt binding to Frizzled activates an Lrp co-receptor to elicit stabilization of cytosolic beta-catenin, which then migrates to the nucleus to control gene expression in cooperation with LEF/TCF transcription factors; (2) tissue polarity or planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, which acts in many epithelia and features the asymmetric localization of Frizzled and several other proteins in plasma membrane complexes to control cytoskeletal organization; and (3) Wnt/calcium signaling, the least understood of the three pathways, in which Wnt binding to Frizzled receptors leads to release of intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angers and Moon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nusse, 2012</xref>). The PCP pathway was discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a regulator of cuticular hair and bristle polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Simons and Mlodzik, 2008</xref>). The core set of PCP proteins defined by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> experiments—Frizzled, Dishevelled, Van Gogh/Strabismus, Prickle, Flamingo/Starry Night, and Diego—are conserved in vertebrates. Over the past 15 years, studies in mice, frogs, and zebrafish have shown that core PCP genes play central roles in a wide variety of developmental processes that involve directional information: coordinating cell movements during neural tube elongation and closure (convergent/extension movements), setting up the global orientation of hairs within mammalian skin, orienting motile cilia within epithelia to produce coherent fluid flow, and orienting asymmetric bundles of stereocilia on the apical faces of auditory and vestibular sensory hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang and Nathans, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayly and Axelrod, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, two of the ten Frizzled family members—Frizzled3 (Fz3) and Fz6—appear to be devoted largely or exclusively to tissue polarity signaling. Fz6 controls hair orientation, and Fz3 and Fz6 act redundantly to control inner ear sensory hair cell orientation and neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2006a</xref>). Among Frizzled receptors, Fz3 is unique in its role in controlling axon guidance in the central nervous system (CNS), where it is required for the development of major fiber tracts, including the corpus callosum, and the thalamocortical, corticothalamic, and nigrostriatal tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2006b</xref>). Fz3 appears to be part of a system that provides directional information to growing axons, as indicated by the observation that in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos commissural sensory axons in the spinal cord orient randomly instead of turning rostrally after midline crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lyuksyutova et al., 2003</xref>). Virtually identical CNS axon phenotypes are observed in embryos lacking Celsr3, one of three mammalian homologues of the core PCP protein Flamingo/Starry Night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tissir et al., 2005</xref>). Fz3 and Celsr1-Celsr3 are also required for caudal and tangential migration of VII<sup>th</sup> cranial (facial branchiomotor) nerve neurons within the developing brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qu et al., 2010</xref>). In the periphery, Fz3 and Celsr3 are required for correctly orienting enteric neurons within the gastrointestinal tract, and Fz3 is required for the development of sympathetic chain ganglia and innervation of sympathetic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sasselli et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we have identified a hitherto unrecognized role for Fz3 in the growth of motor axons. Using conventional and conditional loss-of-function alleles for <italic>Fz3</italic>, we show that <italic>Fz3</italic> is required for a subset of cranial and spinal motor axons to grow to their peripheral targets. In the limb, the absence of <italic>Fz3</italic> leads to a specific stalling defect among LMC<sub>L</sub> axons that is distinct from the phenotypes produced by defects in several other signaling systems active in limb axon guidance. Affected cranial and spinal motor neurons die shortly after their axons stall, providing in vivo evidence for the general idea that as growing axons arrive at intermediate targets essential survival signals are relayed to their cell bodies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A survey of peripheral nerve defects in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos</title><p><italic>Fz3</italic> is widely expressed in the developing mouse CNS, and therefore it seemed possible that its loss might impair neurodevelopmental processes other than those previously described in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2006b</xref>).

For example, Sox10 expression is detected in migrating NC cells and persists in melanocytes and a subset of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and Brn3a and Islet1/2 are expressed in postmigratory DRG sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marmigère and Ernfors, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sauka-Spengler and Bronner-Fraser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01482.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Neural crest cell migration defects in <italic>Fz3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>A′</bold>) NF immunostaining of whole-mount E11 embryos showing aberrant clusters of neurons along the dorsal edge of the caudal neural tube in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos.

Interestingly, Sox10 and Brn3a are expressed in mutually exclusive subsets of cells, as are Sox10 and Islet1/2, suggesting that despite their migratory defect, these presumptive NC cells are able to differentiate along appropriate committed lineages. Furthermore, Sox10 and NF immunolabeling within the dorsal clusters appear to be mutually exclusive or nearly so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E′′,F′′</xref>), suggesting that at E11.5 the dorsal clusters consist of two classes of cells: immature NC cells at the migratory stage (Sox10<sup>+</sup>/NF<sup>-</sup>/Brn3a<sup>−</sup>/Islet1/2<sup>−</sup>) and more mature NC cells that are differentiating as DRG neurons (Sox10<sup>−</sup>/NF<sup>+</sup>/Brn3a<sup>+</sup>/Islet1/2<sup>+</sup>). These observations suggest that NC cell differentiation can proceed in the absence of cell migration, and that these dorsal clusters could serve as a useful model for dissecting extrinsic vs intrinsic influences on NC cell specification.</p><p>We further observed that both the number and average size of the dorsal clusters decreased from E11.5 to E12.5 and they completely disappeared by ∼E14.5, suggesting that the ectopic cells undergo programmed cell death. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F′′</xref>, at E11.5 many cells in the dorsal clusters contain activated Caspase3, especially those that are Sox10<sup>−</sup>/NF<sup>+</sup>. Activated Caspase3 is largely absent from Sox10<sup>+</sup>/NF<sup>−</sup> cells. Apparently the more differentiated DRG-like dorsal cluster neurons are the first to undergo apoptotic cell death, and the less differentiated NC derivatives are temporarily spared that fate.</p><p>In the lumbar region of E11.5 <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos, there is a ∼0.5 day delay in the appearance of apoptotic neurons within the DRG, as determined by immunostaining for activated Caspase3, relative to <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> littermates (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,D′</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,E′</xref>). This delay in apoptotic death among DRG neurons is not observed in the cervical region of E11.5 <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos, which is devoid of dorsal clusters. In DRGs, NC cells differentiate into neurons in greater numbers than are required for full target innervation, and the resulting competition for target-derived survival factors leads to the death of excess neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oppenheim, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cowan, 2001</xref>). Since apoptotic cell death in <italic>WT</italic> DRGs is well underway by E11.5, when most DRG axons are still far from their final targets, it is likely that intermediate targets are a major source of survival signals. The similar distributions along the spinal cord of dorsal clusters and delayed apoptosis suggested the possibility that in the lumber region of <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos there may be an initial reduction in the number of NC cells arriving at the DRG, leading to decreased competition for peripheral targets and higher rates of survival of DRG neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>Fz3</italic> loss-of-function results in severe thinning of the spinal motor nerve innervating the dorsal limb</title><p>In light of the essential role of <italic>Fz3</italic> in the development of subsets of cranial motor neurons, we evaluated the role of <italic>Fz3</italic> in the development of spinal motor neurons that innervate the limbs, a set for which the axonal projection patterns have been well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Marco Garcia and Jessell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonanomi and Pfaff, 2010</xref>).

GFP immunostaining of <italic>Hb9-EGFP;Fz3</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Hb9-EGFP;Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> limbs at E12.5 showed that motor axons are severely under-represented in the dorsal nerve in both fore- and hindlimbs in mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–L′′</xref>). The affected axons derive from motor neurons in the lateral division of the lateral motor column (LMC<sub>L</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Close examination of the pattern of NF immunostaining showed that the <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> defect occurs distal to the point where LMC axons separate into dorsal and ventral nerves. More specifically, in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> limbs an abrupt decrease in diameter is observed in the dorsal nerve immediately distal to the emergence of its first major side branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B′–H′,M</xref>). Therefore, the defect in the <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> limb appears to be a stalling of LMC<sub>L</sub> axons at this location. To quantify this phenotype, we measured the thickness of the dorsal nerve proximal and distal to this point. We also measured the thickness of the ventral nerve at the same distance from the plexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). All measurements were made on NF-immunostained whole-mount limbs viewed in a dorsal-to-ventral orientation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref> shows the quantification of nerve thickness for fore- and hindlimbs among littermates in two E12.5 litters and one E13.5 litter. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>, moderate and severe phenotypes within the hindlimb are represented by distinct symbols, but the statistical analysis ignores this distinction and simply compares <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> and <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> vs <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> littermates. For both the fore- and hindlimbs in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos, several findings emerge: (1) the thinning of the dorsal nerve is highly significant statistically and it occurs over a remarkably small interval, between the regions labeled D<sub>Proximal</sub> and D<sub>Distal</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>; (2) proximal to position D<sub>Proximal</sub>, dorsal nerve thinning is minimal and statistically insignificant; (3) the ventral nerve exhibits a small decrease in thickness in 5/6 comparisons, with 4/6 showing a difference that is statistically significant (p&lt;0.05), implying that dorsal nerve axons have not rerouted to the ventral nerve, which would have then shown an increase in thickness; and (4) the average nerve thickness, relative to the littermate controls, is 31% for the dorsal nerve in the hindlimb, 57% for the dorsal nerve in the forelimb, and 82% for the ventral nerve when averaged over fore- and hindlimbs.</p><p>In <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos, other classes of spinal motor axons appear to be unaffected, including medial motor column and hypaxial motor column axons that innervate axial muscles and body wall muscles, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

To distinguish among the remaining possibilities, we focused on LMC<sub>L</sub> motor neurons and their axons, because (1) these neurons can be unambiguously identified based on their patterns of transcription factor expression; (2) their axons can be clearly identified within the limb; and (3) several signaling pathways that control LMC<sub>L</sub> axon growth and guidance decisions provide points of comparison.</p><p>In the developing mouse spinal cord, postmitotic motor neurons are generated between E9 and E11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arber et al., 1999</xref>).

As both LMC<sub>M</sub> and LMC<sub>L</sub> neurons were counted in the same sections, the number of LMC<sub>M</sub> neurons served as an internal control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,C′</xref>, in the region of the <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> spinal cord that contains LMC<sub>L</sub> neurons, the number of LMC<sub>L</sub> neurons was significantly decreased, while the number of LMC<sub>M</sub> neurons was similar to that in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> controls (sections 1–6). In contrast, the numbers of both LMC<sub>M</sub> and LMC<sub>L</sub> neurons in more rostral regions were unaffected by loss of <italic>Fz3</italic> (sections 7–12).</p><p>The decrease in LMC<sub>L</sub> neurons at E12.5 suggests that loss of <italic>Fz3</italic> could lead—directly or indirectly—to LMC<sub>L</sub> motor neuron death. To test this possibility, we performed cleaved Caspase3 immunostaining on lumbar spinal cord sections from embryos at E11.5 and E12.5, developmental stages prior to the wave of naturally occurring motor neuron death at E13.5-E15.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kablar and Rudnicki, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oppenheim et al., 2000</xref>). As expected, very few apoptotic cells were observed in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> controls at E11.5 and E12.5. In contrast, massive cell death is seen in the region corresponding to the LMC in the brachial and lumbar regions of the <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E′′</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–D′′</xref>). By E12.5 the lumbar LMC volume is substantially smaller in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> compared with <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> spinal cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G′′</xref>). Similarly, in the VII<sup>th</sup> and XII<sup>th</sup> cranial nerve nuclei at E12.5, there is an analogous wave of precocious motor neuron death that is not observed in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–K′</xref>). Thus, in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos a discrete subset of motor neurons exhibits both axon growth defects and apoptotic cell death at E11.5-E12.5.</p><p>The results thus far indicate that <italic>Fz3</italic> inactivation could lead either to a primary defect in motor neuron viability that secondarily impairs axonal growth or a primary defect in axonal growth that secondarily impairs motor neuron viability. To distinguish these two possibilities, we used a <italic>Bax</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> background—in which loss of the proapoptotic molecule <italic>Bax</italic> largely eliminates apoptosis of motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">White et al., 1998</xref>)—to ask whether blocking (or delaying) motor neuron apoptosis rescues the <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> dorsal nerve defect. Although the precocious motor neuron death seen in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos was eliminated in <italic>Bax</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>;Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos, the dorsal nerve defect at the base of the limbs remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M–R′</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E–G′′′</xref>). Taken together, these data imply that in spinal motor neurons the primary phenotype resulting from loss of <italic>Fz3</italic> is a defect in the growth of LMC<sub>L</sub> axons. Since apoptosis is restricted to precisely those motor neurons that exhibit defective axonal growth and since the axonal growth defect is not secondary to apoptosis of LMC<sub>L</sub> neurons, it seems very likely that the chain of causality leads from the axonal growth defect to apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>Fz3</italic> expression is required in the CNS but not in the periphery to control axon growth</title><p>We next asked whether the axonal phenotypes in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos reflect <italic>Fz3</italic> action exclusively in CNS neurons. Based on the pattern of <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter expression from the original <italic>Fz3</italic> null allele (which carries an in-frame <italic>lacZ</italic> open reading frame), <italic>Fz3</italic> expression appears to be far higher in the CNS than in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). However, rigorously answering this question requires selective inactivation of <italic>Fz3</italic> in defined cell populations.

By contrast, Frizzled proteins accumulate at the plasma membrane of one cell and Vang/Stan/Vangl proteins accumulate at the plasma membrane of the opposing cell. The general assumption in the field is that the asymmetric distribution of Frizzled and Vangl proteins is a prerequisite for transmitting polarity information within the plane of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peng and Axelrod, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The current conceptual framework appears well suited to explain signal transmission via cell surface complexes of PCP proteins within relatively stable epithelial monolayers. This framework can also accommodate more dynamic situations in which epithelial cells divide or exchange partners on time scales of minutes to tens of minutes, as seen, for example, during convergent extension movements. Although the dynamics of PCP protein complexes remains largely undefined, one study of their trafficking during the cell cycle shows that these complexes can dis-assemble and reassemble on a time scale of tens of minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Devenport et al., 2011</xref>). The axonal development phenotypes produced by loss of Fz3 or Celsr3 raise an apparent paradox if we imagine that Fz3 and Celsr3 sense and integrate environmental information to control axonal growth by forming the same type of cell-surface complexes in growth cones—and, in particular, in growth cone filopodia—as they do in epithelia. Such a scenario would imply that the time scales of assembly and dis-assembly of PCP protein complexes and engagement with and disengagement from partners in the environment would need to occur on the time scale of growth cone dynamics, that is seconds to tens of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schaefer et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>At present, the subcellular location of endogenous PCP proteins in developing neurons has not been determined. However, experiments with dissociated commissural neurons that express transfected Fz3 or Vangl2 tagged with fluorescent reporters show that Fz3 is enriched in intracellular vesicles and Vangl2 is localized throughout the growth cone plasma membrane with the highest concentration in filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shafer et al., 2011</xref>). While current models of PCP protein action in growth cones are necessarily speculative, the axon growth phenotypes suggest that the signaling repertoire of PCP proteins is more diverse than would be predicted from considerations based only on epithelia. These and other Frizzled and Celsr phenotypes suggest that ‘tissue polarity’, the original name for the signals sent and received by this pathway, might be more apt than the epithelium-centric name ‘planar cell polarity’.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines</title><p>The <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>CKO</italic></sup> allele was generated by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells using standard techniques.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 4 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Robb Krumlauf served as the Reviewing editor and Yimin Zou was one of the peer reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The consensus opinion of the reviewers is that they are enthusiastic about this paper and would like to see a revised version published in <italic>eLife</italic>. It presents an extensive description of novel motor neuron and peripheral nervous system defects in <italic>Fz3</italic> mutants. The genetic experiments are elegant, the experiments thoughtful, and the data striking. There are two primary concerns that need to be addressed and they are summarized below.</p><p>1) The first is that the density of the results and the extensive survey of phenotypes while impressive make it challenging for the reader to take away the key findings from the study. The volume of data is at times overwhelming, which makes it hard to work through and appreciate the subtleties of the many observations. Thought needs to be given to finding a coherent way to summarize the key results in an effective way for the reader in the Discussion. Perhaps the authors could emphasize more clearly the role of Frizzled3 in motor neuron target innervation and survival in the periphery, which is indeed the main finding being reported. Peripheral growth and innervation is a very important issue in the context of peripheral nerve injury and peripheral neuropathy. One suggestion is to simplify the data. This paper is filled with detailed results that make it harder for readers for grasp the main findings. Since the motor axon defects are mostly on the dorsal limb, the authors could focus on showing these dorsal axons. Showing other axons that do not display defects makes it very convincing that only a selected group of axons are affected but these might unnecessarily overwhelm the reader. The authors could simply show one to two images of these as “controls” and then clearly illustrate the main phenotype. This will sharpen the focus on the key results.</p><p>2) The second general issue relates to postulated mechanisms or level of mechanistic insight underlying the phenotypes. Because of the effort made in describing so many diverse phenotypes the study does not go into much mechanistic characterization that could help to understand how Fz3 acts, why specific motor neuron subtypes are affected and/or a molecular explanation for the axon stalling. As a consequence, the paper presents interpretations or speculation on mechanisms associated with phenotypes, which may have alternative explanations.</p><p>For example, the difference between axon outgrowth and guidance needs to be made clearer. The point about outgrowth is emphasized throughout the paper but other interpretations are also possible. The authors show that axons stall and then die but it is premature to conclude based on the limb phenotype alone that axons die because they don't reach an intermediate target. The statement that neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule is not really supported by the data. How can a role for intermediate targets be distinguished from a role of the final target in survival? It is unclear whether the <italic>Fz3</italic> mutant motor neurons die because of an intrinsic neuronal defect, a defect in the cell's ability to transport survival signals from intermediate or distal targets, or the failure of LMCl axons to contact distal targets that supply trophic support. Integrating these possibilities into the Discussion and less speculation on the mechanism would seem appropriate in the absence of supporting data.</p><p>The reviewers are hesitant to request additional experimental detail to complement an already dense study. However, if the report included explant assays it might be possible to determine whether LMCl axons lack an intrinsic ability to extend long axons versus a more direct role of <italic>Fz3</italic> in axon targeting.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01482.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>There are two primary concerns that need to be addressed and they are summarized below</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) The first is that the density of the results and the extensive survey of phenotypes while impressive make it challenging for the reader to take away the key findings from the study.

It is unclear whether the</italic> Fz3 <italic>mutant motor neurons die because of an intrinsic neuronal defect, a defect in the cell's ability to transport survival signals from intermediate or distal targets, or the failure of LMCl axons to contact distal targets that supply trophic support. Integrating these possibilities into the Discussion and less speculation on the mechanism would seem appropriate in the absence of supporting data</italic>.</p><p>We have gone through the text to clarify the writing so that there is a clear distinction between (a) the experimental outcomes and (b) the hypotheses regarding the possible mechanisms underlying those outcomes. In the Discussion, we have also clarified the distinction between axon outgrowth and guidance, although we note that at a mechanistic level these seemingly distinct characteristics may be interconnected, since a failure to grow at a particular point (the phenotype that we observe among <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> motor axons that were destined to innervate the dorsal hind limb) may reflect an underlying inability to choose a correct path at that juncture.</p><p>We agree with the editor’s comment that “it is premature to conclude based on the limb phenotype alone that axons die because they don't reach an intermediate target”. However, we would still like to propose this as the leading hypothesis to explain the data. Regarding the editor’s next question and sentence: “How can a role for intermediate targets be distinguished from a role of the final target in survival? It is unclear whether the Fz3 mutant motor neurons die because of an intrinsic neuronal defect, a defect in the cell's ability to transport survival signals from intermediate or distal targets, or the failure of LMCl axons to contact distal targets that supply trophic support.” This indicates that we have not clearly explained the argument. Our logic is as follows: (1) in the <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> spinal cord, the axons of motor neurons that innervate the dorsal limb stall at the base of the limb at E11.5; (2) the same motor neuron population (and only that population) undergoes massive cell death at the same age (E11.5); (3) in WT embryos, motor axons reach their final targets 2 days later (E13.5), at which time ∼50% of motor neurons start to undergo developmental cell death; and (4), as described in the Discussion, the genetic elimination of all muscle cells (the distal/final target of motor neurons) in <italic>Myf5</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>;<italic>MyoD</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos (Kablar and Rudnycki, 1999) produces massive motor neuron death, but this wave of cell death only begins at the normal time, E13.5, i.e., when the motor axons arrive at the place where the muscle targets should be. Points (3) and (4) imply that the time window when trophic support from distal/final muscle targets becomes required for motor neuron survival begins at E13.5, as judged by the timing of motor neuron death in the absence of that support. Points (1) and (2) demonstrate that in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos, axon stalling and precocious motor neuron death occur two days prior to the arrival of WT motor axons at their final targets and two days prior to the time when trophic support from distal/final targets is needed to maintain WT motor neuron viability. Putting together points (1)-(4), we conclude that motor neuron death in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos in not due to trophic effects from the final distal/targets. Furthermore, the coincidence in time between axon stalling and motor neuron death in the same population of motor neurons in <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos suggests that the two events may be mechanistically coupled, although a skeptic could argue that loss of <italic>Fz3</italic> produces axon stalling and cell death in the same subset of neurons at the same time via two unrelated processes.</p><p>We think that the newly included paragraph in the Discussion section that is devoted to this issue clearly lays out this logic. Here and elsewhere we have been careful to indicate that the intermediate target hypothesis is just a hypothesis, not an established fact. In the Abstract, we characterize the data as “providing in vivo evidence for the idea that developing neurons…” and in the Discussion we characterize the intermediate target hypothesis as a “model” and we write that the data “provide in vivo evidence for this model”, and that “alternative models are also consistent with the data”.</p><p><italic>The reviewers are hesitant to request additional experimental detail to complement an already dense study. However, if the report included explant assays it might be possible to determine whether LMCl axons lack an intrinsic ability to extend long axons versus a more direct role of</italic> Fz3 <italic>in axon targeting</italic>.</p><p>We agree that additional experimental data could add substantially to this work – in particular, the identification of putative growth and/or guidance molecules that act through Fz3, or putative intermediate target-derived trophic factors. However, such an undertaking would constitute a major and independent body of work. In vitro culture experiments that merely recapitulate the in vivo behavior of <italic>Fz3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> axons without leading to real mechanistic insights would add only modestly to the present picture. As the work now stands, we believe it constitutes a comprehensive in vivo body of experimental data with several novel and well-documented biological findings, and therefore it makes sense to publish the body of work in essentially its present form. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion section to provide more background on axon stalling and to address the growth vs guidance issue.</p><p>“Axon stalling has been observed in diverse systems either as part of the normal pattern of axon outgrowth or as a phenotypic consequence of mutations…”</p></body></sub-article></article>
