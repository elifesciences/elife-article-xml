underlies variation in disease risk and other complex traits. The effect of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) varies across cell types; however, the complexity of mammalian tissues makes studying cell-type eQTLs highly challenging. We developed a novel approach in the model nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> that uses single-cell RNA sequencing to map eQTLs at cellular resolution in a single one-pot experiment. We mapped eQTLs across cell types in an extremely large population of genetically distinct <italic>C. elegans</italic> individuals. We found cell-type-specific <italic>trans</italic> eQTL hotspots that affect the expression of core pathways in the relevant cell types. Finally, we found single-cell-specific eQTL effects in the nervous system, including an eQTL with opposite effects in two individual neurons. Our results show that eQTL effects can be specific down to the level of single cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA sequences that differ between individuals often change the activation pattern of genes. That is, they change how, when, or why genes switch on and off. We call such DNA sequences 'expression quantitative trait loci', or eQTLs for short. Many of these eQTLs affect biological traits, but their effects are not always easy to predict. In fact, these effects can change with time, with different stress levels, and even in different types of cells. This makes studying eQTLs challenging, especially in organisms with many different types of cells.</p><p>Standard methods of studying eQTLs involve separately measuring which genes switch on or off under every condition and in each cell. However, a technology called single cell sequencing makes it possible to profile many cells simultaneously, determining which genes are switched on or off in each one. Applying this technology to eQTL discovery could make a challenging problem solvable with a straightforward experiment.</p><p>To test this idea, Ben-David et al. worked with the nematode worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a frequently-used experimental animal which has a small number of cells with well-defined types. The experiment included tens of thousands of cells from tens of thousands of genetically distinct worms. Using single cell sequencing, Ben-David et al. were able to find eQTLs across all the different cell types in the worms. These included many eQTLs already identified using traditional approaches, confirming that the new method worked. To understand the effects of some of these eQTLs in more detail, Ben-David et al. took a closer look at the cells of the nervous system. This revealed that eQTL effects not only differ between cell types, but also between individual cells. In one example, an eQTL changed the expression of the same gene in opposite directions in two different nerve cells.</p><p>There is great interest in studying eQTLs because they provide a common mechanism by which changes in DNA can affect biological traits, including diseases. These experiments highlight the need to compare eQTLs in all conditions and tissues of interest, and the new technique provides a simpler way to do so. As single-cell technology matures and enables profiling of larger numbers of cells, it should become possible to analyze more complex organisms. This could one day include mammals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>eqtl</kwd><kwd>single-cell</kwd><kwd>cell-types</kwd><kwd>rna-seq</kwd><kwd>mapping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99-HG010369</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ben-David</surname><given-names>Eyal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HG004321</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kruglyak</surname><given-names>Leonid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kruglyak</surname><given-names>Leonid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The effect of genetic variation on gene expression can be specific down to the level of individual cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene expression differences have a strong genetic basis, and genome-wide studies have identified thousands of regions affecting gene expression, termed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert and Kruglyak, 2015</xref>). eQTLs have been found to underlie genetic associations with complex traits and diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert and Kruglyak, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gusev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hormozdiari et al., 2018</xref>), and genome-wide eQTL mapping holds great promise for uncovering the molecular underpinnings of phenotypic variation.</p><p>Studies in purified blood cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raj et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fairfax et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishigaki et al., 2017</xref>) and computational analyses in human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donovan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2020</xref>) indicate that many eQTLs are cell-type specific. Studying eQTLs in relevant tissues and cell types is thus important for understanding their role in trait variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yao et al., 2020</xref>). However, major challenges remain for cell-type-specific eQTL mapping. First, studying multiple tissues or cell types is laborious and expensive, and has mostly been limited to large consortia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">GTEx Consortium, 2020</xref>). Additionally, diseases can be associated with specific subsets of cells that may not be readily separable from the rest of the tissue, limiting the insight that can be gleaned from studying bulk tissue samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van der Wijst et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The recently developed technology of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has the potential to significantly mitigate both of the above issues. In scRNA-seq, gene expression is profiled at the level of individual cells, and different cell populations are identified based on their gene expression profiles. This approach allows simultaneous measurement of expression in multiple tissues and cell types in a ‘one-pot’ experiment, reducing the number of samples that need to be processed and profiled separately. Furthermore, distinct cell types can be interrogated directly, facilitating eQTL mapping in disease-relevant but rare cell types.</p><p>The size and complexity of mammalian tissues has so far limited the ability to use scRNA-seq for eQTL mapping, and studies have focused on purified cell populations and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuomo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Wijst et al., 2018</xref>). To pilot a whole-organism approach, we therefore turned to the model nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. One of the mainstays of modern genetic research, <italic>C. elegans</italic> has an invariant cell lineage that leads to each individual having the same number and identity of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</xref>). Decades of research have uncovered the functions of many of those cells, as well as expression markers that uniquely identify them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall and Altun, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hobert et al., 2016</xref>). These features and resources make <italic>C. elegans</italic> exceptionally well-suited for using scRNA-seq to map eQTLs across cell types in the natural physiological context of a whole animal, down to cellular resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell-type-specific eQTL mapping in a single one-pot experiment</title><p>Genome-wide eQTL mapping involves acquiring genotypes and gene expression profiles for a genetically diverse cohort.

In this approach, a large heterogeneous pool of cells from thousands of genetically distinct individuals is profiled using scRNA-seq, cell types are inferred by clustering scRNA-seq profiles and studying known cell-type markers, and genotype information is reconstructed using expressed genetic variants, enabling eQTL mapping in multiple cell types simultaneously.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Whole-organism expression quantitative trait loci mapping with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A large population of segregants is dissociated to single cells. Each cell in the suspension has an unknown genotype and cell-type identity.

The observed number of cells of each type was strongly correlated with the known cell-type abundance in L2 larvae (Spearman’s ρ=0.87, p=2.2×10<sup>−6</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>De novo genotyping of scRNA-seq profiles using a hidden Markov model (HMM)</title><p>Most of the cells in our sample were expected to carry unique genotypes (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1—</xref>Table S1). This design is advantageous for eQTL mapping because it maximizes the sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mandric et al., 2020</xref>), but it requires de novo genotype calling because the genotype of each cell is unknown beforehand. Previous studies have shown that in addition to providing a readout of global gene expression, transcriptomic data can also be used for genotyping by leveraging variants in transcribed sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ronald et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">West et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang et al., 2018</xref>). To that end, we built a HMM for genotyping cells based on scRNA-seq data. The model calculates the posterior probability of the underlying genotypes for each individual based on three components: (1) prior probabilities for each of the possible genotypes, (2) emission probabilities for observing variant-informative reads given each of the possible genotypes, and (3) transition probabilities for recombination events occurring or not occurring between adjacent genotype-informative sites. Emission probabilities were calculated as previously described for low-coverage sequencing data under the assumption that the observed counts of reads for each possible allele at a genotype-informative site arise from a random binomial sampling of the alleles present and that sequencing errors occur independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dodds et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilton et al., 2018</xref>). Transition probabilities at each variant position were derived from the genetic map we previously published for the N2 × CB4856 cross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rockman and Kruglyak, 2009</xref>). Posterior probabilities of each genotype for each individual were calculated using the forward-backward algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; see Materials and methods for a full mathematical description of the model). To minimize loss of power due to genotyping errors, we used the posterior probabilities directly to map eQTLs in a negative binomial modeling framework instead of assigning deterministic genotype calls (Materials and methods).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Probabilistic genotyping using a hidden Markov model.</title><p>A cell with the median (69) number of unique genotype-informative single-nucleotide variant (SNV) unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts is shown for illustration.

After the initial parental cross, all subsequent steps carried out over the course of five <italic>C. elegans</italic> life cycles (3 weeks) were performed in bulk, limiting any confounding environmental factors. To minimize the influence of genotype on development, we synchronized the worms at the first larval stage, L1, and collected samples at the L2 stage, limiting the time for differences to accumulate post synchronization. Even careful synchronization is not expected to completely remove the effects of genetic variation on developmental timing, and such variation can be combined with gene expression time-course data collected during development to increase the power of eQTL mapping and study the developmental dynamics of eQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Francesconi and Lehner, 2014</xref>). This raises the possibility that future scRNA-seq studies of <italic>C. elegans</italic> across developmental stages would open the door to a similar analysis of our single-cell eQTL dataset.</p><p>Previous work suggested the existence of cell-type-specific eQTL hotspots in <italic>C. elegans</italic> based on the expression patterns of hotspot targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Francesconi and Lehner, 2014</xref>). We discovered three hotspots that are cell-type specific, with targets that are involved in core functions performed by these cell types.

Remarkably, our previous study mapped a QTL for body size in a cross between N2 and CB4856 to the same region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>). Ultimately, resolving the physiological impact of eQTL hotspots, including the ones in this study, will require fine-mapping to identify the underlying causal variants.

This observation suggests that modeling strategies that borrow power among cell types could increase the power to detect eQTLs. In addition, our approach for <italic>cis</italic> eQTL discovery could be supplemented with tests for allele-specific expression (ASE).

We used a gene transfer format file that was corrected for misannotation of 3′ untranslated regions that was generated in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Packer et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> cell types differ widely in the number of UMIs that are recovered using scRNA-seq. Therefore, a simple UMI cutoff, as is commonly used, may be biased for cell types with more UMIs. We therefore implemented an iterative pipeline to recover clusters of <italic>bona fide</italic> cells and remove cell doublets as well as degraded cells. We took 20,000 cells with the most UMIs in each cluster (twice the targeted number of cells, 100,000 overall), and processed them in <italic>Monocle</italic> (version 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>). Default parameters were used, with the exception that 100 dimensions were used for reduction, and batch was added as a covariate. Leiden clustering identified a total of 154 clusters, and we used the <italic>top_markers</italic> function in <italic>Monocle</italic> to identify the genes upregulated in each. We then removed clusters whose top genes included any ribosomal genes or the mitochondrial genes <italic>ndfl-4</italic>, <italic>nduo-6</italic>, <italic>atp-6</italic>, <italic>ctc-2</italic>, <italic>ctc-3</italic>, <italic>ctc-1</italic>, which we noticed were usually found together as the most upregulated genes in clusters that did not specifically express any known markers for <italic>C. elegans</italic> cell types. This removed a total of 30,980 cells (31%). For the remaining 69,020 cells, raw counts were processed using the R package <italic>SoupX</italic> to reduce ambient RNA contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Young and Behjati, 2020</xref>). We then normalized, reduced dimensions, and clustered the background-corrected cell profiles in <italic>Monocle</italic> using the same parameters as above.</p><p>To annotate cell types, we used the markers described in a previous study (Table S12 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Packer et al., 2019</xref>) that reanalyzed a previous L2 single-cell dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2017</xref>). Our cell-type annotation corresponds to the ‘UMAP’ column in that table, with the following exceptions: (1) we separated hypodermis from seam cells, somatic gonad from sex muscle cells, and glia from excretory cells since those groups were not clustering together in our data. (2) Cells identified as ‘Miscellaneous’ in that table were annotated as individual cell-type identifications in our data, with the exception of the sphincter and anal muscles, which were not differentiated from each other in our data. Finally, we re-evaluated our cell-type identifications and filtered cell doublets as well as dead cell or debris that may still contaminate <italic>bona fide</italic> cell-type clusters. We trained a classifier using our manually curated cell-type classifications with a L2-penalized multinomial logistic regression framework, as implemented in the <italic>Scikit-learn</italic> Python package (v0.22) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pedregosa, 2011</xref>). We read the raw gene expression matrices into Python using scanpy (v1.4.2). We removed 2582 genes that were expressed in less than 10 cells. The gene expression levels of each cell were corrected so that the total gene expression counts added up to 10,000. Per gene, these corrected counts were normalized using a log(1+x) transformation. To speed up the computation of the multinomial logistic regression, we only used the 2037 genes with a mean expression between 0.0125 and 3, and a minimum dispersion of 0.5. We scaled the gene expression matrix so that the expression level of each gene across cells had a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, after scaling expression values over 20 were set to 20. We fit a multinomial logistic regression model using the scaled gene expression values for the 2037 highly variable genes from the complete set of 69,020 cells to obtain an estimate for the inverse regularization strength (C). Using the estimated C of 7.74 × 10<sup>−04</sup>, we performed fivefold cross-validation to estimate the probability that each cell belongs to one of the manually curated cell-type classifications. Any cell with a probability higher than 0.2 of belonging to two or more cell types (9198) was classified as a doublet. Any cell that did not belong to a cell type with probability ≥0.4 (5547) was classified as low quality. In total, we removed 11,398 cells that were classified as a doublet or low quality. We removed an additional 2114 cells classified as Neurons as described in the section ‘Neuronal cell-type classification’. For the remaining final list of 55,508 cells, we used the output of the classifier as the final cell-type classification. The final classification is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

The HMM is used to calculate the probability of underlying genotypes for each individual and requires three components: (1) prior probabilities for each of the possible genotypes, (2) emission probabilities for observing variant-informative reads given each of the possible genotypes, (3) and transition probabilities – the probabilities of recombination occurring between adjacent genotype-informative sites.</p><p>For the autosomal chromosomes, we defined prior genotype probabilities as 0.25 for homozygote N2, 0.5 for heterozygote CB4856/N2, and 0.25 for homozygote CB4856.

Differential expression analysis was carried out using the <italic>DEsingle</italic> R package in each cell type, as well as globally in all cells combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To compare differential expression results with our <italic>cis</italic> eQTL results, we first normalized the effect size of each <italic>cis</italic> eQTL by its standard error. Those were used directly in comparisons done within each cell type. To compare with global differential expression, those standardized effects were combined across all cell types in which an eQTL was identified using Stouffer’s weighted-Z method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whitlock, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Processing whole-worm eQTL data</title><p>Microarray genotype and gene expression data for our published expression QTL data were acquired from the gene expression omnibus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rockman et al., 2010</xref>). Probe sequences were realigned to the WBcel235 transcriptome using BWA, and uniquely mapping probes were used. Expression probes that were present in less than 2/3 of the sample were removed. The genotype and expression matrices were standardized. To map eQTLs, we calculated the Pearson correlation between each probe and every genotype. Correlation coefficients were transformed to LOD scores using <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. To assess significance and account for multiple testing, we permuted the sample identities 100 times and calculated the average number of transcripts with an identified eQTL at different LOD scores. We compared these results to the unpermuted LOD scores to estimate the FDR and selected a cutoff corresponding to a rate of 10% (LOD = 4.2), equivalent to the single-cell mapping. <italic>cis</italic> eQTLs were derived by calculating the Pearson correlation between transcript expression and the normalized genotypes in the variant nearest to a given transcript, transforming to LOD score and comparing against the global threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Hotspot analysis</title><p>To discover hotspots, we split the genome into 130 bins of 5 cm each. We then counted the number of eQTLs in each bin identified in each cell type (applying a 10% FDR significance threshold), after removing all <italic>cis</italic> linkages. <italic>Cis</italic> linkages were defined here as those where the transcribed gene falls within the 95% eQTL confidence interval range extended by 1 MB on both sides. A bin was considered to have an excess of linkages if the number of linkages exceeded the number expected by chance from a Poisson distribution, given the average number of linkages per bin for that cell type and a Bonferroni correction for the total number of bins (p&lt;3.8e-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith and Kruglyak, 2008</xref>). The <italic>findpeaks</italic> function in the <italic>pracma</italic> R package was used to identify peak hotspot bins and prevent identifying sets of adjacent bins as hotspots.</p><p>For GO analysis, we identified hotspot targets using the same procedure above, but relaxed the significance threshold to 20% FDR. We then used the R package <italic>topGO</italic> to identify enriched terms, with the genes expressed in the cell type used as background.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Neuronal cell-type classification</title><p>Neuronal classification was carried out using a combination of available <italic>C. elegans</italic> scRNA-seq datasets, including a published L2 dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Packer et al., 2019</xref>), and the CeNGEN project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taylor, 2019</xref>). Neuronal cells were processed separately using <italic>monocle3</italic> with default parameters, with the exception that 100 dimensions were specified for the <italic>preprocess_cds</italic> step. The analysis was carried out in two passes. In the first pass, we processed all cells identified by our classifier as neurons. Following Leiden clustering, we removed 2114 cells that were in clusters whose top genes were mostly mitochondrial and ribosomal genes, similar to the analysis described above for the global dataset. We then processed the pruned dataset in <italic>monocle3</italic> as described above. To annotate the final neuronal clusters, we first used the list of marker genes from two previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Packer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hammarlund et al., 2018</xref>) to derive candidate clusters that uniquely express marker genes. We next used the <italic>top_markers</italic> function in <italic>monocle3</italic> to identify upregulated genes in each cluster compared to the rest. These were compared with the data available in the online SCeNGEN <italic>Shiny</italic> application (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cengen.shinyapps.io/SCeNGEA">https://cengen.shinyapps.io/SCeNGEA</ext-link>) for the candidate cluster. The full list of genes used for classification is found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1—</xref>Table S5. In the final dataset, clusters Unknown_1 - Unknown_4 are of unknown identity and do not correspond to the clusters of the same name in CeNGEN, while the clusters Unknown_touch and Unknown_glut_2 do correspond to cell clusters of the same names in CeNGEN.</p><p>sn-eQTL analysis sn-eQTL mapping is described above (section ‘eQTL mapping’). GO annotation of genes with sn-eQTL was done in <italic>topGO</italic>, with the genes expressed in neurons (determined using the criteria for inclusion in eQTL mapping) used as background. A heatmap was plotted using the <italic>ComplexHeatmap</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2016</xref>). To determine the consistency in effect direction between the sn-eQTL neuron and the rest of the neurons, we repeated the eQTL mapping, aggregating cells from all neuronal cell types but omitting the neuron with the sn-eQTL. The RIC and RIM neurons in the parental datasets were identified using the same gene markers used in the segregant eQTL dataset, as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1—</xref>Table S5.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work was supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and NIH grants R01 HG004321 (LK) and K99 HG010369 (EB-D). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> was created with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biorender.com/">Biorender.com</ext-link>.

However, finding these cell type specific eQTLs is complicated by the factorial nature of these experiments. In this work, the authors use a pooled transcriptome/genotyping approach with single cell sequencing to begin obtaining a broad overview of the genetic architecture of genotype x cell type interactions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Whole-organism eQTL mapping at cellular resolution with single-cell sequencing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ewan Birney (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Clarify and explain the genotyping information/approach that is largely in the supplement. Each reviewer has a comment along these lines.</p><p>2) Temper some claims in the Introduction and Discussion per the reviewers suggestions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The concept of using transcriptomes to simultaneously genotype and phenotype samples is actually a somewhat old concept first established in plants in the era of microarrays. I'm not sure if it is appropriate to not cite the original literature establishing this concept. Some acknowledgment of past developments should be provided.</p><p>Introduction – Is it really valid to say that eQTLs have been proposed to underly genetic associations? Seems like there is a ton of validation studies in Yeast, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Maize and Arabidopsis that move this beyond the &quot;proposed&quot; stage.</p><p>Results – the authors report that the # of eQTLs is correlated with the number of cells of that type in the sequencing data. This suggests that what is actually happening is the # of cells is correlated with the number of independent individuals represented. It would help if the authors could use the genotyping information to estimate the number of individuals contributing to each cell type. This should be obtainable from the genotyping information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My only 3 issues I would like addressed is that I would prefer Supplementary Figure 2, where they use an HHM to impute the genotypes for each cell, to be adapted to be a main figure along with some text to explain exactly how they do this since it is pretty important for the conclusions. I'd also like some discussion about the ultimate biology that the eQTLS underlie – there are differences in the biology of N2 and CB4956 and it would be nice if they would comment on whether any of this can be explained by eQTLS and the genes affected (even if the answer is negative, totally fine with that). Finally, I note that while eQTLS were previously reported to often show transgressive segregation, this appears not to be the case for the ones found here if I understand correctly and I'd be curious to know the reason– It's a great paper, the writing is clear, the conclusions are strong and the approach is important.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper is great.</p><p>My major recommendation is lifting a bit more of the methods into the main text. Naively when I was reading this I was wondering why the authors had not used a more joint model that could borrow power between cell lines; once I had read into Equations 3 and 4 in eQTL mapping I decided that this was a harder problem than I thought. You might want to hint in the Discussion about taking Equations 3 and 4 into a world where you borrow power between cell types, but it would seem inappropriate to suggest you did this in this paper.</p><p>Overall I think you should bring this out in the main text more, and have paragraph on this (maybe Equations 3 and 4 in the main text?).</p><p>Specifically I was curious about the X<sub>t</sub>. B<sub>t</sub> term, which seemed to suggest to me that without this term &quot;bad things happened&quot; (fair enough) but if so I think you should expand more (at least in the supplement) why this term is there.</p><p>I am somewhat surprised that the probabilistic genotyping does not go closer to 1 for the homozygous calls (at least in the example shown) and I would.… prefer to see some discussion / exploration of this; surely the homozygous segments must be pretty obvious in the data. If one had some elementary error about homozygous calls from the highly expressed genes…what would happen? Is the issue predominantly about the expression levels to &quot;rule out&quot; het calls? Perhaps the average recombination size and the sparsity of the highly expressed genes make this hard? (And please let us know whether choosing F4 over F2 was in hindsight a good choice.) It feels cute but that there is something here which looks wrong. I don't think this invalidates anything, I am curious about your recommendation for future designs. If you think a future design would be better at the F2 level, I would state that.</p><p>In theory you should be able to do ASE. Of course, full ASE will just get mis called (goes homozygous) but partial levels should be &quot;callable&quot; (and goes to the question above – to what extend is a F4 too many switches to model). I would comment on it, even if you don't do it.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65857.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Clarify and explain the genotyping information/approach that is largely in the supplement.

We estimated the number of unique individuals statistically, and our analysis showed that 56%-75% of cells are expected to come from unique individuals. This is due to the large study population (200,000) — nearly four times the number of cells. Notably, that estimate is very conservative since it only looks at overall collision rates in the dataset; collision rates within a cell type should be much lower since they sample a smaller number from the same 200,000 individuals. Consistent with this, we’ve analyzed the genotype correlation matrix of the 1,373 germline cells in our study. We observe that the maximum correlation with another cell is higher than 0.9 for only 39 cells (&lt;3%). Of the 13,219 hypodermis cells (the most abundant cell type), 1,815 (14%) have a maximum correlation of &gt;0.9 with another cell. We now include these estimates for each cell type as a column in Table S1 in Supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My only 3 issues I would like addressed is that I would prefer Supplementary Figure 2, where they use an HHM to impute the genotypes for each cell, to be adapted to be a main figure along with some text to explain exactly how they do this since it is pretty important for the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

For example, our previous work in yeast showed that most transcripts show transgressive segregation [Brem and Kruglyak, PNAS 2005]. A likely explanation for these effects is the presence of eQTLs with opposite effects that average out in the parents. We did not compare the variance of gene expression between the segregants and the parents to test for transgressive segregation directly in this dataset, as we’ve done before, due to technical concerns. These concerns include sparseness of the single-cell data as well as confounding factors (total UMI / cell, sequencing coverage, random variation in UMI capture in the library prep, etc.) arising from the fact that we prepared the parental and progeny data in separate experiments. We think studying the cell-type specificity of transgressive effects could be very interesting and hope that future studies will address it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This paper is great.</p><p>My major recommendation is lifting a bit more of the methods into the main text. Naively when I was reading this I was wondering why the authors had not used a more joint model that could borrow power between cell lines; once I had read into Equations 3 and 4 in eQTL mapping I decided that this was a harder problem than I thought. You might want to hint in the Discussion about taking Equations 3 and 4 into a world where you borrow power between cell types, but it would seem inappropriate to suggest you did this in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that borrowing power between cell types could be beneficial, and we believe this approach needs to be further developed in a future study. As suggested, we’ve added this to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall I think you should bring this out in the main text more, and have paragraph on this (maybe Equations 3 and 4 in the main text?).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We’ve added language detailing the genotyping. We found, however, that a description of the complex model we use for eQTL mapping did not fit well in the main text, and we feel it is better suited for the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specifically I was curious about the X<sub>t</sub>. B<sub>t</sub> term, which seemed to suggest to me that without this term &quot;bad things happened&quot; (fair enough) but if so I think you should expand more (at least in the supplement) why this term is there.</p></disp-quote><p>We included those terms as we considered the total expression in a cell to be a potential technical source of variation, which we wanted to control for, even though in the examples we looked at, it was not significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am somewhat surprised that the probabilistic genotyping does not go closer to 1 for the homozygous calls (at least in the example shown) and I would.… prefer to see some discussion/exploration of this; surely the homozygous segments must be pretty obvious in the data. If one had some elementary error about homozygous calls from the highly expressed genes…what would happen? Is the issue predominantly about the expression levels to &quot;rule out&quot; het calls?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggests, the scRNA-seq data’s sparseness means that most variants have very low read counts, making it difficult to rule out het calls. This was part of the reason we’ve opted to use the marginal posteriors directly in the eQTL mapping rather than calling discrete haplotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps the average recombination size and the sparsity of the highly expressed genes make this hard? (And please let us know whether choosing F4 over F2 was in hindsight a good choice.) It feels cute but that there is something here which looks wrong. I don't think this invalidates anything, I am curious about your recommendation for future designs. If you think a future design would be better at the F2 level, I would state that.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer notes, there is a tradeoff when choosing which generation to study between power (which decreases as recombinations accumulate) and resolution (which increases for the same reason). In this study, we prioritized power and studied an F4 population. Unfortunately, studying earlier generations was not feasible since the P0 are manually picked to a plate at the beginning of the experiment to guarantee that all males are from one strain and all females are from the other. We usually obtain 5-fold more progeny at each generation, and often less than that. Therefore, studying 200,000 F2 would require picking at least 8,000 worms manually to start the cross, which would be unfeasible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In theory you should be able to do ASE. Of course, full ASE will just get mis called (goes homozygous) but partial levels should be &quot;callable&quot; (and goes to the question above – to what extend is a F4 too many switches to model). I would comment on it, even if you don't do it.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We agree that ASE could be an interesting application in our framework, and we comment on this possibility in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
