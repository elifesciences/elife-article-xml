protein encoded on chromosome 21. Yet how trisomy 21 and elevated Pericentrin disrupt cilia-related molecules and pathways, and the in vivo phenotypic relevance remain unclear. Utilizing ciliogenesis time course experiments combined with light microscopy and electron tomography, we reveal that chromosome 21 polyploidy elevates Pericentrin and microtubules away from the centrosome that corral MyosinVA and EHD1, delaying ciliary membrane delivery and mother centriole uncapping essential for ciliogenesis. If given enough time, trisomy 21 cells eventually ciliate, but these ciliated cells demonstrate persistent trafficking defects that reduce transition zone protein localization and decrease sonic hedgehog signaling in direct anticorrelation with Pericentrin levels. Consistent with cultured trisomy 21 cells, a mouse model of Down syndrome with elevated Pericentrin has fewer primary cilia in cerebellar granule neuron progenitors and thinner external granular layers at P4. Our work reveals that elevated Pericentrin from trisomy 21 disrupts multiple early steps of ciliogenesis and creates persistent trafficking defects in ciliated cells. This pericentrosomal crowding mechanism results in signaling deficiencies consistent with the neurological phenotypes found in individuals with Down syndrome.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human cells typically have 23 pairs of structures known as chromosomes. Each chromosome contains a unique set of genes which provide the instructions needed to make proteins and other essential molecules found in the body. Individuals with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21. This genetic alteration is known as trisomy 21 and affects many different organs in the body, leading to various medical conditions including intellectual disability, heart defects, and immune deficiencies.</p><p>A recent study showed that cells from individuals with Down syndrome had defects in forming primary cilia – structures on the surface of cells which work as signaling hubs to control how cells grow and develop. These cilia defects were in large part due to excess levels of a protein known as Pericentrin, which is encoded by a gene found on chromosome 21. But it is unclear how Pericentrin disrupts cilia assembly, and how this may contribute to the medical conditions observed in individuals with Down syndrome.</p><p>To address these questions, Jewett et al. studied human cells that had been engineered to have trisomy 21. The experiments found that trisomy 21 led to higher levels of Pericentrin and altered the way molecules were organized at the sites where primary cilia form. This caused the components required to build and maintain the primary cilium to become trapped in the wrong locations. The trisomy 21 cells were eventually able to rearrange the molecules and build a primary cilium, but it took them twice as long as cells with 23 pairs of chromosomes and their primary cilium did not properly work.</p><p>Further experiments were then conducted on mice that had been engineered to have an extra copy of a portion of genes on human chromosome 21, including the gene for Pericentrin<bold>.</bold> Jewett et al. found that these mice assembled cilia later and had defects in cilia signaling, similar to the human trisomy 21 cells. This resulted in mild abnormalities in brain development that were consistent with what occurs in individuals with Down syndrome.</p><p>These findings suggest that the elevated levels of Pericentrin in trisomy 21 causes changes in cilia formation and function which, in turn, may alter how the mouse brain develops. Further studies will be required to find out whether defects in primary cilia may contribute to other medical conditions observed in individuals with Down syndrome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pericentrin,</kwd><kwd>primary cilia</kwd><kwd>trisomy 21</kwd><kwd>Down syndrome</kwd><kwd>MyosinVA</kwd><kwd>CP110</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM138415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>Chad G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM140813</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>Chad G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1553798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jewett</surname><given-names>Cayla E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INCLUDE T32 GM008730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jewett</surname><given-names>Cayla E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100020341</institution-id><institution>Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Anschutz Medical Campus</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Blumenthal Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jewett</surname><given-names>Cayla E</given-names></name><name><surname>McCurdy</surname><given-names>Bailey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK064380</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prekeris</surname><given-names>Rytis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008086</institution-id><institution>Global Down Syndrome Foundation, Anna and John Sie Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jewett</surname><given-names>Cayla E</given-names></name><name><surname>McCurdy</surname><given-names>Bailey L</given-names></name><name><surname>Espinosa</surname><given-names>Joaquín M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sullivan</surname><given-names>Kelly D</given-names></name><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>Chad G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Trisomy 21, the genetic cause of Down syndrome, produces elevated centrosome protein levels reducing intracellular trafficking to and from the centrosome thereby delaying primary ciliogenesis, ciliary signaling, and mouse cerebellar development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome (DS) is a common chromosomal disorder characterized by phenotypes including craniofacial abnormalities, intellectual disability, heart defects, and cerebellar hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haydar and Reeves, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergström et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richtsmeier et al., 2000</xref>). These pathologies overlap with those of ciliopathies—genetic disorders affecting primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>). Primary cilia are signaling organelles essential for vertebrate development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>). The primary cilium nucleates from the mother centriole and projects into the extracellular space. Cilia formation requires the spatial and temporal coordination of many molecules. It begins with remodeling the mother centriole, including the addition of appendages that serve as docking platforms for cargo delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishikawa et al., 2005</xref>). This triggers removal and proteasomal degradation of the mother centriole capping proteins, allowing extension of axoneme microtubules and membrane remodeling to ensheath the axoneme with a ciliary membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spektor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>). A barrier complex forms at the base of the cilium called the transition zone, that restricts access of molecules to and from the cilium. This creates a unique ciliary compartment that is biochemically distinct from the rest of the cell, allowing the cilium to function as a specialized signaling organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Gonzalo and Reiter, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Building and maintaining cilia requires trafficking of molecules to and from the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sung and Leroux, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nachury et al., 2010</xref>). The centrosome is comprised of the mother and daughter centrioles and surrounding pericentriolar material. Molecules are trafficked in both membrane-derived vesicles and granular moieties, called centriolar satellites, that move along microtubules nucleated and organized by the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blacque et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hori and Toda, 2017</xref>). Pericentrin (PCNT) is an essential centrosome scaffolding protein that, together with CDK5RAP2/CEP215 and other centrosome components, organizes microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doxsey et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gavilan et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> PCNT ortholog is required for cilia function in sensory cells and sperm, and mis-localization of PCNT is sufficient to redistribute the pericentriolar material and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez-Campos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galletta et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, in human cells, PCNT depletion disrupts primary cilia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jurczyk et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>PCNT</italic> is encoded on human chromosome 21 (human somatic autosome 21; HSA21), and we previously showed that elevated PCNT due to increased copy number in trisomy 21 is sufficient to initiate cilia defects in human DS-derived fibroblasts compared to age- and sex-matched controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galati et al., 2018</xref>). Elevated PCNT forms aggregates that colocalize with centriolar satellite proteins such as PCM1 and disrupts the flux of intracellular components to and from the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCurdy et al., 2022</xref>). While we showed reduced centrosome localization of the ciliary IFT20 protein in trisomy 21 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galati et al., 2018</xref>), IFT20 recruitment to the cilium is a late step in the process of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joo et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is unknown which molecules or pathways are disrupted in trisomy 21 that reduce cilia formation and signaling, and whether cilia defects observed in cultured cells contribute to DS-associated phenotypes in vivo.</p><p>Here, we use isogenic human cell lines to eliminate genetic variability and mouse models of DS to show that elevated PCNT induces trafficking defects around the centrosome such that cargo required for early steps in primary ciliogenesis, including ciliary vesicle formation and mother centriole uncapping, are held up in a ‘pericentrosomal crowd’. Of the trisomy 21 cells that do ciliate, intracellular trafficking defects persist as transition zone proteins are unable to reach the centrosome efficiently, thereby decreasing their localization at the transition zone. Consistent with transition zone defects, Shh signaling is reduced and anticorrelates with PCNT levels. A mouse model of DS with increased <italic>Pcnt</italic> copy number and elevated PCNT levels has reduced primary cilia in both primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as well as cerebellar neuronal precursor cells in vivo. In line with ciliary assembly and signaling defects, these mice have a thinner external granular layer and fewer neuronal protrusions. Our findings reveal how early events in ciliogenesis are disrupted by a PCNT-overexpression-induced crowding phenotype and that these ciliation and signaling defects have consequences for in vivo brain development in DS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rapid PCNT and microtubule reorganization upon G0 arrest increases with HSA21 dosage</title><p><italic>PCNT</italic> is encoded on HSA21 resulting in 1.5-fold increased expression in trisomy 21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galati et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCurdy et al., 2022</xref>). We previously showed that elevated PCNT protein is sufficient for decreased ciliation in trisomy 21 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galati et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCurdy et al., 2022</xref>). Whereas PCNT normally organizes microtubules emanating from centrosomes, elevated PCNT has three major consequences in trisomy 21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): (1) PCNT increases microtubule density around the centrosome; (2) PCNT forms large protein aggregates along these microtubules; and (3) PCNT resides at the ends of cytoplasmic microtubules that are disconnected from the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galati et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCurdy et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with more microtubules, the centrosome scaffolding proteins CDK5RAP2 and γ-tubulin are increased at and around the centrosome in trisomy 21 cells, although unlike PCNT, the whole cell expression levels of these proteins are unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galati et al., 2018</xref>). Together, elevated PCNT perturbs trafficking to and from centrosomes by altering microtubule networks and the molecular composition of the pericentrosomal region, thereby hindering the exchange of molecules required for ciliogenesis – a phenotype we have termed pericentrosomal crowding. This model was derived from an analysis of either cycling cells or cells 24 hr after serum depletion (0.5% serum in medium) to induce G0 cell cycle arrest and ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galati et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCurdy et al., 2022</xref>). Because ciliogenesis requires a coordinated series of trafficking and centrosome remodeling events over a period of several hours, we explored how elevated PCNT and trisomy 21 disrupts these processes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rapid PCNT and microtubule reorganization upon G0 arrest increases with HSA21 dosage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model figure showing the three main consequences of elevated PCNT in trisomy 21 (<bold>T21</bold>) and tetrasomy 21 (<bold>Q21</bold>) compared to disomy 21 (<bold>D21</bold>) cells: (1) PCNT nucleates more microtubules; (2) PCNT forms large protein aggregates on microtubules; and (3) PCNT nucleates microtubules further away from the centrosome.

In control RPE1 cells with two copies of HSA21 (D21), PCNT levels increased rapidly by approximately 50% near the centrosome (within a 5 μm radius) 2 hr after serum depletion and continued to gradually increase throughout the remaining 48-hr time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Similarly, microtubule density around the centrosome increased and fluctuated between 0 and 8 hr post serum depletion, then remained constant through the rest of the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). To examine the dose dependency of HSA21 and PCNT levels on these processes, we used isogenic human RPE1 cells genetically engineered through microcell-mediated chromosome transfer to have three or four copies of HSA21 (Trisomy 21 /T21 or Tetrasomy 21/Q21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lane et al., 2014</xref>). As expected, Western Blot analysis shows that PCNT protein levels scale with HSA21 dosage, and RNA FISH confirms HSA21 polyploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCurdy et al., 2022</xref>). T21 and Q21 cells have elevated PCNT prior to serum depletion both at and around the centrosome (within a 5 μm radius) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Microtubule intensity was more similar in all three cell lines prior to serum depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). By 2 hr, both PCNT and microtubule intensities elevated with increasing HSA21 dosage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Elevated PCNT near the centrosome in T21 and Q21 cells persisted through the time course and was not due to changes in whole cell protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Instead, PCNT and microtubules in T21 and Q21 cells reorganized at the centrosome (0.0–1.2 μm region from the centroid of the centrosome) and pericentrosomal region (1.2–5.0 μm region from the centroid of the centrosome), such that more PCNT foci and microtubules were distributed around the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). These data support a model whereby PCNT accumulates at and around the centrosome upon exit from the cell cycle. Interestingly, by 48 hr, PCNT and microtubule intensities were more similar between the three cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>), suggesting that T21 and Q21 cells adapt to an elevated PCNT state upon prolonged G0 arrest.</p><p>To understand the interplay between PCNT levels, microtubules, and ciliation, we quantified primary cilia frequency through the time course. D21 cells demonstrated two rates of ciliation: an early fast phase from 0 to 8 hr and a late slow phase from 8 to 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). In contrast, T21 and Q21 cells showed a decreased ciliation rate in the early phase; however, the slow phase from 8 to 48 hr was similar to D21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). The early ciliation phase correlates with the increases to PCNT and microtubule intensities which are more robust in T21 and Q21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>). To differentiate between a block or a delay in ciliogenesis, we performed a ciliation time course over 7 days. By day 3 of serum depletion, D21 and T21 cells reach similar ciliation frequencies, and after 4 days all three cell lines reach similar ciliation frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). This delay in ciliogenesis observed in T21 and Q21 cells is consistent with a model whereby increasing HSA21 dosage disrupts pericentrosomal trafficking flux to and from the centrosome early in the process of ciliogenesis; however, cells can overcome elevated HSA21 dosage to ciliate after a prolonged delay in G0.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HSA21 ploidy does not affect centriole appendages but decreases vesicles at the mother centriole</title><p>Primary ciliogenesis requires the coordination of trafficking and complex assembly events over several hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shakya and Westlake, 2021</xref>).

Consistent with the immunofluorescence data, D21, T21, and Q21 cells showed ninefold symmetry of distal and subdistal appendages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, the triplet microtubules that comprise the centriole wall were unchanged across all cell lines, confirming that HSA21 ploidy does not affect centriole structure.</p><p>Whereas centriole ultrastructure was unaffected, 3D modeling of the EM tomograms revealed changes in the number of vesicles and smooth membranes at the mother centriole. D21 cells showed many small vesicles (35–65 nm diameter) near the mother centriole (91 vesicles), as well as smooth, tubular membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, red spheres and blue-green objects). In contrast, vesicle number was decreased in T21 and Q21 cells (26 and 31 vesicles, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, red spheres) and smooth membranes were positioned away from the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, blue-green objects). Moreover, in D21 cells, vesicles were distributed along microtubules and at their ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, green lines, cyan spheres), whereas vesicles in the T21 and Q21 cells were not always found on microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1 fig2video2 fig2video3">Figure 2—videos 1–3</xref>). Despite the increased microtubule density observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the comparable number of microtubule minus ends near the centrioles (86, 69, 90 microtubule ends in D21, T21, Q21, respectively) suggests that the additional microtubules are not associated with the mother centriole. Because the tomograms only capture the centrosomal region (0–1.2 μm from the centroid of the centrosome), we did not observe additional microtubule minus ends which our fluorescent studies suggest originate in the pericentrosomal region distal to the centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCurdy et al., 2022</xref>). Together, these data indicate that HSA21 dosage does not affect centriole structure nor centriole appendage formation but may alter membrane structures at and around the centrosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Preciliary vesicle components accumulate with PCNT-induced pericentrosomal crowding</title><p>Centriolar appendages are docking sites for vesicles and molecules required for ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). Our electron tomograms suggested that vesicle accumulation at the mother centriole was defective with increased HSA21 ploidy. Because increased HSA21 ploidy resulted in changes to the pericentrosomal region in early ciliogenesis, one potential explanation for decreased mother centriole vesicles is disrupted trafficking in the pericentrosomal region. We thus examined whether molecules required for initiating ciliogenesis are disrupted in this region. The first molecules that initiate the downstream steps of ciliogenesis are components of the preciliary or distal appendage vesicle and include the motor protein Myosin VA (MYO5A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2018</xref>) and the membrane shaping protein EHD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). At 2 hr post serum depletion, about half of D21 cells have formed a MYO5A vesicle at the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, T21 and Q21 cells show decreased MYO5A vesicle formation and a striking buildup of MYO5A protein in the pericentrosomal region surrounding the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). These changes in pericentrosomal MYO5A intensity were not due to changes in whole cell MYO5A protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Radial analysis of MYO5A intensity surrounding the centrosome in D21 cells showed high MYO5A levels at the centrosome that then decreased in intensity moving away from the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> inset). We then compared the MYO5A intensity distribution at and around the centrosome with increasing ploidy through the time course. Two hours after serum depletion, MYO5A intensities in T21 and Q21 cells were increased in the pericentrosomal 1.2–5.0 μm region from the centroid of the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, centrosomal MYO5A levels were decreased with increasing ploidy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). By 4 hr, pericentrosomal MYO5A intensities in T21 and Q21 cells became more prominent, while MYO5A centrosomal levels remained decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). By 24 hr, T21 and Q21 cells still showed changes in their MYO5A intensity distributions, but the increased intensities were nearer to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Whereas MYO5A intensities increased at the centrosome in T21 and Q21 cells 24 hr post serum depletion, MYO5A appeared more diffuse at the mother centriole compared to D21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom panel). This suggests an additional defect in vesicle coalescence. Given that our electron tomography showed decreased vesicles at the centrosome with increasing ploidy, it is likely that the redistribution of MYO5A further away from the centrosome in T21 and Q21 cells contributes to this decrease. Taken together, MYO5A increases in the pericentrosomal region and its accumulation at the mother centriole is hampered with increasing chromosome 21 ploidy, a redistribution consistent with a pericentrosomal crowding model.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Preciliary vesicle components contribute to PCNT-induced pericentrosomal crowding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative structured illumination microscopy images from time course experiments of RPE1 D21, T21, and Q21 cells grown on coverslips and serum depleted for 2, 4, and 24 hr.

Together, this indicates that elevated PCNT from increased HSA21 ploidy is sufficient to block mother centriole uncapping. Because uncapping requires the trafficking of the preciliary vesicle, we propose that elevated PCNT-induced crowding traps components required for efficient uncapping.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Increased HSA21 ploidy disrupts mother centriole uncapping in a PCNT-dosage-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative structured illumination microscopy images of RPE1 D21, T21, and Q21 cells grown on coverslips and serum depleted for 24 hr.

We examined ciliary vesicle formation using 3D electron tomography. In D21 cells, the ciliary vesicle had a surface area of 0.619 µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). While some T21 and Q21 cells assembled a ciliary vesicle, the surface areas were smaller in T21 (0.569 µm<sup>2</sup>) and not measured in Q21 due to the difficulty in finding ciliary vesicles in the tomograms. Additionally, there were decreased vesicles and membranes around the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2 fig4video3">Figure 4—videos 2 and 3</xref>). This is consistent with a redistribution of membranes further away from the centrosome. In addition, the one ciliary vesicle observed in a Q21 cell was not centered over the distal end of the mother centriole. Taken together, this suggests that defects in early steps of ciliogenesis with increasing HSA21 ploidy persist into the ciliary vesicle stages of ciliogenesis.</p><p>The small GTPase RAB8 functions in ciliary membrane extension during ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2015</xref>) Consistent with our electron tomograms showing decreased membrane at the centrosome in T21 and Q21 cells, we observed decreased RAB8 accumulation at the mother centriole with increasing HSA21 ploidy at 8 hr post serum depletion. This decrease in RAB8-labeled membrane persisted throughout the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Given that RAB8 associates with Golgi and post-Golgi membranes in the context of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moritz et al., 2001</xref>), one potential explanation for decreased RAB8 at the centrosome is defective trafficking from the Golgi. However, we did not observe changes in RAB8 intensity at the Golgi with increasing ploidy, suggesting RAB8 leaves the Golgi without incident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>). Thus, RAB8 trafficking defects are specific to the centrosomal region and are not generally disrupted intracellularly in T21 and Q21 cells.</p><p>Given the observed defects in trafficked proteins required for ciliogenesis reaching the centrosome and the importance of microtubules in trafficking pathways, we wondered if general membrane trafficking pathways were disrupted with increasing HSA21 ploidy. <italic>Cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi networks, early endosomes, and lysosomes did not exhibit changes in distribution or morphology in T21 and Q21 cells when compared to D21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–G</xref>). Moreover, whereas mild intensity differences were observed in some of these organelles, they did not follow a consistent trend with increasing ploidy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–K</xref>). Thus, gross disruptions of the endolysosomal trafficking pathways are not apparent and trafficking defects associated with trisomy 21 are focused at and around the centrosome. Collectively, this suggests that ciliogenesis defects in trisomy 21 result from early PCNT-induced crowding around the centrosome that captures preciliary vesicle components thereby preventing mother centriole uncapping and RAB8-axoneme extension.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Decreased transition zone protein localization in ciliated trisomy 21 cells</title><p>Despite early defects in ciliogenesis, elevated PCNT from increasing HSA21 ploidy does not abolish cilia. Approximately 40% of T21 and 20% of Q21 cells formed a primary cilium by 24 hr post serum depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We thus wondered whether trisomy 21 induced solely a kinetic block in cilia formation or if defects persist after ciliation. To function as a signaling compartment, primary cilia are exposed to the external cellular environment to send and receive signals. In RPE1 cells, cilia typically assemble inside the cell and then fuse with the cell membrane to become extracellular signaling organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sorokin, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>). This requires remodeling of the plasma membrane and cytoskeletal networks. Given the observed pericentrosomal trafficking defects, we tested whether cilia in trisomy 21 cells were exposed to the external environment using the IN/OUT assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kukic et al., 2016</xref>). No difference was observed in the number of cilia outside versus inside the cell in D21 and T21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1L–M</xref>), suggesting that trisomy 21 does not cause cilia to be retained inside cells.</p><p>A second requirement for cilia signaling is the creation of a diffusion barrier between the cilium and the cell cytoplasm called the transition zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Gonzalo and Reiter, 2012</xref>). The transition zone, at the base of the cilium, is composed of proteins that regulate entry and exit of molecules to and from the cilium. Regulation of transit through the transition zone is essential for proper ciliary signaling, and many genes mutated in ciliopathies encode transition zone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tobin and Beales, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sang et al., 2011</xref>). Transition zone protein levels were analyzed in ciliated D21 and T21 cells. Q21 cells were eliminated because of their low ciliation frequency. Consistent with defects in the primary cilia transition zone, the core transition zone protein CEP290 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Craige et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) was decreased in T21 cells compared to D21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, yellow arrows, and B). In addition to the transition zone, CEP290 also localizes to centriolar satellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2008</xref>), and we observed increased CEP290 at the pericentrosomal but not centrosomal region in T21 cells relative to D21s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1N</xref>). Moreover, CEP290 partially colocalizes with PCNT in this pericentrosomal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, cyan arrows), suggesting that decreased CEP290 at the transition zone may result from pericentrosomal crowding. In addition to CEP290, RPGRIP1L, and two outer transition zone proteins, NPHP4 and TMEM67 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Williams et al., 2011</xref>, were also decreased at the transition zone in T21 compared to D21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–I</xref>). While we were unable to resolve the structure of the transition zone by EM tomography, we did observe a continued decrease in the amount of membrane at the mother centriole after the primary cilium assembled in T21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1 fig5video2">Figure 5—videos 1 and 2</xref>). Collectively, trisomy 21 cells show transition zone defects suggesting that trafficking problems to the centrosome are not specific to building a cilium but persist even in ciliated cells.

Thus, decreased ciliation is specific to elevated PCNT in primary MEFs from the Dp10 mouse model of DS.</p><p>Upon induction of the Shh pathway, the transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO) translocates into the cilium and generates signals that induce nuclear GLI localization and downstream transcriptional responses of hedgehog target genes important for mitogenic activity and developmental processes such as patterning and limb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kong et al., 2019</xref>). Because Shh signaling is disrupted in a DS mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roper et al., 2006</xref>), and we previously found decreased GLI expression in DS-derived human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galati et al., 2018</xref>), we examined Shh signaling in MEFs where we can distinguish the contributions of different regions of HSA21. We compared SMO intensity in the cilium with and without induction of Shh signaling using the SMO agonist SAG. Without SAG, ciliary SMO levels were undetectable in both wild-type and Dp10 MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, upon SAG treatment, SMO robustly accumulated in the cilium in wild-type cells, whereas ciliary SMO remained low in Dp10 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We next analyzed <italic>Gli1</italic> expression by RT-PCR. Since Gli1 expression prior to SAG treatment was variable, we focused our analysis on cells with low basal <italic>Gli1</italic> expression. In WT cells, SAG treatment increased <italic>Gli1</italic> levels by approximately threefold, whereas <italic>Gli1</italic> levels in Dp10 cells showed little response to SAG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>). Moreover, ciliary SMO levels in Dp16 and Dp17 cell lines after SAG treatment inversely correlated with PCNT levels, as Dp16 MEFs had slightly elevated PCNT and slightly decreased ciliary SMO while Dp17 MEFs had slightly decreased PCNT levels and slightly increased ciliary SMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, E and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). Together, decreased ciliation frequency and ciliary SMO in Dp10 MEFs is consistent with persistent trafficking defects from pericentrosomal crowding in ciliated trisomy 21 cells.</p><p>Interestingly, one Dp10 MEF line (Dp10-2) did not show decreased ciliation compared to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H, I</xref>). Importantly, this line also did not exhibit elevated PCNT levels or defects in ciliary SMO localization upon SAG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1J, K</xref>). It is unclear whether this Dp10-2 line lost the chromosome duplication containing PCNT or whether cells compensated at the molecular level. Regardless, results from this line reinforce the conclusion that cilia and ciliary signaling defects result from elevated PCNT. In summary, PCNT and ciliary SMO levels anticorrelate and are disrupted in trisomy 21.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Elevated PCNT in a DS mouse model results in decreased primary cilia and cerebellar dysmorphology</title><p>Primary cilia are ubiquitous and essential signaling organelles.

We thus measured the width of the external granular layer and found it decreased in Dp10 animals compared to wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). Decreased width could result from decreased cell proliferation, so we examined Ki67 staining as a marker for cell proliferation. While we observed no changes in the number of Ki67-positive cells in the external granular layer of Dp10 and wild-type animals at P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), we cannot rule out changes in cell proliferation at earlier developmental time points.

Dp10 animals showed decreased DCX-labeled cellular protrusions compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). While not conclusive, this suggests that elevated PCNT alters non-centrosomal microtubules such as those required for neuronal outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nishita et al., 2017</xref>).

Strikingly, reducing PCNT levels in Dp10 slice cultures rescued ciliation back to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–I</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that elevated PCNT from trisomy 21 is sufficient to induce ciliation defects during cerebellar development in vivo.</p><p>Our data from T21 and Q21 RPE1 cells suggests that pericentrosomal crowding delays ciliogenesis; however, cells arrested in G0 for a prolonged period eventually ciliate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Moreover, our previous work in human DS-derived fibroblasts showed the strongest ciliation defects in cycling cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galati et al., 2018</xref>). We thus tested whether ciliation defects in vivo were dependent on cell cycle state by analyzing cells in the inner granular layer of the cerebellum which are generally post-mitotic. Primary ciliation of inner granule layer cells was unchanged between wild-type and Dp10 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We also asked whether ciliation defects persisted throughout development in Dp10 animals by analyzing a later developmental timepoint. At P21, the cerebella of WT and Dp10 animals showed no difference in ciliation frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Moreover, at P21, the widths of both the cerebellar granule and molecular layers were unchanged between WT and Dp10 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>). These findings are consistent with our cultured models of HSA21 ploidy and provide further evidence that trisomy 21 delays but does not abolish ciliogenesis in vivo, with the major impact on cycling cells such as migrating precursor cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Trisomy 21 alters trafficking flux of early ciliogenesis molecules delaying ciliogenesis</title><p>Here, we use a time course to establish the dynamic changes to PCNT trafficking puncta and microtubules upon induction of ciliogenesis through media serum depletion. In control euploid cells, the largest changes to PCNT and microtubule networks around the centrosome occur within 2 hr after induction of ciliogenesis. Moreover, we observe a slow and a fast phase to ciliation in a population of cells, with the fast phase occurring within the first 8 hr and the slow phase from 8 to 48 hr. In T21 and Q21 cells, PCNT and microtubule levels increase more dramatically at the onset of ciliogenesis. This is accompanied by a decrease in the effectiveness of the fast phase of ciliogenesis, while the slow phase from 8 to 48 hr is largely intact. Presumably, this rapid increase of PCNT (either by inappropriately nucleating MTs) or sterically hindering trafficking molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCurdy et al., 2022</xref>) slows trafficking, and in turn slows the rapid phase of cilia assembly. The aberrant microtubule network could result from the PCNT interaction with the microtubule nucleator, γ-tubulin, or through changes to other microtubule nucleators (XMAP215, CDK5RAP2/CEP215, and SAS4/CPAP/CENPJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roostalu and Surrey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thawani et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, if T21 and Q21 cells experience persistent cell cycle arrest, they will eventually ciliate at similar frequencies to D21 cells. These data reveal that in trisomy 21, PCNT-induced pericentrosomal crowding occurs immediately upon induction of ciliogenesis and delays but does not abolish ciliation.</p><p>Several distinct trafficking pathways required for building a primary cilium cannot be efficiently recruited to the site of assembly in the altered microtubule and PCNT landscape caused by increased HSA21 dosage. MYO5A, one of the earliest proteins to localize to the mother centriole during ciliogenesis, does not traffic normally but rather participates in pericentrosomal crowding in T21 and Q21 cells. Mother centriole uncapping is also disrupted, perhaps through defects in trafficking the proteosome or autophagosome machinery required for CP110 and CEP97 removal and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spektor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), although this remains to be tested. In addition to early defects in ciliogenesis, pericentrosomal crowding affects later steps such as RAB8-mediated ciliary membrane growth and IFT20 centrosomal localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galati et al., 2018</xref>). Together, our results show HSA21 dosage dependent disruption in trafficking pathways are important to the earliest observable stages of ciliogenesis and cilia function, as molecules required for building and maintaining a cilium get caught in PCNT-induced crowding around the centrosome.</p><p>Several lines of evidence support the idea that trisomy 21 delays rather than blocks ciliogenesis. First, with sustained G0 arrest, T21 and Q21 cells increase their ciliation. Prolonged arrest appears to allow for a compensation mechanism that counteracts pericentrosomal crowding as differences in PCNT and microtubule densities at and around centrosomes are reduced over time. Second, a similar phenomenon is observed with cargo, as the amount of pericentrosomal MYO5A decreases over time and MYO5A eventually accumulates at mother centrioles in T21 and Q21 cells. Trisomy 21 cells demonstrate decreased signaling even after a cell builds a primary cilium suggesting that compensation for trafficking defects may be incomplete. This is consistent with previous work showing reduced GLI expression in human trisomy 21 cells and decreased ciliary SMO trafficking in cells overexpressing PCNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galati et al., 2018</xref>). Third, crowding has the most severe consequences for molecules that are dynamically trafficking to and from the centrosome, whereas longer lived structures such as the core centriole and appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hibbard et al., 2021</xref>) are unaffected by elevated PCNT. Finally, in vivo, only cycling neuronal precursors of the external granular layer have decreased ciliation, whereas ciliation in post-mitotic cells of the inner granular layer and in P21 cerebella remains unaffected with trisomy 21. Collectively, we find that PCNT-induced pericentrosomal crowding disrupts the dynamic flux of molecules to and from the centrosome thereby disturbing the coordination and timing required for proper ciliogenesis and signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cerebellar phenotypes in animals with elevated PCNT</title><p>While the timing of ciliogenesis is not vital in cultured cells, the timing of ciliogenesis and cilia-dependent signaling is critical during in vivo development where cilia send and receive signals between neighboring cells to coordinate proper tissue development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ho and Stearns, 2021</xref>). In line with our cultured cell results, we do not observe a complete loss in cilia and signaling in primary MEFs or cerebellar neuronal precursor cells with elevated PCNT but do observe consistent decreases in ciliation. The organization of cerebellar layers displays a thinner external granular layer in P4 Dp10 mice. While this is suggestive of decreased cell proliferation in cells within the external granular layer, Ki67 staining, a marker for proliferating cells, appears normal in Dp10 animals compared to wild-type littermates. Because elevated PCNT does not result in a complete loss of cilia, perhaps enough of the cell population is ciliated to receive the Shh mitogenic signal and proliferate at this timepoint. Consistent with this, we do not observe gross cerebellar morphology defects or changes in widths of the granule and molecular layers in Dp10 animals at P21 when ciliation is no longer decreased; however, we cannot rule out changes in neuronal processes or glial cells. Cerebellar development is a highly integrated process where a trisomy 21-induced delay in ciliogenesis could alter the coordination of cellular processes such that some cells never fully catch up. Because inputs are not completely lost, this cell-to-cell variability could account for the spectrum of phenotypes observed in individuals with DS.</p><p>Most trisomy 21 animal studies have been performed in the Ts65Dn mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>). While these mice show some degree of DS-like phenotypes, they are only trisomic for about half of the HSA21 orthologs and contain an additional amplification of genes not found on HSA21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duchon et al., 2011</xref>). The Dp mouse models are a more refined genetic system to determine the phenotypic contributions from different regions of HSA21. Dp10 mice contain approximately 41 duplicated HSA21 gene orthologs including PCNT while Dp16 and Dp17 mice have 115 and 19 duplicated gene orthologs, respectively, and exclude PCNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2010b</xref>). Our experiments in primary MEFs and cerebellar slices largely attribute cilia defects to elevated PCNT levels in Dp10 animals. However, there are other known cilia and centrosome genes found on HSA21, and potentially non-coding regions that may also contribute to phenotypic consequences of trisomy 21. For example, MMU16 contains the splicing factor SON, which is known to splice PCNT mRNA and alters PCNT levels and distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stemm-Wolf et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, while we do not find changes in primary cilia frequency in Dp16 animals, we do observe moderately decreased ciliary SMO and moderately increased PCNT levels. Animals with individual chromosomal duplications, Dp10, Dp16, or Dp17 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2010b</xref>, do not show as severe phenotypic consequences as combined Dp10; Dp16; Dp17 animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yu et al., 2010a</xref>). Therefore, while elevated PCNT disrupts ciliogenesis and signaling, there are likely other contributions from additional genes on HSA21 that add to the spectrum of phenotypes observed in individuals with DS.</p><p>In contrast to single gene disruption studies, here we show that ciliary defects arise from elevated protein expression, as is often the case in chromosomal aberrations. Indeed, cilia defects have been observed with increased copy number of a nuclear pore protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Del Viso et al., 2016</xref>). While changes in some protein levels may be tolerated, we demonstrate that even a modest increase in PCNT protein (1.5–2-fold) is deleterious to cilia formation and function in a dose-dependent manner. Elevated PCNT aggregates and reorganizes microtubule networks, inducing pericentrosomal crowding that disrupts cargo transport required for early steps in ciliogenesis and persists in ciliated trisomy cells. Because tight control of microtubule organization is essential for many cell types and processes including neuron outgrowth, cell migration, immune synapse formation, glucose-induced insulin secretion, and cell polarity, these functions need further study to determine whether elevated PCNT from trisomy 21 and changes in microtubule topologies alter these cell types and functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Disomy 21, Trisomy 21, and Tetrasomy 21 (D21, T21, Q21) hTERT-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial (RPE1) cells were generated by Drs.

Lysates were separated in 3–8% Criterion XT Tris-Acetate PAGE (3450131, Bio-Rad), and protein transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with anti-MYOVA followed by incubation in HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Blots were incubated for 5 min in SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (34578, ThermoScientific) and imaged on a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP Imaging System. For relative MYOVA protein level quantification, band intensities were measured and normalized to india ink loading controls. All band intensity analyses were quantified using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Gli1 RT-PCR</title><p>MEFs were serum depleted for 24 hr in DMEM medium (Cytiva SH30022.01) supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum and treated with 100 nM SAG for the final 4 hr. RNA was isolated from MEFs using the TRIzol Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 25 units of SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 0.1 µM gene-specific primer was used for cDNA first strand synthesis using 500 ng total RNA in a total volume of 10 µl according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Radial fluorescence intensity was measured using the Radial Profile Extended ImageJ plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://questpharma.u-strasbg.fr/html/radial-profile-ext.html">http://questpharma.u-strasbg.fr/html/radial-profile-ext.html</ext-link>). Briefly, this plugin plots average fluorescence intensity as a function of distance from a user defined centroid. 10 µm diameter ROIs were centered over the brightest pixel of a Gaussian blurred maximum intensity projection of the centrosome defined by PCNT fluorescence. In cells with GT335-labeled centrioles, the centroid was manually centered between the two centrioles. Background was determined per field of view by the mean intensity of an extracellular ROI. Background subtracted radial intensities were summed and normalized to the D21 average. Centrosomal fluorescence intensity was defined as the sum of radial intensities falling within 0.0–1.2 µm from the centroid of analysis. Pericentrosomal fluorescence intensity was defined as the sum of radial intensities falling within 1.2–5.0 µm from the centroid.</p><p>Whole cell intensities were calculated using the integrated density within cells outlined using ImageJ. Ciliation frequency was measured by counting either DM1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or ARL13B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and dividing by the number of nuclei per field of view. For ciliation frequency in cultured cerebellar slices, the number of ARL13B-labeled cilia was divided by the number of centrosomes per field of view. For ciliation frequency in fixed cerebellar slices, the number of ARL13B-labeled cilia was divided by the mean Hoechst 33342 intensity per field of view because individual nuclei could not be resolved in the thick slices. The frequency of ciliation per hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) was calculated by subtracting the percentage of ciliated cells from the previous time point from the percentage of ciliated cells and dividing the result by the total number of hours.</p><p>For PCNT siRNA experiments, radial MYO5A and PCNT fluorescence intensity was calculated using the same methods as above. For MYO5A radial distribution, all values were divided by the maximum intensity value per cell and normalized to D21 values. Correlation analyses were performed by plotting 10 µm diameter PCNT intensities normalized within a cell line to either centrosomal or pericentrosomal normalized MYO5A intensities. R values and significance were calculated by running a correlation analysis in GraphPad. PCNT levels were analyzed with a 10 µm diameter circle centered on the centrosome to measure the integrated density. Background was determined with an extracellular ROI. Background subtracted values were normalized to the D21 average.</p><p>GM130 and Golgin97 intensities were measured by drawing an ROI around the GM130 or Golgin97 signal and measuring the integrated density within this ROI using ImageJ. Background was determined by an extracellular ROI. Background subtracted values were normalized to the D21 average. To quantify early endosome and lysosome levels, integrated density was measured across a field of view and divided by the number of nuclei within the same field of view. Values were normalized to the D21 average.</p><p>All transition zone antibodies were co-stained with GT335. The transition zone was identified by the gap in GT335 signal between the mother centriole and the base of the cilium. Transition zone protein intensity was determined by centering a 1 µm x 1 µm box over the transition zone and measuring the integrated density. Background was determined by a 1 µm x 1 µm box randomly placed near the centrosome. Background subtracted values were normalized to the D21 average. For TMEM67, the ROI was a 0.5 µm x 0.5 µm box to avoid TMEM67 signal that localizes to the centrosome.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All data sets were tested for Normality using D’Agostino and Pearson Omnibus Normality Test in GraphPad Prism 9. Normal data sets were then tested for significance with a two-tailed unpaired t-test and non-normal data sets were tested for significance using the Mann-Whitney test. For ciliation analysis in mouse cerebella paired t-tests were used to ensure that corresponding folia in WT and Dp10 animals were compared. All graphs show mean ± SD. All experiments utilized at least three biological replicates, unless otherwise noted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Electron tomography</title><p>RPE1 cells were grown on sapphire discs and prepared for electron microscopy using high pressure freezing and freeze substitution as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McDonald et al., 2010</xref>. Briefly, 3 mm sapphire discs (Technotrade International) were coated with gold and a large “F” was scratched into the surface to orient the cell side. The disks were coated with collagen, sterilized under UV light and cells plated for culturing. Monolayers grown on sapphire discs were frozen using a Wohlwend Compact 2 high pressure freezer (Technotrade International). The frozen cells were freeze substituted in 1% OsO4 and 0.1% uranyl acetate in acetone at –80 °C for 3 days then gradually warmed to room temperature. The discs were then flat embedded in a thin layer of Epon resin and polymerized at 60 °C. Regions containing cells were identified in the light microscope, and a small square of resin containing the cells was excised and remounted onto a blank resin block. The cells were then sectioned en face and serial, thick sections (250–300 nm) were collected onto formvar-coated slot grids. Grids were post stained with 2% uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead citrate and 15 nm colloidal gold (BBI International) was affixed to the section surface to serve as alignment markers.</p><p>Grids containing serial thick (250–300 nm) sections were screened using a Tecnai T12 microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). A total of 20 D21 cells were screened, and 4 complete centrosomes were selected for tomographic reconstruction. A total of 26 T21 cells were screened, and 3 complete centrosomes were selected for tomographic reconstruction. A total of 17 Q21 cells were screened and 4 were chosen for reconstruction. Only those cells that had the centrosome complete in the serial sections were selected for reconstruction. However, observations about the presence of ciliary vesicles and primary cilia could be made from the incomplete centrosomes.</p><p>Tomography was performed using a Tecnai F30 microscope operating at 300 kV (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Dual axis tilt series were collected over a+/-60° range using the SerialEM image acquisition software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>), and a Gatan OneView camera (Gatan, Inc, Pleasanton, CA). For most data sets, tilt series were collected from 2 to 4 serial sections to reconstruct a larger volume of cell data. Tomograms were computed, serial tomograms joined and cellular features were modeled using the IMOD 4.9 software package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/">https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mastronarde, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Organelles at the centrosomes of the cells (centrioles, vesicles, positions of MT and their ends) were manually traced in these reconstructions using the 3dmod program in the IMOD software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>). Models were projected in 3D to show the arrangement of the centrioles, vesicles, microtubules and the position their ends within the volume. In total, 4 centrosomes from D21, 3 centrosomes from T21, and 4 centrosomes from Q21 were reconstructed and modeled. The modeled centrosomes came from different stages, including at or before ciliary vesicle formation, and one D21 and T21 set with a primary cilium. Surface areas of membrane structures were computed from the model data using the program imodinfo from the IMOD software package.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Supervision, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures involving mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (protocol numbers 134 and 00111) and were performed in accordance with National Institute Guidelines for the care and use of animals in research.

an additional copy of Pericentrin (PCNT) on cell biology, with a focus on ciliation and ciliary Hedgehog signaling. They demonstrate that modestly increased PCNT levels can attenuate ciliogenesis and may result in trisomy 21-associated phenotypes such as cerebellar growth defects. This work advances our understanding of the trafficking defects caused by increased PCNT and has important implications for our understanding of the cellular basis of trisomy 21, a major hereditary human disorder.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78202.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Reiter</surname><given-names>Jeremy F</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Reiter</surname><given-names>Jeremy F</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.11.10.468107">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.10.468107v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Trisomy 21 induces pericentrosomal crowding disrupting early stages of primary ciliogenesis and mouse cerebellar development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jeremy F Reiter as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. We apologize that it took us some time to complete our review.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please attend to the apparent discrepancy between Figure S3B, C indicating that centrosomal MYO5A levels are decreased with increasing chromosome 21 ploidy, and Figure 3E indicating that centrosomal MYO5A levels are increased with increasing chromosome 21 ploidy.</p><p>2) Please assess whether HH-dependent transcriptional responses, such as Gli1 induction, were reduced in the cerebella of Dp10 mice. Also, please assess whether there are defects in cerebellar morphology at P21 or in the adult Dp10 mice.</p><p>3) Please discriminate between delayed and attenuated ciliogenesis in T21 and Q21 cells by assessing whether the frequencies of cilia in the T21 or Q21 cells eventually reach the same level as D21 cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Is the PCNT copy number in the diploid, trisomy, and tetrasomy 21 retinal pigment epithelium cells validated somewhere? Do the authors do a PCNT protein level scale with copy number in these cells? It is difficult to use immunofluorescence to evaluate protein levels. Can the authors simply use Western blot to evaluate relative protein levels? Similar issues pertain to MYO5A levels.</p><p>Figures S3B, and C indicate that centrosomal MYO5A levels were decreased with increasing chromosome 21 ploidy. Figure 3E indicates that centrosomal MYO5A levels were increased with increasing chromosome 21 ploidy. How do these results square? Are there different definitions of centrosomal being used? The figure legend for figure 3E is unclear on the time point that is being analyzed.</p><p>The authors indicate that SMO levels in response to SAG are reduced with chromosome 21 trisomy. Are transcriptional responses, such as Gli1 induction, similarly reduced? Although there is a morphological defect in the cerebella of Dp10 mice, there is no decrease in EGL proliferation at P4, inconsistent with a marked effect on Hedgehog signaling. Similarly, is Gli1 expression reduced in Dp10 mice cerebella, as would be predicted?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In Figure 1B and the data in 1D, was there some normalization applied to microtubule staining? For this experiment to make sense, the intensity of labeling of a single microtubule should be the same across all samples (or be subjected to normalization). In the images shown, the intensity values of what appear to be individual microtubules are very different. Also, the models derived from EM in Figure 2D don't seem to show the same microtubule effect, as noted in the text (line 173).

We were unable to antibody stain for Gli1 using antigen retrieval and immunofluorescence in the cerebella of P4 WT and Dp10 brains. Unlike P4 mice, the cerebellar ciliation and molecular and granule layer widths were not different in P21 mice. This suggests that ciliogenesis delays are found in the early and rapidly dividing granule cells of P4 but not in later stages of development when cells are not dividing as rapidly.

Do the authors do a PCNT protein level scale with copy number in these cells? It is difficult to use immunofluorescence to evaluate protein levels. Can the authors simply use Western blot to evaluate relative protein levels? Similar issues pertain to MYO5A levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously validated these cell lines via Western blot and RNA FISH (see PMID: 35476505). The text has been modified to include this. We have now included Western blot analysis of MYO5A levels demonstrating that, like our immunofluorescence results, they are unchanged across D21, T21, and Q21 lines (Figure S3B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures S3B, and C indicate that centrosomal MYO5A levels were decreased with increasing chromosome 21 ploidy. Figure 3E indicates that centrosomal MYO5A levels were increased with increasing chromosome 21 ploidy. How do these results square? Are there different definitions of centrosomal being used?

Are transcriptional responses, such as Gli1 induction, similarly reduced? Although there is a morphological defect in the cerebella of Dp10 mice, there is no decrease in EGL proliferation at P4, inconsistent with a marked effect on Hedgehog signaling. Similarly, is Gli1 expression reduced in Dp10 mice cerebella, as would be predicted?</p></disp-quote><p>We now show that Gli1 induction is reduced in SAG treated MEFs from Dp10 mice compared to WT mice.

For this experiment to make sense, the intensity of labeling of a single microtubule should be the same across all samples (or be subjected to normalization). In the images shown, the intensity values of what appear to be individual microtubules are very different. Also, the models derived from EM in Figure 2D don't seem to show the same microtubule effect, as noted in the text (line 173). The explanation for this – that the microtubules must be further out from the centrosome – seems weak.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1B shows images that were acquired with identical microscope settings and levelled the same. No normalization has been applied. We did this to illustrate the substantial microtubule networks that are recruited to and rearranged around the centrosome prior to ciliogenesis in D21, T21, and Q21 cells.</p><p>There are several reasons why we may not see as many microtubules in T21 and Q21 cells by EM compared to IF. First, EM is limited by small sample size and small analysis region. Performing microtubule tracing is technical and time consuming. In addition, longer microtubules are easier to pick out and trace compared to shorter microtubules that would be increasingly present in T21 and Q21 cells (PMID: 35476505). Second, the fixation technique is different for EM (high pressure freeze substitution) compared to IF (PFA with pre-permeabilization step). We addressed the issue of microtubule preservation and stability throughout different fixation techniques in our previous paper (PMID: 35476505).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 140, Figure 1E, F.

Using these established markers, we are confident in our ability to identify cilia and differentiate these structures from cytoplasmic microtubules with DM1a staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2A and Line 552 &quot;Percentages represent cells with indicated marker for 3 N's&quot; It seems that the N values are in a separate supplementary table, which makes it harder to interpret the data than necessary.

A total of 26 T21 cells were screened, and 3 complete centrosomes were selected for tomographic reconstruction. A total of 17 Q21 cells were screened and 4 were chosen for reconstruction. Only those cells that had the complete centrosome in the 3D volume of the serial sections were selected for reconstruction. However, observations about the presence of ciliary vesicles and primary cilia could be made from the incomplete centrosomes.
