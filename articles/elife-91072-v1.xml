in the N-terminal region of flagellin (flg22) to initiate plant defense pathways, which was intensively studied in the past decades. However, the dynamic regulation of FLS2 phosphorylation at the plasma membrane after flg22 recognition needs further elucidation. Through single-particle tracking, we demonstrated that upon flg22 treatment the phosphorylation of Ser-938 in FLS2 impacts its spatiotemporal dynamics and lifetime. Following Förster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and protein proximity indexes assays revealed that flg22 treatment increased the co-localization of GFP-tagged FLS2/FLS2<sup>S938D</sup> but not FLS2<sup>S938A</sup> with AtRem1.3-mCherry, a sterol-rich lipid marker, indicating that the phosphorylation of FLS2<sup>S938</sup> affects FLS2 sorting efficiency to <italic>At</italic>Rem1.3-associated nanodomains. Importantly, we found that the phosphorylation of Ser-938 enhanced flg22-induced FLS2 internalization and immune responses, demonstrating that the phosphorylation may activate flg22-triggered immunity through partitioning FLS2 into functional <italic>At</italic>Rem1.3-associated nanodomains, which fills the gap between the FLS2<sup>S938</sup> phosphorylation and FLS2-mediated

features with an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang and Zhou, 2018</xref>). FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2), a star RK in PTI, senses a conserved N-terminal epitope (flg22) of the bacterial flagellin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hudson et al., 2024</xref>). Upon flg22 perception, FLS2 rapidly interacts with its co-receptor brassinosteroid insensitive1-associated kinase1 (BAK1) to form an active receptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chinchilla et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chinchilla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heese et al., 2007</xref>), initiating phosphorylation events through activating receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) such as BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1) to elicit downstream immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Protein phosphorylation, a vital post-translational modification, plays an essential role in signal transduction. Previous studies suggest that protein phosphorylation alterations affect protein dynamics and subcellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaiserli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kontaxi et al., 2023</xref>). In plants, phosphorylation of proteins can coalesce into membrane nanodomains, forming platforms for active protein function at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bücherl et al., 2017</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xue et al., 2018</xref> demonstrated that phosphorylation of the blue light receptor phot1 accelerates the protein movement, enhancing its interaction with a sterol-rich lipid marker <italic>At</italic>Rem1.3-mCherry, which underscores the crucial role of protein phosphorylation in protein dynamics and membrane partitioning. Upon flg22 treatment, multiple FLS2 phosphorylation sites are activated, with the Serine-938 phosphorylation playing a pivotal role in defense activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2013</xref>); nevertheless, how the phosphorylation of FLS2<sup>S938</sup> impacts on plant immunity remains elusive.</p><p>Membrane nanodomains, which are crucial in regulating PM protein behavior, are dynamic structures enriched with sterols and sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boutté and Jaillais, 2020</xref>) and uniquely labeled by proteins such as Flotillins and Remorins within living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinière and Zelazny, 2021</xref>). Various stimuli are able to trigger PM proteins moving into mobile or immobile nanodomains, suggesting a connection between nanodomains and signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xing et al., 2022</xref> demonstrated that sterol depletion significantly impacts the dynamics of flg22-activated FER-GFP, emphasizing the role of nanodomains in the lateral mobility and dissociation of FER from the PM under flg22 treatment. However, the spatial coordination of FLS2 dynamics and signaling at the PM, and their relationships with nanodomains remain poorly understood.</p><p>To investigate whether the FLS2<sup>S938</sup> phosphorylation activates immune responses through nanodomains, we analyzed the diffusion and lifetime of FLS2 phospho-dead and phospho-mimic mutants at the PM before and after flg22 treatments. Our results show that flg22-induced dynamic and lifetime changes were abolished in FLS2<sup>S938A</sup>. Using FLIM-FRET and single-molecule protein proximity index (smPPI) techniques, we found that FLS2 phosphorylation variants exhibited distinct membrane nanodomain distribution and endocytosis. Importantly, we demonstrated that the immune response of phosphor-mimic FLS2<sup>S938D</sup> was comparable to wild-type FLS2, while the phosphor-dead version of FLS2<sup>S938A</sup> weakened the immune response. Our findings pinpoint the missing piece of FLS2-mediated immune signaling in planta.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ser-938 phosphorylation site changed the spatiotemporal dynamics of flg22-induced FLS2 at the plasma membrane</title><p>Previous studies highlight the crucial role of membrane protein phosphorylation in fundamental cellular processes, including PM dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vitrac et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Offringa and Huang, 2013</xref>). In vitro mass spectrometry (MS) identified multiple phosphorylation sites in FLS2. Genetic analysis further identified Ser-938 as a functionally important site for FLS2 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). FLS2 Ser-938 mutations impact flg22-induced signaling, while BAK1 binding remains unaffected, thereby suggesting Ser-938 regulates other aspects of FLS2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). To unravel the immune response regulation mechanisms via FLS2 phosphorylation, we generated transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants expressing C-terminal GFP-fused FLS2, S938A, or S938D under the FLS2 native promoter in the <italic>fls2</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Samples were mounted in 25% glycerol, and then observed under a microscope that was equipped with a Leica DM2500 UV lamp.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Confocal laser scanning microscopy and image analysis</title><p>Confocal microscopy was done with a TCS SP5 Confocal Microscope fitted with a ×63 water-immersion objective. GFP and FM4-64 were assayed using 488 nm and 514 nm wavelengths (multitrack mode). The fluorescence emissions were respectively detected with spectral detector set LP 560-640 (FM4-64) and BP 520-555 (GFP). Image analysis was performed with Leica TCS SP5 software and quantified using the ImageJ software bundle (NIH).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>VA-TIRFM and single-particle fluorescence image analysis</title><p>The dynamics of FLS2 phospho-dead and phospho-mimic mutants were recorded using VA-TIRFM. This was done using an inverted microscope (IX-71, Olympus) equipped with a total internal reflective fluorescence illuminator (model no. IX2-RFAEVA-2; Olympus) and a 1003 oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture = 1.45). To track GFP-labeled proteins at the PM, living leaf epidermal cells of 6-day-old seedlings were observed under VA-TIRFM. To visualize GFP or mCherry fluorescent proteins, appropriate corresponding laser excitation (473 nm or 561 nm) was used and emission fluorescence was obtained with filters (BA510IF for GFP; HQ525/50 for mCherry). A digital EMCCD camera (Andor Technology, ANDOR iXon DV8897D-CS0-VP, Belfast, UK) was used to acquire the fluorescent signals, which were stored directly on computers and then analyzed using ImageJ software. Images of single particles were acquired with 100 ms exposure time.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>UMAP analysis</title><p>We used an R package to perform dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis of single-particle tracking data. We performed nonlinear dimensionality reduction for visualization with the function ‘UMAP’ in the R package. We proceeded to cluster cells using the Louvain algorithm with the ‘FindNeighbors’ and ‘FindClusters’ functions in the R package carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorrity et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>TIRF-SIM imaging and the co-localization analysis</title><p>The SIM images were taken using a 60×NA 1.49 objective on a structured illumination microscopy (SIM) platform (DeltaVision OMX SR) with a sCMOS camera (camera pixel size, 6.5 μm). The light source for TIRF-SIM included diode laser at 488 nm and 568 nm with pixel sizes (μm) of 0.0794 and 0.0794 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbieri et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>For the dual-color imaging, FLS2/FLS2<sup>S938A</sup>/FLS2<sup>S938D</sup>-GFP (488 nm/30.0%) and AtRem1.3-mCherry (561 nm/30.0%) were excited sequentially. The exposure time of the camera was set at 50 ms throughout single-particle imaging. The time interval for time-lapse imaging was 100 ms, the total time was 2 s, and the total time points were 21 s. The Imaris intensity correlation analysis plugin was used to calculate the co-localization ratio as described previously.

The Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the leaf cells was measured at 0.2 Hz near and 30 µm away from the cells. Each plant was measured once, and then using 1/2 MS (CK) or 10 μM flg22 treated the leaf and measured Ca<sup>2+</sup>flux again. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux was calculated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiao et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Analysis of root growth</title><p>The transgenic seedlings were treated with different conditions, and imaging was performed by scanning the root systems at 500 dpi (Canon EOS 600D).

This is actually not known.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you for your expert comments. Although the phosphorylation of Ser-938 upon flg22 treatment is not known, the model presented in the manuscript is based on previous studies that have shown the importance of Ser-938 phosphorylation for the function of FLS2 (Cao et al, 2013). When it is mutated to the phosphorylation-mimicking residues aspartate or glutamate, immune responses remain normal. These findings suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser-938 plays a critical role in activating defense mechanisms upon flagellin detection (Cao et al, 2013). Now we added the results of Cao et al. (2013) to the introduction to strengthen in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 2: In addition, the S938D mutant does not show constitutively increased diffusion and co-localization with remorin. It is necessary to soften the tone in the conclusion.</p><p>Reply: We appreciate the valuable suggestions from the reviewer. Based on our findings, we observed that the phosphorylation of Ser-938 significantly impacts the dynamics of flg22-induced FLS2. However, it does not alter the diffusion coefficient of FLS2 itself. In the revised manuscript, we have carefully adjusted the conclusion by softening the tone to reflect these findings.</p><p>Question 3: The introduction (only two paragraphs) and discussion are not properly written in the context of the current understanding of plant receptors in nanodomains. The authors basically just cited a few publications of their own, and this is not acceptable.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We accepted the criticisms here. Now, we have reworded the introduction and discussion sections to improve clarity. Furthermore, we have incorporated several new reports on plant receptors in nanodomains into the revised manuscript. Besides, we deleted some publications from our own group, while citing the latest references on plant receptors and nanodomains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The research conducted by Yaning Cui and colleagues delves into understanding FLS2-mediated immunity.

We agree with you that different imaging techniques may have their limitations and can highlight distinct aspects of protein dynamics and interactions.</p><p>In our study, we used single-particle analysis and FLIM-FRET to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of FLS2 and its association with remorin. While single-particle analysis did not conclusively link FLS2 and remorin, FLIM-FRET effectively highlighted their ligand-triggered association and the disengagement caused by mutations. We acknowledge that these techniques may have different spatial and temporal resolutions, leading to the discrepancy in their results. However, after the normalized treatment, we can provide very similar conclusions. Accordingly, we have revised the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Receptor kinases (RKs) perceive extracellular signals to regulate many processes in plants. FLS2 is an RK that acts as a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) to recognize bacterial flagellin and activate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). PRRs such as FLS2 have been previously shown to reside within PM nanodomains, which can regulate downstream PTI signaling. In the current manuscript, Cui et al use single particle tracking to characterize the effect of previously-described phosposite mutants (FLS2-S938A/D) on the PM organization, endocytosis, and signaling functions of FLS2. The authors confirm that FLS2-S938D but not -S938A is functional for flg22-induced responses, while also demonstrating that phopshodead mutation at this site (S938A) prevents flg22-induced sorting into nanodomains and endocytosis. These results are consistent with S938 being an important phosphorylation site for FLS2 function, however, they fall short of demonstrating that membrane disorganization of FLS2-938A is responsible for downstream signaling defects.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors' experiments (single particle tracking, co-localization, etc) do a good job of demonstrating how a non-functional version of FLS2 (S938A) does not alter its spatio-temporal dynamics, nanodomain organization, and endocytosis in response to flg22, suggesting that these require a functional receptor and are regulated by intracellular signaling components.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Question 1: The authors do not provide direct evidence that S938 phosphorylation specifically affects membrane organization, rather than FLS2 signaling more generally. All evidence is consistent with S938A being a non-functional version of FLS2, wherein an activated/functional receptor is required for all downstream events including membrane re-organization, downstream signalling, internalization, etc. Furthermore, the authors never demonstrate that this site is phosphorylated in planta in the basal or flg22-elicited state.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Sorry that we did not describe clearly in the original manuscript. In fact, we found in our study that the phosphorylation of the Ser-938 site influences the efficient sorting of FLS2 into AtRem1.3-associated microdomains rather than membrane organization, as depicted in Figure 2. Furthermore, we found that the immune responses are disrupted when Ser-938 is mutated to alanine, which is consistent with previously reported results (Cao et al, 2013). However, they remain normal when mutated to the phosphorylation-mimicking residues aspartate or glutamate. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser-938 is crucial for activating defense mechanisms upon flagellin detection. Although the phosphorylation of Ser-938 in plant at the basal or flg22-elicited state is not known, the model presented in the manuscript is based on the results of our current investigation together with those in the previous study that have shown the importance of Ser-938 phosphorylation for FLS2 function (Cao et al, 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 2: As written, the manuscript also has numerous scientific issues, including a misleading/incomplete description of plant immune signaling, lack of context from previous work, and extensive use of inappropriate references.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We accept the criticism here. After reading the comments, we realized the problem. Now we have revised the misleading or incomplete description of plant immune signaling, added the context of previous works and deleted inappropriate references in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Question 1: The description of the data has no details. How many biological repeats were done? How were statistical analyses done? What is the concentration of flg22? How was the calcium flux done (Fig. 4A)? The method also lacks details and relevant references.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We apologize for the lack of detail in presenting the data. Following your suggestion, we added comprehensive figure legends that provide clear explanations for each figure. Additionally, we included supplementary information on the measurement methods and references pertaining to calcium flux in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 2: Data in Fig. 4 basically repeated the 2013 PLoS Pathog paper. Why were these experiments even performed? Were GFP-tagged FLS2 lines used in these experiments? If this is the case, the data just verified that the GFP-tagged FLS2 functions as expected and should be moved to supporting data.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thanks for the expert suggestions. In our study, we utilized GFP-tagged FLS2 lines to generate FLS2-S938 mutants and conducted experiments to investigate the flg22-induced immune response. Although some experiments in Figure 4 are similar to those reported (Cao et al, 2013), we provided a more detailed analysis of the immune response. The comprehensive analysis included early immune responses and late immune responses, e.g., the activation of a calcium burst, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the induction of immune-responsive genes and callose deposition, ultimately resulting in the inhibition of plant growth. As some results are analogous to the previous paper, we transfer some of the experiments as suggested, including the analysis of MAPKs and callose deposition, to the supporting data section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 3: Flg22-induced FLS2-BAK1 association does not require S938, this is consistent with prior study that flg22 acts as a molecular glue for the ectodomains of FLS2 and BAK1 (Sun et al., 2013 Science). This needs to be cited.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Yes, we agree with the comment. Now we added an additional sentence in the revised manuscript: “ This aligns with the previous finding that flg22 acts as a molecular glue for FLS2 and BAK1 ectodomains (Sun et al., 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 4: Line 50, the references cited do not match what they say here.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We are sorry for the mistake in citing inappropriate references. In the revised manuscript, we deleted this sentence as well as the incorrect reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 5: Line 105, &quot;flg22 can act as a ligand-like factor&quot;. It is a ligand!</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Sorry for the mistake. Now, the sentence was corrected in the revised manuscript by deleting the word “like”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 6: Line 107, FLS2/BAK1 heterodimerization, not heteroologomerization.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Now we used “heterodimerization” to replace “heteroologomerization” in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 7: Line 114, are these really the best references to cite here?</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: After reading the comment, we found the references were not suitable here. Now we changed references by citing “(Martinière et al., 2021)” in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 8: Lines 123-124, the sentence is incomplete.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: In the revised manuscript, we reworded the sentence to make it complete now. We changed “In a previous investigation, we demonstrated that flg22 induces FLS2 translocation from AtFlot1-negative to AtFlot1-positive nanodomains in the plasma membrane, implying a connection between FLS2 phosphorylation and membrane nanodomain distribution (Cui et al., 2018). To validate this, we assessed the association of FLS2/FLS2S938D/FLS2S938A with membrane microdomains, using AtRem1.3-associated microdomains as representatives (Huang et al., 2019).” in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 9: Lines 169-170, Why is this &quot;most important&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Sorry for the unsuitable description. As we have dramatically changed the manuscript, this sentence was deleted from the new version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Here are some specific areas of ambiguity in the study to be improved.</p><p>Question 1: Clarity in statistical analysis is necessary. Many figure legends omit details such as the sample size &quot;n&quot;, and the nature of the measurements, like ROIs, images, and dots, the size of the seedlings, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We appreciated this suggestion, which was raised by the reviewer I as well. Now, we provided the details for each figure, including the sample size, the nature of the measurements in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 2: Additional background about the choice of FLS2-S938 mutant would be beneficial, given that this mutant doesn't affect the BAK1 interaction but nullifies several PTI responses.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Yes, we agreed that some additional background is required for the FLS2-S938 mutant. Therefore, we added a sentence here: “FLS2 Ser-938 mutations impact flg22-induced signaling, while BAK1 binding remains unaffected, thereby suggesting Ser-938 regulates other aspects of FLS2 activity (Cao et al., 2013).” in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 3: A specific segment &quot;... Using CLSM, Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) and Western blotting, we found that the endocytic vesicles of FLS2S938D increased significantly after flg22 treatment (Figure 3B-3E)...&quot; is not easy to follow. The author may want to differentiate these methods and highlight them by indicting them as endocytic vesicle counting, receptor density on PM measurement by FCS, and WB-based protein degradation characterization to understand such mixed descriptions better. By the way, &quot;Number of Endocytosis&quot; should be &quot;number of endocytic vesicles&quot;. Endocytosis is a process and uncountable.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We thank the reviewer for kindly reminding us to differentiate experimental methods. Therefore, we changed the sentences in the revised manuscript: “Employing confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) during 10μM flg22 treatment, we tracked FLS2 endocytosis and quantified vesicle numbers over time (Figure 3B). It is evident that both FLS2 and FLS2S938D vesicles appeared 15 min after-flg22 treatment, significantly increasing thereafter (Figure 3C). Notably, only a few vesicles were detected in FLS2S938A-GFP, indicating Ser-938 phosphorylation's impact on flg22-induced FLS2 endocytosis. Additionally, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (Chen et al., 2009) monitored molecular density changes at the PM before and after flg22 treatment (Figure S3F). Figure 3D shows that both FLS2-GFP and FLS2S938D-GFP densities significantly decreased after flg22 treatment, while FLS2S938A-GFP exhibited minimal changes, indicating Ser-938 phosphorylation affects FLS2 internalization. Western blotting confirmed that Ser-938 phosphorylation influences FLS2 degradation after flg22 treatment (Figure 3E), consistent with single-molecule analysis findings.” Besides, we also changed “number of endocytosis” to “the number of endocytic vesicles” in Figure 3C as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 4: In Figure 1 E, a discrepancy exists where the total percentages in the red and black columns don't sum up to 100%, while other groups look right. This needs clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We are sorry for our carelessness in making the data incomplete. Now we thoroughly supplemented, collated, and rechecked the data in Figure 1E. Due to an oversight during the production of the figure, some data was inadvertently omitted, resulting in the red column not reaching 100%. Besides, we checked the data in the black column again, and the total percentage indeed added up to 100%.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 5: Although Figure 1F uses UMAP analysis to differentiate between FLS2WT and A mutants, only data pertaining to the &quot;D&quot; mutant is shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you for the expert comments. Because there are several images in Figure 1, we only selected the data related to the “D” mutant as a representative for display. As suggested, we have added all the UMAP images in the revised supplement figure S1F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 6: There are apparent inconsistencies in the FRAP results, particularly regarding the initial recovery points post-bleaching. A detailed statistical analysis, supplemented with FRAP images over time, should be included for clarity. Were they bleached to a similar ground level before monitoring their recovery? The data points from &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after &quot;bleaching were not shown. I found the red and blue curves showed similar recovery slop, which suggests no long-distance movement changes for all three FLS2 versions, with or without flg22. This is opposite from the conclusions made by the author.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you for the expert comments. After reading the comments, we recognized this terrible problem. Therefore, we carried out a new FRAP experiment. The new results showed that, following complete bleaching of three samples of FLS2 to ground level, the recovery rates of FLS2 and FLS2S938D under flg22 treatment were significantly higher compared to the control group (Fig. 1G). In contrast, the recovery rates of the FLS2S938A-GFP after flg22 treatment remain similar to that before treatment (Fig. 1G), indicating that the Ser-938 phosphorylation site indeed affects the flg22-induced lateral diffusion of FLS2 at the PM. The new results are basically consistent with the motion range of single-molecule results, which is not contradictory to long-distance movement changes. Accordingly, we incorporated the new time-lapse FRAP images into Figure 1G and S1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 7: There's a potential typo in Figure 1B regarding the bar size. It could neither possibly be 200 um nor 200 nm. Figure 1A also needs a scale bar.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Apologies for the mistake. We now corrected “200 μm” to “2 μm”. Besides, we also included a scale bar in Figure 1A in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 8: Due to the unreliable tracking for a long-time by Imaris, the authors analyzed the tracks within 10s and quantified very short live particles under 4s. Such 4S surface retention for a receptor does not seem to match functional endocytic internalization time for cargo. Even after the endocytic adaptor module recruitment, it would take at least more than 10s to finish the internalization. In the field of endocytosis, these events are often described as abortive endocytic events. However, the disappearance of cargoes, FLS2 in this case, indicates internalization into the cytoplasm, which is interesting. May the author discuss more on how these short events analyzed enhance our understanding of the functional behavior of FLS2?</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We greatly appreciated the valuable comments provided by the reviewer. After thorough consideration, we acknowledged that in our original manuscript, we failed to distinguish the short-lived from the long-lived particles and vaguely put them collectively into the internalized particles. We realized that and it is inappropriate to ambiguously categorize all particles as internalized. Therefore, we added the sentence “Additionally, numerous FLS2 exhibited short-lived dwell times, indicating abortive endocytic events associated with the endocytic pathway and signal transduction (Bertot et al., 2018)” in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 9: Figure 2D should be comprehensive, presenting data for the WT, A, and D versions.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Yes, we agreed with the suggestions. Now, we added several representative images for the WT, A, and D versions in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 10: In Figure 2D, TIRM-SIM should be a typo and rectified to TIRF-SIM. Also, a detailed explanation of the TIRF-SIM setup and its specifics would be important. The imaging approach of SIM, especially the time duration for finishing all frames before reconstruction, is essential to rationalize its use in capturing and measuring an appropriate speed range of particle movement. May the author elaborate on the technique details and the use of TIRF-SIM for colocalization analysis? To clarify these, the author may provide additional TIRF-only movies of FLS2 (WT, A, D) and AtRem1.3 for comparison with TIRF-SIM still images.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Sorry for the mistake. In the revised manuscript, we have corrected “TIRM-SIM” to “TIRF-SIM”. In order to rationalize its use in capturing and measuring an appropriate speed range of particle movement, we included a more detailed description of the imaging approach and the colocalization analysis of TIRF-SIM in the Materials and Methods section as follows: “The SIM images were taken by a 60 × NA 1.49 objective on a structured illumination microscopy (SIM) platform (DeltaVision OMX SR) with a sCMOS camera (Camera pixel size, 6.5 μm). The light source for TIRF-SIM included diode laser at 488 nm and 568 nm with pixel sizes (μm) of 0.0794 and 0.0794 (Barbieri et al., 2021). For the dual-color imaging, FLS2/FLS2S938A/FLS2S938D-GFP (488 nm/30.0%) and AtRem1.3-mCherry (561 nm/30.0%) were excited sequentially. The exposure time of the camera was set at 50 ms throughout single-particle imaging. The time interval for time-lapse imaging was 100 ms, the total time was 2s, and the total time points were 21s. The Imaris intensity correlation analysis plugin was used to calculate the co-localization ratio.” in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, we provided additional TIRF-SIM movies of FLS2 (WT, A, D) and AtRem1.3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 11: The colocalization displayed in Figure 2D is hard to tell. A colocalization ratio of FLS2-AtRem1.3 is shown as ~0.8%, which has only ~0.2% difference from the flg22-treated condition. &quot;n&quot; of Figure 2F should be specified in the legend, such as a line with a specific length, or an ROI with a specific area size.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you for the expert comments. Although the increased colocalization after flg22 treatment is not high, the change is statistically significant as compared with the wild type. We agreed that every fluorescence-based method, like biochemical analysis, has its own unique limitations, which were raised by the Reviewer #2 (Public Review) as well. In order to provide strong evidence, we also carried out the FLIM-FRET experiment as a supplement, which can effectively detect their ligand-triggered association or disassociation. From figure 2G and H, we clearly found that the co-localization of FLS2/FLS2S938D-GFP with AtRem1.3-mCherry significantly increase in response to flg22 treatment (FLS2-GFP control: 2.45 ± 0.019 s; FLS2-GFP flg22-treated: 2.39 ± 0.016 s; FLS2S938D-GFP control: 2.42 ± 0.010 ns; FLS2S938D-GFP flg22-treated: 2.35 ± 0.028 ns). In contrast, FLS2S938A-GFP shows no significant changes (control: 2.53 ± 0.011 ns; flg22-treated: 2.56 ± 0.013 ns), indicating that Ser-938 phosphorylation influences efficient sorting of FLS2 into AtRem1.3-associated microdomains. Following the suggestion of the reviewer, we now rearranged the order of 2E and 2F, in which N represents the entire image region used for analysis rather than a specific region of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 12: I appreciate the nice results of the FLIM-FRET results for FLS2-Rem1.3. Figure 2H should be supplemented with additional representative images of all FLS2 variants including WT and mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thanks for your warm encouragement. As suggested, we added all the representative images in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 13: The unit of the X-axis of Figure 2E can not be pixel. Should it be, um? In the method, the author could specify the camera model and magnification for TIRF-SIM to understand pixel size of the image better.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Sorry for the mistake here. Indeed, the unit of the X-axis in Figure 2E should be μm. Now we correct this mistake in Figure 2E in the revised manuscript. Besides, we included a detailed description of the imaging approach of TIRF-SIM in the Materials and Methods section as follows: “The SIM images were taken by a 60 × NA 1.49 objective on a structured illumination microscopy (SIM) platform (DeltaVision OMX SR) with a sCMOS camera (Camera pixel size, 6.5 μm)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 14: &quot;... as shown in A...&quot; in Figure Legend 2E should be &quot;... as shown in D...&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thanks for pointing out this mistake. In the revised manuscript, we used “as shown in D” to replace “as shown in A”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 15: I recommend that the authors exercise caution when drawing conclusions based on the Rem1.3 data and when representing the &quot;microdomain&quot; concept in their final model. While Rem1.3 punctate is a nanometer-sized protein cluster specific to its identity, its shape can be categorized as a nanodomain. Conceptually, however, it neither universally represents all nanodomains nor microdomains, as depicted in Figure 4. We should exercise caution to prevent providing misleading information to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We thank the reviewer for expert comments. To avoid misleading conclusions, we changed “nanodomains” to “AtRem1.3-associated microdomains” in the revised manuscript. Besides, we have also made modifications to Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Question 1: The manuscript needs to be extensively re-written and has severe issues as-is.

As suggested, we thoroughly rewrote the manuscript to address the concerns raised. Furthermore, we have thoroughly checked and revised the manuscript by removing 21 irrelevant references and adding 30 relevant references. We also incorporated the most up-to-date descriptions of the PTI and RK signaling pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 2: Receptor-like kinase (RLK) should generally be receptor kinase (RK) as receptor functions are now well established.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Yes, we agreed with your expert comment here.

In the revised manuscript, we changed “However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of FLS2 phosphorylation activity at the plasma membrane in response to flg22 remain largely enigmatic.” to “However, the dynamic FLS2 phosphorylation regulation at the plasma membrane in response to flg22 needs further elucidation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 4: S938D sorts better in response to Flg22; S938A is unaffected - suggests phosphorylation of S938 is not dynamic in response to Fig 22 but is required for pre-elicitation sorting. Overall, there is a chicken-and-egg problem in this paper: which comes first, immune/signalling functionality or nanodomain sorting? And which is explaining the defects of S938A?</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We thank the reviewer for expert suggestions. In fact, the previous studies showed that membrane microdomains serve as signaling platforms that mediate cargo protein sorting and protein-protein interactions in a variety of contexts (Goldfinger et al. 2017). Since our previous research showed that the disruption of membrane microdomains affected flg22-induced immune signaling (Cui et al. 2018), we speculate that the immune signal occurred after entering the membrane microdomains.</p><p>As shown in Figure 1 and 2, ligand exposure leads to an increase in diffusion coefficient and enhanced co-localization with REM1.3, both of which are dependent on the phosphorylation of the Ser-938 site. Deducing from these results, we inferred that the defects in S938A resulted largely from its failure to sort into membrane microdomains. The phosphorylation of the Ser-938 site can regulate FLS2 into functional AtRem1.3-associated microdomains, thereby affecting flg22-induced plant immunity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 5: Line 37 conserved, not conservative (though not technically true - the domain organization is conserved but the ECDs are not conserved).</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you for pointing this mistake out.

After reading the comments, we realized the problem which was raised by the reviewer I as well. Now, we changed “ligand-like factor” to “ligand”.

Now, we added several sentences in the revised manuscript: “Therefore, we further investigated if Ser-938 phosphorylation affects FLS2/BAK1 heterodimerization. Tesseler segmentation, FRET-FLIM, and smPPI analyses revealed no impact of Ser-938 phosphorylation on FLS2/BAK1 heterodimerization (Figure 2A-C and S2). This aligns with the previous finding that flg22 acts as a molecular glue for FLS2 and BAK1 ectodomains (Sun et al., 2013), confirming the independence of FLS2/BAK1 heterodimerization from phosphorylation, with these events occurring sequentially.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 13: Line 119 - this is the wrong citation - Yu et al 2020 is a review and does not cover RALFs; correct citation is Gronnier et al 2022 eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: In the revised manuscript, we updated the reference from “ (Yu et al., 2020)” to “(Gronnier et al., 2022)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 14: Lines 123-124 - this sentence is incomplete.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Sorry for the incomplete sentence.

In the revised manuscript, we reworded the sentence as follows: “To validate this, we assessed the association of FLS2/FLS2S938D/FLS2S938A with membrane microdomains, using AtRem1.3-associated microdomains as representatives (Huang et al., 2019)” .</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 17: Line 138 - these are odd references to use for such a broad statement.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Now the inappropriate references cited here have been deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 18: Line 161 - incorrect reference, again.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Sorry for this mistake. In the revised manuscript, we reworded the sentence and changed the reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 19: Lines 160-165 - this is very confusing and misleading. I would suggest just having a short section introducing PTI earlier on (with appropriate references).</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: As suggestion, we reworded and added a section in the revised manuscript as follows: “PTI plays a pivotal role in host defense against pathogenic infections (Lorrai et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2022). Previous studies demonstrated that FLS2 perception of flg22 initiates a complex signaling network with multiple parallel branches, including calcium burst, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation, callose deposition, and seedling growth inhibition (Baral et al., 2015; Marcec et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2023). Our focus was to investigate the significance of Ser-938 phosphorylation in flg22-induced plant immunity. Figure 4A-F illustrates diverse immune responses in FLS2 and FLS2S938D plants following flg22 treatment. These responses encompass calcium burst activation, MAPKs cascade reaction, callose deposition, hypocotyl growth inhibition, and activation of immune-responsive genes. In contrast, FLS2S938A (Figure S4A-D) exhibited limited immune responses, underscoring the importance of Ser-938 phosphorylation for FLS2-mediated PTI responses”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 20: Line 166 - these are not appropriate references, again.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we removed the inappropriate references. Besides, we added new references by citing: “(Baral et al., 2015; Marcec et al., 2021)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 21: Lines 169-173 - this is not relevant, the inhibition of growth by elicitors is extremely well-documented (though not by the refs cited here).</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We reworded the sentence and deleted the inappropriate reference in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 22: Lines 174-175 - I don't see why this is unexpected, as nanodomain organization of PRRs has been previously described.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Sorry for the inappropriate expressions here.
