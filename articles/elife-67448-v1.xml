The crenarchaeal N-glycosylation begins with the synthesis of a lipid-linked chitobiose core structure, identical to that in Eukaryotes, although the enzyme catalyzing this reaction remains unknown. Here, we report the identification of a thermostable archaeal β-1,4-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, named <underline>a</underline>rchaeal <underline>gl</underline>ycosylation enzyme 24 (Agl24), responsible for the synthesis of the N-glycan chitobiose core. Biochemical characterization confirmed its function as an inverting β-D-GlcNAc-(1→4)-α-D-GlcNAc-diphosphodolichol glycosyltransferase. Substitution of a conserved histidine residue, found also in the eukaryotic and bacterial homologs, demonstrated its functional importance for Agl24. Furthermore, bioinformatics and structural modeling revealed similarities of Agl24 to the eukaryotic Alg14/13 and a distant relation to the bacterial MurG, which are catalyzing the same or a similar reaction, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of Alg14/13 homologs indicates that they are ancient in Eukaryotes, either as a lateral transfer or inherited through eukaryogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Sulfolobus acidocladarius</italic></kwd><kwd>N-glycosylation</kwd><kwd>chitobiose</kwd><kwd>Agl24</kwd><kwd>Alg13</kwd><kwd>Alg14</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Wellcome Trust and Royal Society Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>109357/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagstaff</surname><given-names>Ben A</given-names></name><name><surname>Dorfmueller</surname><given-names>Helge C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SFG</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>403222702-SFB 1381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Albers</surname><given-names>Sonja V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014690</institution-id><institution>Ministerium für Kultur und Wissenschaft des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Nachwuchsgruppe Dr. Alexander Probst</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Probst</surname><given-names>Alexander J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adam</surname><given-names>Panagiotis S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The crenarchaeon Sulfolobus synthesizes the N-glycan core in the identical way as all Eukaryotes, which strengthens the hypothesis that the eukaryotic N-glycosylation is acquired from an ancient archaeon during eukaryogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation is one of the most common co- and post-translational protein modifications found in all three domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nothaft and Szymanski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Larkin and Imperiali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jarrell et al., 2014</xref>). In Eukaryotes, N-glycosylation is evolutionarily highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lehle et al., 2006</xref>) and it is estimated that more than half of all eukaryotic proteins are glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Apweiler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zielinska et al., 2010</xref>). Correct folding and stability of proteins, intra- and extracellular recognition of protein targets and enzymatic activity necessitate N-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Varki, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Helenius and Aebi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caramelo and Parodi, 2007</xref>). Consequently, protein glycosylation is essential for many cellular processes of Eukaryotes. As such, congenital disorders of glycosylation in humans are often lethal or cause severe phenotypes and diseases, including intellectual disability, growth retardation, cardiac anomalies, and early death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Reily et al., 2019</xref>). Although it was long thought that N-glycosylation was restricted to Eukaryotes, N-glycosylation pathways have now been characterized in organisms of all domains of life.</p><p>The bacterial N-glycosylation processes, which assemble the N-glycan as an intermediated step on a lipid carrier and use an oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) for the transfer of the N-glycan to the target protein, as is has been described for the eukaryotic N-glycosylation, seem to be restricted to Delta- and Epsilon-Proteobacteria. However, also non-lipid-dependent N-glycosylation processes, in which a single nucleotide-activated sugar is directly transferred to a target protein, has also been described in different Bacteria, for example, for <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grass et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whitfield et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nothaft and Szymanski, 2019</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, all sequenced Archaea possess the N-glycan OST AglB, with the exceptions of <italic>Aeropyrum pernix</italic> and <italic>Methanopyrus kandleri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jarrell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nikolayev et al., 2020</xref>). The common feature of N-glycosylation is the assembly of an oligosaccharide onto a lipid through the activity of specific glycosyltransferases (GTs), which use either nucleotide- or lipid-activated sugar donors. The assembled lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) is flipped across the cytoplasmic/ER membrane. The glycan is then either enlarged or directly transferred onto a target protein by an OST. Archaeal N-glycosylation displays a mosaic of bacterial and eukaryotic features. Like Bacteria, Archaea use only a single OST subunit, whereas the majority of Eukaryotes require a large complex of distinct OST subunits to transfer the LLO onto the target protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wild et al., 2018</xref>). The level of complexity of the eukaryotic OST varies across kingdoms; vertebrates require an OST complex of eight subunits, plants and insects of seven, while kinetoplastids, like <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> or <italic>Leishmania major</italic>, possess only a single subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kelleher and Gilmore, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to Bacteria, which use undecaprenol as the N-glycan lipid carrier, Archaea assemble the N-glycan on dolichol (Dol) identical to Eukaryotes. Archaea also display unique N-glycosylation features, for example, the N-glycan assembly onto Dol-phosphate (Dol-P) in Euryarchaeota, while Crenarchaeota use Dol-pyrophosphate (Dol-PP) as do Eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Taguchi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Currently, more than 15 different archaeal N-glycan structures have been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jarrell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Albers et al., 2017</xref>). These archaeal N-glycans display unique structures and sugar compositions. Based on this limited characterization of archaeal N-glycans, it is plausible to assume that Archaea possess an enormous range of structural and composition diverse N-glycans. However, closely related species, for example, in the thermophilic crenarchaeal Sulfolobales family, retain a conserved N-glycan core structure but are differentiated by their terminal sugar residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zähringer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Palmieri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">van Wolferen et al., 2020</xref>). The protein N-glycosylation pathway of <italic>Sulfolobus acidocaldarius</italic> (order: Sulfolobales) has only been partially characterized. Secreted proteins, such as the cell wall surface-layer (S-layer) protein and motility filament forming protein ArlB, are N-glycosylated with a tribranched hexasaccharide. This N-glycan has the composition: (Glc-β1–4-sulfoquinovoseβ-1–3)(Man α-1–6)(Man α-1–4)GlcNAc-β1–4-GlcNAc-β-Asp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zähringer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Peyfoon et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, the N-glycan core structure is composed of a chitobiose (GlcNAc-β1–4-GlcNAc) identical to the core structure of all eukaryotic N-glycans. Members of the Sulfolobales family are the only Archaea reported to display this eukaryotic N-linked chitobiose core structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Palmieri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">van Wolferen et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, the characterization of the N-glycan from <italic>Pyrobaculum calidifontis</italic>, belonging to the Thermoproteales order of the Crenarchaeota, revealed as similar N-glycan chitobiose core structure, with the difference that both GlcNAc are modified with an additional <italic>N</italic>-acetyl group at the C3 position while the second GlcNAc residue is oxidized to glucoronate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fujinami et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Based on this eukaryotic N-glycan core structure, it has been suggested that the <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> N-glycan biosynthesis pathway may be similar to the eukaryotic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Meyer and Albers, 2013</xref>). Indeed, a homolog of the yeast Alg7 enzyme, which initiates eukaryotic N-glycosylation by transferring a GlcNAc-P from UDP-GlcNAc to Dol-P to generate the precursor Dol-PP-GlcNAc, has been identified in <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic> as AlgH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Meyer et al., 2017</xref>). Not only did this AglH show a similar topology and highly conserved amino acid motifs to Alg7, but also functionally complemented a conditional yeast Alg7 knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Meyer et al., 2017</xref>). This functional complementation has been first described for the AglH of <italic>Methanococcus voltae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shams-Eldin et al., 2008</xref>), which has suggested that AglH initiates the N-glycosylation by transferring GlcNAc-1-P onto Dol-P. However, a biochemical study clearly showed that AglK is responsible for the generation of Dol-P-GlcNAc, on which the N-glycan is assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Larkin et al., 2013</xref>). This observation agrees that Euryarchaeota build their N-glycans on Dol-P and not on Dol-PP in a similar manner to Crenarchaeaota and Eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Taguchi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the identification of the β-1,4-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminetransferase Agl24 from <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic>, which shows conserved amino acid motifs and apparent structural similarities with the eukaryotic Alg14/13 and bacterial MurG functional homologs. Activity assays along with HPLC, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), and NMR analyses confirmed the function of Agl24 as catalyzing the second N-glycan biosynthesis step to generate the lipid-linked chitobiose core. Our extensive bioinformatics analyses support the hypothesis that the eukaryotic N-glycosylation pathway originates from an archaeal ancestor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a Dol-PP-GlcNAc UDP-GlcNAc GlcNAc GT candidate in <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic></title><p>To identify the GT that catalyzes chitobiose biosynthesis step in the N-glycosylation process in <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic>, we searched for similar biosynthetic processes to identify potential homologs. The bacterial enzyme MurG transfers a GlcNAc residue from UDP-GlcNAc to the C4 hydroxyl group of MurNAc-(pentapeptide)-PP-undecaprenol to produce the lipid-linked β-(1,4) disaccharide known as lipid II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Men et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ha et al., 1999</xref>). Although MurG does not synthesize chitobiose-like <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic> does, the enzyme uses a similar lipid-linked acceptor and an identical sugar donor (UDP-GlcNAc) and therefore presents a valid candidate for evaluation. MurG has been classified in the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cazy.org/">http://www.cazy.org/</ext-link>) as a family 28 GT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lombard et al., 2014</xref>). Until now, only a few archaeal organisms possess GT28 family homologs. These organisms include members of the archaeal orders Methanobacteriales and Methanopyrales, which have been described that synthesize pseudomurein as a component of their cell wall structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kandler and König, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">König et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Albers and Meyer, 2011</xref>), and <italic>Salinadaptatus halalkaliphilus</italic> 2447, a recently described member of the Halobacteriales.</p><p>Another candidate homolog is the eukaryotic protein complex formed by Alg13 and Alg14 that transfers GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to the C4 hydroxyl of GlcNAc-PP-Dol to produce the β-(1-4) chitobiose core of the eukaryotic N-glycan. Alg13 and Alg14 are classified as GT1 family members but are distantly related to GT28 family enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lombard et al., 2014</xref>). Alg13 and Alg14 form the C- and N-terminal domains, respectively, of a functional heterodimeric GT enzyme; Alg14 contains the acceptor-binding site and the membrane association domain, while Alg13 possesses the UDP-GlcNAc-binding pocket. The interaction of these two enzymes is required for the catalytic activity, as the active site lies in the cavity formed by the two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bickel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chantret et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao et al., 2005</xref>). Although members of the GT1 family are prominent in Archaea, until now no GT1 family member has been identified in genomes of Sulfolobales.</p><p>As Alg14-13 and MurG use UDP-GlcNAc to GlcNAcylate a lipid-linked sugar acceptor, they represent valid candidates for a bioinformatics search in <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic>.</p><p>Using the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MurG protein sequence (WP_063074721.1; EC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/2.4.1.227">2.4.1.227</ext-link>) as template for a Delta BLAST search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boratyn et al., 2012</xref>), various homologs were identified in <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic> with very low sequence identity of only 10–17% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

This GGxGGH motif and a subsequent second glycine-rich motif (GGY) have been proposed to enable MurG to be involved in an interaction with the diphosphate group of the lipid acceptor, as these two motifs resemble phosphate-binding loops of nucleotide-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baker et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carugo and Argos, 1997</xref>).

In addition, HSQC experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) were used to assign the identity of each proton and carbon signal. The C4 signal of the α-GlcNAc residue was shifted to 79.6 ppm, strongly suggesting that the terminal β-GlcNAc was linked at this position. This was further supported by a relative increase in the shift of the H4 proton of the α-GlcNAc residue compared to the un-modified acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zorzoli et al., 2019</xref>).

Similar to Alg14-13, the combined activity of EpsE and EpsF links either a glucose (Glc) from UDP-Glc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kleerebezem et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Kranenburg et al., 1999</xref>), or a galactose (Gal) from UDP-Gal via a β-1,4 linkage to lipid-linked glucose acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Kranenburg et al., 1999</xref>), creating either a lipid-linked cellobiose or a lactose, respectively. As opposed to Agl24 and the other exclusively archaeal clades in our phylogeny, most EpsE/EpsF and Alg14/Alg13-related genes are split. This indicates a single gene split event at the base of that clade, followed by multiple independent re-fusion events across Bacteria, Archaea (e.g., some Thorarchaeota), and Eukaryotes (Kinetoplastids, Amoebozoa; in the latter with gene order inversion).</p><p>All other sequences are exclusively archaeal, fused, and form primarily two clades. One clade consists mainly of euryarchaeal methanogens and a couple of DPANN. The distribution in certain lineages (Methanococcales, Methanosarcinales) is wide enough to suggest that their respective ancestors possessed an Alg14-13 homolog. The second clade corresponds to the TACK superphylum (Thaum-, Bathy-, Aig-, Mars-, Geotherm-, Nezha-, Verstraete-, and Korarchaeota). Even though the relationships among lineages are unresolved, an Alg14-13 homolog was most probably present at the ancestor of the TACK supergroup. Among the TACK, there exist sequences from various Asgard lineages that have been acquired from ancient lateral transfers.</p><p>A third clade consisting of divergent Thaumarchaeota sequences is either sister to both TACK and Euryarchaeota-DPANN (Alg13/EpsF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) or only the TACK. Although we used only well-established Alg14-13 homologs from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lombard, 2016</xref>, in our phylogenies, such divergent homologs (often forming distinct clades) exist across multiple archaeal lineages, including one in Bathyarchaeota (mainly in GTDB genus g__PALSA-986) and two in Methanobacteriales (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9KSWQR">doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9KSWQR</ext-link>). Some of the Bathyarchaeota and the GTDB o__Thermofilales (NCBI: unclassified Thermoprotei) member B67-G16 in the TACK clade above additionally possess an Agl24. Some Bathyarchaeota MAGs also contain additional sequences from the unused divergent clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9KSWQR">doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9KSWQR</ext-link>). Since their N-glycosylation processes are unknown, it is impossible to predict the function and overlap thereof of these homologs.</p><p>Outgroup-free rooting with the minimal ancestor deviation (MAD) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tria et al., 2017</xref>) corroborates the outgroup rooting of the phylogenies with MurG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The bacterial MurG and various (primarily) archaeal Agl24/Alg14-13/EpsEF homologs seem to have originated from a split at the Last Universal Common Ancestor, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lombard, 2016</xref>). Although EpsE/EpsF and Alg14/Alg13-like sequences are found in Bacteria which are ancient in some lineages (EpsE/EpsF in Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria, see the preliminary phylogenies in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9KSWQR">doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9KSWQR</ext-link>), these homologs are of archaeal origin and were acquired through ancient interdomain transfers.</p><p>Similarly, the respective eukaryotic branches are internally poorly resolved and do not even recover the major clades of that domain, such as Opisthokonts. We cannot reveal if this is purely due to weak phylogenetic signal or horizontal gene transfer events, however, the eukaryotic Alg14-13 are monophyletic and archaeal in origin. One possibility is that they were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA), as proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lombard, 2016</xref>. The proximity of Asgards to Eykaryotes would suggest that these genes were inherited vertically during eukaryogenesis in a two-domain tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eme et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Williams et al., 2020</xref>). The counterargument is that only two Asgard phyla are in the vicinity of Eukaryotes, and neither is Heimdallarchaeota, as would be expected from the literature. Despite our careful analysis, we did not find Alg13- and Alg14-like sequences in most Asgard species, suggesting that if they produce the same type of glycosylation, they could be using a different enzyme for this step of N-glycosylation. The homologs in Wukong-, Baldr-, Borrarchaeota, DTBI01, and a second homolog in Odinarchaeota have been laterally acquired from within the TACK. It is unknown whether the multiple Odinarchaeota genes have overlapping functions. The alternative scenario to eukaryogenesis involves a very ancient interdomain transfer from Archaea to either proto-Eukaryotes or shortly after the LECA. Even if such a history is compatible with both a two- and three-domain tree of life, our phylogenies do not directly support a three-domain tree. Whether with MurG outgroup rooting or MAD outgroup-free rooting, the Eukaryotes emerge from and are not sister to all Archaea.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we identified the first archaeal and thermostable β-1,4-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, named Agl24, responsible for the second synthesis step of the lipid-linked chitobiose on which the N-glycan of <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic> is assembled. The reported essentiality of Agl24 is in agreement with the indispensable properties of the OST AglB and AglH, catalyzing the last and first step of the N-glycosylation process in <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Meyer and Albers, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Meyer et al., 2017</xref>). The essentiality of the N-glycosylation has also been confirmed by a transposon study in <italic>Sulfolobus islandicus</italic>, a close relative of <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic>, in which all homologous genes, including <italic>agl24</italic>, lack any transposon insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). However, the fundamental nature of archaeal N-glycosylation cannot be generalized since deletion mutants of the OST AglB can be obtained in Euryarchaeota, for example, in <italic>Methanococcus maripaludis</italic> and <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chaban et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Qarn et al., 2007</xref>). The requirement for N-glycosylation might rely on many factors including the N-glycan composition and structure, as well as the modification frequency on proteins; this frequency is reported to be higher in thermophilic, compared to mesophilic, Archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Meyer and Albers, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jarrell et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of Agl24 with eukaryotic Alg14-13 and the bacterial MurG enzymes revealed structural and amino acid similarities. Although the sequence identity of Agl24 with the eukaryotic and bacterial enzymes is extremely low (~16%), the structural prediction of Agl24 indicated a MurG-like GT-B fold. Interestingly, the amino acids of the nucleotide sugar donor-binding site of MurG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hu et al., 2003</xref>) are not conserved in Agl24 and Alg14, although all enzymes use UDP-GlcNAc as the sugar donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, boxed). Strikingly, a conserved GGH<sub>14</sub> motif within an N-terminal loop of MurG, Alg14-13, and Agl24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), which protrudes into the cavity formed by the two structural folds, could be identified in Agl24. In Bacteria, this G<sub>13</sub>GTGGH<sub>18</sub> loop is extended by a second G<sub>103</sub>GY<sub>105</sub> loop. As both loops are suggested to be reminiscent of the phosphate-binding loops of nucleotide-binding proteins, their involvement in the binding of the diphosphate group of the acceptor lipid has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Crouvoisier et al., 2007</xref>). In agreement with our results, the alanine substitutions of the invariant bacterial H<sub>14</sub> led to an extremely low or undetectable activity of MurG as well as to the loss of the ability to complement a temperature-sensitive MurG mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Crouvoisier et al., 2007</xref>). However, up to now, no structure of MurG or Alg14-13 with the bound lipid acceptor molecule has been published and the interaction of the imidazole ring of the histidine residue with the acceptor molecule remains to be shown. Our alignment also reveals a conserved glutamic acid in the bacterial, eukaryotic, and archaeal sequences. In Bacteria, this glutamic acid is found in a conserved H<sub>124</sub>EQN<sub>127</sub> loop (<italic>E. coli</italic> MurG), which has been proposed to form a key part of the acceptor-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hu et al., 2003</xref>). In agreement with our study, an E<sub>125</sub>A substitution significantly affected the function of MurG, although a marked decrease in lipid acceptor binding (1760-fold) and nucleotide substrate binding (210-fold) was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Crouvoisier et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The euryarchaeal N-glycosylation processes have been well characterized for different species (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jarrell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Albers et al., 2017</xref>). The enzymes catalyzing the first and second step, for example, in <italic>H. volcanii</italic> AglJ and AglG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yurist-Doutsch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kaminski et al., 2010</xref>) and in <italic>M. voltae</italic> AglK and AglC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chaban et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Larkin et al., 2013</xref>), belong to the GT2 family and possess a GT-A fold. <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic> is the only crenarchaeal species for which the N-glycosylation process has been defined, and we revealed that Agl24 is the first archaeal glycosylation enzyme with a predicted GT-B structure. Based on these Agl24 differences to the GT2 family and MurG (GT28, GT-B fold), Agl24 is assigned to the new GT-B fold GT-family 115.</p><p>Although lacking a TMD, Agl24 associates with the membrane, indicating an interaction with membrane enzymes, similar to the interaction of MurG or Alg14-13 with their membrane interaction partners MraY and Alg7, respectively. Based on the structural similarities of these complexes, a shared common evolutionary origin of the first enzymes of eukaryotic N-glycosylation and the bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis has been hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bugg and Brandish, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burda and Aebi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bouhss et al., 2008</xref>). As <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic> possesses a homolog of Alg7, termed AlgH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Meyer et al., 2017</xref>), and a bioinformatics study has indicated that Alg7 might have emerged out of the Crenarchaeota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lombard, 2016</xref>), AglH presents the most likely candidate for being the interaction partner of Agl24.</p><p>Our phylogenetic analysis shed light on the distribution of the identified Agl24 in Archaea and determined its relationship with eukaryotic and bacterial homologs suggesting a very ancient and broad distribution of Agl24/Alg14-13/EpsEF-like homologs in Archaea. Importantly, close homologs of Agl24 are only found within the Crenarchaeota, Bathyarchaeota, and one Asgard genome (Baldrarchaeota). Indeed, all Crenarchaeota, except for members of the order Thermoproteales, possess an Agl24 homolog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>), strongly suggesting that they contain a chitobiose N-glycan core structure. By contrast, the N-glycans of members of the Thermoproteales could be synthesized using a different enzyme. The N-glycan of <italic>Pyrobaculum caldifontis</italic>, belonging to the order Thermoproteales, differs from the N-glycan in Sulfolobales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fujinami et al., 2017</xref>). Its N-glycan core is composed of two di-N-acetylated β-1,4-linked GlcNAc residues with the second sugar being carboxylated at C6 (GlcA(NAc)<sub>2</sub>-β-1,4-Glc(NAc)<sub>2</sub>). A di-N-acetylated glucuronic acid sugar is also found in the N-glycan from <italic>M. voltae,</italic> which is transferred by the GT AglC onto the Dol-P-linked GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chaban et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, a homolog of AglC is likely to be involved in the N-glycan biosynthesis in <italic>P. caldifontis</italic>. The best candidate for an AglC homolog in <italic>P. calidifontis</italic> is Pcal_0481 showing 29.91% sequence identity. Interestingly, the GT-A fold structure has recently been solved, while the predicted function as a mannosyltransferase could not be experimentally confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gandini et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the most closely related enzymes to the eukaryotic Alg14 and Alg13 are found within the Asgard superphylum. Since the discovery of the Archaea as the third domain of life along with Bacteria and Eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Woese and Fox, 1977</xref>), the comparison of archaeal molecular processes, especially those found in Crenarchaeota, has gradually revealed a strong resemblance of the ones found in Eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huet et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zillig et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akıl and Robinson, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akıl et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, some recent phylogenomic analyses indicated that Eukaryotes originated close to the TACK superphylum (Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Korarchaeota) within the Asgard superphylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Petitjean et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Raymann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zaremba-Niedzwiedzka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Williams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) although phylogenies supporting a three-domain tree of life are reported occasionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Da Cunha et al., 2017</xref>). A current hypothesis for the formation of the first eukaryotic cell proposes a membrane protrusion of an ancestral archaeon that engulfed a bacterium to increase the interspecies interaction surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baum and Baum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Imachi et al., 2020</xref>). The eukaryotic N-glycosylation would therefore have been inherited from this ancient archaeal ancestor, which is in agreement with the high conservation of the initial N-glycosylation biosynthesis steps in all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Helenius and Aebi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Samuelson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schwarz and Aebi, 2011</xref>). In addition, AglB in members of the Asgard and TACK superphyla shows considerable similarity to its eukaryotic homologue Stt3, and is clearly distinct from the AglB of the DPANN superphylum and the Euryarchaeota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nikolayev et al., 2020</xref>). Most eukaryotic Stt3 contain a double sequon motif for N-glycosylation near the substrate-binding site, which is hypothesized to contribute to the LLO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wild et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shrimal and Gilmore, 2019</xref>). Interestingly, this double sequon is also present in the AglB of the members of the Asgard and TACK superphyla but absent in the AglB of Euryarchaeota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shrimal and Gilmore, 2019</xref>). Moreover, homologs of non-catalytic subunits of the eukaryotic Stt3 complex, for example, ribophorin, Ost3/6, Ost5, and Wbp1, have been detected in some Asgard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zaremba-Niedzwiedzka et al., 2017</xref>). However, their specific function in the N-glycosylation has to be shown, especially as ribophorin is only found in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wilson and High, 2007</xref>) and is therefore unlikely to have existed in early Eukaryotes. Nevertheless, the assembly of the N-glycan linkage in the TACK superphylum is conducted via a pyrophosphate linkage to the Dol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Taguchi et al., 2016</xref>), identical to that in Eukaryotes. This contrasts with Euryarchaeota, which use a monophosphate linkage. A summary of the similarities and differences of the archaeal N-glycosylation to Eukaryotes and Bacteria is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. All these observations strengthen the hypothesis that the eukaryotic N-glycosylation has emerged from an ancient archaeon. However, an origin of the eukaryotic Alg14-13 through eukaryogenesis cannot be unambiguously demonstrated. Due to the sparse distribution of Alg14-13 homologs among Asgards, incongruences in the phylogenies of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and poor resolution within Eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), it is possible that these components of eukaryotic N-glycosylation originated from an ancient lateral transfer. It is also noteworthy that there exists a multitude of distant Alg14-13 homologs throughout Archaea. Even though in our analysis we relied on well-established clades, primarily due to their evolutionary proximity to Agl24 and Eukaryotes, there are additional clades other than the Asgards worth exploring in the future, such as the ones in Bathyarchaeota and Methanobacteriales (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9KSWQR">doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9KSWQR</ext-link>). Many Bathyarchaeota have multiple Alg14-13 homologs, which suggest some functional redundancy. Methanobacteriales use pseudomurein, which raises the question why do they contain these homologs.</p><p>The homologs of eukaryotic GTs in members of the TACK and Asgard superphyla are very useful tools to study the structure and the functional relationship of the elusive eukaryotic enzymes.

A linear gradient from 20% to 80% Buffer B was performed over 20 min, followed by an immediate drop back to 20% Buffer B for the remaining 15 min of the run to re-equilibrate the column to starting conditions. The Agl24 reaction substrates and products typically eluted 8–11 min into a run.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;N-glycan chitobiose core synthesis by Agl24 strengthens the hypothesis of an archaeal origin of eukaryal N-glycosylation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Patrick Forterre (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Revise text for accuracy and readability as noted by the reviewers. Revise title, summary, discussion, and cover art to align with data provided.</p><p>2) Include statements to make the impact of the work on glycobiology more clear for the reader. Strengthen the messaging of the study as it relates to areas of emphasis noted by the reviewers (use of model system, motif, etc).</p><p>3) Revise the phylogenetic analysis to strengthen it.</p><p>4) Figure S4. Provide a control showing the subcellular fraction of another S. acidocaldarius protein of known distribution, to confirm the membrane association of Agl24. If authors are unable to provide this, then the text should be edited appropriately to make the conclusions tentative pending further confirmation in line with evidence provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General comment – While the actual experiments are solid, the manuscript is very poorly written and even sloppy at places. Too many imprecise statements, errors in figures, etc (see examples, below). The manuscript would also be improved by a quick round of English language editing.</p><p>My specific comments are listed as encountered while reading the manuscript:</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Page 1, line 26 (Cover Art) – in the upper left-hand corner, an outline of something remains. Remove it.</p><p>Page 2, line 29 (and Page 2, line 54) – In Bacteria, N-glycosylation is seemingly limited to the δ/epsilon proteobacteria. As such, the statement: &quot;Protein N-glycosylation is the most common posttranslational modifications found in all three domains of life&quot; is inaccurate. Indeed, the authors themselves note this point (page 3, line 66).</p><p>Page 2, line 47 – remove comma between &quot;histidine&quot; and &quot;within&quot;.</p><p>Page 2, line 55 – does <italic>eLife</italic> require references to be listed alphabetically or chronologically? Here, neither rule applies. Add a period at the end of the sentence.</p><p>Page 2, line 56 – the text reads: &quot;In Eukarya, N-glycosylation is an essential process&quot;, yet on line 61, we are told: &quot;the biological functions of protein glycosylation range from relatively minor to crucial for survival&quot;. The two phrases don't match.</p><p>Page 3, line 69 – what about the non-lipid-dependent N-glycosylation that occurs in some bacteria (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae HMW1 adhesin or the actions of NGT, the N-glycosylating GTase in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae )?</p><p>Page 3, line 74 – to the best of my knowledge, the extended bacterial sequon D/E-X1-N-Χ2-S/T (where X is not proline) is recognized in Campylobacter jejuni and Helicobacter pullorum, the OST of other bacteria show a more relaxed specificity (for instance, see Ollis et al., 2015 Sci Reports).</p><p>Page 3, line 77 – The statement: &quot;Eukarya require an OST complex of nine subunits&quot; is not accurate. Trypanosomes use a single subunit-containing OST.</p><p>Page 3, lines 78-82 – The writing here is very sloppy. In lines 78-79, we are told: &quot;In contrast, Archaea use the shorter version of the recognition sequon (N-X-S/T) as well as dolichol-phosphate (Dol) as lipid&quot;, yet lines 81-82 read: &quot;while the Crenarchaeota use Dol pyrophosphate as in eukaryotes&quot;.</p><p>Page 4, line 103 – &quot;This is a rare example of cross-domain complementation&quot; is inaccurate. There are numerous examples of complementation of a eukaryote mutant by a bacterial gene (for instance, see Kachroo et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2017 for examples). Moreover, no hypothesis of a common origin for eukaryotic and archaeal N-glycosylation was stated up to this point, so it is not clear how this statement further strengthens such a concept.</p><p>Page 4, lines 108-109 – Agl24 would not generate the lipid-linked chitobiose core; rather, it would contribute to the assembly of this moiety.</p><p>Page 4, line 110 – On lines 103-104, the reader is told &quot;of a common origin of eukaryotic and archaeal N-glycosylation&quot;, yet here it is proposed that &quot;the eukaryotic N-glycosylation pathway originates from an archaeal ancestor&quot;. These scenarios are not really the same thing.</p><p>Larkin et al., (2013, Nat Chem Biol), where AglK was shown to add GlcNAc to dolichol phosphate in the methanoarchaea Methanococcus voltae should also be addressed in the Introduction, especially given how genetic studies on this organism have assigned this role to AglH (Shams-Eldin et al., 2008, J. Bacteriol.).</p><p>Likewise, the N-linked glycan of the crenarchaeote Pyrobaculum calidifontis, which includes a core reminiscent of chitobiose (Fujinami et al., 2017, Glycobiology) should also be noted in the Introduction.</p><p>Results</p><p>Page 5, line 115 – &quot;this&quot;?</p><p>Page 5, lines 123-124 – Not accurate. CAZy lists the halophile Salinadaptatus halalkaliphilus, a member of the family Natrialbaceae, as a GT28 family member (http://www.cazy.org/GT28_archaea.html). Also, Kandler and/or Konig should be cited for their work on pseudomurein.</p><p>Page 5, line 142 – The authors should refer to the paper by Cavalier-Smith and Chao (2020, Protoplama) where Saci1262 is described as corresponding to MurG. Indeed, this reference addresses similarities between MurG, Alg13/14 and Saci1262.</p><p>Page 6, line 148 – At this stage of the story, there is no justification in assigning Saci1262 to the N-glycosylation pathway, namely, assigning it the Agl tag used for confirmed archaeal N-glycosylation pathway components. Such involvement needs to be first demonstrated – no such demonstration has been presented at this stage of the report.</p><p>Page 6, lines 149-153 – Since the reader is not told where other N-glycosylation genes are found relative to Saci1262, this bit of text could confuse those outside the field. Indeed, the authors finish the section by stating how Saci1262 is only eight genes downstream of the OST-encoding aglB gene, leaving the reader unclear as to how N-glycosylation gene clustering is defined.</p><p>The &quot;Detailed bioinformatics…..&quot; section beginning on line 156 would be easier to read if the authors better separated data based on sequence comparisons from data based on structural comparisons. Moreover, including evolutionary considerations in the middle of the first paragraph of the section (lines 163-168) further adds to mixture of ideas that require better organization.</p><p>Page 6, line 170 – &quot;archaeal Agl24 enzymes&quot;? At this point, the reader has only been told of Saci1262. Figure 1B and Figure S2, where archaeal Saci1262 homologues are listed, have not yet been cited in the text. Indeed, without knowing anything about N-glycosylation in the majority of these species, it is premature to assign them the Agl24 title – at this stage they are homologues of Saci1262.</p><p>Figure 1A – &quot;Archaea&quot; should not be italicized. Also, why &quot;most Eukarya&quot; and not &quot;higher Eukarya&quot;, since &quot;lower Eukarya&quot; is used? Line 181 – orthologs.</p><p>Figure 1B – the background color scheme is not defined anywhere. Also, &quot;Euryarchaeota&quot; and &quot;Crenarchaeota&quot; should be used, rather than Euryarchaea and Crenarchaea. Why include an artificial yeast Alg13/14 fusion and not the true sequences? Also, maybe I am getting too old to see tiny figures, but it is really hard to follow the color-based sequence alignment presented. How are the red and yellow residues at the end of the Leishmania sequence conserved since they are only found in that one sequence?</p><p>Figure 1C – why not used the same color-coding as used in Figure 1A and 1B? The legend says the Alg13 domain is in turquoise – it is not.</p><p>Page 8, line 204 – eukaryotic</p><p>Page 8, line 211 – what the RMSD of the homology model? In other words, how good is the fit?</p><p>Page 8, line 223 – &quot;both&quot;? E114 and, I assume, H14. Say it better.</p><p>Page 8, line 224 – is it known that all the archaeal species assigned to GT28 produce pseudomurein or is this just being assumed?</p><p>Page 8, line 226 – &quot;the different acceptor molecule&quot;? As the reader may not be an expert in the field, a reminder of the different acceptor molecules might be in place here.</p><p>Page 9, line 233 – a gene (agl24) is essential, not the protein product.</p><p>Page 9, line 235 – agl24 not Agl24</p><p>Is it possible to create a S. acidocaldarius strain lacking agl24 but in which either the MurG- or Alg13/14-encoding genes are introduced?</p><p>Figure S3 – The figure title talks of agl23 deletion. Also, agl24 not Agl24 throughout.</p><p>Page 9, line 252 – As written, the sub-heading implies that GlcNAc alone can serve as acceptor. This was not shown.</p><p>Figure S4A – Without a control showing the subcellular fraction of another S. acidocaldarius protein of known distribution, the membrane association of Agl24 is not confirmed. Is the Agl24 in the supernatant spill from the membrane lane?</p><p>Figure S4C – what does the light blue background represent? What do E and H under the sequence mean (H, hydrophobic; E, ?).</p><p>Page 9, lines 258-263 – The reader is directed to Figure 3C, then to Figure 3A and Figure 3B, then to Figure 3D and Figure 3E. Reorder the panels or the text to go from A-E.</p><p>Figure 3 – If the in vitro reaction was allowed to run for a prolonged period, was Agl24 able to add an additional GlcNAc?</p><p>Page 10, line 274 – reference?</p><p>Figure 4 – In each panel, there remain the frames of rectangles used to cover up apparently unrelated values of around the values above each peak. Very sloppy! The last sentence should read &quot;Above 50°C, the increase in the level of the product at the expense of the level of the acceptor is clearly visible&quot;.</p><p>Page 11, line 292 – Alanine substitution was not inactive. Rather enzymes in which alanine was substituted for histidine were inactive.</p><p>Page 11, line 300 – As written, the text leads the reader to believe that only H14 and E114 are conserved. E114 is a second conserved residue, not the second conserved residue.</p><p>Figure 5 – The previous section described H14 as being important. Here, H15 is addressed. Also, in each panel, there remain the frames of rectangles around the values above each peak. Again, very sloppy!</p><p>Page 14, line 353 – Do the Eps-like sequences in the Euryarchaeota include any of the known enzymes experimentally confirmed as being involved in adding linking sugars?</p><p>Page 14, line 363 – &quot;within them&quot; – who is them? Members of the TACK superphylum or in some Euryarchaeota? Not clear.</p><p>The entire &quot;The eukaryotic GTs….&quot; section is very difficult to follow. The addition of more narration to this section would make it more readable.</p><p>Figure 7 – The use of so much color is distracting. Why does each phylum need a different color? Bootstrap values should be provided to attest to the support given to each clade. How many iterations were run?</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Page 15, line 403 – 'respectively', not 'either'.</p><p>Page 17, line 454 – Does Pyrobaculum calidifontis contain an AglC homologue?</p><p>Page 17, line 458 – The authors state: &quot;comparison of archaeal molecular</p><p>processes has gradually revealed a strong resemblance to those found in eukaryotes&quot;. This is more true of the Crenarchaeota than of the Euryarchaeota.</p><p>Page 17, line 463 – &quot;A&quot; current hypothesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I suggest that you slightly change the way you introduce your identification of Alg24 by first describing how you modelled the structure of your candidate enzyme and identified the conserved amino-acids before naming the enzyme and compare Alg24 with its homologues. I suggest that you include EpsF in this comparison. You should put more emphasis on the identification of the motif GGxGGH motif. You could possibly mention and discuss the genetic work in the discussion part. For the phylogenetic analysis, I suggest that you perform a concatenation (removing Methanopyrus kandleri which is a fast-evolving species and disturb the phylogeny with Alg14) and consider my comments about the different subgroups. It should be important having more details about the phylogeny of EpsF and eukaryotes. In fact, your paper is sufficiently interesting and important in the fields of N-glucosylation, that you don't need to oversell it through the fashionable 2D domains story and the Asgard origin of eukaryotes. You repeatedly claim (and illustrate in the cover art) that your phylogenetic analysis indicates that eukaryotic have close homologues in Asgard, suggesting an Asgard origin of these proteins. On the contrary, an interesting aspect of your paper for me is that most Asgard have no Agl13/14 homologues, except a few MAGs that have a distant one. This should be confirmed by the analysis of more Asgard. If the lack of Agl13/14 homologues is confirmed, it will be crystal clear that the few sequences found in Asgard MAGs are not representative of Asgard, in general, and that, even in a 2D perspective, Alg13/14 did not originated from Asgard. You should definitely remove from the title, covert art and so on all misleading sentences with respect to the archaeal and/or Asgard origin of eukaryotes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Considering the similarity between N-glycosylation of Eukaryotes and Archaea belonging to TACK superphylum, in the text it should be stressed that GTs from thermophilic Archaea could be excellent models to study the structure/function relationship of elusive eukaryotic enzymes. Their stability could be of great help for detailed characterization and 3D structure. The authors could comment this in the text.</p><p>Similarly, the authors should stress that S. acidocaldarius could be used as model system in vivo to proof the function of archaeal homologs of eukaryotic GTs.</p><p>Alg24 is homolog to MurG and Alg13/14 belonging, respectively to CAZy families GT28 and GT1, but the low sequence identity left Alg24 unassigned. The scientists in the field of glycobiology would be happy to know in which GT family can be classified Alg24. It would be of great help for others working in this field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67448.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Revise text for accuracy and readability as noted by the reviewers.

You repeatedly claim (and illustrate in the cover art) that your phylogenetic analysis indicates that eukaryotic have close homologues in Asgard, suggesting an Asgard origin of these proteins. On the contrary, an interesting aspect of your paper for me is that most Asgard have no Agl13/14 homologues, except a few MAGs that have a distant one. This should be confirmed by the analysis of more Asgard. If the lack of Agl13/14 homologues is confirmed, it will be crystal clear that the few sequences found in Asgard MAGs are not representative of Asgard, in general, and that, even in a 2D perspective, Alg13/14 did not originated from Asgard. You should definitely remove from the title, covert art and so on all misleading sentences with respect to the archaeal and/or Asgard origin of eukaryotes.</p></disp-quote><p>We are inclined to agree with many of these suggestions. The situation of the Asgards regarding N-glycosylation appears to be far more complicated than what would be expected from simply adhering to a 2D scenario. On the other hand, the eukaryotic homologs are of archaeal origin and their closest currently known relatives are Asgards. Therefore, in the revised manuscript we have explored the different implications of our phylogenies. We have removed the cover art to avoid any confusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Considering the similarity between N-glycosylation of Eukaryotes and Archaea belonging to TACK superphylum, in the text it should be stressed that GTs from thermophilic Archaea could be excellent models to study the structure/function relationship of elusive eukaryotic enzymes.

The authors could comment this in the text.</p><p>Similarly, the authors should stress that S. acidocaldarius could be used as model system in vivo to proof the function of archaeal homologs of eukaryotic GTs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have highlighted the excellent opportunity to study the homologs of the eukaryotic GT in Archaea, and in particular in <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic>, in the last paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alg24 is homolog to MurG and Alg13/14 belonging, respectively to CAZy families GT28 and GT1, but the low sequence identity left Alg24 unassigned.
