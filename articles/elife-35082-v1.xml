Despite the therapeutic and scientific interest in LSD, specific receptor contributions to its neurobiological effects remain unknown. Methods: We therefore conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02451072) during which 24 healthy human participants received either (i) placebo+placebo, (ii) placebo+LSD (100 µg po), or (iii) Ketanserin, a selective 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonist,+LSD. We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and compared it to cortical gene expression maps. Findings: LSD reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory-somatomotor brain-wide and thalamic connectivity. Ketanserin fully blocked the subjective and neural LSD effects. Whole-brain spatial patterns of LSD effects matched 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor cortical gene expression in humans. Conclusion: Together, these results strongly implicate the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor in LSD’s neuropharmacology. This study therefore pinpoints the critical role of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> in LSD’s mechanism, which informs its neurobiology and guides rational development of psychedelic-based therapeutics.

Users can experience hallucinations, in which they, for example, see things that are not there. Colors, sounds and objects can appear distorted, and time can seem to speed up or slow down. These changes bear some resemblance to the changes in thinking and perception that occur in certain psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Studying how LSD affects the brain could thus offer insights into the mechanisms underlying these conditions. There is also evidence that LSD itself could help to reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders.</p><p>Preller et al. have now used brain imaging to explore the effects of LSD on the brains of healthy volunteers. This revealed that LSD reduced communication among brain areas involved in planning and decision-making, but it increased communication between areas involved in sensation and movement. Volunteers whose brains showed the most communication between sensory and movement areas also reported the strongest effects of LSD on their thinking and perception.</p><p>Preller et al. also found that another drug called Ketanserin prevented LSD from altering how different brain regions communicate. It also prevented LSD from inducing changes in thinking and perception. Ketanserin blocks a protein called the serotonin 2A receptor, which is activated by a brain chemical called serotonin that, amongst other roles, helps to regulate mood. By mapping the location of the gene that produces the serotonin 2A receptor, Preller et al. showed that the receptor is present in brain regions that show altered communication after LSD intake, therefore pinpointing the importance of this receptor in the effects of LSD.</p><p>Psychiatric disorders that produce psychotic symptoms affect vast numbers of people worldwide. Further research into how LSD affects the brain could help us to better understand how such symptoms arise, and may also lead to the development of more effective treatments for a range of mental health conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>serotonin</kwd><kwd>psychedelics</kwd><kwd>functional

rid="bib50">Murray et al., 2012</xref>). Mechanistic studies of consciousness may be undertaken using psychedelic drugs as pharmacologic probes of molecular signaling within cortical networks underlying perception and thought. In particular, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a psychedelic drug with predominantly agonist activity at serotonin (5-HT)2A/C, −1A/B, −6, and −7 and dopamine D2 and D1 receptors (R). Its administration produces characteristic alterations in perception, mood, thought, and the sense of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marona-Lewicka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nichols, 2004</xref>). Despite its powerful effects on consciousness, human research on LSD neurobiology stalled in the late 1960s because of a narrow focus on the experiential effects of hallucinogenic drugs, combined with a lack of understanding of its effects on molecular signaling mechanisms in the brain. However, renewed interest in the potentially beneficial clinical effects of psychedelics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gasser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Griffiths et al., 2016</xref>) warrants a better understanding of their underlying neuropharmacology. Nevertheless, major knowledge gaps remain regarding LSD’s neurobiology in humans as well as its time-dependent receptor neuropharmacology.</p><p>To address this critical gap, the current study aims to comprehensively map time-dependent pharmacological effects of LSD on neural functional connectivity in healthy human adults and compare them to the spatial expression profile of genes coding for receptors interacting with LSD. The goal is to leverage the statistical properties of the slow (&lt;1 Hz) intrinsic fluctuations of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal hemodynamics at rest (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fcMRI)). Critically, rs-fcMRI analyses are able to reveal the functional architecture of the brain, which is organized into large-scale systems exhibiting functional relationships across space and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biswal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buckner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>). Rs-fcMRI measures have furthermore revealed potential biomarkers of various neural disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murrough et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2016a</xref>), as well as proven sensitive to the effects of neuropharmacological agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Driesen et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Anticevic et al., 2015</xref> ).</p><p>Focused analyses on specific regions revealed effects of intravenously administered LSD on functional connectivity between V1 and distributed cortical and subcortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b</xref>). However, such ‘seed-based’ approaches rely on explicitly selecting specific regions of interest based on a priori hypotheses. Therefore, such an approach has limited ability to detect pharmacologically-induced dysconnectivity not predicted <italic>a priori</italic>. To characterize LSD effects on functional connectivity in the absence of strong a priori hypotheses, the current study employed a fully data-driven approach derived from graph theory called Global Brain Connectivity (GBC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anticevic et al., 2014a</xref>). In essence, GBC computes the connectivity of every voxel in the brain with all other voxels and summarizes that in a single value. Therefore, areas of high GBC are highly functionally connected with other areas and might play a role in coordinating large-scale patterns of brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cole et al., 2010</xref>). Reductions in GBC may indicate decreased participation of a brain area in larger networks, whereas increased GBC may indicate a broadening or synchronization of functional networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anticevic et al., 2014a</xref>). One focused study examined GBC after intravenously administered LSD in a sample of 15 participants, revealing connectivity elevations across higher-order association cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tagliazucchi et al., 2016</xref>). While compelling, this preliminary study did not take into account the influence of global signal (GS) artefacts (e.g. via global signal regression, GSR), which are known to exhibit massive differences in clinical populations and following pharmacological manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Power et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Driesen et al., 2013b</xref>). Specifically, GS is hypothesized to contain a complex mixture of non-neuronal artefacts (e.g., physiological, movement, scanner-related), which can induce elevated relationships across the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>). No study has examined LSD-induced changes as a function of GS removal. To inform this knowledge gap a major objective here was to study data-driven LSD-induced dysconnectivity in the context of GS removal.</p><p>Another aim of the current study was to determine the extent to which the neural and behavioral effects of LSD are mediated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors. Preclinical studies suggest that LSD binds potently to many neuroreceptors including 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, D2, and other receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marona-Lewicka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Passie et al., 2008</xref>). Yet, a recent paper from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Preller et al., 2017</xref>) reported that the psychedelic effects of LSD were entirely blocked in humans by ketanserin (Ket), a selective antagonist at 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and α-adreno receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leysen et al., 1982</xref>). This would suggest that the neural effects of LSD should be blocked by Ket. It also suggests that networks modulated by LSD should highly be associated with the distribution of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors in the brain and not closely associated with the distribution of receptors unrelated to the mechanism of action of LSD.</p><p>Here we leverage recent advances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burt et al., 2018</xref>) in human cortical gene expression mapping to inform the spatial topography of neuropharmacologically-induced changes in data-driven connectivity. We hypothesized that the LSD-induced GBC change will quantitatively match the spatial expression profile of genes coding for the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor. In turn, we hypothesized that this effect will be preferential for the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> but not other receptors and that the spatial match will be vastly improved after artefact removal. In doing so, this convergence of neuropharmacology and gene expression mapping validates the contribution of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor to LSD neuropharmacology. In turn, it also highlights a general method for relating spatial gene expression profiles to neuropharmacological manipulations, which has direct and important implications for the rational refinement of any receptor neuropharmacology.</p><p>Collectively, this pharmacological neuroimaging study addresses the following major knowledge gaps in our understanding of LSD neurobiology, by demonstrating: (i) data-driven LSD effects across brain-wide networks, which are exquisitely sensitive to GS removal, (ii) the subjective and neural effects of LSD neuropharmacology are attributable to the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor, and (iii) the cortex-wide LSD effects can be mapped onto the spatial expression profile of the gene coding for the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LSD modulates global brain connectivity and induces marked subjective drug effects</title><p>The main effect of drug on GBC computed with global signal regression (GSR) revealed significant (TFCE type I error protected, 10000 permutations) widespread differences in GBC between drug conditions in cortical and subcortical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Comparing LSD to Ketanserin+LSD (Ket+LSD)+Placebo (Pla) conditions across sessions shows that LSD induces hyper-connectivity predominately in sensory and somatomotor areas, that is the occipital cortex, the superior temporal gyrus, and the postcentral gyrus, as well as the precuneus. Hypo-connectivity was induced in subcortical areas as well as cortical areas associated with associative networks, such the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, the cingulum, the insula, and the temporoparietal junction.

Similarly to the comparison LSD vs. (Ket+LSD)+Pla shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, LSD compared to both Pla and Ket+LSD separately induced a connectivity pattern characterized by significant (TFCE type I error protected, 10000 permutations) hyper-connectivity in predominantly sensory areas and significant hypo-connectivity in associative networks. The similarity between the LSD&gt;Pla and LSD&gt;Ket+LSD contrasts is corroborated by a significant positive correlation (r = 0.91, p&lt;0.001) between the respective Z-maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, only negligible differences were observed when comparing Ket+LSD and Placonditions directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, we tested if the directionality of LSD-induced effects on GBC (hyper-connectivity across sensory and somatomotor networks, hypo-connectivity across associative networks) are separable effects or result from functionally related systems-level perturbations. To this end, we correlated the mean connectivity strength difference between Pla and LSD in hyper-connected regions with mean connectivity strength difference in hypo-connected regions across subjects (based on the LSD vs. (Ket+LSD)+Pla contrast). There was a significant correlation between hypo- and hyper-connectivity (r = −0.90, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) indicating that participants with the highest LSD-induced coupling within sensory and somatomotor networks also showed the strongest LSD-induced de-coupling in associative networks. This suggests that LSD-induced alterations in information flow across these networks may result from systems-level perturbations. Together, these results indicate that LSD-induced GBC alterations are predominantly attributable to its agonistic activity onto the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor. In line with this, a repeated-measures ANOVA (drug condition×scale) was conducted for the retrospectively administered Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) questionnaire, and revealed significant main effects for drug condition (F (2, 46)=88.49, p&lt;0.001) and scale (F (10, 230)=14.47, p&lt;0.001), and a significant interaction of drug condition×scale (F (20, 460)=13.02, p&lt;0.001). Bonferroni corrected simple main effect analyses showed increased ratings on all 5D-ASC scales in the LSD condition compared to Pla and Ket+LSD conditions (all p&lt;0.05) except for the scales spiritual experience and anxiety (all p&gt;0.20).

This discrepancy calls into question interpretations regarding the directionality of LSD on sensory-somatomotor vs. association cortices, at least when assayed via the GBC metric. To inform this question, we conduced three additional analyses designed to investigate the influence of LSD and GSR on BOLD signal properties, which help inform and constrain GBC interpretations:</p><p>First, we investigated if the amplitude of the BOLD signal is influenced by GSR across different experimental conditions (i.e. LSD vs. Pla). Specifically, we quantified ‘amplitudes’ using a measure of local grayordinate-wise variance – an approach validated in our prior work in the context of clinical neuroimaging and effects of GSR in such datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2014b</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the change in local grayordinate-wise variance under LSD vs. Pla. The effect illustrates a very weak alteration in local variance (min/max Z = −1.54/+2.28). No areas survived whole-brain correction. This result in not consistent with the hypothesis that LSD markedly alters grayordinate-wise amplitudes/variance relative to Pla.</p><p>Second, we calculated the mean variance of the GS across all grey matter grayordinates (as opposed to local grayordinate-wise variance). We achieved this by defining the mean of all gray matter signal for a given subject based on their FreeSurfer segmentation and then computed the variance of the BOLD signal time course, averaged over all grayordinates in this global greymatter mask. Results indicate that variance of the GS does not differ significantly between conditions on average when computing the mean across all grey matter grayordinates [F(2, 46)=0.71, p&gt;0.49)].</p><p>Third, we investigated the possibility that the GS itself may exhibit a shifted topography on LSD, as shown in prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2016b</xref>). Specifically, the two analyses above reveal that grayordinate-wise and average GS variance do not markedly differ for LSD vs. Pla. However, the mean GS analysis above cannot address the possibility that the GS signal itself has a distinct spatial configuration following LSD administration. In other words, which areas are maximally contributing to the mean GS may not be the same after LSD administration. To investigate the possibility of a shifted topography of the GS, as shown in prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2016b</xref>), we computed the beta map of the GS for each subject (see Materials and methods). This GS beta map allowed us to compare the spatial topography of GS under LSD vs. Pla conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As evident from the figure, the GS beta contrast was quite robust, especially when compared to the local grayordinate-wise variance results (min/max Z = −5.73/+7.74). Critically, the map revealed a bi-directional spatial shift of the GS under LSD where associative cortices and large areas of sub-cortex showed an elevated GS contribution. In contrast, the blue areas showed a reduced GS contribution under LSD. This map correlated highly with the spatial organization of the LSD-induced changes on GBC. This is unsurprising as GBC is highly sensitive to shared brain-wide signal shifts. Put differently, a GBC measure will be sensitive to the change in the mean shared signal across the brain. If LSD is altering this mean shared signal topography, then the GBC effect should be similarly affected. To quantify this we calculated the relationship between the LSD-Pla contrast GBC map before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and after GSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and the LSD-Pla contrast GS beta map. The LSD-Pla contrast GS beta map exhibited a highly significant negative correlation with the LSD-Pla contrast GBC map after GSR (r = 0.65, p&lt;0.001), but a highly significant positive correlation before GSR (r = 0.66, p&lt;0.001). This result provides evidence consistent with the hypothesis that LSD induces a transformation in the GS beta map itself, which is contributing the GBC effect pre/post GSR.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35082.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Beta map of the global signal for the LSD&gt;Pla contrast.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The top panel displays significant (TFCE type I error protected) areas showing increased (red) and decreased (blue) covariance with the GS in the LSD condition compared to Pla. The Z map in the lower panel illustrates the unthresholded contrast between LSD vs. Pla for the GS beta map computed for each subject. Specifically, we calculated the GS (computed as mean grey matter signal) for each frame in the BOLD time course. This mean GS was then used as a regressor in a subject-specific general linear model (GLM). The resulting beta map indicates which areas are maximally co-varying with the mean GS for each subject under LSD or Pla. This ‘GS beta map’ was then entered into a 2<sup>nd</sup> level analysis as done for the connectivity dependent measures.

There is a core limitation to the GBC metric in relation to the GS topography inherent to the way it is computed: Specifically, GBC yields the mean shared signal from a given grayordinate to all other grayordinates. This calculation is therefore affected by the shared variance across all grayordinates (i.e. the map of the GS). If this shared GS variance structure is shifted in one condition versus the next, then the GBC calculation will shift accordingly in a spatially ordered way corresponding to the GS spatial shift.</p><p>Therefore, it is not known from the GBC effects alone if LSD elevates or reduces mean connectivity in associative vs. sensory and somatomotor cortices. This interpretational challenge stems from the presented GS beta map analyses because it is not clear if GS beta map transformations on the GBC effect under LSD are primarily neural or artefactual.</p><p>To address this, we designed a complementary analysis, which yields a map that is interpretationally consistent irrespective of GS-related shifts. Here we focused on the thalamo-cortical system leveraging a well-established effect that is not affected by GSR transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Anticevic et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Woodward et al., 2012</xref>). To examine brain-wide thalamic coupling in session one we computed a seed-based map by extracting average time-series across all grayordinates in each subject's anatomically defined bilateral thalamus (via FreeSurfer segmentations). To examine between-drug differences, thalamic maps were entered into a second level analysis as done for the GBC measures (mean thalamic connectivity maps for each condition are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and all contrasts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Here we used both the correlation and covariance as methods of statistical association, which we conjuncted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cole et al., 2016</xref>). We did this because covariance reflects a non-normalized measure of shared BOLD signal across time (which is scale free and unaffected by variance structure) whereas correlation is inherently normalized by pooled variance. Furthermore, given that GS induces mean signal shifts (i.e. it may induce anti-correlation), we also obtained the top and bottom 10% of all thalamic connections from both correlation and covariance maps before and after GSR. This final 4-way conjunction map ensured that the resulting regions in the top/bottom ranges exhibit thalamic coupling irrespective of processing (i.e. GSR/noGSR) or statistical method (i.e. r or cov). This map was then used to calculate LSD induced effects on top 10% and bottom 10% of seed thalamic brain-wide connections. The prediction was that LSD would decrease thalamic connections that were in the top 10% (i.e. highly positive thalamic connections at baseline, which represent thalamo-associative coupling, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Critically, this effect was preserved for the LSD-(Ket+LSD) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Without GSR however, inconsistent results emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). To reconcile the interpretation of LSD-induced directionality we leveraged the conjunction map that was robust to processing method and statistical approach. This conjunction map was used as a mask to extract the average signal across these regions in the LSD-Pla and LSD-(Ket+LSD) contrast before and after GSR in the seed-based correlation/covariance analyses as well as GBC correlation/covariance analyses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> shows the difference in the average signal between these drug conditions across analyses methods (thalamic seed FC/GBC, correlation/covariance) after GSR. Here, LSD consistently decreased thalamic coupling in associative areas and increased thalamic coupling in sensory-somatomotor regions irrespective of analysis method. Importantly, the thalamic seed analyses matched GBC effects. Without GSR however (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), seed thalamic coupling and GBC results were inconsistent. Furthermore, in contrast to results after GSR, LSD did not consistently decrease connections that were in the top 10% or elevate connections that were in the bottom 10% without GSR. To investigate individual differences, we computed the correlation between the top and bottom connections before and after GSR across participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, full connectivity matrix is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The prediction was that individuals with biggest elevation for bottom 10% would should the biggest drop in the top 10% under LSD. Predicted negative individual differences emerged after GSR but without GSR results were not compatible with individual difference predictions based either for thalamic seed analysis or GBC. Collectively, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that, following GS cleanup, LSD reduces shared signals for association cortices but elevates shared signals for sensory and somatomotor areas across both seed-based thalamic and GBC analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Time course of subjective drug effects</title><p>To investigate the time course of subjective effects, a short version of the 5D-ASC was administered 180 min, 250 min, and 360 min after the second drug administration.

However, the underlying neuropharmacology psychedelics is scarcely investigated in humans. The current study closes major knowledge gaps in the area by characterizing the effects of the prototypical psychedelic by showing that i) LSD increases GBC across sensory and somatomotor functional networks and reduces GBC in associative networks, which is sensitive to GS removal; ii) time-dependent effects are only found in the interaction with katenserin; iii) GBC in the somatomotor network was associated with subjective effects; iv) LSD-induced effects on GBC and subjective symptoms are linked to the pharmacology of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor; v) innovative gene expression analyses across cortex reveal for the first time a correspondence between specific spatial gene expression patterns and in-vivo pharmacological effects in humans.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>LSD increases GBC across sensory and somatomotor functional networks and reduces GBC in associative networks</title><p>We show across conditions that LSD induces hyper-connectivity predominantly in sensory and somatomotor areas (i.e. the occipital cortex, the superior temporal gyrus, and the postcentral gyrus). LSD-induced hypo-connectivity was observed across subcortical areas (with the exception of the amygdala and sensory thalamus) as well as cortical areas associated with associative networks (i.e. the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, the cingulum, the insula, and the temporoparietal junction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that LSD induces a de-synchronization of associative networks whereas sensory and somatomotor areas exhibit elevated brain-wide shared signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anticevic et al., 2014a</xref>). This is in line with previous seed-based studies reporting increased V1 resting-state connectivity with the rest of the brain after LSD administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b</xref>). Additionally, decreases of connectivity within the DMN were reported after ayahuasca, a tea containing the hallucinogenic 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonist N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, desynchronization within the DMN was reported after psilocybin infusion measured with magnetoencephalography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013</xref>). As noted, while subcortical areas predominantly show hypo-connectivity under LSD there were key exceptions: the amygdala exhibited brain-wide hyper-connectivity under LSD. Amygdala neurons abundantly express 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, and alterations in amygdala activity and connectivity have been hypothesized to be important for potential beneficial clinical effects of psychedelics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rainnie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kraehenmann et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, results showed that participants with the highest LSD-induced coupling within sensory and somatomotor networks also showed the strongest LSD-induced de-coupling in associative networks. This suggests that LSD-induced alterations in information flow across these networks probably results from linked systems-level perturbations, as opposed to being due to dissociable mechanisms across subjects. This pattern of hyper-and hypo-connectivity may underlie the psychedelic state, suggesting increased processing of sensory information which is not counterbalanced by associative network integrity. Consequently, this may result in an altered state of consciousness whereby internal and external sensory computations are not integrated, leading to psychedelic symptoms.</p><p>A virtually identical pattern of hyper-connectivity in sensory networks and hypo-connectivity in associative networks is revealed when contrasting LSD effects with the condition where LSD is blocked by pre-administration of Ket. This brain-wide net effect of LSD was virtually indistinguishable from LSD vs. Pla condition. Put differently, pre-treatment of LSD with Ketanserin induced only negligible changes compared to LSD vs. Pla, indicating that Ket blocked virtually all LSD-induced alterations in GBC. Ketanserin has high antagonistic properties particularly on the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor. Thus, these results indicate that LSD-induced alterations in neural and behavioral effects are highly dependent on stimulation of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leysen et al., 1982</xref>). This is in line with data on subjective LSD-induced effects which were normalized by Ket pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these data extend previous studies by revealing that the described pattern of brain-wide dysconnectivity may be directly attributable to stimulation of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor. Specifically, the effect can be characterized by brain-wide integration of sensory networks and dis-integration of associative networks, which presumably underlie LSD-induced altered state of consciousness. Furthermore, these data highlight the importance of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor system in LSD-induced neural and behavioral alterations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>LSD’s effect on GBC is sensitive to GS removal</title><p>One small study by Tagliazucchi et al. has previously investigated the effects of intravenously administered LSD and reports that association cortices (partially overlapping with the default-mode, salience, and frontoparietal attention networks) and the thalamus showed increased GBC under LSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tagliazucchi et al., 2016</xref>).

Such artefacts can induce spuriously high statistical association across the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coyle, 2006</xref>). Due to these discrepancies, we studied the data as a function of GS regression to inform how this methodological step affects results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tagliazucchi et al., 2016</xref>). These analysis support the observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tagliazucchi et al. (2016)</xref> when GS was not considered: results showed increased GBC in fronto-parietal, temporal, and subcortical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The analysis without GSR showed a positive correlation between hyper- and hypo-connectivity change scores, indicating that participants with the highest LSD-induced hyper-connectivity showed the weakest LSD-induced de-coupling. This was in contrast to results after GS removal. Furthermore, connectivity values with GSR and those without GSR were not significantly correlated within subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Notably, without GS regression, LSD-Pla differences were not observed when examining seven functionally pre-defined networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These data suggest that GS related effects cannot be explained by a mean-shift in connectivity values on average, but instead may reflect a process within each subject.</p><p>One hypothesis is that GSR statistically attenuates non-neural arts and therefore provides a method to better isolate functional networks in pharmacological resting-state connectivity studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coyle, 2006</xref>). This interpretation is consistent with the absence of a neural-symptom correlation without GSR. Finally, spatial correlations with gene expression maps (discussed below) were notably attenuated for without GSR. That said, this dataset is not well-suited for drawing conclusions about GSR suitability for pharmacological neuroimaging. In fact, it can be argued that results are more replicable across session 1 and 2 without GSR. However, the statistical phenomenon of ‘artefactual’ replication is not surprising, if one considers that GSR is designed to attenuate sources of spatially pervasive structured artefacts which may persist across sessions; f.e. elevated respiratory artefacts). Put differently, there is a key nuance between ‘noise’ and ‘artefact’. Pure unstructured noise can be signal-averaged out and would not yield a consistent ‘artefactual’ effect. In contrast, ‘structured’ artefact represents a signal that can induce the same spurious effect multiple times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Power et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Glasser et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, if a structured artefact is large across both measurements (session 1 and 2), then this artefact will spuriously drive the effect and will be replicable. Experiments that manipulate variables such as breathing rate and vigilance will be key to fully characterize the effects of GSR on pharmacological neuroimaging data and help separate neuropharmacological effects associated with ‘global artefacts’ versus those affecting ‘global neural signal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Glasser et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, there are open knowledge gaps regarding LSD’s effects on neurovascular coupling and the hemodynamic response function properties. This pitfall needs to be addressed in experiments incorporating measures specifically designed to investigate changes in hemodynamic coupling. Here animal studies, which offer the possibility to combine neuronal recordings with simultaneous measurement of hemodynamics, will be critical to help interpret LSD effects inhumans.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Considering the directionality of LSD’s neural effects</title><p>As expected, the GS analyses indicate that a GBC metric is highly sensitive to global shared signal, which is altered under LSD. This raises the question regarding the direction of the LSD-induced effects on association vs. sensory-somatomotor areas. To inform the directionality of LSD modulations of GBC we completed an additional analyses based on seed-based thalamic functional connectivity, which yielded a map that was robust to GS transformations. The reason for this phenomenon is that the thalamus exhibits strong bi-directional brain-wide shared signal. Furthermore, we constructed a conjunction measure that identified baseline (i.e. Pla) thalamic FC that was interpretationally consistent irrespective of GS-related shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This seed-based conjunction analysis revealed that LSD-induced changes were consistent after GSR and comparable to GBC effects. Without GS removal, neither the thalamic nor GBC effects converged across metrics. This observation, however, does not rule out the possibility that GS removal in fact attenuates signal components that are neuronal in origin and may be relevant to important LSD-induced properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tagliazucchi et al., 2016</xref>). Careful manipulation and measurement of respiratory-related artefacts during pharmacological fMRI is needed to disambiguate the amount of GS variance that relates to neuronal vs. artefactual LSD effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Time-dependent effects of LSD</title><p>Animal studies suggest distinct temporal phases of LSD pharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marona-Lewicka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marona-Lewicka and Nichols, 2007</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the time-dependent effects of LSD on subjective effects as well as on GBC. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, subjective effects were highest 180 min after LSD administration and decreased in intensity 250 and 360 min after administration as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Passie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmid et al., 2015</xref>). No differences were found between Pla and Ket+LSD conditions at any time point, with subjective effects in both conditions being very low in intensity (&lt;4.7%). This shows that Ket blocked subjective LSD-induced effects over the whole time course, indicating that subjective effects are most likely attributable to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor stimulation. To investigate the time course of LSD-induced effects on GBC, two resting-state scans were analyzed, conducted 75 min (session 1) and 300 min (session 2) after the second drug administration. While no significant differences were observed when comparing session 1 and 2 within the Pla and the LSD condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), participants showed significant changes in GBC in session two compared to session one in the Ket+LSD condition. Taken together with time-dependent results observed in the functionally defined networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the blocking effect of ketanersin is particularly evident in the session one across all networks. Specifically, Ket not only blocks LSD effects in session one but also augments the effects seen in Pla, indicating the opposite mechanism of action from that seen by LSD – namely 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leysen et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kometer et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, it seems possible that there exist two distinct pharmacological time phases as described in animal studies. The first phase may be modulated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor activation and the second phase possibly by D2 receptor activation, as suggested by preclinical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marona-Lewicka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marona-Lewicka and Nichols, 2007</xref>). This hypothesis of time-dependent complex receptor pharmacology awaits further testing. First, studies are needed to investigate the effect of Ket alone on GBC to verify the preferential effects of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> antagonism. Second, studies using pre-treatment of LSD by antagonists on receptors other than 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> are needed to determine if the second phase is indeed modulated by another receptor system. Lastly, indications of different pharmacological phases are not evident from subjective drug effects which remain completely blocked by Ket. Studies using higher doses of LSD are therefore needed to investigate if the potential effect of LSD’s action on other receptors becomes more pronounced and therefore subjectively accessible.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>LSD-induced alterations in GBC in the somatomotor network are associated with subjective effects</title><p>The LSD-induced change in connectivity in the somatomotor network correlated significantly with general and specific subjective LSD-induced effects (mean across all scales, blissful state, disembodiment, changed meaning of percepts, elementary imagery, spiritual experience). Participants with increased connectivity in the somatomotor network also showed higher subjective effects. On average, the change in connectivity between the LSD and Pla condition in the somatomotor network was not significant. However, this is likely explained by the heterogeneous connectivity changes within this network: while the pre- and postcentral gyrus predominantly showed increases in GBC, medial areas were hypo-connected. Connectivity changes in other functional networks were not significantly correlated with subjective effects. This points to the importance somatomotor network brain regions and their connectivity with the rest of the brain for psychedelic experiences. This is in line with previous results obtained from task-related data showing that the supplementary motor area is associated with LSD-induced alterations in meaning and personal relevance processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Preller et al., 2017</xref>). These results also support broader theories of consciousness emphasizing the importance of the sensorimotor system for the perception of presence and agency, and therefore a sense of self (e.g., interoceptive predictive coding model of conscious presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seth et al., 2011</xref>), comparator model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frith et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blanke and Metzinger, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, alterations in sensorimotor gating have been suggested to underlie psychedelic experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Quednow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ludewig et al., 2003</xref>). Somatomotor system activity and connectivity has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Anticevic et al., 2014b</xref>), an illness characterized by delusions and alterations in the sense of self, potentially arising from alterations in sensorimotor gating deficits in an inferential mechanism that allows distinguishing whether or not a sensory event has been self-produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Synofzik et al., 2010</xref>). The current results corroborate and extend these previous findings by showing that somatomotor network connectivity is also closely associated with an LSD-induced psychedelic state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>LSD-induced alterations in GBC correlate with HTR2A and HTR7 cortical gene expression</title><p>To further investigate LSD’s receptor pharmacology we specifically used the threshold-free Z-score map of LSD effects relative to Ket blockade and Pla. The logic here is that such a map may reflect Ket-specific contributions to LSD blockade, which is hypothesized to involve the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor. This map was then correlated with gene expression maps of receptors that may be stimulated by LSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nichols, 2004</xref>). LSD-induced changes in functional connectivity after GSR exhibited strong positive relationships with HTR2A expression (higher than 95.9% of all possible gene expression correlations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These results show that LSD-induced changes in GBC quantitatively match the spatial expression profile of genes coding for the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor, supporting the central role of this receptor system in LSD’s neuronal and subjective effects. LSD-induced changes in functional connectivity were also highly negatively correlated with HTR7 gene expression (lower than 99.8% of all possible gene expression correlations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This can be explained by the highly anti-correlated expression of these two genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). However, it is also possible that the 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor functionally contributes to LSD-induced effects. In contrast to its agonistic properties on the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor, LSD has been reported to be an antagonist in the 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wacker et al., 2013</xref>). Since previous studies have shown that 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor antagonists have anti-psychotic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waters et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2009</xref>), it seems very unlikely that LSD’s effects have a strong and appreciable contribution on the 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor. However, future studies should examine 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor pharmacology more carefully as they may reveal a role of this receptor system in pro-cognitive effects that contrast those of LSD. While the current results strongly implicate the involvement of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor in LSD-induced effects, it must be noted that no further conclusions can be drawn regarding the functional contribution of other receptors agonized or antagonized by LSD. This limitation needs further investigation in future studies by blocking serotonin and dopamine receptors involved in the pharmacology of LSD beyond the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor. Furthermore, the contribution of these receptors to the effects of different doses of LSD still need to be studied. Finally, we show that the spatial match between gene expression maps and GBC maps is significantly improved after GSR, even though correlation coefficients in particular for DRD1, DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2C remain moderate. These results also highlight the validity of this approach as a general method for relating spatial gene expression profiles to neuropharmacological manipulations in humans. An important next step allowing further methodological validation is comparing LSD-induced alterations in GBC with receptor maps provided by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saulin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ettrup et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ettrup et al., 2014</xref>), preferably using MR scanners that are both MR and PET compliant allowing for cross-validation across BOLD and PET modalities within the same person.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the current results close major knowledge-gaps regarding the neurobiology and neuropharmacology of LSD. First, we show that LSD induces widespread alterations of GBC in cortical and subcortical brain areas, characterized by a synchronization of sensory and somatomotor functional networks and dis-integration of associative networks. We show that this effect is sensitive to GSR, which has important implications for future pharmacological resting-state studies. Second, we investigated the receptor-pharmacology of LSD, showing that the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor plays a critical role in subjective and neuronal LSD-induced effects. However, analyzing the time course of LSD-induced alterations in functional connectivity, it seems likely that at a later phase, modulation by receptors other than the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor is involved. The comparison of LSD-induced effects on functional connectivity and receptor-gene expression maps underscores the interpretations of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> pharmacology and points to potentially impactful studies on 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor pharmacology. Lastly, in line with various theories of consciousness we showed that the somatomotor system in particular is related to LSD-induced psychedelic effects. Collectively, these results deepen our understanding of psychedelic compounds and offer important directions for development of novel therapeutics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited through advertisements placed in local universities from March to July 2015 and underwent a screening visit before inclusion in the larger study protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Preller et al., 2017</xref>).

These open-source HCP algorithms, optimized for our specific acquisition parameters and Yale’s High Performance Computing resources, represent the current state-of-the-art in distortion correction, registration, and maximization of high-resolution signal-to-noise (SNR). Here we briefly describe the processing steps. Complete details are outlined by Glasser and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">WU-Minn HCP Consortium et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>First, the T1w/T2w images were corrected for bias-field distortions and warped to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute-152 (MNI-152) brain template through a combination of linear and non-linear transformations using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002823">SCR_002823</ext-link>) linear image registration tool (FLIRT) and non-linear image registration tool (FNIRT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jenkinson et al., 2002</xref>). Then, FreeSurfer’s recon-all pipeline was employed to compute brain-extraction, within-subjects registration, and individual cortical and subcortical anatomical segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reuter et al., 2012</xref>). T1w/T2w images were then converted to the Connectivity Informatics Technology Initiative (CIFTI) volume/surface ‘grayordinate’ space.</p><p>Raw BOLD images were first corrected for field inhomogeneity distortion, phase encoding direction distortions and susceptibility arts using the pair of reverse phase-encoded spin-echo field-map images implemented via FSL’s TOPUP algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 2003</xref>). Motion-correction was then performed by registering each volume in a run to the corresponding single-band reference image collected at the start of each run. BOLD images were then registered to the structural images via FLIRT/FNIRT, and a brain-mask was applied to exclude signal from non-brain tissue. After processing in NIFTI volume space, BOLD data were converted to the CIFTI gray matter matrix by sampling from the anatomically-defined gray matter ribbon.</p><p>Following these minimal HCP preprocessing steps, a high-pass filter (&gt;0.008 Hz) was applied to the BOLD time series in order to remove low frequencies and scanner drift. In-house MATLAB (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>) tools were used to compute the average variation in BOLD signal in the ventricles and deep white matter. This signal was regressed out of the gray matter time series as a nuisance variable because any BOLD signal change in those structures was likely due to pervasive rather than cortical activity. Finally, mean gray matter time series (i.e. the global signal) was also regressed to address spatially pervasive artefacts, such as respiration. There still remains considerable controversy regarding the utility of mean signal de-noising strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Power et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2016b</xref>), with clear pros/cons. While there are several emerging approaches in the literature that attenuate and/or remove sources of global artefacts in BOLD data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Glasser et al., 2018</xref>), the field-wide gold-standard approach still uses a univariate framework for removing variance from each grayordinate’s time series by computing the mean across grayordinates and regressing it from each grayordinate’s time course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Power et al., 2018</xref>). GSR was performed using these standard procedures, explicitly excluding ventricles and white matter (which are defined as separate nuisance regressors). The GS and its first derivative (with respect to time) were used as nuisance predictor terms within a multiple linear regression model along with other nuisance predictor terms (ventricular signal, white matter signal, movement parameters, and the first derivatives of each of these, as noted above). Finally, all data were motion-scrubbed as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Power et al. (2013)</xref>. As accomplished previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anticevic et al., 2012</xref>), all image frames with possible movement-induced artual fluctuations in intensity were identified via two criteria: first, frames in which the sum of the displacement across all six rigid body movement correction parameters exceeded 0.5 mm (assuming 50 mm cortical sphere radius) were identified. Second, root mean square (RMS) of differences in intensity between the current and preceding frame was computed across all voxels and divided by mean intensity. Frames in which normalized RMS exceeded 1.6 times the median across scans were identified. The frames flagged by either criterion, as well as the one frame preceding and two frames following each flagged frame, were marked for exclusion (logical or). Subjects with more than 50% frames flagged were completely excluded from all analyses. All the included subjects in the final samples passed these criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Global brain connectivity calculation</title><p>Most connectivity studies focus on pre-defined areas (i.e. seed-based approaches). Such approaches assume ‘dysconnectivity’ across similar regions or networks. However, functional dysconnectivity induced by LSD, especially across heterogeneous associative cortical circuits, may exhibit variability across people. To address this, here we applied recently optimized neuroimaging analytic techniques to identify dysconnectivity in a data-driven fashion, termed global brain connectivity (GBC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anticevic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Anticevic et al., 2014c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cole et al., 2011</xref>). GBC is a measure that examines connectivity from a given grayordinate(or area) to all other voxelgrayordinates (or areas) simultaneously by computing average connectivity strength – thereby producing an unbiased approach as to the location of dysconnectivity. Also, unlike typical seed approaches, GBC involves one statistical test per grayordinates (or area) rather than one test per grayordinate-to-grayordinate pairing, substantially reducing multiple comparisons. These improvements dramatically increase the chances of identifying pharmacologically-induced dysconnectivity, or individual differences correlated with symptoms, as we demonstrated by our prior studies conducted in clinical populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cole et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anticevic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cole et al., 2011</xref>). By extension, this approach can be readily applied to pharmacological neuroimaging studies. Specifically, the GBC approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cole et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cole et al., 2011</xref>) was applied using in-house Matlab tools studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anticevic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Anticevic et al., 2014c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cole et al., 2011</xref>), extended across all grayordinates in the brain, as defined via the CIFTI image space, which was obtained via an adapted version of FreeSurfer software fine-tuned by the HCP pipelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fischl et al., 2002</xref>). Finally, for each grayordinate in the CIFTI image space, we computed a correlation with every other whole-brain grayordinate, transformed the correlations to Fisher z-values, and finally computed their mean. This calculation yielded a GBC map for each subject where each grayordinates value represents the mean connectivity of that grayordinate with all other grayordinates in the brain. We also verified that differences in variance of BOLD signals did not drive our GBC results, as predicted by our prior computational modeling work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2014c</xref>). To this end, we computed GBC using a non-normalized covariance measure, which did not alter effects. Appropriate whole-brain type I error correction was computed via FSL’s PALM tool (see second - Level Group Comparisons below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Thalamic seed functional connectivity</title><p>To examine the thalamus coupling with all grayordinates in the brain in session one we computed a seed-based thalamus correlation and covariation map by extracting average time-series across all grayordinates in each subject's bilateral thalamus and then correlating/covarying these with each grayordinate.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Changes in global brain connectivity in LSD-induced altered states are attributable to the 5-HT2A receptor&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laurence Hunt as the Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study examines the effect of 100 micrograms oral LSD administration on resting-state functional MRI data. This has significant effects on Global Brain Connectivity, a measure used to index changes in functional connectivity between regions. The study's key contribution is to pinpoint the pharmacological mechanism of this effect, by showing that it is largely removed by co-administration of 40mg oral administration of the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin. Results show that both the subjective and the connectivity changes associated with LSD were blocked fully by ketanserin. Global brain connectivity patterns associated with LSD were also closely linked to gene expression maps of 5-HT2A receptors.</p><p>All reviewers were in agreement that this is an unusual and interesting dataset, in terms of the sophisticated 5-HT pharmacology and comparison with gene expression profiles. The reviewers applaud the authors for their use of advanced HCP pipelines. By investigating the 5-HT2A receptor contributions of LSD-induced rsfMRI signal changes, the authors address a relevant topic in psychiatric diseases such as psychosis.</p><p>However, all reviewers raised questions about some of the results and interpretations, particularly with respect to the effects of global signal regression on their conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show that LSD effects on GBC differ considerably depending on whether global signal regression (GSR) is used during preprocessing. This finding is interpreted to suggest that the results after global signal regression are &quot;correct&quot;. The reviewers had concerns about this interpretation. The argument about GSR is not settled, and therefore statements to the effect that GSR &quot;is key for separating signal and noise&quot; are incorrect.</p><p>If LSD increases the BOLD signal amplitude in large regions of the brain, this interacts with global signal regression and can drive changes in connectivity. For example, the simulation below shows that whole brain positive-negative effects in GBC that appear very similar to the results presented in Figure 1A can be introduced by the interaction between amplitude changes and global signal regression (note that results without GSR are identical because correlation is scale invariant). It is known that large amplitude changes are found in altered states of consciousness (e.g. during sleep, see Horovitz et al., 2008). It is also likely that the subjects' level of arousal is something that would be expected to change in this LSD study.</p><p>% Matlab code for simulation:</p><p>T1 = rand(1000,100);</p><p>T1 = T1 – repmat(mean(T1),1000,1);% demean</p><p>T1_GSR = T1-mean(T1,2)*(pinv(mean(T1,2))*T1);</p><p>T2 = [T1(:,1:50).*repmat(2,1000,50) T1(:,51:end)];</p><p>T2 = T2 – repmat(mean(T2),1000,1);% demean</p><p>T2_GSR = T2-mean(T2,2)*(pinv(mean(T2,2))*T2);</p><p>GBC = [mean(corr(T1)); mean(corr(T1_GSR)); mean(corr(T2)); mean(corr(T2_GSR))];figure; set(gcf,'Position',[0 0 1000 400])plot(GBC'); xlabel('voxel'); ylabel('GBC'); title('Simulations to test interaction between amplitude changes and GSR');legend({'Original','Original after GSR','increased amp','increased amp after GSR'})set(gca,'fontsize',16)</p><p>A key motivation given for using GSR is that it removes potential respiration artefacts. However, the authors have already removed such artefacts using WM and CSF regression. This lends further evidence to the idea that the global signal in this context may actual represent important global neural activity. All results presented in the manuscript must be interpreted in this context; the effects of any large scale changes in neural activity are not visible with GSR and only focal changes above and beyond these main effects remain.</p><p>Given this, and the strong effect of global signal regression on the findings, the reviewers suspect that the results are strongly influenced by underlying changes in amplitude. It is very important to disambiguate these effects, as they would fundamentally change both the interpretation of the LSD effect and the interpretation regarding global signal regression. Therefore, the reviewers argue that a detailed investigation of amplitude changes is absolutely critical for this work.</p><p>Lastly, the reviewers find the emphasis on GSR in the manuscript misplaced, and detracting from the core study presented in this work. While they applaud the authors for including results with and without GSR, this work is not well placed to draw generalizable conclusions regarding this preprocessing procedure (particularly given the potential confounds of amplitude changes and hemodynamic coupling changes).</p><p>The reviewers' concrete recommendations would therefore be as follows:a) Test directly for amplitude effects (i.e. voxel-wise test for temporal standard deviation, or related measure such as fALFF, between conditions).</p><p>b) Continue to present pre and post GSR results, but give them equal weight.</p><p>c) Remove <italic>all</italic> interpretations of GSR-related differences, and instead clarify that this dataset is not well-suited for the purpose of drawing conclusions regarding GSR.</p><p>2) One further issue is that without GSR, changes in connectivity are left lateralised whereas with GSR they are not. If the global signal only represents artefacts which are by definition global, then why when leaving it in the data are the connectivity changes confined to one hemisphere? Similarly, it is unclear how the data in Figure 5 can be used to support the idea that GSR is desirable. Indeed, it appears that when comparing session 1 vs. session 2 values that the connectivity values are more repeatable without GSR. In the DMN and the limbic network when using GSR, connectivity values are of opposite sign in the Pla and Ket+LSD conditions when comparing across sessions suggesting the GSR is detrimental to the repeatability of the measure in this data.</p><p>3) Are there any known effects of LSD on hemodynamic coupling? While it is challenging to control for such effects in this study, this topic warrants further discussion.</p><p>4) The comparison against gene expression maps is a strong element of this paper, however it is presented almost as an afterthought in much of the manuscript. One reviewer felt that the authors could emphasize this aspect more strongly in the paper (although another reviewer cautioned that the correlations are fairly low). The authors may wish to emphasise this part of their manuscript more strongly.</p><p>5) The effects of the 5-HT2A receptor are investigated (both pharmacologically and in terms of gene expression). However, the authors list a number of other receptors that LSD binds to. Therefore, a more critical discussion (in a limitations section) of the scope of this paper and the potential role of other receptors is warranted.</p><p>6) Changes in subjective drug effects over time are presented (Figure 3). Can the authors comment on test-retest reliability of these questionnaire measures please. For example, what was the change over time in the placebo group for subjects that took part in the placebo session as the first study session?</p><p>7) The first derivative of the global signal is also included as a regressor, which is quite uncommon. Please include a (mathematical or empirical) justification for this.</p><p>8) One reviewer commented that the barplots and distributions in Figure 1B, Figure 4B and others like them should be removed and not relied upon for interpretation, as they present circular reasoning (Kriegeskorte et al., Nat Neuro 2009). Plotting the average connectivity in areas that are defined by looking for differences in connectivity will always lead to significantly different barplots.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35082.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show that LSD effects on GBC differ considerably depending on whether global signal regression (GSR) is used during preprocessing.

There has been a great deal of recent work on this precise topic. For instance, Power et al., 2017, explicitly investigated the effects of common de-noising strategies on artefact removal and show that WM and CSF regression alone do not remove respiration artefacts. In fact, their work explicitly demonstrates that the respiratory artefact is a phenomenon that has ‘global-like’ properties.</p><p>Furthermore, Power et al., 2018, build on this finding and report “…we isolate a second kind of motion-associated signal, a respiratory signal, that occurs across the entire brain”(see Abstract). They go on to report two methods that they state are capable of quantitatively removing global artefact:</p><p>“Go Decomposition (GODEC) is a recently developed multivariate technique that can separate spatially widespread (low-rank) signals from spatially focal (sparse) signals in an fMRI dataset (29).” (p.4)</p><p>“A univariate approach to removing global fluctuations in fMRI data is to regress the global signal from all time series (here, we use the mean cortical signal as the global signal, which, as mentioned above, is essentially identical to the whole-brain signal that is often used for such regression purposes).” (p. 5).</p><p>We used the later in this paper as the basis for our global artefact removal. We appreciate the reviewers’ point however that this may not have been clear. We now clarify this point in the revised version of the paper:</p><p>“While there are several emerging approaches in the literature that attenuate and/or remove sources of global artefact in BOLD data (Glasser et al., 2018), the field-wide gold-standard approach still uses a univariate framework for removing variance from each voxel’s time series by computing the mean across grey matter voxels and regressing it from each voxel’s time course (Power et al., 2018).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given this, and the strong effect of global signal regression on the findings, the reviewers suspect that the results are strongly influenced by underlying changes in amplitude. It is very important to disambiguate these effects, as they would fundamentally change both the interpretation of the LSD effect and the interpretation regarding global signal regression. Therefore, the reviewers argue that a detailed investigation of amplitude changes is absolutely critical for this work.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewers that disambiguating the effects of global artefact versus global neural signal, especially in the context of pharmacological neuroimaging, is vital. Given this, we chose to present results both with GSR and without. Furthermore, we agree that the additional suggested analyses may shed father information on how global signal BOLD properties change following LSD administration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, the reviewers find the emphasis on GSR in the manuscript misplaced, and detracting from the core study presented in this work. While they applaud the authors for including results with and without GSR, this work is not well placed to draw generalizable conclusions regarding this preprocessing procedure (particularly given the potential confounds of amplitude changes and hemodynamic coupling changes).</p><p>The reviewers' concrete recommendations would therefore be as follows:a) Test directly for amplitude effects (i.e. voxel-wise test for temporal standard deviation, or related measure such as fALFF, between conditions).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point which we weighed upon initial submission. We agree with the reviewers that this study is not the ideal forum to put forth conclusions about the optimal choices for processing/de-noising methods in pharmacological neuroimaging in general and LSD-induced changes in particular. Nevertheless, we value that the reviewers found merit in presenting this important processing nuance because the results vary dramatically as a function of mean global signal removal (GSR). To help interpret these discrepancies, we have implemented the proposed analysis and expanded the analytic treatment of the GSR steps considerably based on this feedback. Importantly, throughout the revised paper, we present the two methods on equal footing on the same scale and in matched figure format, as requested below. Please note that we updated the color scale to a continuous format to present the effects more intuitively.</p><p>Specifically, we conducted three analyses that collectively incorporate the reviewers’ feedback and provide further treatment of this issue:</p><p>i) We investigated if the amplitude of the BOLD signal is influenced by GSR across different experimental conditions (i.e. LSD vs. Placebo). Specifically, we quantified ‘amplitudes’ using a measure of local voxel-wise variance – an approach validated in our prior work in the context of clinical neuroimaging and effects of GSR in such datasets (Yang et al., 2014).</p><p>ii) We calculated the mean variance of the global signal across all grey matter voxels (as opposed to local voxel-wise variance). We achieved this by defining the mean of all gray matter signal for a given subject based on their FreeSurfer segmentation and then computing the variance of the BOLD signal time course, averaged over all voxels in this global greymatter mask.</p><p>iii) To investigate the possibility that the GS itself may exhibit a shifted topography on LSD, as shown in prior work (Yang et al., 2016), we also computed the beta map of the global signal for each subject. In turn, this map allowed us compare the spatial topography of GS under LSD versus placebo conditions and allowed us to test the hypothesis that the GS itself is shifted spatially by LSD. Put differently, it could be possible that on LSD different regions are contributing to the GS map, which may explain the effect of this processing step on the GBC analyses.</p><p>Collectively, these three approaches examine the possibility of local versus global BOLD variance changes as well as GS spatial topography shifts under LSD. We present the three analyses below for reviewers’ inspection, which we now added to the revised paper.</p><p>i) Testing the hypothesis of voxel-wise variance changes for the LSD &gt; Pla contrast (presented un-thresholded for full inspection).</p><p>The Z map presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows the change in local voxel-wise variance under LSD vs. placebo. The effect illustrates a very weak alteration in local variance (min/max Z = -1.54/+2.28). No effects survived whole-brain correction and no peaks were evident. This result in not consistent with the possibility that LSD markedly alters voxel-wise amplitudes/variance relative to placebo.</p><p>ii) Mean grey matter variance across all voxels for the LSD &gt; Pla contrast.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35082.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35082-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows the mean variance across all grey matter voxels under various conditions. Results indicate that variance of the GS does not differ significantly between conditions on average when computing the mean across all grey matter voxels [F(2,46)=0.71, p&gt;0.49)].</p><p>iii) Beta map of the GS for the LSD &gt; Pla contrast (presented un-thresholded for full inspection).</p><p>Above we show that voxel-wise and average GS variance does not differ markedly for LSD vs. placebo. However, the mean GS analysis above cannot address the possibility that the GS signal itself has a distinct spatial configuration following LSD administration. In other words, which areas are maximally contributing to the mean GS may not be the same after LSD administration. Critically, as noted by the reviewers, these types of analyses are not designed to arbitrate if such a shift is artefactual or neural, but it would provide a key insight regarding the origin of the GBC maps shifts before and after GSR on LSD.</p><p>Global Gray Matter Signal Beta Map Calculation.The Z map presented in Figure 3 illustrates a contrast between LSD vs. placebo for the GS beta map that was computed for each subject. Specifically, we calculated the GS (computed as mean grey matter signal) for each frame in the BOLD time course. This mean GS was then used as a regressor in a subject-specific GLM. The resulting beta map indicates which areas are maximally co-varying with the mean GS for each subject under LSD or placebo.</p><p>As described in the text, to obtain global signal (GS) beta values, we first performed GS regression (GSR) using standard widely adopted procedures (Cole MWet al. 2011; Anticevic A, MS Brumbaugh, et al. 2012). The GS time series for each subject was obtained by calculating mean raw BOLD signal averaged over all gray matter voxels for each time point, explicitly excluding ventricles and white matter signal. This GS time series was used as nuisance predictor term within a multiple linear regression model. More formally, we used the following multiple regression analysis:<disp-formula id="equ7"><mml:math id="m7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> represents the raw BOLD signal in voxel <italic>k</italic> as a function of time, <italic>t. b<sub>0</sub></italic> is the intercept, <italic>X<sub>i</sub></italic> represents the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> nuisance (e.g. GS at that time point), <italic>b<sub>i</sub></italic> is the corresponding beta weight computed for regressor <italic>X<sub>i</sub></italic>.

In that sense, the voxel-wise whole-brain map of GS beta weights is more interpretable as a task-evoked GLM analysis than to a functional connectivity measure. In other words, GS beta weights are <italic>not</italic> functional connectivity values and should not be interpreted as such – instead they represent the amount of GS variance accounted for by that voxel for a given subject.</p><p>This ‘GS beta map’ was then entered into a 2<sup>nd</sup> level analysis as done for the functional connectivity dependent measures. This comparison tests the hypnosis that the spatial contribution to the GS is altered under LSD vs. placebo, as done in our prior work (Yang et al., 2016). The result shows LSD&gt;placebo in warm colors and LSD&lt;placebo in cool colors. As evident from Figure 3, the GS beta contrast was quite robust, especially when compared to the local voxel-wise variance results (min/max Z = -5.73/+7.74). Critically, the map revealed a bi-direction spatial shift of the GS under LSD where associative cortices and large areas of sub-cortex showed an elevated GS contribution. In contrast, the blue areas showed a reduced GS contribution under LSD. This map correlated highly with the spatial organization of the LSD-induced changes on GBC. This is unsurprising as GBC is highly sensitive to mean shared signal shifts. Put differently, a GBC matrix will be sensitive to the change in the mean shared signal across the brain. If LSD is altering this mean shared signal topography, then the GBC effect should be similarly affected. To quantify this we calculated the relationship between the LSD-placebo contrast GBC map before and after GSR and the LSD-placebo contrast GS beta map.</p><p>This result provides evidence consistent with the hypothesis that LSD induces a transformation in the GS beta map itself, which is contributing the GBC effect pre/post GSR. That said, this analysis still does not resolve or help inform the ‘ground truth’ effect of LSD on baseline functional connectivity.</p><p>There is a core limitation to the GBC effect in relation to the GS topography inherent to the way it is computed: Specifically, GBC yields the mean shared statistical dependence from a given voxel to all other voxels. This calculation is therefore affected by the shared variance structure across all voxels (i.e. the map of the GS). If this shared GS variance structure is shifted in one condition versus the next, then the GBC calculation will shift accordingly in a spatially ordered way corresponding to the GS spatial shift. This is precisely what the Figure 3 illustrates. We are very thankful that the reviewers’ comments pushed us down this analytic path, which now fundamentally enriches the way one interprets the GBC results in our and prior LSD work.</p><p>To frame this problem more precisely, it cannot be determined definitively from the GBC effect if LSD indeed elevates or reduces mean connectivity in associative vs. somato-sensory cortices. This interpretational challenge, which is present in this and prior work, is highlighted by the presented GS beta map analyses because it is not clear if GS beta map transformations on the GBC effect under LSD are primarily neural or artefactual. In other words, the presented results do not provide a ‘ground truth’ of directional manipulations under LSD irrespective of GS-related shifts.</p><p>To inform this problem, a complementary analysis is needed, which yields a map that is interpretationally consistent irrespective of GS-related shifts. To construct such a map, here we focused on thalamocortical circuits to provide a well-established and replicated effect in the clinical literature that is not strongly affected by GSR transformations (Anticevic et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2014, Woodward et al., 2012).</p><p>To examine thalamic coupling with all voxels in the brain in session 1 we computed a seed-based thalamus map by extracting average time-series across all voxels in each subject's anatomically defined bilateral thalamus (via FreeSurfer segmentations) and then quantifying its relationship with each gray matter voxel. Critically, we used both the correlation and covariance as methods of statistical dependence, which we conjuncted (Cole et al., 2016). We did this because covariance reflects a non-normalized measure of shared signal co-variation (which is scale free and unaffected by variance structure) whereas correlation is inherently normalized by pooled variance. This yielded a more robust map of thalamic covariation. Furthermore, given that GS induces mean signal shifts (i.e. it may induce anti-correlation), here we also obtained the top and bottom 10% of all thalamic connections from the mean connectivity (correlation and covariance) maps before and after GSR. This final 4-way conjunction map ensured that the resulting regions in the top range exhibit thalamic FC irrespective of processing (i.e. GSR/noGSR) or statistical method (i.e. r or cov). This map was then used to calculate LSD induced effects on top 10% and bottom 10% of the connections. The prediction was that LSD would decrease connections that were in the top 10% (i.e. highly positive thalamic connections at baseline, which represent thalamo-associative FC). In turn, we predicted that LSD would elevate connections that were in the bottom 10% (i.e. highly weak thalamic connections at baseline, which represent thalamo-sensory FC).</p><p>Figure 4 illustrates the result of these analyses. Panel A shows the baseline thalamic FC computed after GSR for the correlation method, illustrating the expected patterns (i.e. weak thalamo-sensory FC and strong thalamo-associative FC). Panels B and C show the difference in the average signal between drug conditions for the correlation method after GSR. Here, LSD consistently decreases FC in associative areas and increases FC in somato-sensory regions (panel A) and this effect was preserved for the LSD-(Ket+LSD) analysis (panel B). Without GSR however, inconsistent results are revealed (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Therefore, to reconcile the interpretation of the LSD effect directionality we performed a conjunction approach that was robust to processing method and statistical approach. As noted, the top and bottom 10% of all connections were extracted from the mean connectivity (correlation and covariance) maps in the Pla condition (before and after GSR) were used to compute a conjunction map providing the strongest and weakest thalamic connections irrespective of analysis method (panels D and E). This conjunction map was then used as a mask to extract the average signal across these regions in the LSD-Pla and LSD-(Ket+LSD) contrast before and after GSR in the seed-based correlation/covariace analyses as well as GBC correlation/covariance analyses. Panel F shows the difference in the average signal between these drug conditions for the different analyses methods (seed FC/GBC, correlation/covariance) after GSR. Here, LSD consistently decreases FC in associative areas and increases FC in somato-sensory regions irrespective of analysis method. Importantly, the thalamic seed analyses reveals a matched GBC effects. Without GSR however (Panel G), seed FC and GBC results are inconsistent. Furthermore, in contrast to results after GSR, LSD did not consistently decrease connections that were in the top 10% or elevate connections that were in the bottom 10% without GSR. To investigate individual differences, we computed the correlation between the top and bottom connections before and after GSR across participants (Panel H, full connectivity matrix is presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 1). The prediction was that individuals with biggest elevation for bottom 10% would should the biggest drop in the top 10% under LSD. Predicted negative individual differences emerged after GSR but without GSR results were not compatible with individual difference predictions based either for thalamic seed analysis or GBC. Collectively, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that, following GS cleanup, LSD reduces shared signals for association cortices but elevates shared signals for sensory and somatomotor areas across both seed-based thalamic and GBC analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Continue to present pre and post GSR results, but give them equal weight.</p></disp-quote><p>Weagree fully. As noted, we are now giving both analyses equal weight and have introduced additional expansion of the result, as articulated above. In particular, we have now added Figure S5 (displaying the results without GSR) to the main manuscript as Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Remove all interpretations of GSR-related differences, and instead clarify that this dataset is not well-suited for the purpose of drawing conclusions regarding GSR.</p></disp-quote><p>We also agree with this suggestion and have edited the manuscript accordingly. Detailed changes are outlined in response 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One further issue is that without GSR, changes in connectivity are left lateralised whereas with GSR they are not. If the global signal only represents artefacts which are by definition global, then why when leaving it in the data are the connectivity changes confined to one hemisphere? Similarly, it is unclear how the data in Figure 5 can be used to support the idea that GSR is desirable. Indeed, it appears that when comparing session 1 vs. session 2 values that the connectivity values are more repeatable without GSR. In the DMN and the limbic network when using GSR, connectivity values are of opposite sign in the placebo and ket+LSD conditions when comparing across sessions suggesting the GSR is detrimental to the repeatability of the measure in this data.</p></disp-quote><p>These are all thoughtful and relevant points, many of which are now addressed by the added analyses articulated above. That said, we respectfully disagree with the conclusion that changes in connectivity without GSR are exclusively lateralized. The key intuition here emerges when inspecting the un-thresholded maps in Figure S5 (lower panels of Figures S5C-E, now Figure 2). These maps are highly consistent with the hypothesis of a symmetrical drug-induced effect on GBC with and without GSR. However, we agree that the TFCE Type I error protected maps do give the impression that effects are stronger in one hemisphere than the other. This is occurring due to peaks of the effect being marginally higher in one hemisphere relative to the other. To quantify this point, we correlated the L vs. R CIFTI map elements (i.e. L vs. R surfaces) prior to thresholding. This indicates that the effect is indeed highly symmetric (r=0.59 – 0.80).</p><p>The second component of the reviewers’ feedback concerns the ability to arbitrate GSR/noGSR effects as more valid. We agree with this feedback. In fact, Figure 5 (now Figure 7) has not been included to support one analysis method over the other. We apologize if this was the impression in the original version of the paper. Actually, Figure 5 is presenting all data while giving equal weight to both methods, as advised by the reviewers.</p><p>In addition, considered carefully examined T1 vs. T2 effects, which we agree differ across conditions. We also see how the reviewers might arrive at the conclusion that some results might seem more ‘replicable’ without GSR. We apologize for the lack of clarity in our original version, which perhaps did not fully unpack this intuition. We appreciate the chance to more carefully discuss this effect. This statistical phenomenon of ‘artefactual’ replication is not surprising, when one considers GSR is intended to remove sources of spatially pervasive structured artefact that also likely persists across sessions (e.g. elevated respiratory artefacts). Here there is an important nuance between ‘noise’ and ‘artefact’. Pure ‘white’ noise can be signal-averaged out and would not yield a consistent effect. In contrast, structured artefact represents a signal that can induce the same spurious effect multiple times (Power et al., 2018, Glasser et al., 2018). Put differently, if a structured artefact is large in both measurements (T1 and T2), then this artefact will spuriously drive the effect and therefore will be replicable. We are not claiming that the current data are able to fully disambiguate between these scenarios (i.e. true replication vs. spurious replication). For this reason, we have not expanded our detailed description of this effect, which was presented originally in Figure 4. In turn, we provide a more detailed discussion of the potential underlying pharmacological mechanisms which may relate to this phenomenon, building on the original section “Time-dependent effects of LSD” in the Discussion section. Collectively, we are thankful for this careful feedback which we feel improved arguments surrounding T1/T2 effects, which we now include in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Are there any known effects of LSD on hemodynamic coupling? While it is challenging to control for such effects in this study, this topic warrants further discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers raising this excellent point. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study investigating the effects of LSD on hemodynamic coupling specifically. However, we agree with the reviewers that this point needs further discussion. Therefore, we added the following paragraph to the Discussion section:</p><p>“Furthermore, so far, it has not been investigated whether LSD modulates neurovascular coupling and the hemodynamic response function. […] Furthermore, animal studies which offer the possibility to combine neuronal recordings with simultaneous measurement of hemodynamics are desirable to support the interpretation of functional imaging studies of LSD effects in the human brain.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The comparison against gene expression maps is a strong element of this paper, however it is presented almost as an afterthought in much of the manuscript. One reviewer felt that the authors could emphasize this aspect more strongly in the paper (although another reviewer cautioned that the correlations are fairly low). The authors may wish to emphasise this part of their manuscript more strongly.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate the reviewers’ positive feedback and the recognition of the added value that this analysis brings to the study. We appreciate the comment to perhaps prioritize this effect. The comparison against gene expression maps is presented as the last figure because this is a highly novel analysis that we felt needs further replication before it is featured centrally. Nevertheless, we have now emphasized this effect further, as recommended by the reviewers:</p><p>- We highlighted this effect more prominently in the Abstract.- We further emphasized the rationale and the effect in the Introduction section.</p><p>- We expanded the Discussion section on gene expression, integrating the caution proposed by the reviewers concerning magnitude of correlations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The effects of the 5-HT2A receptor are investigated (both pharmacologically and in terms of gene expression). However, the authors list a number of other receptors that LSD binds to. Therefore, a more critical discussion (in a limitations section) of the scope of this paper and the potential role of other receptors is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that from the current study no conclusions can be drawn about the functional contribution of other receptors to the effects of LSD beyond the 5-HT2A receptor, which is afforded by the ketanserin manipulation. We discuss this limitation in the subsection “Session Impacts Global Brain Connectivity in Ketanserin+LSD Condition” and have now added the following paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“While the current results strongly implicate the involvement of the 5-HT2A receptor in LSD-induced effects, it must be noted that no further conclusions can be drawn regarding the functional contribution of other receptors agonized or antagonized by LSD. This limitation needs further investigation in future studies by blocking serotonin and dopamine receptors involved in the pharmacology of LSD beyond the 5-HT2A receptor. Furthermore, the contribution of these receptors to the effects of different doses of LSD still need to be studied.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Changes in subjective drug effects over time are presented (Figure 3). Can the authors comment on test-retest reliability of these questionnaire measures please. For example, what was the change over time in the placebo group for subjects that took part in the placebo session as the first study session?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a thoughtful point and we appreciate the opportunity to add this information. There are two parts to this comment:</p><p>i) Test-retest reliability of the subject drug-induced effects over time.</p><p>ii) Test-rests reliability of the scale itself in the placebo condition over time.</p><p>Regarding the first point, test-retest reliability of these measures is high. Within each drug condition, mean scores over time correlated highly and significantly (all Pearson’s r &gt; 0.40, max r = 0.99). We now quantified this in the LSD condition across the 5 subjective subscales, which we present in the supplement of the revised paper (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Regarding the second point, 8 (out of 24) participants received placebo in the first study session. Within this group the subjective effects were modest at best. For instance, the largest mean change score was observed for the scale “disembodiment” between T1 and T2 and this was a mean=3.5 (SD=9.37) on scale ranging from 0-100. Put simply, the range of observed values in the placebo condition makes is statistically challenging (if not invalid) to compute a test-rests. We are certain the reviewers appreciate the intuition that the scale in question is designed to assay the subjective effects <italic>after</italic> drug administration. Thus, while we see the logic of the placebo group analysis suggestion, the practicality is that this analysis yields little useful variance. Therefore, we now added the test-retest effects for the LSD drug-induced subjective change. We are thankful for the reviewers engaging this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The first derivative of the global signal is also included as a regressor, which is quite uncommon.

Therefore we removed the indication of significance from the barplots (asterisk symbol and legend) in Figure 1, 4 (now Figure 5), and S5 (now Figure 2). However, we respectfully disagree with the request to remove the plot itself, since we argue for presenting the data as transparently and comprehensively as possible. The distribution – and barplots enable the reader to gain additional insight in the nature of alterations in connectivity induced by drugs and/or session beyond brain maps. Furthermore, since Figure 1 and S5 (now Figure 2) represent the main effect of three conditions, these barplots allow the reader to directly compare these three conditions, which is not possible from the main effect brain map.</p></body></sub-article></article>
