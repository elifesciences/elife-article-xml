of cardiac aging in both mice and humans. We show here that 8-week treatment of old mice with the mitochondrial targeted peptide SS-31 (elamipretide) can substantially reverse this deficit. SS-31 normalized the increase in proton leak and reduced mitochondrial ROS in cardiomyocytes from old mice, accompanied by reduced protein oxidation and a shift towards a more reduced protein thiol redox state in old hearts. Improved diastolic function was concordant with increased phosphorylation of cMyBP-C Ser282 but was independent of titin isoform shift. Late-life viral expression of mitochondrial-targeted catalase (mCAT) produced similar functional benefits in old mice and SS-31 did not improve cardiac function of old mCAT mice, implicating normalizing mitochondrial oxidative stress as an overlapping mechanism. These results demonstrate that pre-existing cardiac aging phenotypes can be reversed by targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and implicate mitochondrial energetics and redox signaling as therapeutic targets for cardiac aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>cardiac function</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>diastolic dysfunction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Glenn/AFAR Postdoctoral Fellowship Program for Translational Research on Aging</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chiao</surname><given-names>Ying Ann</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Huiliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32AG000057 Training Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chiao</surname><given-names>Ying Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99/R00 AG051735</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chiao</surname><given-names>Ying Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 AG001751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rabinovitch</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 AG013280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rabinovitch</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDA 19CDA34660311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Huiliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35HL144998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Granzier</surname><given-names>Henk L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondrial-targeted SS-31 peptide ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction and rescues pre-existing cardiac dysfunction in old mice, supporting the translational potential of mitochondrial protective interventions to treat age-related diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the hallmarks of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). While mitochondria generate the bulk of cellular ATP, they are also the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in most cells. The mitochondrial free radical theory of aging proposes that excessive mitochondrial ROS damages mitochondrial DNA and proteins, and this leads to further mitochondrial dysfunction, with subsequent cellular and organ functional declines and limits on lifespan and healthspan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harman, 1972</xref>).</p><p>Aging is the strongest risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Niccoli and Partridge, 2012</xref>). It is also accompanied by a decline in cardiac function, especially diastolic dysfunction and hypertrophy of the left ventricle and left atrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lakatta and Levy, 2003</xref>). The heart is rich in mitochondria and has a high metabolic demand; therefore, it is highly susceptible to oxidative damage and the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction play critical roles in cardiovascular diseases and cardiac aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tocchi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The therapeutic potential of reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress is supported by mice expressing mitochondrial-targeted catalase (mCAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schriner et al., 2005</xref>). In these mice, catalase removes hydrogen peroxide in mitochondria and significantly reduces mitochondrial protein oxidative damage and mitochondrial DNA mutation and deletion frequencies in mCAT mice. In addition to an extension of median and maximum lifespan, mCAT mice displayed greatly attenuated cardiac aging phenotypes, including reduced cardiac hypertrophy and improved diastolic function and myocardial performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dai et al., 2009</xref>). Expression of mCAT is also protective in models of cardiac hypertrophy and failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dai et al., 2011a</xref>). These cardiac benefits suggest that pharmacologic interventions combating mitochondrial ROS and improving mitochondrial function are attractive targets for treatment of cardiovascular disease and cardiac aging. Despite the positive effects of targeting mitochondrial ROS by mCAT on lifespan and in multiple disease models, studies have also reported negative effects of targeting mitochondrial ROS. While normalizing mitochondrial ROS by modest level of mCAT expression attenuates cardiac defects in a model of mitofusin-deficient cardiomyopathy, super-suppression of mitochondrial ROS by high level of mCAT expression exacerbates the defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2014</xref>). In another study, suppression of mitochondrial ROS in mice resulted in impaired macrophage bactericidal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">West et al., 2011</xref>). A recent proteomic study demonstrated that while old mCAT mice displayed a more youthful proteome composition and turnover compared to old wild-type mice, the proteome of young mCAT mice recapitulates that of old wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basisty et al., 2016</xref>). These studies support the physiological roles and an age-dependent pleiotropy of mitochondrial ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basisty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sena and Chandel, 2012</xref>). Therefore, later-life interventions that target pathological levels of mitochondrial ROS in old age may offer better translational potentials than life-long or long-term interventions.</p><p>We focused on the mitochondrial-targeted tetrapeptide SS-31 (elamipretide), a pharmacologic intervention that selectively concentrates in mitochondria, suppressing mitochondrial ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Szeto, 2006</xref>) and increasing skeletal muscle ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siegel et al., 2013</xref>). SS-31 treatment was previously shown to reduce mitochondrial oxidative damage and prevent pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and failure in a manner that was highly similar to mCAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dai et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dai et al., 2012</xref>). While these and other studies have shown that combating mitochondrial ROS during the course of a lifetime or during work and pressure overload stress can prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and attenuate cardiac functional decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dai et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dai et al., 2017</xref>), it has not been established whether delivering such interventions in later life can rescue pre-existing mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction. In this study, we demonstrate that mitochondrial-targeted interventions can improve mitochondrial function and reverse pre-existing cardiac dysfunction in old mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>8-week SS-31 treatment rescues cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy in old mice</title><p>Diastolic function and myocardial performance decline significantly with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dai et al., 2014b</xref>). Compared to young mice, old mice exhibit a reduced ratio of early to late diastolic mitral annulus velocities (Ea/Aa), indicating a decline in diastolic function, and they have an increased (poorer) myocardial performance index (MPI), indicating an increased fraction of the cardiac cycle that is not accompanied by a change in volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dai et al., 2014b</xref>). To determine the effects of SS-31 treatment on cardiac function in old mice, we treated 24-month-old mice with the SS-31 peptide or saline control and examined cardiac function by echocardiography after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. We found that Ea/Aa increased and MPI decreased in old mice treated with SS-31 for 8 weeks, reversing the age-related changes, and both parameters were significantly different compared to saline controls at 8 weeks of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Systolic function, measured as fractional shortening, was not altered by SS-31 treatment and remained similar between old control and old SS-31 treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). At the 8-week necropsy, we observed a higher heart weight normalized to tibia length (HW/TL) in old control mice compared to young control mice, while HW/TL of old SS-31 treated mice was lower than that of old controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), suggesting a regression of age-related cardiac hypertrophy after SS-31 treatment. A decline in diastolic cardiac function in the elderly is associated with exercise intolerance, so we studied whether exercise performance was improved by SS-31 treatment. We observed reduced treadmill running time in old mice compared to young mice, and old mice treated with SS-31 for 8 weeks ran significantly longer than old control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with recent observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2019</xref>). As in male mice, we observed a similar improvement in Ea/Aa in 24 month old female mice treated with SS-31 for 8 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that the treatment is effective in both sexes. To evaluate the persistence of the SS-31-induced cardiac benefit, we continued to monitor cardiac function in these mice after cessation of treatment. We found that the improved Ea/Aa in SS-31 treated mice was maintained at 2 weeks, but dropped by approximately half at 4 weeks after treatment ceased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SS-31 treatment reverses cardiac aging phenotypes and improves exercise performance in old mice.</title><p>Doppler echocardiography showed that 8-week SS-31 treatment (<bold>a</bold>) improved diastolic function (increased Ea/Aa) and (<bold>b</bold>) enhanced myocardial performance (reduced myocardial performance index, MPI) of old male mice.

The main findings of the study are: 1) enhancing mitochondrial function at late-life by administration of mitochondrial-targeted SS-31 peptide or AAV-mediated expression of mitochondrial targeted catalase can reverse pre-existing cardiac dysfunction in old mice; 2) SS-31 treatment normalizes the age-related increase in mitochondrial proton leak, reduces ROS production by old cardiomyocytes, and reduces protein oxidative modifications; 3) the rescue of diastolic function by SS-31 in old mice is due, at least in part, to reversal of hypo-phosphorylation of myofilament protein cMyBP-C; and 4) SS-31 treatment and mCAT expression, while similar in many ways, differentially regulate myofilament protein phosphorylation.

A single injection of SS-31 to old mice has been shown to enhance mitochondrial energetics in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siegel et al., 2013</xref>). Subcutaneous delivery of SS-31 for 8 weeks improves redox homeostasis and mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle and enhances exercise tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2019</xref>), and the same regimen also improves kidney glomerular architecture in old mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sweetwyne et al., 2017</xref>). 2- week daily injection of SS-31 restores neurovascular coupling responses and improves cognition in old mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tarantini et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to these positive effects in normal aging, SS-31 treatment has been shown to protect against cardiovascular diseases. SS-31 treatment offers cardioprotection in models of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion and myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dai et al., 2014c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kloner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szeto, 2008</xref>), it also prevents cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy induced by 4-week Angiotensin II infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dai et al., 2011b</xref>). As with mCAT expression, SS-31 ameliorates cardiac fibrosis and improves cardiac function in pressure overload-induced heart failure, and proteomic analyses revealed that both SS-31 and mCAT expression attenuated changes in proteins related to mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dai et al., 2012</xref>). However, whether SS-31 treatment is protective against cardiac aging had not been previously established.</p><p>In this study we found that the reversal of cardiac aging phenotypes by late-life SS-31 treatment was accompanied by reduced oxidative protein modifications in aged hearts, which can be explained by the reduced mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in SS-31 treated cardiomyocytes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, SS-31 and mCAT both reduce ROS, however, the former is believed to do so by prevention of ROS production by electron transport chain, while the latter directly scavenges hydrogen peroxide. Both, however, will inhibit the vicious cycle of ROS induced damage to mitochondrial DNA and proteins and prevent pathological ROS-Induced-Redox Signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Consistent with this overlap, SS-31 treatment cannot further improve the cardiac function of old mCAT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), supporting the role of reduction of mitochondrial oxidative stress as a key mechanism of SS-31 reversal of cardiac aging. Although 8-week SS-31 treatment did not significantly further improve diastolic function in old mCAT mice, there appeared to be an increasing trend and it is possible that longer duration of treatment might lead to further additive improvement. This could be explained by the involvement of other molecular mechanisms, especially those that may be due to direct augmentation of mitochondrial ATP production by SS-31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the benefits detected in old mice after SS-31 treatment, we did not observe significant differences in the parameters we measured in young mice with SS-31 treatment, including exercise performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and cardiac metabolome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that SS-31 treatment is effective in aged hearts with pre-existing mitochondrial dysfunction but has little effects in young hearts with normal functioning mitochondria. The absence of SS-31 induced improvement in healthy mitochondria has previously been reported by studies of diseases models and aging skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siegel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Szeto, 2013</xref>), potentially due to the inability to further increase ATP production in individuals with optimal mitochondrial function.</p><p>A recent study by Cieslik and colleagues showed that combined treatment with glutathione precursors, N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) and Glycine, but not NAC alone, can reverse age-related diastolic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cieslik et al., 2018</xref>). While the study suggests that aged mice may benefit from increased glutathione content, the effects of the combined treatment on in vivo cardiac glutathione contents and S-glutathionylation remain to be established. Here, we showed that SS-31 can reverse diastolic dysfunction and normalized the age-related increase in protein S-glutathionylation without the necessity to exogenously alter glutathione levels. This supports the primary importance of reducing mitochondrial ROS in redox homeostasis. A follow-up protein-by-protein analysis of SS-31 effects on S-glutathionylation will provide further insights on how SS-31 regulates redox homeostasis in the aging hearts (unpublished). In addition, the fact that SS-31 treatment or late-life mCAT expression can reverse age-related diastolic dysfunction but NAC alone fails to do so supports the importance of mitochondrial localization of the ROS combating action in cardiac aging protection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Normalization of proton leak in aged cardiomyocytes is a protective mechanism of SS-31</title><p>Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is the major source of ATP production in the cell. When electrons from substrate oxidation pass through electron transport chain complexes, the energy generated is used to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space to generate a proton gradient. The resulting protonmotive force drives protons back to mitochondrial matrix through ATP synthase, while converting ADP to ATP. However, this coupling of substrate oxidation and ATP synthesis is incomplete as protons can also re-enter mitochondrial matrix independent of ATP synthesis in a process termed ‘proton leak’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jastroch et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we showed that cardiomyocytes from old mice exhibited increased proton leak when compared to cardiomyocytes from young mice. This age-related increase in proton leak is consistent with previous observations that aging increases proton leak in mouse hepatocytes and in mitochondria from rat heart, kidney and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harper et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Serviddio et al., 2007</xref>). The increased proton leak implicates that aging reduces coupling of substrate oxidation to ATP synthesis, and agrees with the reduced mitochondrial coupling observed in aged skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siegel et al., 2013</xref>). Strikingly, 8-week treatment with SS-31 completely reversed the age-related increase in mitochondrial proton leak in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c, e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>).</p><p>While the molecular mechanisms of proton leak are not fully understood, it has been shown that basal leak through mitochondrial inner membrane or around inner membrane proteins, and inducible leak through adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) or uncoupling proteins (UCPs) contribute to mitochondrial proton leak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jastroch et al., 2010</xref>). Because SS-31 interacts with cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane, it is possible that SS-31 can regulate basal leak by preserving inner membrane integrity and normalizing the function of inner membrane spanning proteins. ROS has been shown to induce mitochondrial uncoupling and increase proton leak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brookes and Mitochondrial, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brookes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Echtay et al., 2002</xref>), and thus, reduced ROS production following SS-31 treatment may also contribute to the lowered proton leak. A protective function of ROS-induced proton leak has been suggested, where increased ROS level promotes proton leak to reduce mitochondrial membrane potential and decrease further ROS production and oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brookes and Mitochondrial, 2005</xref>). However, the reduced RCR and increased oxidative damage seen in the aged heart suggest that this increased proton leak is maladaptive and a result of compromised mitochondria function. In addition to suppressing proton leak, SS-31 partially restores the RCR and increases mitochondrial membrane potential in aged cardiomyocytes, suggesting that SS-31 treatment reverses age-related mitochondrial dysfunction. It has been shown that mitochondrial dysfunction induces cellular senescence, and PolG mutator mice, which have increased mtDNA mutation and mtROS, also have accumulation of senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wiley et al., 2016</xref>). Compared to old controls, SS-31 treated hearts have reduced numbers of p16- or p19-positive senescent cells and this may be a direct result of the restoration of mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wiley et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>SS-31 and mCAT expression differentially regulate phosphorylation of myofilament proteins to improve diastolic function</title><p>SS-31 treatment reduces cardiac dysfunction in models of pressure-overload induced heart failure, and this is accompanied by marked proteomic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dai et al., 2013</xref>). In comparison, however, SS-31 induces more modest changes in protein expression in the aging heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and no changes in expression of OXPHOS subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In this study, we also investigated the effect of SS-31 treatment on the cardiac metabolite profile and detected modest changes in metabolite levels, with SS-31 treatment showing a tendency of attenuation of the age-related metabolic changes.</p><p>On the other hand, post-translational modifications, both oxidative and phosphorylative, may play a more important role in conferring the benefits of SS-31 treatment. In cardiac muscle, the state of post-translational modifications of myofilament proteins are crucial to the regulation of contractile and relaxation behaviors, as shown in the pathophysiology of heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biesiadecki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamdani et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramirez-Correa et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, phosphorylation of myofilament proteins is a key modulator of diastolic function of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamdani et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hamdani et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosas et al., 2015</xref>). cMyBP-C is a sarcomeric protein that modulates actin–myosin interaction and cross-bridge cycling. It is a critical mediator of diastolic function whose activity has been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation of its cardiac specific M-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosas et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies have shown that a high level of phosphorylation is critical to normal cardiac function, and hypo-phosphorylation of the M-domain is associated with heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Copeland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jacques et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kooij et al., 2013</xref>). Ser282 is one of the phosphorylation sites in the M-domain. Sadayappan and colleagues showed that Ser282 phosphorylation is critical for subsequent phosphorylation of Ser302, another phosphorylation site in the M-domain of cMyBP-C, and phospho-ablation at Ser282 impairs baseline diastolic function and response to β-adrenergic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sadayappan et al., 2011</xref>). We detected an age-related decrease in phosphorylation of S282 in the M-domain of cMyBP-C, and SS-31 treatment restores Ser282 phosphorylation in old mice, likely contributing to the restoration of diastolic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>).</p><p>TnI is an inhibitory subunit of troponin, and it binds to actin to inhibit actomyosin interaction in the absence of calcium binding to TnC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomes et al., 2002</xref>). Phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser23/24 by protein kinase A has been shown to reduce myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and increase myofilament relaxation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kentish et al., 2001</xref>). Biesiadecki lab recently showed simultaneous increases in Ser23/24 and Ser150 phosphorylation in ischemic hearts and suggested that this combined phosphorylation plays an adaptive role in ischemia by maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and accelerating Ca<sup>2+</sup> dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nixon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Salhi et al., 2016</xref>). Late-life mCAT expression, but not SS-31, increased phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser23/24 and Ser150 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7d, e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). The effects of these increases in cTnI phosphorylation on Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and myofilament relaxation in aging cardiac muscles remain to be investigated. Unlike SS-31 treatment, late-life mCAT expression fails to increase Ser282 phosphorylation of cMyBP-C. Although reduction of mtROS is a shared protective mechanism between SS-31 and mCAT, it is likely that the two interventions activate different kinases to regulate myofilament protein phosphorylation to mediate improved relaxation in the aging hearts. Future ex vivo biomechanical assays are required to determine how the two interventions differentially regulate cross-bridge kinetics and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity to improve diastolic function.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that due to the limited number of mice in the persistence cohort, we did not follow up on how different molecular changes responded after cessation of SS-31 treatment due to the limited number of mice in the persistence cohort. We note that the persistence of SS-31 induced functional benefit varied between individual mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), and thus, we hypothesize that the persistence of the molecular changes (e.g. oxidative modifications and myofilament protein phosphorylation) also varied between individuals. Future studies will be required to determine on how different molecular changes mediated by SS-31 persist after treatment cessation and identify the molecular mechanisms driving this individual variation and limiting SS-31 persistence.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated that late-life SS-31 treatment can reverse pre-existing cardiac aging phenotypes, including diastolic dysfunction. Besides reducing mitochondrial ROS production and oxidative damage, SS-31 treatment reduces the age-related increase in mitochondrial proton leak in cardiomyocytes. Despite similar cardiac benefits, SS-31 and mCAT expression induced differential changes in myofilament protein phosphorylation, in line with overlapping but not concordant mechanisms of action. These results support the therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial dysfunction to reverse the effects of cardiac aging.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus;

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Pamela Boon Li Pun (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript, the authors present the ability of a mitochondrially targeted peptide SS-31/elamipretide to alleviate age-related mitochondrial dysfunction and thereby restore cardiac function, likely acting through reduction in oxidative damage. Similarities are drawn to benefits seen from over-expression of mCAT in old mice and, taken together, the conclusion is that application of the peptide can improve cardiac function through reduction in mitochondrial ROS and this supports their hypothesis that mitochondrial targeted therapeutics may be beneficial in reversing the effects of cardiac ageing. A significant amount of similar work has previously been published e.g. on the benefits of the peptide to improve mitochondrial dysfunction, protect against hypertensive cardiomyopathy, improve cerebrovascular endothelial function and thereby improve cognition in aged mice. However, there is novelty in the current work both in evaluating the effects on cardiac function in aged mice relative to young mice and in the deeper analysis of mechanism that is provided and in relating effects to those seen in the mCAT mice.</p><p>The work provides some evidence that delivery of interventions in later life can reverse age-induced cardiac dysfunction, although it is not entirely clear if this is purely reversal of age-dependent changes or general improvement (see below). The focus on late-life is valuable, although it would have been interesting to see if these benefits translate into increase lifespan or health span, if continued. The study is quite comprehensive, providing extensive data towards possible underlying mechanisms, related to metabolic and mitochondrial changes, redox signalling ROS and protein modifications.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a fundamental concern in that a similar improvement can be seen with SS-31 in young mice – which the authors show but do not discuss in Figure 1E. The authors do not present any other data on effects of SS-31 in young mice but, given the significant improvements in exercise duration, it is likely that benefits would be seen in other parameters in young mice as well (had these been measured / reported). Hence, benefits may not be seen exclusively in old mice or due to &quot;reversal&quot; of age-related cardiac function. Are these benefits of SS-31 on exercise in young mice from Figure 1E significant? Why are no other details on changes (markers) presented for young mice? The authors should present and carefully analyze any data that they have on this question and discuss its implications fully.</p><p>2) Gender differences in changes in mitochondria function and treatment effects have previously been reported. The Materials and methods section (subsection “Animals”, second paragraph) seem to indicate that the authors have studied both genders. If indeed so, the authors should present all such data and clarify if any gender differences were observed in this study. For example, data from female mice were used in Figure 1F. It would be useful to indicate as well whether the effects of SS-31 treatment persisted in male mice, as it did in female mice. It would also be useful to clarify in the legend for all figures and in the figures (panels) themselves, whether data from male and/or female mice is presented. In particular, authors should clarify in Figure 7 whether female mice (or male or a mixed-gender group) were used for the comparative SS-31 treatment group, since the mCAT mice were female (as indicated in the third paragraph of the subsection “Animals”).</p><p>3) The explanation of the statistics and experimental design should be clearer and carefully checked for consistency. For example, for measurement of protein S-glutathionylation; under Materials and methods the n=3 / group but in the figure text (Figure 4A) mentions n&gt;6 / group.</p><p>4) Please also indicate the statistical analyses used for each figure in the legends and the exact n-numbers for each group rather than a range (especially since your range is very wide, e.g. Figure 1F n=3 to 7/group).</p><p>5) Just by eyeballing, it is very difficult to see how the authors achieve statistical significance, given the large standard deviation and low n-numbers e.g. Figure 1B, D, E and Figure 4B. A much clearer explanation of the statistical analyses needs to be given and raw data and the specific tests should be provided in each case.</p><p>6) I assume that for several of the studies presented, the same mice were followed (e.g. for Figure E and F, it looks like female mice were measured at baseline, post treatment and then even further followed until well after the end of treatment). Would it not make sense to take advantage of this fact in the statistical analysis by plotting / analyzing individual trajectories?</p><p>7) Why were young mice (Figure 1E) not followed up further (as in Figure 1F)? If such data has been collected it should be included and discussed.</p><p>8) It is heartening that late-life treatment was able to reverse cardiac dysfunction, yet it is also somewhat disappointing that the reversal was itself reversible once treatment was stopped. The authors have presented extensive changes in ROS levels, mitochondrial respiration, protein modifications, and metabolic profiling associated with late-life treatment. It would be desirable to present at least some data to indicate whether these changes were also reversible once treatment stopped.</p><p>9) Blots should be done in multiple replicates (if this was done, it is not indicated).</p><p>10) One of the key strengths of this study is the range and quality of techniques applied to the intervention study. However, to maximize the value of these data, it is important that all the raw data is made available in full and is annotated such that other can further or re-analyze it. The metabolomics data is provided in such a format but the some of the other data either require clearer annotation or are missing.</p><p>Examples of data that should be provided in full with appropriate annotation include:</p><p>• Full proteomics data on S-glutathionylation (Figure 4B).</p><p>• All images used for image-based analysis (ROS: Figure 2A and B).</p><p>• All images included in imaged-based analysis / statistics (Senescence: and Figure 4C and D).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55513.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a fundamental concern in that a similar improvement can be seen with SS-31 in young mice – which the authors show but do not discuss in Figure 1E.

Also, in a female cohort we previously tested, we also observed no significant improvement in treadmill running in young mice (Campbell et al., 2018).</p><p>Furthermore, we did not observe significant differences in the other parameters that we measured in young mice with and without SS-31 treatment, including exercise performance (Figure 1E), cardiac hypertrophy (Figure 1D) and metabolome (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). These results suggest that SS-31 is effective in aged hearts with pre-existing mitochondrial dysfunction but has little effects in young hearts with normal functioning mitochondria, as has been previously observed (Campbell et al., 2018; Siegel et al., 2013; Szeto, 2013). Therefore, we focused on the treatment effects in old mice and did not look at the remaining parameters in young SS-31. We have now added this in the Discussion section (subsection “Targeting mitochondrial oxidative stress in late-life reverses cardiac aging phenotypes”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Gender differences in changes in mitochondria function and treatment effects have previously been reported.

We also observed similar benefits in exercise performance in male and female mice after 8-week SS-31 treatment (Figure 1E and Campbell et al., 2018). However, due to limitations in numbers of old mice available, not all parameters were tested in both sexes. Persistence of the SS-31 induced improvement was only followed in female mice but not male mice. We used female WT mice for AAV9-mCAT administration (Figure 7A, C, D and E), and female WT mice treated with SS-31 were used in Figure 6 for comparison of the effects of AAV9-mCAT and SS-31 on myofilament protein phosphorylation.</p><p>For Figure 7B, a mixed-sex group of mCAT transgenic mice and WT littermates were used to study the effect of SS-31 in combination with mCAT transgenic expression. We used a mixed-sex group because we only had a limited number of old mCAT transgenic mice available and because we had observed a similar diastolic function benefit from SS-31 treatment in male and female WT mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The explanation of the statistics and experimental design should be clearer and carefully checked for consistency.

As noted above, and discussed in the text, SS-31 appears to be effective only when there is pre-existing mitochondrial dysfunction but has little effects on normal mitochondria in young mice. Therefore, we didn’t follow up on young mice in other experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It is heartening that late-life treatment was able to reverse cardiac dysfunction, yet it is also somewhat disappointing that the reversal was itself reversible once treatment was stopped. The authors have presented extensive changes in ROS levels, mitochondrial respiration, protein modifications, and metabolic profiling associated with late-life treatment. It would be desirable to present at least some data to indicate whether these changes were also reversible once treatment stopped.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed that it is a little disappointing that the benefit of SS-31 is not more persistent. One interesting observation is that the persistence of the functional benefit varied between individual mice, the individual trajectories is now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 3. We hypothesize that the persistence of the molecular changes e.g. oxidative damage and myofilament protein phosphorylation, also varied between individuals. Future studies will be required to follow up on how different molecular changes mediated by SS-31 persist after treatment cessation and determine the molecular mechanisms driving this individual variation and limiting SS-31 persistence. We have added this limitation to the Discussion section (subsection “SS-31 and mCAT expression differentially regulate phosphorylation of myofilament proteins to improve diastolic function”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Blots should be done in multiple replicates (if this was done, it is not indicated).</p></disp-quote><p>Each immunoblotting was performed with at least 3 biological replicates (heart samples from 3 mice) per treatment/age group. We have now listed the exact numbers of biological replicates in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) One of the key strengths of this study is the range and quality of techniques applied to the intervention study. However, to maximize the value of these data, it is important that all the raw data is made available in full and is annotated such that other can further or re-analyze it. The metabolomics data is provided in such a format but the some of the other data either require clearer annotation or are missing.</p><p>Examples of data that should be provided in full with appropriate annotation include:</p><p>• Full proteomics data on S-glutathionylation (Figure 4B).</p></disp-quote><p>Raw mass spec files for S-glutathionylation have been deposited raw data into MassIVE and can be accessed via the following link (included in the Materials and methods section): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=e8e88dd88dfc416d962d6cedf7af90d1">https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=e8e88dd88dfc416d962d6cedf7af90d1</ext-link></p><p>We are currently preparing a manuscript on the protein by protein analysis on SS-31 effects on S-glutathionylation.
