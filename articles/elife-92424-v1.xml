Besides, the kidney of fish is considered as a functional ortholog of mammalian bone marrow that serves as a hematopoietic hub for generating blood cell lineages and immunological responses. However, knowledge about the properties of kidney hematopoietic cells, and the functionality of the kidney in fish immune systems remains to be elucidated. To this end, our present study generated a comprehensive atlas with 59 hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) and immune-cells types from zebrafish kidneys via single-cell transcriptome profiling analysis. These populations included almost all known cells associated with innate and adaptive immunity, and displayed differential responses to viral infection, indicating their diverse functional roles in antiviral immunity. Remarkably, HSPCs were found to have extensive reactivities to viral infection, and the trained immunity can be effectively induced in certain HSPCs. In addition, the antigen-stimulated adaptive immunity can be fully generated in the kidney, suggesting the kidney acts as a secondary lymphoid organ. These results indicated that the fish kidney is a dual-functional entity with functionalities of both primary and secondary lymphoid organs. Our findings illustrated the unique features of fish immune systems, and highlighted the multifaced biology of kidneys in ancient vertebrates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-cell transcriptome profiling</kwd><kwd>zebrafish kidney</kwd><kwd>HSPCs</kwd><kwd>immune cell types</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>antiviral immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32173003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Li-xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31630083</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shao</surname><given-names>Jian-zhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFD0900503</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shao</surname><given-names>Jian-zhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFD0900505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Li-xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>scRNA-seq revealed the fish kidney is a dual-functional entity with functionalities of both primary and secondary lymphoid organs and highlighted the multifaced biology of kidney in ancient vertebrates.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Teleost fish are a group of indispensable model organisms for comprehending the evolutionary history and general principles underlying the design of the vertebrate immune system, since they stand as the earliest living jawed vertebrates known as an important link in vertebrate evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sunyer, 2013</xref>). Over the recent decades, the field of fish immunology has made significant strides, notably hastening the identification and characterization of functional genes and signaling pathways intricately associated with both piscine innate and adaptive immunities. These advances stem from the progress in genome projects encompassing diverse fish species, and have markedly enriched our comprehension of the molecular underpinnings of fish immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Volff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). Some breakthroughs have not only challenged established paradigms about the immune system but have also unveiled novel dimensions of mammalian immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sunyer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus far, it was generally accepted that teleost fish possess the fundamental components of both innate and adaptive immune systems, akin to those seen in humans and other mammalian counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rauta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Secombes and Wang, 2012</xref>). However, our grasp of the precise architectural layout, cellular coordination, and functional attributes of the fish immune system, particularly the adaptive facet, remains incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Secombes and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mokhtar et al., 2023</xref>). Evolutionarily speaking, bony fish represent the earliest living organisms endowed with a rudimentary adaptive immune system encompassing basic molecular and cellular constituents. These encompass immunoglobulins (Igs), antigen-specific receptors (TCR/BCR) driven by the recombination-activating genes, major histocompatibility complex class I and II (MHC-I/II) molecules, as well as T and B lymphocytes. These cellular elements populate the primary and secondary lymphoid organs of fish, such as the thymus and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooper and Alder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wan et al., 2016</xref>). Notwithstanding, the fish adaptive immune system is characterized by its own set of specializations and distinctive attributes. Notably absent in fishes are the bone marrow, histologically discernible lymph nodes, Peyer’s patches, and germinal centers—entities that define primary and secondary lymphoid organs in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neely and Flajnik, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matz et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, fishes lack antibody class-switch recombination activity, albeit retaining the ability to express activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barreto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wakae et al., 2006</xref>). These revelations underscore the substantial diversity inherent in immune systems across distinct vertebrate taxonomic groups. Consequently, teleost fish emerge as invaluable primitive animal models, illuminating previously uncharted events during the emergence and phylogenetic progression of adaptive immune systems. Such endeavors stand to elucidate the distinct principles governing the immunology of ancient vertebrates, thereby furnishing scientific substantiation for a broader comprehension of the evolutionary trajectory of vertebrate immune systems.</p><p>In light of these considerations, we have recently generated a comprehensive atlas of immune cell types within the spleen of zebrafish, employing a single-cell transcriptome profiling approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2023</xref>). Our work has entailed the classification of splenic leukocytes into 11 principal categories and the identification of over 50 subset populations within these categories. Moreover, we have delineated the differential responses of various subset cells—both innate and adaptive—to infection by the spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV). Particularly noteworthy was our discovery of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that existed within the spleen. This observation intimates that the fish spleen may well function as a hematopoietic site, transcending its established role as a secondary lymphoid organ. These insights offer fresh perspectives into the intricacies and distinctive attributes of the fish immune system, setting it apart from its mammalian counterparts. Seeking to attain a deeper understanding of the fish immune system, our present study has undertaken a further exploration of immune cell types and their functional characteristics within the kidney of zebrafish. This investigation places special emphasis on the hematopoietic activity of kidney HSPCs and the adaptive immune responses of kidney immune cells toward viral infections. As a result, our classification efforts have yielded 13 categories of cells from kidney leukocyte preparations, unearthing 59 potential subset cells spanning HSPCs and immune cell-associated categories. The observed subset populations manifest disparate reactions to SVCV infection. Most notably, some HSPC subsets exhibit a robust proliferative response to viral infection, capable of inducing trained immunity. Furthermore, we have successfully identified a comprehensive array of cells—encompassing diverse antigen-presenting cells (APCs) as well as effector T and B cells—integral for the full activation of adaptive immunity within the kidney. These adaptive immune-associated cells display marked responsiveness to SVCV infection and antigenic stimulation. Evidently, the complete process of adaptive immunity unfolds within the kidney, as evidenced by the substantial expansion, activation, and somatic hypermutation (SHM) of antigen-specific T and B cells upon exposure to cognate antigens. These results strongly affirmed the kidney’s dual role as a lymphoid organ, boasting both hematopoietic functionality and adaptive immune reactivity in adult fish. Consequently, our findings cast the fish kidney in the role of a secondary lymphoid organ, supplementing its recognized status as a primary lymphoid organ. This advancement significantly improved our current comprehension of fish hematopoietic and immune systems, thus advancing our insights into the multifaceted biology of the kidney in ancient vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Categories of immune-associated cells in the kidney</title><p>In order to profile distinct immune-cell categories within the kidneys, leukocytes were extracted from zebrafish kidney tissues. The experimental groups consisted of fish treated with PBS (control), fish infected with SVCV (infected), and fish that underwent both vaccination with inactivated SVCV and subsequent SVCV infection (vaccinated+infected). Each sample comprised leukocytes from 60 fish and was subjected to scRNA-seq using the 10x Chromium platform. Following sequencing, the control group exhibited mean reads/median genes per cell of 34,501/1090, the infected group showed 29,706/1383, while the vaccinated+infected group displayed 37,611/1379. The total number of detected genes in leukocyte samples from the control, infected, and vaccinated+infected groups were 26,345, 26,865, and 25,342, respectively. Employing an unsupervised cluster detection algorithm (SEURAT), we identified 13 distinct clusters of cells exhibiting similar gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, specific genes were pinpointed within each cluster. Notably, clear demarcation boundaries were evident for each cluster in the heatmap, while dot plot and violin plot analyses indicated that a PCA-based cell separation approach was indeed favorable for our investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Categorization of the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and immune cell types in zebrafish kidney.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nonlinear t-SNE clustering visually categorized populations of zebrafish kidney leukocytes.

H4 cells were positioned towards the trajectory’s terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). H2 cells, along with erythrocyte (H7) and lymphoid (H8) progenitors, were positioned towards the trajectory’s midpoint. H0 and H3 populations, along with NK (H5) and myeloid (H6) progenitors, were located towards both the origin and midpoint of the trajectory. Furthermore, an analysis of the pseudotime dynamics of significantly changed genes in the 11 HSPC clusters revealed three modules delineated by their pseudotemporal expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). In addition, RNA velocity analysis showed the differentiation potential of H0, H1, H2, H3, and H4 subclusters into myeloid, thrombocyte/erythrocyte, and lymphoid progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These findings collectively suggested that H0-H4 clusters potentially represent a group of stem and early progenitors that lead to late progenitors responsible for differentiation into erythroid, myeloid, and lymphocyte lineages. Notably, we recently detected the presence of HSPCs in zebrafish spleen tissues, indicating the spleen’s role as a hematopoietic organ in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2023</xref>). To compare HSPC characteristics between the kidney and spleen, we integrated scRNA-seq data from both organs and subjected the merged dataset to cell classification. This assessment demonstrated that the newly generated atlas shared overall consistency with the kidney and spleen, merging proportional HSPCs and immune cells from the two organs to varying extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These observations underscored the presence of substantial overlapping HSPCs and immune cell types in both the kidney and spleen. Furthermore, pseudotime trajectory analysis highlighted similar cell differentiation trajectories shared between the kidney and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>). Pseudotime dynamics of significantly altered genes across all categories were analyzed and organized into three modules based on their pseudotemporal expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). In aggregate, our findings reveal overall similarities in HSCPs' composition and differentiation potentials between the kidney and spleen, suggesting analogous functionalities in hematopoiesis and immunity across both organs.

Interestingly, a distinct subset of IgM<sup>+</sup>β<sup>+</sup> cells was identified within B8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). This lineage, known as dual expresser (DE), simultaneously expressing TCR and BCR, has been reported in humans and is also present in the spleen of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2019</xref>). The top 10 subset-specific genes with the greatest significance for each B-cell subset are visualized in a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). An analysis of the top 10 significantly enriched GO terms within the biological process (BP) for each B-cell subset was conducted. The results revealed varying metabolic processes enriched in each subset. For example, protein export emerged as a major BP category and the most notable KEGG pathway in plasma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This outcome aligns with the understanding that plasma cells are actively engaged in antibody synthesis and secretion, underscoring the importance of protein synthetic metabolism in humoral immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zwollo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bromage et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, (im)mat. B subset cells exhibited significant enrichment in antigen processing and presentation BP pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>). This finding is congruent with prior evidence highlighting the robust antigen presentation capability of teleost fish B cells, contributing to the initiation of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation in adaptive humoral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, the translation process displayed enrichment across all B-cell subsets, indicative of ongoing protein synthesis during B cell development and maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). These observations provide substantive support for subset classification from the perspective of cellular metabolism. Subsequently, Monocle2 pseudotime analysis was performed on B-cell subsets using Monocle to unveil potential relationships among different subsets during B-cell development. Distinct pseudotime trajectory states of the B-cell subsets were delineated and are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>. Among these subsets, pro/pre B (B2), B1-like (B8), and germinal center B-like cells (B5) occupied state 1, representing the initial differentiation phase, followed by the im/mat. B (B0 and B3), IgM<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>+</sup> B (B1), act. B/PBs (B6), and plasma (B4) cells. Notably, the identified B2, B5, and B8 clustered together in a single branch, while B0, B3, and B7 progressively differentiated into B6 and eventually into B4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). To explore the regulation of B-cell differentiation, a pseudotime analysis was conducted on the genes significantly altered within these clusters. These genes were categorized into three modules based on their pseudotemporal expression patterns, thereby yielding potential key regulators of teleost B-cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Furthermore, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has been found to induce trained immunity in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs), promoting augmented myelopoiesis at the expense of lymphopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Laval et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we investigated the potential induction of trained immunity in innate immune cells and HSPCs within the kidney upon stimulation by SVCV. To this end, zebrafish were immunized with the SVCV vaccine for 14 days and subsequently exposed to virulent SVCV for another 7 days. The outcomes demonstrated a substantial reduction in the proportion of neutrophils within cluster 0 following SVCV infection. However, this population exhibited minimal reduction in vaccinated zebrafish (referred to as “trained zebrafish”) upon the second SVCV challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, the abundance of HSPCs 1 within cluster 4 remained unchanged after SVCV infection, yet experienced significant expansion during the second SVCV challenge in trained zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, the H0 subset exhibited the most pronounced response to trained immunity to SVCV within the HSPC categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). Specifically, the proportion of H0 decreased from 27.81% in the PBS group to 19.87% in the SVCV group, then rapidly surged to 41.43% in the vaccinated+SVCV group. This trend was supported by the significant upregulation of numerous immune-related genes within H0 subset cells of trained zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). Thus, the shift in the H0 subset played a pivotal role in the overall heightened activity of the HSPCs 1 category within trained zebrafish. Collectively, these findings underscore an intensified immune response in kidney HSPCs of zebrafish subsequent to SVCV vaccination, suggesting the inducement of trained immunity in zebrafish kidney HSPCs for the generation of a memory response to SVCV infection. Furthermore, the neutrophils within the kidney of trained zebrafish exhibited enhanced antiviral immunity, showcasing potential innate immune memory characteristics.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Induction of trained immunity in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) through zebrafish vaccination with inactivated spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nonlinear t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) clustering displayed the proportions of HSPCs 1 (<bold>H0</bold>) in the PBS-administered (control), SVCV-infected (infected), and SVCV-vaccinated plus SVCV-infected (vaccinated+SVCV) groups.

This study offers experimental confirmation for the occurrence of adaptive immunity in the zebrafish kidney following viral stimulation. To this end, zebrafish were exposed to inactivated SVCV (10<sup>6</sup> TCID50/fish) for 7 days, and the activation of kidney T and B cells was assessed by quantifying their heightened proliferation and increased expression of CD154 and CD40 costimulatory molecules through flow cytometry and RT-qPCR. As anticipated, CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, and IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells exhibited significant proliferation in the kidneys of zebrafish stimulated with SVCV compared to control fish that received mock PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A–D</xref>). In tandem, the transcriptional levels of CD154 and CD40 genes displayed marked upregulation, concurrent with the proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, and IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13E and F</xref>). Importantly, parallel activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, and IgM<sup>+</sup> cells was also discerned in the spleens of SVCV-stimulated zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13G</xref>). These results suggested that the zebrafish kidney assumes a central role in orchestrating adaptive immune responses to viral infection, a role that may be comparable to that of the spleen, a well-known secondary lymphoid organ crucial for initiating and advancing adaptive immunity. To substantiate this perspective, we proceeded to investigate the occurrence of SHM, a hallmark event driving antibody affinity maturation in adaptive humoral immunity, within kidney B cells upon antigenic stimulation. We employed RT-qPCR to examine the expression of the zebrafish AID gene (<italic>aicda</italic>), a pivotal initiator of SHM. As anticipated, AID transcript presence was evident in the zebrafish kidney, and its expression significantly increased in response to SVCV stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13H</xref>).

Notably, the frequency of mutagenesis within V regions (V4-9) of IgM genes demonstrated a substantial antigen-dependent increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13I</xref>). These findings offer novel insights into the dual-functionality of the zebrafish kidney, encompassing both hematopoietic and adaptive immunological responsiveness.

The origin and phylogenetic evolution of the vertebrate immune system captivates the attention of comparative immunologists, particularly concerning teleost fish due to their pivotal phylogenetic standing. In human and other mammalian organisms, the immune system encompasses primary and secondary lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neely and Flajnik, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boehm and Bleul, 2007</xref>), the former including bone marrow and thymus, facilitating hematopoiesis, lymphocyte maturation, and functional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boehm and Bleul, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chinn et al., 2023</xref>). Secondary lymphoid organs, including lymph nodes, spleen, and sections of mucosal immune systems, trigger the activation of naïve lymphocytes by antigens, thereby initiating and advancing adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neely and Flajnik, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Malhotra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Randall et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast to mammals, teleost fish lack bone marrow and lymph nodes. Instead, the anterior section of the fish kidney (referred to as the head kidney) emerges as an operational analog of mammalian bone marrow in adult fish. Accordingly, the fish kidney functions as the primary hematopoietic site, overseeing the generation of circulating blood cell lineages and B cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stachura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diep et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Page et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the fish kidney is also thought to be an immunologically responsive organ capable of eliciting immune responses against a spectrum of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zwollo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bromage et al., 2004</xref>). These findings establish the kidney’s pivotal role in fish immunity, although a comprehensive understanding of the cellular components and their attributes within the hematopoietic process and immune responses in the fish kidney remains elusive.</p><p>To address these gaps, we conducted a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of kidney leukocytes in zebrafish, unraveling the spectrum of hematopoietic and immune-associated cell types in adult fish. We identified 13 distinct cell categories, spanning three groups of HSPCs, six cohorts of innate and adaptive immune-related cells, and four renal cell types, which emerged as byproducts of cellular preparation. Further subdivisions of the three HSPC groups led to the identification of 11 potential subpopulations, each marked by unique gene expression profiles. Notable subsets, such as Nanos1<sup>+</sup>Spi2<sup>+</sup> HSPCs and cycling HSPCs, bore resemblances to previously described counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rubin et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, six subsets exhibited the characteristics of progenitor cells, demonstrating both marker gene expression and the capacity to differentiate into diverse blood cell lineages encompassing NK cells, myeloid cells, lymphoid cells, erythrocytes, and thrombocytes. Yet, the properties of certain HSPC subsets, like H2, H3, and H4, remain undefined. Such subsets exhibit distinct gene expression profiles, which could potentially serve as candidate signatures for future subset classification. Correspondingly, numerous committed or terminal cell lineages, intricately associated with these HSPCs, were detected in the kidney. These lineages encompass a range of innate and adaptive immune-related cells at various developmental stages, prominently featuring neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, and various T and B cell subsets. Moreover, early developmental cells such as double negative (DN) T cells, double positive (DP) T cells, pro/pre B cells, and immature/mature B cells were found in the kidney. These cells are major committed immature or partially mature T and B lymphocytes at the early stage of hematopoiesis, among them, the DN and DP T cells will enter the thymus, where they complete their maturation and maturing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rubin et al., 2022</xref>), while pro/pre B and im/mat B cells may continue to mature or partially mature in the kidney. These insights underscore the presence of diverse HSPCs fostering various blood cell lineages and reinforce the concept that the fish kidney functions as a primary lymphoid organ, mirroring the role of mammalian bone marrow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Catton, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zapata, 1979</xref>).</p><p>Comparatively, human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are characterized by surface markers (such as CD34 and c-kit), coupled with the absence of lineage-specific markers typical of mature cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shin et al., 2014</xref>). HSCs yield common myeloid-lymphoid progenitors (CMLPs) and common myeloid-megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (CMMEPs). While CMLPs give rise to committed T and B cell precursors, ILCs, and certain myeloid cells, CMMEPs produce precursors for erythroid, megakaryocytic, monocytic, and granulocytic lineages. These precursors subsequently develop into mature erythrocytes, platelets, monocytes, and granulocytes, as well as dendritic cells and mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Woolthuis and Park, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kondo, 2010</xref>). Notably, zebrafish exhibited detectable elementary progenitors responsible for generating principal blood cell lineages, suggesting the presence of conserved cellular components and developmental pathways underlying adult hematopoiesis across species. However, unresolved matters and fish-specific events within adult fish hematopoiesis persist, such as distinguishing HSCs from multiple HSPCs. Additionally, the existence of pluripotent common progenitors akin to CMLPs and CMMEPs, as well as committed precursors for lymphocytic, erythroid, megakaryocytic, monocytic, and granulocytic lineages, warrant clarification. Although pseudotime trajectory and RNA velocity analyses have shed preliminary light on relationships among partial HSPCs, the precise phenotypic features, developmental trajectories, and correlations of these HSPCs necessitate thorough elucidation. Unique HSPCs with unknown properties, like H0, H2, H3, and H4, accentuate the high heterogeneity within HSPCs in adult fish. Given the considerable number of fish-specific lineages, probing the relationship between these uncharacterized HSPCs and fish-specific lineages remains a promising avenue of exploration.</p><p>The extensive presence of immune cells associated with the kidney signifies the central role of this organ in fish immunity, extending beyond its hematopoietic function. Indeed, the kidney exhibited robust responsiveness to SVCV infection, evidenced by significant changes in the abundance of diverse immune cells, including both upregulated and downregulated subsets. Prominent upregulated populations consisted of neutrophils (N0, N2, N3), NK (T6, T7, T13, T21), NKT (T5, T17), Th17 (T12), Th2-like (T22), common IgM<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>+</sup> B (B1), pro/pre B (B2), germinal center B-like (B5) cells, and macrophages (M1, M2, M4, M5), indicating their engagement in host defense against SVCV. Conversely, downregulated populations encompassed subsets of neutrophils (N1, N4), CD8<sup>+</sup> T (T8, T9, T15), Th1 (T3), Treg (T16), im/mat. B (B0), and M1-/M2-macrophages (M0, M3, M7, M8), implying their impairment during SVCV infection. For example, the impairment of im/mat. B (B0) cells may be caused by undergoing severe cell death under infection in this case, as determined by their high expression of death-associated genes related to apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necroptosis. The reduction in this antibody-producing subset will attenuate the humoral adaptive immune protection of fish from SVCV infection. Notably, we found that the abundance of three HSPC subsets (H1, H3, and H4) were markedly upregulated by 24.09-, 255.22-, 258.44-folds, respectively. By contrast, six other HSPC subsets (H0, H2, H6, H7, H8, and H9) were downregulated, potentially hampering the differentiation of downstream lineage cells and attenuating antiviral immunity. Encouragingly, two HSPC subsets demonstrated the induction of trained immunity upon stimulation with SVCV vaccine, subsequently challenged by virulent SVCV. These findings not only underscore the role of HSPCs in viral responses but also signify a novel dimension of HSPC involvement in viral infections. Previous studies have highlighted the profound impact of infections on host immune homeostasis in various viral disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sumbria et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rouse and Sehrawat, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perelson and Ribeiro, 2018</xref>). The consequences range from excessive inflammation due to hyperactive immune responses to immune deficiency resulting from ineffective responses, the latter of which potentially favors immune escape from viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rouse and Sehrawat, 2010</xref>). In the current study, multiple HSPCs and immune cell subset disturbances were observed under SVCV infection, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spellberg and Edwards, 2001</xref>). However, the exact mechanisms of the disturbance of HSPCs and immune cells under infection remain to be studied, which will help clarify the pathogenesis of viremia during SVCV infection from the perspective of immunopathology.</p><p>The broader overview of kidney immune cell shifts in response to SVCV challenge reveals extensive innate and adaptive immune responses within the kidney during viral infections.

These cells encompass various APCs, along with naïve T and B cells, plasmablasts, and plasma cells—key cell types crucial for initiating, activating, and executing adaptive immune responses. The profiles of adaptive immune cells within the kidney, alongside their responses, closely resemble those observed in the spleen—an evolutionarily conserved secondary lymphoid organ spanning vertebrates from fish to mammals. Consequently, our findings strongly imply that the zebrafish kidney might function as a secondary lymphoid organ, fostering the generation of adaptive immunity through interactions among APCs and antigen-specific T and B cells. To empirically substantiate this hypothesis, we examined the occurrence of antigen-stimulated adaptive immune responses in the kidney. As anticipated, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, and IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells exhibited pronounced activation in the zebrafish kidney under SVCV challenge. This activation was underscored by significant proliferation in CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, and IgM<sup>+</sup> B cell populations, followed by upregulated transcriptional expression of CD154 and CD40 genes in these cells. Furthermore, we also observed the occurrence of antigen-induced expression of AID and SHM in the kidney IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells, two hallmark events for the affinity maturation of antibodies in adaptive humoral immunity. These results collectively establish the zebrafish kidney as a distinct entity encompassing attributes of both primary and secondary lymphoid organs, thus offering fresh insights into the dual functional roles of the fish kidney, spanning hematopoiesis and adaptive immunity. While peripheral lymph nodes are absent, the spleen has historically stood as the predominant secondary lymphoid organ in fish. However, our current study introduces a novel member to the array of secondary lymphoid organs. The intricate interplay between the roles of the kidney and spleen in hematopoiesis and immune responses within fish warrants further elucidation. Moreover, unraveling the structural foundations accommodating diverse HSPCs and immune cell types and precisely orchestrating hematopoiesis and immune responses within the kidney and spleen emerges as a compelling area of inquiry. Addressing these queries necessitates the utilization of advanced techniques, such as single-cell spatiotemporal transcriptomic analysis at the level of cross-organ single-cell transcriptome profiling.</p><p>In summary, our study presents a comprehensive panorama of HSPCs and immune cell types within the zebrafish kidney under steady-state conditions, viral emergencies, and vaccine training. Our identification of a multitude of HSPCs, along with developmentally-linked progenitors and immune cell types, and their modifications under emergency and training scenarios, underscores the pivotal role of the kidney in fish defense against viral infections. Moreover, the revelation of trained immunity establishment within HSPCs holds significant implications for comprehending the novel pathways and mechanisms governing trained immunity formation. The paradigm shift—where the kidney, traditionally viewed as a primary lymphoid organ facilitating hematopoiesis—emerges as a secondary lymphoid organ, marks a pivotal transformation in understanding fish biology. Our study offers insights into the intricate and heterogeneous nature of the fish immune system, shedding light on the multifunctionality of the fish kidney, encompassing hematopoiesis, immune defense, waste excretion, and osmoregulation—mainstays of kidney function across diverse vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental fish</title><p>Wild-type AB zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) of both sexes were obtained from China Zebrafish Resource Center (Wuhan, China), 3–12 months of age with body weights ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 g and lengths of 3–4 cm, were reared under standard laboratory conditions. The fish were raised in recirculating water at a temperature of 28 °C and exposed to a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Prior to their use in experiments, all fish were acclimated for a minimum of 2 weeks to ensure their overall health.

After 7 days of SVCV challenge, zebrafish were euthanized with MS222. Kidney tissues were meticulously excised and passed through a 40 μm stainless nylon mesh (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Germany). The resulting cell suspension was suspended in Leibovitz’s L-15 Medium (L-15, Gibco), supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), streptomycin (100 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), and heparin sodium (10 U/ml, Sigma-Aldrich). This suspension was then introduced into a Ficoll-Hypaque (1.080 g/mL) density-gradient centrifugation, and subsequently centrifuged at 1200 g for 25 min. The cellular interface layer was cautiously aspirated, followed by a wash with ice-cold PBS at 400 g for 10 min. The viability and quantity of cells were assessed using 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), confirming the viability of over 95% of the cells.

In brief, the isolated leucocytes from zebrafish kidney were applied to Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer and the magnetic bead separation method was used to remove red blood cells and dead cells. After cell counting, an appropriate volume for capturing 10,000 cells was calculated. These cells were mixed into a sample and adjusted to 700~1200 cell/μl. Libraries were constructed using the Chromium Controller and Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit v2 (10×Genomics) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Cellular suspension was added to the master mix containing nuclease-free water, RT Reagent Mix, RT Primer, Additive A and RT Enzyme Mix. Master mix with cells was transferred to the wells in the row labeled 1 on the Chromium Single Cell A Chip (10×Genomics). Single Cell 3’ Gel Beads and Partitioning Oil were placed in specific rows. The chip was loaded onto the Chromium Controller to create single-cell GEMs. GEM-RT was conducted in a C1000 Touch Thermal cycler (Bio-Rad), followed by cleanup with DynaBeads MyOne Silane Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Subsequent cDNA amplification and library construction adhered to standard protocols. The library was multiplexed and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq-500 lane using a high-output (400 m) kit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hernández et al., 2018</xref>).

Cells with fewer than 500 unique genes, over 50,000 UMI counts, or more than 10% mitochondrial reads were removed. Undetected genes in any cell were excluded. Post-filtration, cell counts were 9004 in the PBS-administered group (control), 9890 in the SVCV-infected group (infected), and 8487 in the SVCV-vaccinated plus SVCV-infected group (vaccinated+infected).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Downstream analysis of 10x Genomics data</title><p>After log normalizing the data, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce dimension. The identification of significant clusters was performed using the Find Clusters algorithm in the Seurat package, which uses a shared nearest-neighbor modularity optimization-based clustering algorithm. Marker genes for each significant cluster were found using the Seurat function FindAllMarkers. Cell types were determined using a combination of marker genes identified from the literature and gene ontology for cell types. Expression of selected genes was plotted with the Seurat function FeaturePlot and VlnPlot. Hierarchical clustering and heat map generation were performed for single cells based on log-normalized (with scale factor 10,000 and pseudocount 1) expression values of marker genes obtained from the literature or identified as highly differentially expressed. Heatmaps were generated using the heatmap.2 function from the gplots v3.5.2 R package using the default complete-linkage clustering algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Pseudotime trajectory analysis</title><p>Pseudotime trajectory was plotted by using the R package monocle Version 2.22.0 with the default settings given there.

This approach uses the relative proportions of unspliced and spliced mRNA abundance to provide insights into the anticipated future state of cells. Initial annotation of spliced and unspliced reads was performed through the utilization of the ‘velocyto.py’ commandline tools. Subsequently, downstream analysis was performed using the same ‘velocyto.py’ framework. The resulting RNA velocity data represents a vector that predicts the transition dynamics of individual cells, with the direction and speed of each transition inferred from the amplitude and direction of the individual cell velocity arrows plotted on a t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) plot. By examining the directional flow within the RNA velocity vector field, the hierarchical relationship between two cell populations can be inferred.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Pathway enrichment analysis</title><p>Functional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), were conducted to determine which differentially expressed genes (DEGs) significantly enriched GO terms or metabolic pathways.

It is likely that the formatting of the inserted images was altered during the manuscript upload process, leading to a reduction in resolution. However, the graphics uploaded as separate image files, specifically formatted as vector files in PDF format, preserve their high resolution even when zoomed in. Therefore, we kindly request the reviewer to consult the figures in the submission folder for a more detailed examination. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) What are the figures at the end of the manuscript without any figure legends?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. The last few figures that lack figure legends are actually supplementary figures included in the text. It is possible that they were automatically and repeatedly generated by the submission system. In the revised manuscript, we will take measures to ensure that this issue is avoided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It would be better to use a Table to organize the gene signatures that define each unique population of immune cells such as T, B, NK, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We greatly appreciate the valuable advice provided by the reviewer. As per the reviewer's recommendation, we have included a comprehensive display of all cell types and corresponding gene signatures in Supplementary File 1 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) What are the similarities for HSPC and immune cell populations between fish and man based on this research? It is better to form a table to compare and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Following the valuable suggestion of the reviewer, we have included an additional comparative analysis of HSPC and immune cell populations between zebrafish and humans. This information can be found in Supplementary file 8 and in the &quot;Discussion&quot; section (lines 684-685).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is highly likely that sex and age could be the biological variation for how HSPC responds to virus infections and vaccination. The author should clearly state the fish sex and age from their samples and discuss their results taking into consideration of these variations.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We are grateful for the reviewer's insightful comments. To reduce inter-individual variations, zebrafish samples were selected randomly, with an equal distribution of males and females, during their prime youth period spanning from 3 to 12 months of age. We have included supplementary instructions regarding this selection process in the &quot;Materials and Methods&quot; section (lines 798-799).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors claim that the spleen and kidney share HSPCs. However, their data did not demonstrate this result clearly in Figure 4A. Perhaps they should use different color to make the overlay becoming more obvious? Or include a table to show which HSPCs are shared between the kidney and spleen? Are they sure if these are just HSPCs seeding the spleen to differentiate into B cells or other immune cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We express our gratitude to the reviewer for raising this issue. In this section, we would like to provide detailed explanations regarding this matter. It is important to note that the figures positioned on both the left and right sides of Figure 4A should be interpreted in a corresponding manner. The left-side figure represents the cellular composition from the spleen (depicted in light red) and the kidney (depicted in blue) across various cell types. Each data point in the left-side figure signifies an individual cell, with the two distinct colors indicating the origin of the cell. On the other hand, the right-side figure displays the varied colors representing different cell types. We want to emphasize that the spatial distribution and proportions of diverse cells in the tSNE plot on the right align consistently with the information presented in the left-side figure. This indicates the correspondence between the two plots and reinforces the validity of our findings. When interpreting the figures on the left and right sides of Figure 4A in a corresponding manner, it becomes evident that the overlapping HSPCs shared by both spleen and kidney predominantly reside in the HSPCs1 group (indicated as cluster 5 in the right-side figure). Additionally, there is also a small distribution of the overlapping HSPCs in the HSPCs2 group (cluster 8 in the right-side figure). These observations underline the presence of overlapping HSPCs in both the kidney and spleen. However, further clarification is required to fully comprehend the intricate correlation between the HSPCs in the kidney and spleen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor concerns:</p><p>(1) Figure 3C: why is 10 listed in between 1 and 2?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer's comment. It is pertinent to mention that the graphs in Figure 3C underwent an automatic sorting process facilitated by the software during the analysis. It should be emphasized that the assigned positions resulting from this sorting process have no bearing on the outcomes of the analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 4A: difficult to assess the overlay between the kidney and spleen.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As mentioned above, the overlapping HSPCs shared by both the spleen and kidney are mainly distributed in the HSPCs1 group (cluster 5 in the right-side figure), with a small amount also found in the HSPCs2 group (cluster 8 in the right-side figure).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 4C: What is this sample, kidney or spleen? Please specify.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Figure 4C represents an overlay of the spleen and kidney cells depicted in Figure 4B, which includes all cells of the spleen and kidney to show the differentiation trajectory of the cells. As per reviewer’s suggestion, we have made corresponding modification to the revised figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The manuscript is very long. Consider to focus on the major findings as the main figures and move the rest to the supplementary figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This article aimed to comprehensively understand the hematopoietic and immunological traits of zebrafish kidneys through a systematic study. As a result, a comprehensive presentation of the findings has been provided. Given that the figures currently integrated into the main text play a significant role in illustrating the principal outcomes of each section, we kindly request that these figures remain in the main body of the article.

Do the authors have any insights into the coordination of these two functions in the kidneys?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We are grateful for the valuable comments provided. We believe that the question raised by the reviewer poses an intriguing research topic, as it explores the intricate interaction between the hematopoietic and adaptive immune systems in the renal organ. This exploration holds significant value in understanding the underlying mechanisms. To accomplish this, advanced techniques such as spatiotemporal single-cell transcriptomics and dynamic cell tracking will be utilized to validate the interplay between hematopoietic and immune cell lineages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Previous studies have found that fish IgZ/IgT specificity exists in mucosal immune organs. Is the expression of the zebrafish IgZ gene observed in the kidney? If so, is there any correlation with IgZ in mucosal immune organs?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for drawing attention to this matter. In our study, we observed the expression of the IgZ gene (ighz) in the zebrafish kidney, as shown in Figure 6. This discovery aligns with previous research and confirms its presence in B cells. While IgZ is known to function as an antibody in mucosal immunity, it remains unclear whether the development of its secretory cells (IgZ+ B cells) originates from the central immune system, such as the kidney. Our results suggest that IgZ+ B cells may have their origin in the kidney and then migrate through the peripheral circulation to carry out their functions in the local mucosal system. This finding is consistent with our earlier research, which demonstrated that zebrafish IgZ is not limited to mucosal immune organs but is also abundantly present in systemic immunity, including peripheral blood (Immunology. 2021; 162(1): 105-120).</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Ji, J.

We have incorporated this information into the &quot;Materials and Methods&quot; section of the revised manuscript (line 873).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Since the authors performed single-cell sequencing on leukocytes, why did several kidney cells, such as kidney multicellular cells and kidney mucin cells existed in the samples?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s comments. It is important to acknowledge that inadvertent mixing of kidney cells might have occurred during the preparation of single-cell suspensions in our analyzed sample. However, it is pertinent to emphasize that our primary focus was the analysis of immune cells. Therefore, any minor contamination from kidney cells in the analyzed sample is considered negligible and does not significantly affect the main results of our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The application of &quot;trained immunity,&quot; although currently popular, appears unsuitable in this context, as the current scenario involves a recall with the cognate antigen.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: To our knowledge, trained immunity is generally recognized as the long-term memory of innate immunity based on transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic modifications of myeloid cells, which are characterized by elevated pro-inflammatory responses to secondary stimuli, whether they are identical or different (Cell Host Microbe. 2012; 12(2): 223-32; Nat Immunol. 2021; 22(1): 2-6; J Clin Invest. 2022;132(7): e158468). Therefore, stimulation of cognate antigens can be considered as a form of training immunity, and we hope that it will be accepted in this context.</p><p>References:</p><p>(1) Quintin, J. et al.

Do the authors have any insights into the biological significance of trained immunity in HSPCs concerning immune defense?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We propose that the generation of trained immunity in HSPCs holds significant physiological implications. This process may expedite the differentiation and activation of specific immune cells upon re-infection, thereby bolstering the body's immune defenses and pathogen clearance. Consequently, it may serve as an intelligent strategy for host defense against pathogens. However, additional research is required to confirm this hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In the Figure 13I, the authors used CpG and CpG+TNP-KLH to stimulate zebrafish, but no corresponding experimental method was provided in the &quot;Materials and methods&quot;.

We have included corresponding supplementary instructions in the “Materials and methods” section (lines 1011-1018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) At line 187-190 in &quot;Results&quot;, authors state that &quot;It's noteworthy that cluster 11 exhibited high expression of genes ......, resembling a unique serpin-secreting cell population&quot;. Noteworthy is the fact that serpins play a role in diverse immunological processes, including coagulation, inflammation, as well as myeloid and lymphoid cell development. Could this renal cell cluster (kidney mucin cells) potentially harbor immunological functions?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Given the crucial role of serpins in various immunological processes, secreted serpins from this particular cell cluster likely possess significant immunological functions, suggesting the notable immunological capabilities of this cell group. Consequently, our forthcoming research aims to conduct a more comprehensive investigation of this specific cell population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) At line 171 in &quot;Results&quot;, the number &quot;6&quot; in the &quot;cluster 6&quot; should not be italicized, please correct.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have addressed this issue in the revised manuscript (line 170).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) At line 937 in &quot;Materials and methods&quot;, the authors isolated T/B lymphocytes through magnetic bead sorting.
