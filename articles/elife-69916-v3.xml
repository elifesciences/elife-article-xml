Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a double-stranded closed circular molecule of about 16 kb coding for 37 genes. Mutations, including deletions in the mitochondrial genome, can culminate in different human diseases. Mapping the deletion junctions suggests that the breakpoints are generally seen at hotspots. ‘9 bp deletion’ (8271–8281), seen in the intergenic region of cytochrome c oxidase II/tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>, is the most common mitochondrial deletion. While it is associated with several diseases like myopathy, dystonia, and hepatocellular carcinoma, it has also been used as an evolutionary marker. However, the mechanism responsible for its fragility is unclear. In the current study, we show that Endonuclease G, a mitochondrial nuclease responsible for nonspecific cleavage of nuclear DNA during apoptosis, can induce breaks at sequences associated with ‘9 bp deletion’ when it is present on a plasmid or in the mitochondrial genome. Through a series of in vitro and intracellular studies, we show that Endonuclease G binds to G-quadruplex structures formed at the hotspot and induces DNA breaks. Therefore, we uncover a new role for Endonuclease G in generating mtDNA deletions, which depends on the formation of G4 DNA within the mitochondrial genome. In summary, we identify a novel property of Endonuclease G, besides its role in apoptosis and the recently described ‘elimination of paternal mitochondria during fertilisation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tetraplexes</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial fragility</kwd><kwd>Endo G</kwd><kwd>double-strand breaks</kwd><kwd>MMEJ</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial deletion</kwd><kwd>G4 DNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>37(1692)/17/EMR-11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raghavan</surname><given-names>Sathees C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001502</institution-id><institution>Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21/01/2016-BRNS/35074</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raghavan</surname><given-names>Sathees C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR/3458/COE/34/33/2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raghavan</surname><given-names>Sathees C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>IISc-DBT partnership programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR27952-INF/22/212/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raghavan</surname><given-names>Sathees C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007780</institution-id><institution>Indian Institute of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dahal</surname><given-names>Sumedha</given-names></name><name><surname>Siddiqua</surname><given-names>Humaira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new role for Endonuclease G with respect to the generation of mtDNA deletions is identified, which is dependent on the formation of G4 DNA within human mitochondria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mitochondria are semiautonomous organelles with their genome. The mammalian mitochondrial genome encodes for 13 respiratory chain proteins, 22 tRNAs and 2 rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Butow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clayton, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holthöfer et al., 1999</xref>). Due to its vital role in oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial DNA is frequently exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is more prone to DNA damage than nuclear DNA, leading to the accumulation of 50 times more mutations, including deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hudson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Michikawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pakendorf and Stoneking, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yakes and Van Houten, 1997</xref>). Mitochondrial mutations have been associated with ageing and several disease conditions like myopathies, dystonia, cancer etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Taylor and Turnbull, 2005</xref>). These mutations include point mutations, mismatches, or deletions, which affect the coding of essential proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and the respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Penta et al., 2001</xref>). Mitochondrial mutations, especially large-scale deletions of 200–5000 bp, were associated with the progression of breast, colorectal, renal, and gastric cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianchi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carew and Huang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Modica-Napolitano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Penta et al., 2001</xref>). However, the correlation between mtDNA deletions and cancer remains unsettled. The well-studied phenotypes of mtDNA deletions are Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS), Pearson syndrome, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marni, 2003</xref>). Large stretches of deletions seen in different diseased patients suggest fragile sites in the mitochondrial genome similar to the fragile sites (FRA) sites of the nuclear DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Richards and Macaulay, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The FRA regions and other frequent chromosomal translocations have been observed in late replicating sites in the nuclear DNA, which are prone to replication fork stalling due to possible, stable secondary structure formation or inadvertent action of structure-specific nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dillon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Raghavan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sun et al., 2001</xref>). Mitochondrial DNA has its replication machinery that is not governed by cell cycle checkpoints. Therefore, it is likely that the formation of a secondary structure may account for observed mitochondrial fragility.</p><p>The presence of alternate DNA structures like G-quadruplex, triplex, and cruciform structures in the mitochondrial genome has been reported along with their association with different mitochondrial diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bharti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Damas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oliveira et al., 2013</xref>). Breakpoint regions reported in the case of PEO patients were in the proximity of G-quadruplex motifs, further suggesting the role of non-B DNA structures in mitochondrial disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bharti et al., 2014</xref>). G4 forming motifs were also located adjacent to mitochondrial deletion breakpoints associated with KSS, a clinical subgroup of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Van Goethem et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zeviani et al., 1988</xref>). Further, a G4 ligand RHPS4 preferentially localises to mitochondria and affects mitochondrial genome content, transcription elongation, and respiratory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falabella et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oliveira et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, in vitro results suggested that a single-base mutation in mtDNA (mt10251) was sufficient to form G4 DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, ATP-dependent G4 resolving helicase Pif1 could unfold non-B DNA structures and continue the synthesis by mitochondrial DNA polymerases, Pol γ and PrimPol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butler et al., 2020</xref>). However, further studies are required to confirm the presence of these structures in vivo and establish their contribution towards the mechanism of breakage and deletions.</p><p>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 9 bp deletion caused by loss of one copy of the 9 bp repeat sequence (CCCCCTCTA) in the intergenic region of cytochrome c oxidase II (COII)/tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> is one of the most common deletions in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Redd et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thomas et al., 1998</xref>). It has been associated with various diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Komandur et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krishnan and Turnbull, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhuo et al., 2010</xref>). The 9 bp deletion is also widely used as a phylogenetic marker to study evolutionary trends and migration of populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Soodyall et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yao et al., 2000</xref>). The occurrence of deletions in such high frequency indicates the fragility of the region; however, its mechanism is unclear.</p><p>Out of the large-scale mtDNA deletions reported, one of the well-studied examples is mt<sup>4977</sup>, and accumulation of it results in different mitochondrial disorders, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yusoff et al., 2019</xref>). mt<sup>4977</sup> eliminates mitochondrial sequences between 8470 and 13,447 bp, which include the removal of genes required for normal oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yen et al., 1991</xref>). Recently the role of replication slippage and DSB repair has been shown to play a role in the generation of mtDNA<sup>4977</sup> in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phillips et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the presence of a 13 bp direct repeat plays a major role in mt<sup>4977</sup>, as only one of the repeats was retained following joining, indicating the involvement of microhomology-mediated end joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Samuels et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Srivastava and Moraes, 2005</xref>). When restriction endonucleases were used to introduce DSBs, there was the accumulation of deletions, which further implicates the imperfect repair and deletion in the mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Srivastava and Moraes, 2005</xref>). A previous study from our laboratory suggested the existence of microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) in mitochondria, which operate in a microhomology-dependent manner, explaining the frequently seen deletions in mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tadi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate the mechanism of fragility associated with the most common deletion seen in the mitochondrial genome. The putative role of non-B DNA structures and the mechanism of DNA breakage associated with the formation of mtDNA deletions are extensively studied. We report that the region associated with 9 bp deletion can fold into a G-quadruplex DNA structure using various biochemical and ex vivo methods. For the first time, we show that Endonuclease G can specifically bind to the G-quadruplex structure and cleave the mtDNA. Finally, the joining of the broken DNA could lead to the formation of ‘9 bp deletion’ seen in human mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Previously, different non-B DNA motifs, including G4 DNA motifs have been reported in the mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Damas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dong et al., 2014</xref>). It was also suggested that alternate forms of DNA may play a role in the generation of deletions in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Damas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dong et al., 2014</xref>). In silico studies along with biochemical analyses revealed that 5 classical G4 DNA motifs are present in the mitochondrial genome, which could fold into G4 DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since ‘9 bp deletion’ (8271–8281) is the most frequent mitochondrial deletion and occurs next to one of the 5 G4 motifs with the coordinate position 8252–8295 (designated as mitochondrial Region I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahal et al., 2022</xref>), we have investigated the putative role of G4 DNA structure in DNA breakage and formation of the mtDNA deletions. Notably, the chosen G-quadruplex motif is also present in two other large-scale deletions associated with mitochondria.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Biochemical studies to investigate formation of G-quadruplex structure in Region I of the mitochondrial genome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence of the mitochondrial Region I with direct repeats and inverted repeats.

Radiolabelled oligomeric DNA was then subjected to electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay in the absence or presence of KCl. Faster mobility of the G-rich strand compared to its complementary C-rich strand suggested the formation of both intra and intermolecular G4 DNA structure in a KCl-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, the formation of intramolecular G4 DNA was abrogated when G-stretches were mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Further, circular dichroism (CD) studies revealed that the spectra exhibited the characteristic of a parallel G-quadruplex DNA with absorption maxima of 260–270 nm and absorption minima of 240 nm as opposed to the C-rich strand, which showed the maxima similar to that of a typical single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>DMS protection assay was performed to understand the precise base pairing of guanine nucleotides involved in the G4 plates compared to the ones within connecting loops that facilitate DNA strand folding and, thus, G-quadruplex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nambiar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nambiar et al., 2013</xref>). DMS methylates the N7 position of the guanine base, making it susceptible to subsequent piperidine cleavage. Since the N7 position of G residues forming the G4 plate is engaged upon Hoogsteen base pairing, these residues are protected from DMS treatment and piperidine cleavage. When the G-quadruplex sequences from mitochondrial Region I (G1) were subjected to DMS protection assay, following structure formation, we observed that most G residues in this region showed a significant reduction in cleavage, suggesting protection of these nucleotides from DMS. Based on the observed protection of guanine from DMS, we conclude that these guanines are indeed involved in Hoogsteen bonding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lane 2). The results suggest that the guanine residues from the G stretches of the mitochondrial Region I motif participate in G-quadruplex formation. Based on CD studies and gel shift assays, a parallel, intramolecular G-quadruplex structure was modelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, our study reinforces that the Region I of mitochondrial DNA can fold into an intramolecular G-quadruplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The G4 motif present in Region I of mtDNA can fold into a G-quadruplex structure when present on a plasmid DNA</title><p>In the context of double-stranded DNA, G-quadruplexes can form only when the Hoogsteen base pairing between the guanine residues is stronger than the Watson and Crick H-bonding required for duplex B-DNA formation. Therefore, the G-quadruplex forming ability of the mitochondrial Region I was tested after cloning into a plasmid, pDI1. Interestingly, an inverted repeat sequence (coordinate positions 8295–8363), which could fold into a cruciform DNA, was also present adjacent to the G4 motif. Thus, that was also part of pDI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further, to delineate the role of G4 DNA in the plasmid context, a mutant plasmid with a scrambled sequence corresponding to the G4 motif but with intact inverted repeats (pDI2) was also constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the formation of G4 DNA can lead to a pause during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nambiar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Voineagu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wells, 2009</xref>). To assess whether the G4 DNA formed at Region I of the mitochondrial genome can act as a replication pause, a primer extension assay was performed using pDI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). A sequencing ladder was also generated for mapping the location of the polymerase pause sites on the plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Results revealed multiple polymerase pause sites, and the intensity of the pauses increased with increasing concentrations of KCl (25, 50 and 100 mM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, there was significantly fewer sites and less pausing observed in the absence of KCl, indicating the absence of the formation of intramolecular G-quadruplex species in these cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 2). Considering that the formation of cruciform DNA occurs irrespective of the presence of KCl, these results also suggest that the observed pause was due to the formation of G4 DNA, but not cruciform DNA. Besides, the observed polymerase pauses mapped to the G-quadruplex motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 7–9). Abrogation of G4 DNA structure by mutation of G4 DNA motif (pDI2) resulted in the disappearance of the observed pause site, further confirming the above results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lanes 3, 4 and lane 6, 7). It was also observed that the appearance of strong polymerase pause sites were dependent on K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, lanes 4–5; F), but not on other monovalent cations such as Li<sup>+</sup> (with no or little G-quadruplex stabilising properties) or Na<sup>+</sup> (with limited stabilising properties) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, lanes 6–9; F) suggesting that the non-B DNA responsible for polymerase arrest was G4 DNA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Evaluation of formation of G-quadruplex DNA in Region I of the mitochondrial DNA when cloned into a plasmid.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing cloning of the mitochondrial Region I and its mutant to generate plasmids pDI1 and pDI2, respectively.

In the case of mitochondrial extract, additional proteins may bind to G4 DNA, thus preventing cleavage at multiple sites.

Purified Endonuclease G was allowed to bind to mitochondrial DNA isolated from Nalm6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and cross-linked. Sonicated mitochondrial DNA was incubated with anti-Endonuclease G and Protein A/G beads.

The threshold values presented as a bar diagram suggested that Endonuclease G can bind to all G quadruplex regions (GR1- GR5), including the one present at mitochondrial Region I, while the control regions (CR1-CR10) (not known to form canonical G quadruplex) did not bind to Endonuclease G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>).

Following the pull-down, beads were separated and loaded for protein analysis and western to confirm the pull-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The remaining was used for DNA isolation, followed by real-time and semiquantitative PCR. Results suggested the binding of Endonuclease G to G-quadruplex regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–E</xref>). Endonuclease G binding assay inside cells was performed to assess the binding of Endonuclease G to mitochondrial G4 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The antibody-bound mitochondrial DNA was used for real-time PCR to amplify the G quadruplex regions and control regions. Results showed specific amplification of G quadruplex regions and no amplification of control regions, suggesting the specificity of Endonuclease G to G quadruplex regions within the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>).</p><p>P1 nuclease assay was also performed to determine the binding footprint of Endonuclease G to G-quadruplex forming Region I by incubating the wild type and the mutant oligomers of Region I in the presence and absence of Endonuclease G. Interestingly, binding of Endonuclease G to G-rich strand (G1) partially rescued the sensitivity of P1 nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2B</xref>, lanes 5–8). In contrast, in the case of C-rich strands, mutants and random oligomers, such protection was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Although Endonuclease G was thought to be localised within the mitochondrial intermembrane space, its proximity to the mitochondrial matrix was supported by multiple experimental evidence suggesting a direct interaction of Endonuclease G with mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duguay and Smiley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDermott-Roe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wiehe et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, as a preliminary investigation, we were interested in testing the conditions in which Endonuclease G could be released to the mitochondrial soluble fraction from the inner mitochondrial membrane. To do this, HeLa cells were exposed to Menadione, a mitochondria-specific ROS inducer (25 µM, for 2 hr). Cells were harvested, and fractionation of mitochondria was performed. Fractionated extracts were equalized and used for western blotting studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Results showed that exposure to stress conditions resulted in elevated levels of Endonuclease G in the matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and B</xref>). However, this warrants further detailed investigation. Thus, we hypothesize that different stress conditions may regulate the release of Endonuclease G to mitochondrial matrix.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Investigation of stress conditions that favor the transport of Endonuclease G to mitochondrial matrix.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot showing the presence of Endonuclease G, Cytochrome C and TFAM in either total or supernatant (Sup) and pellet fraction with or without menadione treatment (25 µM) following sub-fractionation of mitochondrial compartments.

This could help the induce DNA breaks by Endonuclease G at Region I of the mitochondrial genome.

A close analysis of patient breakpoint regions revealed the presence of high-frequency mitochondrial deletion junctions (9 bp deletion) adjacent to one of the G-quadruplex structures at Region I.</p><p>The presence of G-quadruplex motifs proximal to mitochondrial deletions has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falabella et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Falabella et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oliveira et al., 2013</xref>). Computational analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bharti et al., 2014</xref>) revealed that G4 sequences proximal to mtDNA deletions in several genetic diseases like Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome, Mitochondrial myopathy, Progressive external ophthalmoplegia, etc. G4 motifs were also located adjacent to mitochondrial deletion breakpoints associated with KSS, a clinical subgroup of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies associated with these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Van Goethem et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zeviani et al., 1988</xref>). In the present study, we establish that the region containing ‘9 bp deletion’ can fold into G-quadruplex structures, as shown by EMSA and CD studies in a K+dependent manner. Using bisulphite modification assay, we showed that Region I could fold into a G4 DNA in the mitochondrial genome. Immunofluorescence studies and antibody pull-down assays using G4-specific antibody, BG4, provide further support for the occurrence of G4 quadruplex DNA structures within the cells. Thus, with the combinatorial use of in silico studies, and biophysical, biochemical and ex vivo techniques, we demonstrate the formation of G quadruplexes at the region corresponding to a 9 bp deletion in the mitochondrial genome.</p><p>The formation of intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structure in the mitochondrial genome could make the region fragile as there is an increased probability of replication fork slippage or transcription arrest at this region. The primer extension assay revealed multiple pause sites around the G4 motif, suggesting that polymerase arrest could occur at these structures. However, the deletions seen were precise and occurred in a particular sequence. Thus, an alternate possibility for generating a break at these structures could be due to recognition by structure-selective nucleases followed by cleavage at G4 DNA.</p><p>Studies have shown that a few enzymes possess the ability to cleave G-quadruplex structures. The action of RAGs at the G-quadruplex site in BCL2 MBR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Raghavan et al., 2004</xref>), MRE11 and DNA2 helicase on either side of the G-quadruplex structure in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Masuda-Sasa et al., 2008</xref>) being some of the examples. In the current study, we observed that the structure-selective nuclease activity of mitochondrial endonuclease G could induce cleavage at G4 DNA formed at Region I of the mitochondrial genome using both biochemical (primer extension with purified nucleases, mito-IP with purified Endonuclease G and isolated mitochondria, reconstitution assay with plasmid and purified protein) and ex vivo (immunofluorescence, mito-IP, reconstitution assay in mitochondria) assays. Previous studies have reported various other properties of Endonuclease G, which include the generation of primers during mitochondrial DNA replication by DNA polymerase γ, initiation of genomic inversion in herpes simplex type-1 virus (HSV-1), and its role during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Côté et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Parrish et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ruiz-Carrillo and Renaud, 1987</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian Endonuclease G is encoded in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gannavaram et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ohsato et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wiehe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>) and upon translocation to mitochondria, the mitochondrial targeting sequence is cleaved off such that a mature nuclease is released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">van Loo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wiehe et al., 2018</xref>). Generally, Endonuclease G is known to reside in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, although a low expression has been reported in the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duguay and Smiley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDermott-Roe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wiehe et al., 2018</xref>). Our preliminary results suggest that Endonuclease G may be further released to the matrix when cells are under stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>In a recent study, it has been shown that Endonuclease G also cleaved mtDNA in the case of unrepaired oxidative lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wiehe et al., 2018</xref>). This was helpful in compensatory mtDNA replication through TWINKLE and mtSSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wiehe et al., 2018</xref>). However, the binding of Endonuclease G to mtDNA and cleavage might be an event dependent upon various factors, including oxidative stress. Therefore, it is possible that in a typical cellular condition, the level of Endonuclease G in the matrix is low; however, upon stress, it is released into the matrix leading to genome fragility. Hence, the stress-induced release may act as a regulatory mechanism concerning the generation of mitochondrial deletions. A recent study showed the complete degradation property of Endonuclease G at pH 6, which could delineate its role during apoptosis, since apoptotic cells show cytosolic acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schäfer et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, at physiological pH, the enzyme showed the property of nuclease (converting supercoiled DNA to open circular and linear; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schäfer et al., 2004</xref>). CPS-6, a mitochondrial endonuclease G in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> acts with maternal autophagy and proteasome machinery to promote paternal mitochondrial elimination. It relocates from the intermembrane space of paternal mitochondria to the matrix after fertilisation to degrade mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Endog<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice revealed that Endonuclease G could act as a novel determinant of maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy, which is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDermott-Roe et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our study suggests that Endonuclease G can bind to G-quadruplexes and nick the DNA, resulting in single-strand breaks, which can be converted as double-strand breaks during replication or other DNA transactions. However, in low frequency, we could also see DSBs directly induced by Endonuclease G. We observed that the binding was specific to G4 DNA, as we did not observe nonspecific binding with regions where GC content was high in the mitochondrial genome. Previous studies have shown that although Endonuclease G showed random nuclease activity at higher concentrations, at optimal concentrations, it was specific to kink DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ohsato et al., 2002</xref>). The first study on Endonuclease G showed preference towards the guanine-rich strands, which falls in line with our study as the formation of G quadruplexes requires a G-rich region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ruiz-Carrillo and Renaud, 1987</xref>). Further, Endonuclease G cleaved mtDNA in unrepaired oxidative lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wiehe et al., 2018</xref>). It is likely that binding and cleavage by Endonuclease G on mtDNA be an event dependent on multiple factors, including oxidative stress. Based on our data, it is evident that in the presence of stress, levels of Endonuclease G go up in the matrix, which enables the protein to be present proximal to the mitochondrial genome. The findings from mito IP studies suggest that Endonuclease G only binds to the G-quadruplex forming regions and not to the other areas of mtDNA. This provides additional regulation and ensures the mitochondrial genome stability in most instances.</p><p>DNA repair in mitochondria is poorly understood. Base excision repair (BER) is the most well-characterized DNA repair pathway in mitochondria, while it is generally believed that nucleotide excision repair is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akbari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Souza-Pinto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Homologous recombination repair helps repair DSBs and, thus stability of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dahal et al., 2018</xref>), though classical NHEJ was undetectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tadi et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, microhomology-mediated end joining uses flanking direct repeats to fix DSBs and delete the sequences between the repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tadi et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the G quadruplex forming Region I is close to the deletion junction 8271:8281 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Redd et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yao et al., 2000</xref>) also had a 9 bp direct repeat sequence at the flank site.</p><p>In a recent study, a replication slippage-mediated mechanism was attributed to a common 4977 deletion where in frequent replication fork stalling at the junction of the common deletion was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phillips et al., 2017</xref>). While this is a replication-dependent process, what we observed may not be immediately connected to replication. However, it is possible that replication can indeed facilitate the formation of G-quadruplexes.</p><p>A balance between the formation and resolution of G4 DNA within the mitochondrial genome is essential. The mitochondrial genes are transcribed as a single polycistronic mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clayton, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sanchez et al., 2011</xref>) and therefore undergo a high transcription rate, which may promote G-quadruplex formation. Besides, random ‘breathing’ of DNA (a process of transient melting of the duplex structure due to thermal fluctuations) may also occur in the GC-rich sequences of the mitochondrial DNA promoting G-quadruplex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dornberger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jose et al., 2009</xref>). Once the structure is formed, G4 resolvases also play a critical role in its resolution. In the nuclear DNA context, resolvases like WRN and BLM helicase are considered as the factors that negatively regulate G4 DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Giri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Paeschke et al., 2013</xref>). However, such a role for these nucleases in mitochondria is not reported. TWINKLE helicase is known to unwind mitochondrial duplex DNA and regulate replication, although its role in structural resolution is yet to be studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phillips et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Hence, our study suggests a novel mechanism that explains fragility in mitochondria, dependent on the structure-selective nuclease activity of Endonuclease G on G-quadruplex DNA. The process could be controlled by cellular stress conditions, which may regulate the release of Endonuclease G to the mitochondrial matrix; however, this requires further extensive investigation. Although we have focused on a single example of ‘9 bp deletion’ often seen in mitochondria, it is very much possible that it may be a general mechanism and may help in explaining several other deletions seen in mitochondria-associated human disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Enzymes, chemicals, and reagents</title><p>Chemicals and reagents used in the present study were purchased from Millipore-Sigma (USA), SRL (India), Himedia (India), and Amresco (USA).

The complex was sonicated (VC 750, Ultrasonic processor) for 10 min with the pulse of 10 sec on/ 10 sec off and incubated at –80 °C for 8 h. 75 ng of Endonuclease G antibody (CST: 4969) was added and incubated at 4 °C (end to end rotation). A total of 15 µl protein A/G beads (Santa cruz, sc-2003) were added to the chromatin-antibody complex and incubated for 2 h. The supernatant was removed entirely, and beads were washed and eluted with high salt immune complex wash buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate) and incubated at 55 °C for 2 h. DNA protein interactions were reverse crosslinked by incubating the samples overnight at 65 °C. DNA was purified with phenol: chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carey et al., 2009</xref>). Endonuclease G pulled-down mitochondrial DNA and was subjected to semiquantitative and real-time PCR of different mitochondrial regions (five G-quadruplex forming regions and ten random control regions). Three independent reactions were performed, and the bar diagram represented threshold values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-29"><title>Mitochondrial IP (mito IP)</title><p>4X10<sup>7</sup> Nalm6 cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 <sup>o</sup>C for 15 min and quenched with 100 µl/ml of 1.375 M glycine. Mitochondria were then isolated from the cells as described above and lysed using buffer (5 mM PIPES, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP40). Lysed samples were then sonicated (Diagenode Bioruptor, Belgium) with 30 s on/ 45 s off pulse for 30 cycles. Sonicated samples were stored at −80 °C for at least 8 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carey et al., 2009</xref>). For immunoprecipitation, the samples were centrifuged at high speed for 15 min, and the supernatant was divided for input, secondary control and experimental. Relevant antibodies (Endonuclease G or BG4) were added to the sample and allowed to bind for 8–10 hr. Protein A/G-agarose beads (Sigma, USA) were added to the models and incubated for 2 hr. Samples were washed and eluted using high salt wash buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate) in repeated cycles of centrifugation and then reverse cross-linked by incubating overnight at 65 °C. Finally, DNA was purified following phenol: chloroform extraction and precipitation. The purified DNA was used for real time PCR amplification of different mitochondrial regions that either support formation of G-quadruplex structure or do not support any secondary structure formation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-30"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Immunofluorescence studies were performed as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dahal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kumari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ray et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tadi et al., 2016</xref>). Approximately 50,000 cells (HeLa, HEK293T, Rho(0), or MEF) were grown in the media for 24 hr, as described before. Cells were grown in chamber slides in MEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma) for 24 hr. The cells were stained with either 100 ng/ml of MitoTracker Red 580 (Invitrogen) or 100 ng/ml MitoTracker Green FM (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tadi et al., 2016</xref>). Cells were washed twice with 1 X PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (20 min) and permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 (5 min) at room temperature. BSA (0.1%) was used for blocking (30 min), and subsequently the cells were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at room temperature (4 hr). Appropriate FITC or Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies were used to detect the signal. After washing, the cells were stained with DAPI, mounted with DABCO (Sigma) and imaged under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 880 with ×63 magnifications or Olympus FLUOVIEW FV3000 with ×100 magnifications). The images were processed using either Zen Lite or FV31S-SW software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-31"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Every experiment was repeated multiple times with at least three biological repeats and presented. Based on the data obtained from repeats, Student’s t-test (two-tailed) was performed, and the error bars were calculated for the bar diagrams representing were the fold change value using GraphPad Prism ver 5.0. Error bars are shown depicting mean ± SEM (ns: not significant, *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.005, ***p&lt;0.0001). Colocalisation analysis in immunofluorescence assay was done using JaCoP in ImageJ software. The values were plotted in GraphPad Prism 5.0, and the significance was calculated using the same. The values were obtained for at least 50–100 cells per sample.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Indian National Law on animal care and use.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sergei Mirkin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript makes interesting observations that should advance the field of mitochondrial DNA metabolism and will be off interest for researchers in the field of mitochondrial genome stability and mitochondrial diseases.</p><p>The revision that is needed to make this manuscript, as submitted, publishable is too extensive. If the authors decide to address the comments by the additional experimentation needed, they are invited to resubmit a revised manuscript as a new submission that I would be happy to handle as BRE and seek to have the same reviewers evaluate the new submission.</p><p>Alternatively, the authors may want to consider tightening the manuscript and omit the reconstitution studies making sure that their interpretations are supported by the data and consider alternative mechanisms, when necessary. This more focused version would still contain sufficient new insights and allow the authors to further develop the reconstitution experiments with the required exhaustive separate incubation controls for a future publication.</p><p>1) Independent of specific criticism towards individual experiments or experimental tools, the manuscript is difficult to read, poorly assembled and would need a major overhaul in the text and figures. The text requires careful editing, there are many disagreements, and many cases where referrals such as 'its' or 'this' are unclear. The figures should be labeled that the experiments can be understood independent of the legend or method description. A few examples are given here.</p><p>• Figure 1A: The sequences of C1 and G1 are needed here. Giving more is confusing, as they do not relate to the figure. In Figure S1, all oligo sequences should be listed.</p><p>• Figure S1A: Define -/+ KCl under gel in legend.</p><p>• Figure S1B: Indicate inverted repeat sequences.</p><p>• Figure S3C: Where are the gel data? What is shown here? The description in the legend does not allow to understand the figure, what is the difference between the 3 lanes that are labeled as +.</p><p>• Figure S3: Unclear what the Westernblots show in D, F, and H.</p><p>• Figure S5F: Define the lanes. What is loaded in lane 4?</p><p>• Figure 4D: Label upper input and lower pull-down, also Figure 2G.</p><p>2) A key problem in the manuscript is that the authors mix their interpretation into the description of the results. A few examples are given here, but the authors should check the entire manuscript and correct this issue. The authors should carefully separate description of the results from their interpretation and refrain from overinterpreting their data (see also below). There is no need to overstate the result; exceptions or unexpected results must be discussed and acknowledged. For example:</p><p>• Figure 2F/G: What happened with CR7? Low threshold value but no PCR product? This is not described in the text.</p><p>• Figure 3D: The upper cleavage site stays the same, unlike what is described in the text.</p><p>• Figure S3A, B: It is unclear which band is EndoG. Is the Westernblot aligned with material loaded in slots 4-7 of the protein-stained gel? If so, why does the Westernblot intensity not reflect the staining intensity?</p><p>• Figure 3F: The Mt extract does only show the major EndoG sites but not the minor sites, which add up to a significant proportion of the products.</p><p>• Page 10, line 10: The mutant plasmid still has one cleavage site, cleavage is not abrogated as stated in the text.</p><p>• Page 10, line 22: Figure 3D is extract not purified EndoG as stated in line 22 of page 10.</p><p>• Figure 4E and F: What is the difference between both experiments? E: extract, F: cells? This could be clarified in the figure and text.</p><p>• Figure S5G: The description of the P1 results is not precise. There is clear protection of the C strand by EndoG in the upper third of the ladder.</p><p>• Figure 7A requires more description and quantitation. Figure 7 B/E: Why is the DAPI signal so variable? Figure 7G: the difference between lanes 1-3 and 4-6 should become apparent from the figure. For Figure 7G and H, only menadione data are shown, there are no IR data as stated in the text.</p><p>3) The BG4 antibody is problematic. Page 8, line 22: Why is there a BG4 signal in the cytoplasm in rho (0) cells? Is this also seen in rho (+) cells?</p><p>Also, the authors may want to discuss in more details image modification via Coste's mask. I can clearly see yellow dots in merged images for rho (0) cells, but somehow they are not converting to the white dotes when the Coste's mask is applied.</p><p>Figure 2 and 4: There are many BG4 signals? Do the signals all represent G4 tetraplex DNA? How can the authors ascertain the specificity and usefulness of this reagent?</p><p>The control in Figure 4A/B needs to be defined. What would be expectation from random overlap in this experiment given that both signals are very abundant?</p><p>4) The microscopy approach is less informative and overinterpreted. The level of resolution obtained with the confocal microscope approach used does not allow a conclusion on the localization beyond saying that the protein is present in the mitochondria and is not suitable for distinguishing the different mitochondrial compartments. As for the fractionation procedure used, I am not sure that it allows the separation of the matrix fraction from the intermembrane compartment. Furthermore, the description of the results displayed is not clear and there seem to be some mistakes in the labelling of the figures, making it harder to draw clear conclusions.</p><p>5) The mutant substrates are an excellent control for testing the G4 tetraplex hypothesis. What is the experimental evidence that these mutant oligonucleotides do not form tetraplexes?</p><p>6) The attempt to reconstruct the deletion formation in vitro is welcomed. However, these experiments lack a crucial control. In Figure 5B, there is product in the negative control? This raises the concern that bands labeled MMEJ products are PCR artifacts. The authors must conduct a separate incubation control by incubating both oligos separately with extracts, extract the DNA, mix, and then perform PCR detection to ascertain that bands labeled as products are formed during the extract incubation and not PCR artifacts. The recombination literature is replete with this artifact, and it must be eliminated here.</p><p>The separate incubation controls are also needed for the experiments with mt plasmid DNA and mitochondrial genomics DNA in Figure 5F and Figure S6.</p><p>In their exploration of the mechanisms leading to deletions, the data presented supports their model invoking MMEJ, at least for the in vitro system as shown by the sequencing of the deletions obtained either with the plasmid or with mitochondrial DNA. When mitochondrial DNA was used, however, it would seem that mutations in that region accumulate but they are not associated with deletions, which are proportionally less abundant than in the plasmid system. This finding merits more discussion.</p><p>The authors hypothesize that MMEJ repair of the DNA break caused by the endonuclease G produces the 9 bp-deletion. If this is the case, why just one out of four repeats is always deleted? Further, the authors may want to tone down their MMEJ model, since no direct evidence for this mechanism is provided. Other mechanisms, such as nick-repair can potentially lead to the same outcome.</p><p>7) Page 13, lines 20/21: Give the exact numbers for 'few' and 'many others'.</p><p>8) The EndoG nuclease experiments and conclusion that EndoG is responsible for the observed cleavages, would be strengthened by purifying a catalytic mutant of EndoG and showing dependance of cleavage on the EndoG active site. This is a standard control for the nuclease field.</p><p>9) The discussion is not well organized and should include an evaluation what the possible physiological function of the observation of EndoG release upon oxidative stress and deletion formation might be. Are these off-pathway accidents?</p><p>Is there a role of EndoG on G4 RNA tetraplexes? This refers also to the point about the BG4 antibody; does it recognize G4 RNA?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Unleashing a Novel Function of Endonuclease G in Mitochondrial Genome Instability&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The manuscript makes interesting observations that should advance the field of mitochondrial DNA metabolism and will be off interest for researchers in the field of mitochondrial genome stability and mitochondrial diseases.</p><p>The revised manuscript is much improved, although there are number of points that should be addressed in a final revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript still requires some language editing.</p><p>2) Page 6, line 33: Overstatement, there are some pause site w/o KCl; change to significantly fewer sites and less pausing.</p><p>3) Figure 2 D: Primer DI12 is too inefficient to be meaningful. A new primer would be needed to make the point. The question is whether these data are needed in light of the mutant control?</p><p>4) Page 10, line 24-27 and Figure 6E: Make an additional mutant to test the prediction of the origin of the second remaining band.</p><p>5) Some points concerning the localisation of the protein in the mitochondria sub-fractions and its proposed recruitment to the matrix are still not convincing (please see specific comments below). There are enough novel data to justify its publication even without including the above-mentioned aspects, or if they are only presented as preliminary data to propose a hypothesis. The discussion should be amended to reflect that.</p><p>• Line 372: The fact that EndoG is present in mitochondria was already documented by several papers. It is not clear where the novelty is in this Results section. Furthermore, the title mentions TFAM as an inner membrane protein, which is not the case. As mentioned in the text, although TFAM is found associated with the membrane, it is a matrix protein. The low level of co-localisation and the limited resolution of the microscope used make do not allow to conclude much beyond the already known presence of Endo G in mitochondria. More detailed localisation studies would require electron microscopy or super resolution microscopy.</p><p>• Line 396: Based on the same arguments used above, the results described in the first paragraph of this section do not add much. The resolution of the images does not allow to conclude the presence of Endo G at G-quadruplexes through the co-localisation with the BG4 antibody. However, the PCR experiments provide evidence for that.</p><p>• The sub-mitochondrial fractionation described does not correspond to the references cited. In both papers cited there is a first step is a hypotonic shock that would yield a pellet of mitoplasts that can then be separated into inner membrane and matrix fractions. Here the fractionation is directly done in high salt and, to my understanding there is no an intermediate step allowing to get rid of the intermembrane fraction or the outer membrane.</p><p>There is all along an ambiguity regarding the localisation of EndoG. As mentioned by the authors the protein is normally found in the intermembrane space, therefore, the majority of it should be found in the soluble fraction with their fractionation protocol or lost if they use the hypotonic one. However, they find a substantial fraction in the membrane (inner or total?) fraction and this fraction does not decrease upon treatment while the soluble does. The question is then, where does the newly soluble protein come from?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Unleashing a Novel Function of Endonuclease G in Mitochondrial Genome Instability&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) There is still a contradiction in the section describing the localisation of EndoG within the mitochondria. The title of that section (page 11) is &quot;Endonuclease G is expressed in mitochondria and colocalises with inner mitochondria membrane protein TFAM within the cells&quot;. However, based on the experiments described in the text that follows and shown in Figure 8, the authors conclude that it colocalises with TFAM which they define as &quot;a transcription factor known to be present in the mitochondrial matrix&quot;.</p><p>2) As described the protocol for mitochondrial fractionation still does not provide a separation of the inner membrane from the outer one, nor does it separate the intermembrane space from the matrix (unless the description omitted a centrifugation step after the hypotonic shock). If this is the case the authors should be more careful in their statements and mention in the text on page 13, as they did in Figure 10, that what they are looking at is the partial release from the membrane to the soluble fractions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69916.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript makes interesting observations that should advance the field of mitochondrial DNA metabolism and will be off interest for researchers in the field of mitochondrial genome stability and mitochondrial diseases.</p><p>The revision that is needed to make this manuscript, as submitted, publishable is too extensive.

Low threshold value but no PCR product? This is not described in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>When sequence of the region spanning CR7 was analysed for potential G4 motifs, we observed sequence that may support formation of 2 plate G4 structure. This could explain the observed binding of BG4 during semiquantitative PCR. However, the threshold value was based on real time PCR which is highly sensitive when compared to semiquantitative PCR. This could be the reason for absence of a band in the CR7.

It may be that multiple molecules of purified Endonuclease G may bind to different forms of G4 DNA resulting in cleavage at different positions. In the case of mitochondrial extract, there may be additional proteins, which can bind to G4 DNA, thus preventing cleavage at multiple sites. This has been now added in Page 11, lines 14-20.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Page 10, line 10: The mutant plasmid still has one cleavage site, cleavage is not abrogated as stated in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Although, 2 of the G-stretches are mutated, Region I still can fold into a G-quadruplex, thus one of the cleavage sites is not abrogated.

Is this also seen in rho (+) cells?</p></disp-quote><p>BG4 binds to G-quadruplexes of nuclear DNA and RNA in cytoplasm (Biffi et al., 2014; Biffi et al., 2013). All the BG4 outside nucleus is not only because of G4 DNA in mitochondria, but also due to RNA G4 in the cytoplasm (Biffi et al., 2014). We have used mitotracker to indicate the mitochondria. Recently, we have also extensively investigated the specificity of BG4 towards G4 DNA (Javadekar et al., 2020). The BG4 signal in the cytoplasm is also seen in rho (+) cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the authors may want to discuss in more details image modification via Coste's mask.

Besides, recently 2 plate G-quadruplexes and involvement of GNG motifs were reported during G-quadruplex structure formation (Biffi et al., 2013; Das et al., 2016). If one considers all these into account, ~2% of the genome may support the formation of G-quadruplexes in human genome. Thus, the number of BG4 signals can be justified in the nucleus. Within mitochondria 5 canonical G4 motifs (Dahal et al., 2022) and &gt;200 number of 2 plate G-quadruplexes (Brázda et al., 2019) have been reported. Considering that several mtDNA are present in one mitochondrion and several mitochondria are present in one cell, impact can be several fold. In addition to that RNA G4 structures have also been reported in cytoplasm (Biffi et al., 2014; Biffi et al., 2013).</p><p>The specificity and usefulness of the reagent has been extensively shown in the previous studies (Biffi et al., 2013; Das et al., 2016; Javadekar et al., 2020)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The microscopy approach is less informative and overinterpreted.

The question is whether these data are needed in light of the mutant control?</p></disp-quote><p>As rightly pointed out by the reviewer, the efficacy of primer (DI12) binding is inefficient, and this data does not add up significantly to the overall content of Figure 2. Thus, we have removed the panel from figure 2 and reorganised the rest of the figure (Revised Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Page 10, line 24-27 and Figure 6E: Make an additional mutant to test the prediction of the origin of the second remaining band.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have now generated a new mutant to test the predicted basis of the second band and presented it as Figure 6-supplement figure 1. Results showed that upon generation of additional mutants, the second band, due to cleavage, disappeared. This further confirms the involvement of G4 DNA during the observed nicking (Page 10, lines 23-26).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Some points concerning the localisation of the protein in the mitochondria sub-fractions and its proposed recruitment to the matrix are still not convincing (please see specific comments below). There are enough novel data to justify its publication even without including the above-mentioned aspects, or if they are only presented as preliminary data to propose a hypothesis. The discussion should be amended to reflect that.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and as suggested, the immunolocalisation data showing the recruitment of Endonuclease G to the matrix is now removed from Figure 10. However, we have maintained sub-fractionation data as a preliminary observation (Figure 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Line 372: The fact that EndoG is present in mitochondria was already documented by several papers. It is not clear where the novelty is in this Results section. Furthermore, the title mentions TFAM as an inner membrane protein, which is not the case. As mentioned in the text, although TFAM is found associated with the membrane, it is a matrix protein. The low level of co-localisation and the limited resolution of the microscope used make do not allow to conclude much beyond the already known presence of Endo G in mitochondria. More detailed localisation studies would require electron microscopy or super resolution microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comments that the conclusion on sub-localisation based on the standard microscopy technique may not be sufficient to make the point. Thus, we have removed the immunofluorescence figures related to the localisation of EndoG to different mitochondrial compartments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Line 396: Based on the same arguments used above, the results described in the first paragraph of this section do not add much. The resolution of the images does not allow to conclude the presence of Endo G at G-quadruplexes through the co-localisation with the BG4 antibody. However, the PCR experiments provide evidence for that.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. We agree that the results described do not add much and the presence of BG4 cannot be concluded based on only colocalization with BG4. However, as stated, since we have other experiments (PCR-based ChIP) to evaluate the same question, we have maintained the data in the manuscript (Figures 4 and 9A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The sub-mitochondrial fractionation described does not correspond to the references cited. In both papers cited there is a first step is a hypotonic shock that would yield a pellet of mitoplasts that can then be separated into inner membrane and matrix fractions. Here the fractionation is directly done in high salt and, to my understanding there is no an intermediate step allowing to get rid of the intermembrane fraction or the outer membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for not providing a detailed protocol. As mentioned in Sinha et al., we first performed the hypotonic shock to yield mitoplasts and separated them into inner membrane and matrix fractions (Sinha et al., 2010, Hum Mol Genet, vol 19, page 1248-1262; Suzuki et al., 2002, J Cell Sci, vol 115, pages 1895-1905). Accordingly, we have rewritten the section by providing sufficient detail to avoid ambiguity (Page 20, lines 24-32).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is all along an ambiguity regarding the localisation of EndoG. As mentioned by the authors the protein is normally found in the intermembrane space, therefore, the majority of it should be found in the soluble fraction with their fractionation protocol or lost if they use the hypotonic one. However, they find a substantial fraction in the membrane (inner or total?) fraction and this fraction does not decrease upon treatment while the soluble does. The question is then, where does the newly soluble protein come from?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there has been ambiguity in the sublocalization of EndoG. While there are few papers suggesting the localization to inner membrane (David et al., 2006 Cell Death Differ;13(7):1147-55,Ishihara and Shimamoto (2006) JBC; 281, (10): 6726 –6733) others suggest its presence in the inner membrane space (Ohsato et al., 2002 Eur. J. Biochem.269, 5765–5770, Zhou et al., 2016 Science 353 (6297):394-9, Davies et al., 2003 Nucleic acids Res. 31(4): 1364–1373). With the protocol that we have used (the hypotonic method), if it was present only in the inner membrane space, Endo G would have been completely lost. However, further investigation is required to comment on this aspect.</p><p>We apologise for the ambiguity of quantification. We have now re-quantified the western blots and presented it as Figure 10B.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) There is still a contradiction in the section describing the localisation of EndoG within the mitochondria. The title of that section (page 11) is &quot;Endonuclease G is expressed in mitochondria and colocalises with inner mitochondria membrane protein TFAM within the cells&quot;. However, based on the experiments described in the text that follows and shown in Figure 8, the authors conclude that it colocalises with TFAM which they define as &quot;a transcription factor known to be present in the mitochondrial matrix&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this and apologize for the error. We have now corrected the title section on page 12, lines 1, 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As described the protocol for mitochondrial fractionation still does not provide a separation of the inner membrane from the outer one, nor does it separate the intermembrane space from the matrix (unless the description omitted a centrifugation step after the hypotonic shock). If this is the case the authors should be more careful in their statements and mention in the text on page 13, as they did in Figure 10, that what they are looking at is the partial release from the membrane to the soluble fractions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now edited the text to avoid the discrepancy (page 13, line 31).</p></body></sub-article></article>
