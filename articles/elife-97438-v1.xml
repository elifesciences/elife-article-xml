mechanisms underlying this link remain uncertain. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the histone deacetylase Sir2 is required for both transcriptional silencing and late replication at the repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays. We have previously reported that in the absence of <italic>SIR2</italic>, a de-repressed RNA PolII repositions MCM replicative helicases from their loading site at the ribosomal origin, where they abut well-positioned, high-occupancy nucleosomes, to an adjacent region with lower nucleosome occupancy. By developing a method that can distinguish activation of closely spaced MCM complexes, here we show that the displaced MCMs at rDNA origins have increased firing propensity compared to the nondisplaced MCMs. Furthermore, we found that both activation of the repositioned MCMs and low occupancy of the adjacent nucleosomes critically depend on the chromatin remodeling activity of <italic>FUN30</italic>. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which Sir2 delays replication timing, and it demonstrates, for the first time, that activation of a specific replication origin in vivo relies on the nucleosome context shaped by a single chromatin remodeler.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Sir2</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>chromatin remodeling enzyme</kwd><kwd>Fun30</kwd><kwd>silencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM117446</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedalov</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Precocious ribosomal DNA replication in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants requires Fun30.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>SIR2</italic> is the founding member of a family of NAD-dependent protein deacylases called sirtuins, which have important effects on transcription, replication, chromatin structure, and metabolism in organisms from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Houtkooper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shahgaldi and Kahmini, 2021</xref>). <italic>SIR2</italic> was initially identified in budding yeast in 1979 on the basis of its role in transcriptional repression at the silent mating type loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haber and George, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klar et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rine et al., 1979</xref>), and it was therefore dubbed a ‘<underline>S</underline>ilent <underline>I</underline>nformation <underline>R</underline>egulator’. The silent mating type loci are heterochromatic regions that contain nontranscribed copies of the small open reading frames that determine yeast mating type, and deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> not only activates their transcription but also abolishes their heterochromatic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ivy et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rine and Herskowitz, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weiss and Simpson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ravindra et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haber, 2012</xref>). It was later discovered that, in addition to regulating transcription at the silent mating type loci, Sir2 also regulates DNA replication, and it does so not only at the silent mating type loci but also at the two other heterochromatic regions of the yeast genome, namely at telomeres and the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pasero et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoshida et al., 2014</xref>). It is this last activity of Sir2, namely its effect on replication at the rDNA, that is the focus of this report.</p><p>The rDNA, which encodes the structural RNA components of the ribosome, is composed of approximately 150 tandemly arranged 9.1 kb repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Woolford and Baserga, 2013</xref>). At almost 1.4 megabases, the rDNA is too large to be replicated passively, and thus it must contain its own origins of replication. This is achieved by the organization shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>: The ribosomal RNAs are produced as two major species, known as the 35S and 5S, which are transcribed by RNA PolI and RNA PolIII, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fernández-Pevida et al., 2015</xref>). Between the 5' ends of these genes is an origin of replication, and immediately to the left of this origin is a short Sir2-repressed RNA PolII-transcribed noncoding transcript called C-pro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kobayashi and Ganley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vasiljeva et al., 2008</xref>), which we will discuss further below.

Each repeat encodes both the 35S and 5S ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), which are transcribed by RNA polymerase I (PolI) and RNA polymerase III (PolIII), respectively. The ribosomal origin of replication (rARS) is located between the 5' ends of these genes. The C-pro transcript, which is suppressed by Sir2, initiates approximately 200 base pairs from the rARS.

The double-hexameric MCM helicase complex, MCM2-7, is depicted in purple, and nucleosomes are in blue. Cleavage is induced by addition of calcium to permeabilized cells.

Replicative lifespan in budding yeast is defined as the number of daughter cells that a mother cell is able to produce and is therefore a measure of a cell’s replicative capacity at birth. By measuring lifespan in segregants from a cross between two genetically diverse strains of yeast, Kwan et al. were able to identify a point mutation at the rARS that (1) decreased origin activity at the rDNA; (2) increased origin activity elsewhere in the genome; and (3) prolonged replicative lifespan. They interpreted these results as reflecting competition for replication resources between the origins in two distinct compartments of the nucleus, namely the heterochromatic repetitive nucleolus or rDNA and the nonrepetitive sequences that make up the bulk of the yeast genome. This competition is exacerbated by the perturbation of nucleolar heterochromatin caused by the absence of <italic>SIR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoshida et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foss et al., 2017</xref>). Most replication outside of the rDNA initiates from approximately 300 replication origins, and thus the 150 origins at the rDNA make up approximately one-third of total origins. Increased replication resources directed toward the rDNA might therefore be expected to create a significant strain on replication in the rest of the genome.</p><p>Replication origins are known to compete for limiting resources at the level of origin firing. Broadly speaking, replication origin activity is regulated at two levels, namely origin licensing and origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Remus and Diffley, 2009</xref>). Origin licensing refers to loading of the replicative helicase in G1, and only origins that have been licensed are capable of being used in the subsequent S phase. Licensing occurs when an origin recognition complex, Orc1-6, that is bound to an 11–17 base pair so-called ARS consensus sequence (ACS) within the origin loads two hexameric helicases, each consisting of a ring of subunits, MCM2-7, that encircles the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Francis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell and Botchan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deegan and Diffley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis et al., 2022</xref>). The mechanism by which Orc recognizes origins and loads an MCM double-hexamer has been elucidated in great detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa and Diffley, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu and Stillman, 2023</xref>). DNA replication initiates from only a subset of these licensed origins, namely those where the helicase complex is activated, a process referred to as origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rhind and Gilbert, 2013</xref>). Origin firing is triggered by activation of two kinase signaling pathways, DDK and CDK, which then cause each hexameric MCM helicase to encircle a single strand of DNA and track in opposite directions in front of the replisome, thereby establishing bidirectional replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duncker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Firing factors are not present in sufficient quantities to activate all licensed origins simultaneously, and thus origins are activated in waves, with firing factors being recycled until the entire genome has been replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mantiero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>). Determining the criteria by which origins are prioritized for activation remains an area of active research.</p><p>Importantly, if the competition between the origins at the rDNA and those in the rest of the genome is tilted in favor of the rDNA, either by a point mutation in the rARS or by deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic>, replication gaps between distantly spaced origins outside of the rDNA persist late into S phase, and genome duplication may remain incomplete when the cell enters mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foss et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the observation that weakening the rARS by a point mutation can suppress the short replicative lifespan characteristic of <italic>sir2</italic> mutants suggests that these replication gaps may be the ultimate cause of ‘replicative death’. Teleologically, one can rationalize the prioritization of replication of the unique areas of the genome over the repetitive and heterochromatic areas, because (1) there are mechanisms available for repair in repetitive regions, like single-strand annealing, that are not available in unique regions, and they may therefore be able to survive lesions created when mitosis precedes the completion of replication; and (2) the cell is able to tolerate variation in copy number at the rDNA, but not deletion of protein-coding sequences in unique regions. Consistent with this view of the utility of assigning a low priority to replication of repetitive sequence, heterochromatic regions are also late replicating in mammalian cells, and disease states have been associated with disruption of this pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donley and Thayer, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Despite its biological importance, the mechanism by which Sir2 suppresses replication initiation is poorly understood. Clues to Sir2’s role in replication may be gleaned from its role in transcription, although here, too, our understanding is limited. Sir2’s ability to repress transcription at the silent mating type loci has been postulated to follow from its role in chromatin compaction. Experiments demonstrating <italic>SIR2</italic>-dependent protection of heterochromatin from digestion with endonucleases or methylation by bacterial DNA methyltransferases support the notion that DNA in heterochromatin is generally less accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gottschling, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singh and Klar, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Loo and Rine, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ansari and Gartenberg, 1999</xref>). Thus, a widely publicized model attributes Sir2’s ability to inhibit transcription to blocking access of RNA PolII to the DNA, although a simple model of indiscriminate steric occlusion cannot account for this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Widom, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lynch and Rusche, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kitada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bondra and Rine, 2023</xref>). Whether Sir2’s effect on replication is similarly the result of chromatin compaction limiting access to enzymes involved in DNA metabolism is not known.</p><p>A study examining the distribution of MCM helicase complexes at the rDNA suggests that, rather than a global manifestation of lack of accessibility of the rDNA, the early activation of replication at the rDNA in the absence of Sir2 may reflect a more localized phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Foss et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, MCM binding was assessed at nucleotide-level resolution by fusing a subunit of MCM to micrococcal nuclease (MNase), a technique known as chromatin endogenous cleavage, or ‘ChEC’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schmid et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zentner et al., 2015</xref>). Permeabilization of cells with detergent followed by the addition of calcium activates MNase, thereby generating approximately 65 base pair fragments of DNA under MCM double-hexamers that can be identified by high-throughput sequencing. This analysis revealed that, while deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> did not elicit an obvious change in the overall levels of licensing at the rDNA, it led to a dramatic redistribution of MCM helicase complexes: In WT cells, the helicase complexes are located almost exclusively immediately adjacent to a high-occupancy well-positioned nucleosome approximately 130 base pairs to the left of the ACS. In contrast, the MCM complexes in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants are largely displaced to the right into an area with lower nucleosome occupancy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This displacement appears to be caused by the de-repression of C-pro transcription in the absence of <italic>SIR2</italic>, which results in RNA PolII pushing the MCM double-hexamer into the relatively nucleosome-free region. This observation is provocative in light of studies demonstrating that the arrangement of MCM-proximal nucleosomes can have a dramatic effect on MCM activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azmi et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, by using chromatin remodeling enzymes (CREs) to create a variety of nucleosomal arrangements on an origin-containing fragment of DNA, Azmi et al. demonstrated that activation of an MCM double-hexamer loaded at that origin could be inhibited by nucleosomes arranged by specific CREs. In another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chacin et al., 2023</xref>), a mutant version of Orc1 that retains the ability to load MCM but alters phasing of MCM adjacent nucleosomes was shown to inhibit DNA replication in vivo and in vitro, consistent with a critical role for nucleosome organization at origins in the initiation of replication.</p><p>Taken together, the observations above led us to hypothesize that (1) relocation of MCM helicases from regions of high nucleosome occupancy to nearby regions of low nucleosome occupancy promotes early activation of replication origins in <italic>sir2</italic>; (2) this local difference in nucleosome occupancy is the result of modulation of nucleosomal architecture by one or more CREs; and therefore (3) screening CREs for the ability to suppress the early rDNA replication phenotype in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants might allow us to identify the relevant CRE. In this report, we show that the displaced MCM complexes fire before their nondisplaced counterpart and that increased nucleosome occupancy near the displaced MCMs in the absence of Fun30 CRE suppresses their early activation. This is the first in vivo demonstration of the modulation of an origin activity by a specific chromatin remodeler in vivo, and has implications for the broader relationship between transcription and replication timing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Fun30</italic> chromatin remodeling activity is required for early rDNA replication in <italic>sir2</italic> mutant</title><p>To identify CREs required for the early replication of the rDNA in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants, we needed a method to determine replication timing, and for this we turned to S-seq. In this widely used technique, G1 and S phase populations of cells from a log phase culture are sorted using flow cytometry and their DNA subjected to genomic sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batrakou et al., 2020</xref>). Replication timing can then be inferred from read depths in the S phase fraction, because regions that replicate early in S phase will be present in two copies in most cells, while regions that replicate late will be present mostly as a single copy. S phase read depths are normalized to those in G1 to account for differences in DNA copy numbers, which is particularly important for repetitive loci whose copy number can vary, such as rDNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which depicts the S-seq profile of chromosome 12, relative replication timing (Trel) values using this approach typically range from 1.4 to 0.8 for early- and late-replicating regions, respectively, with a value of 1 indicating that a locus replicates at the same time as the genome-wide average (see Materials and methods for specific calculation). The late replication of the rDNA, defined as coordinates 450,000–470,000 on chrXII, in WT is reflected in a Trel value of 0.89, whereas this ratio increases to 1.2 upon deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

To evaluate the effect of <italic>FUN30</italic> on rDNA origin activation independently of rDNA size, we generated an isogenic set of strains in a <italic>fob1</italic> background, all of which contain ~30 copies of the rDNA repeats. (Deletion of <italic>FOB1</italic> is necessary to stabilize rDNA copy number.) Comparing rDNA origin activity in <italic>sir2</italic> vs <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> genotypes, we observed a robust and reproducible reduction in rDNA origin activity upon <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This finding confirms that the <italic>FUN30</italic> suppresses rDNA origin firing in <italic>sir2</italic> background independently of both rDNA size and <italic>FOB1</italic> status.</p><p>We and others have previously shown that deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> not only advances replication at the rDNA but also retards replication elsewhere in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kwan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoshida et al., 2014</xref>). The absence of <italic>SIR2</italic> has been linked to decreased activation of less robust early replication origins, likely due to their heightened sensitivity to overall levels of replication-initiating factors. To ascertain the specificity of the interaction between <italic>FUN30</italic> and <italic>SIR2</italic>, we investigated whether deleting <italic>FUN30</italic> also mitigates the delayed activation of weak early origins in a <italic>sir2</italic> mutant background. We focused on the activation of ARS305, an origin we previously identified as delayed in a <italic>sir2</italic> mutant using 2D gel analysis. Overall, the comparison of origin activity at ARS305, measured as bubble arc to 1N signal, with that at rDNA demonstrates a reciprocal relationship between activity at ARS305 and rDNA across the four genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As seen previously, deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> suppresses ARS305, whereas additional deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> increased activity close to that of WT. Deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> in a <italic>SIR2</italic> background also showed a trend of increased origin activation, though this difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>Delayed initiation of genomic origins following <italic>SIR2</italic> deletion has been previously demonstrated on a global scale as a decline in the incorporation of a labeled uridine analogue, bromodeoxyuridine, at weak early origins in <italic>sir2</italic> cells compared to WT cells upon their release from G1 into HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoshida et al., 2014</xref>). We employed a similar approach to investigate whether the deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> mitigates this effect, utilizing a different labeled nucleotide, ethynyl-deoxy-uridine (EdU), which can be isolated through click chemistry rather than immunoprecipitation. WT, <italic>sir2</italic>, <italic>sir2 fun30</italic>, and <italic>fun30</italic> cells engineered for the uptake and phosphorylation of the analogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Viggiani and Aparicio, 2006</xref>) were arrested in G1 using alpha factor and collected 60 min after release into medium containing HU and EdU. DNA extracted from these cells was sonicated and subjected to click chemistry with biotin azide to covalently link biotin to EdU incorporated into DNA. Biotinylated DNA was then purified and sequenced. The impact of <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>FUN30</italic> status on replication timing was assessed by graphing the EdU signal at 111 early origins in WT cells on the x-axis against the signal in <italic>sir2</italic>, <italic>fun30</italic>, and <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> cells on the y-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Similar to observations with BrdU, we noted reduced EdU incorporation at a subset of early origins in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants, coupled with increased EdU incorporation at rDNA origins. Deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> in a <italic>sir2</italic> background partially restored EdU incorporation at early origins, concomitant with reduced EdU incorporation at rDNA origins. In particular, the median value of log<sub>10</sub> of read depths at 111 early origins, as the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, dropped from 6.5 for WT to 6.2 for <italic>sir2</italic> but then returned almost to WT levels (6.4) in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic>. The p-value obtained by Student’s t test, comparing the drop in 111 origins from WT to <italic>sir2</italic> with that from WT to <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> was highly significant (&lt;&lt;10<sup>–16</sup>). In contrast, <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion in the WT background did not reduce EdU incorporation at genomic origins (median 6.6). These findings highlight that <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion-induced suppression of rDNA origins in <italic>sir2</italic> is accompanied by the activation of genomic origins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Early firing of displaced helicase complexes</title><p>While our results above demonstrate that deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> promotes firing of rDNA origins and that additional deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> suppresses this phenotype, they lack the resolution to distinguish replication arising from the displaced vs the nondisplaced MCM complexes. Other methods for measuring origin activation, such as generation of single-stranded DNA or incorporation of nucleoside analogs, also suffer from this limitation. Distinguishing between firing of the displaced vs the nondisplaced MCM complexes is important to test our hypothesis that displacement of the helicase complex into a relatively nucleosome-free region is responsible for its early activation. We therefore sought to devise a method that can differentiate activation of MCM complexes that are only ~150 bp apart, i.e., the approximate distance between displaced and nondisplaced MCMs. We reasoned that, because MCM-ChEC has the resolution to distinguish closely spaced helicase complexes, the differential disappearance of such closely spaced footprints might permit us to distinguish their relative activation times.</p><p>To explore the possibility that the disappearance of the MCM-ChEC signal could be used to distinguish the firing of the displaced vs nondisplaced populations of MCM, we first asked whether the pattern of disappearance of the MCM signal recapitulates that of origin firing. In particular, while late origins are inhibited by HU, early origins are not; therefore, we asked whether this phenomenon was reflected in MCM-ChEC. To do this, we arrested cells in G1 using alpha factor and then released them into medium containing HU, taking samples for ChEC analysis at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). HU inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and thereby dramatically slows S phase, making it easier to follow replication kinetics, but the relative order of firing of different origins remains unchanged. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, we plot the MCM-ChEC signal at 111 early origins and 101 late origins, with G1 on the x-axis and S phase on the y-axis. While we observed little difference in the signal abundance between early and late origins just 15 min after release from alpha factor, before origins have had a chance to fire, this difference increases over the time course, with early origins dropping more than late. MCM signal quantification demonstrates that the differences in MCM abundance between early and late origins increase over the time course in HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) for FLAG-tagged MCM2 in cells arrested in alpha factor and those released into HU for 60 min, we observed a similar reduction of the MCM signal at early compared to later origins, confirming our MCM-ChEC results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We conclude that the disappearance of the MCM-ChEC signal as cells progress through S phase can be used to assess origin firing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Disappearance of MCM2-chromatin endogenous cleavage (ChEC) signal can be used to monitor origin firing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cells were synchronized in G1 phase using alpha factor for 1.5 hr before being released into media supplemented with hydroxyurea (HU).

We first used MCM2-Flag ChIP in WT and sir2 cells after release into HU to confirm this prediction. In both WT and <italic>sir2</italic> cells, the MCM can be found at the rDNA origin in alpha factor-arrested cells as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, at 60 min following release into HU, unlike in WT cells where the MCM signal remains at its loading site, in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants, we can see that a large fraction of the signal has now redistributed from its loading site and accumulated left of the RFB, consistent with early activation of rDNA origins in <italic>sir2</italic> cells and the arrest of the replication forks at the RFB. While these results demonstrate that ChIP can be used to monitor the repositioning of the MCM signal at a kb scale and origin activation, its resolution is inadequate for small-scale changes in MCM signal distribution, which is needed to monitor the proposed differences in activation of repositioned and non-repositioned MCM complexes. We therefore turned to ChEC to address this question.</p><p>The MCM-ChEC signal in WT cells remained at their initial loading throughout the duration of the HU experiment (blue box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) as we have seen by ChIP in WT cells at 60 min. (Note that 200 mM HU causes an approximately 20-fold slowing of S phase, therefore a 60 min time point is equivalent to &lt;5 min without HU, i.e. prior to the time when the rDNA origin fires in WT cells.) Like in WT, this nondisplaced population of MCM in <italic>sir2</italic> remains relatively constant (blue box); however, in striking contrast, the displaced population of MCM in <italic>sir2</italic> (orange box) shows a continual decrease over the course of the experiment, and there is a concomitant increase in signal in the region upstream of RFB that is absent in WT. Furthermore, both the decrease in the displaced signal (orange box) and its corresponding increase upstream of the RFB were suppressed by deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic>. The changes in the relative abundance of displaced and nondisplaced MCMs during the time course, as well as the repositioning of the MCM signal to the region upstream of RFB across different genotypes, were highly reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these observations provide strong support for the hypothesis that the displaced population of MCM in <italic>sir2</italic> cells fires more readily than its nondisplaced counterpart and that the increased firing of the displaced MCMs is suppressed by <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion.</p><p>It is notable that, although a small fraction of the total G1 signal in WT arises from the displaced location, this minor signal likewise disappears more rapidly than its nondisplaced counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). This suggests that some feature of the immediate chromatin environment may be responsible for the difference in firing times at the two locations, and that this difference is present in both WT and <italic>sir2</italic>; in other words, the fact that the displaced helicase complex is activated before the nondisplaced complex regardless of <italic>SIR2</italic> status is consistent with a model in which <italic>sir2</italic> mutants replicate their rDNA early by virtue of displacing much of their loaded helicases to a region where they are more apt to fire, rather than by altering the chromatin environment more globally to affect all replicative helicases in the nucleolus.</p><p>Finally, although deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> could suppress replication initiation at the rDNA either by inhibiting the firing of the active, repositioned MCM complex, or by preventing MCM repositioning to the ‘active location’ in the first place, our results suggest that suppression occurs through the former mechanism. Consistent with previous reports that <italic>fun30</italic> mutants are deficient in transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neves-Costa et al., 2009</xref>), C-pro RNA levels were approximately twice as high in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> cells compared to <italic>sir2</italic> cells when adjusted for rDNA size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> shifts the distribution toward the repositioned MCM location over the non-repositioned one in G1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), aligning with the increased C-pro transcription observed in <italic>fun30</italic> mutants.

Chromatin treatment with MNase digests DNA that is not bound by proteins, such as nucleosomes and transcription factors. Nucleosomes, which are wrapped by approximately 150 base pairs of DNA, tend to protect fragments in the 150–200 base pair range, and thus profiling fragments in this size range are widely used to assess nucleosome distribution. Plotting nucleosome midpoints at the rARS in G1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) reveals that nucleosome occupancy at the +2 (green box) and +3 (red box) positions is higher in the <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> double mutant than in the <italic>sir2</italic> single mutant. Furthermore, this effect of Fun30 is not limited to the <italic>sir2</italic> background, since nucleosome occupancy is also modestly increased in <italic>fun30</italic> cells compared to WT cells. These observations support the notion that it is the relatively nucleosome-free nature of the region into which MCMs are displaced in <italic>sir2</italic> that make the displaced complexes more prone to activation.

This is due to the fact that the entrance and exit sites for DNA wrapped around a nucleosome are in close physical proximity, despite the fact that they are separated by approximately 150 base pairs, and thus the MNase fusion protein adjacent to a nucleosome often cleaves both sites. MCM-ChEC, therefore, provides a powerful tool for measuring nucleosome occupancy immediately adjacent to the MCM helicase complex <italic>exclusively in those rDNA repeats where those complexes have been loaded</italic>.

Sir2’s activity has been widely ascribed to the intuitive, but mechanistically imprecise, notion that ‘closed chromatin’ is less accessible to both transcription and replication factors. Consistent with this model, deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> abolishes heterochromatic compaction and simultaneously increases the ability of methylases and restriction endonucleases to act on those sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gottschling, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singh and Klar, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Loo and Rine, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weiss and Simpson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ansari and Gartenberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ravindra et al., 1999</xref>). However, at least in its simplest form, non-specific steric exclusion of DNA metabolic enzymes cannot fully account for the suppression of transcription and replication at the rDNA. Steric arguments such as these are even less compelling when made for rDNA than for the silent mating type loci and telomeres, because chromatin compaction has been studied mostly in the context of the complete Sir complex (Sir2–4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gartenberg and Smith, 2016</xref>). In contrast, Sir3 and Sir4 are not present at the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Straight et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, rDNA is the most highly transcribed region of the genome, with transcription by PolI and PolIII accounting for approximately 80% of cellular RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Warner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Woolford and Baserga, 2013</xref>). These two polymerase complexes are similar in size to the PolII complex, thus size alone is not sufficient to selectively occlude PolII.</p><p>Additionally, deletion of SIR2 increases accessibility of restriction enzymes to heterochromatin at the HML locus by 1.5-fold, yet it increases PolII transcription by over 3000-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Holland, 2002</xref>). This indicates that the magnitude of Sir2’s steric exclusion is insufficient to explain its effect on PolII transcription. Similar measurements in eukaryotic cells found little difference in accessibility of restriction enzymes and MNase between euchromatin and heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chereji et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the current report, we argue that Sir2’s role in suppressing replication at the rDNA reflects local differences in the distribution of the MCM replicative helicase complexes rather than more global occlusion of these complexes from the rDNA. In particular, our results suggest that the key difference between WT and <italic>sir2</italic>, with regard to replication initiation, is the location of the MCM complex, with the preponderance of that complex in WT abutting a high-occupancy nucleosome while, in <italic>sir2</italic>, it is mostly in a relatively nucleosome-free region. Furthermore, we show that, even though this nucleosome-free region is less than 200 base pairs from MCM’s original location, the displaced helicase complex is significantly more prone to activation than its nondisplaced counterpart. Moreover, the chromatin-remodeling enzyme Fun30 is required to maintain the nucleosome-free character around the displaced MCM, and its deletion both increases nucleosome occupancy and decreases the ability of the displaced MCM to fire. Finally, as discussed below, we suggest that the increased proclivity of the displaced MCM to fire is not an anomaly specific to the physiology of <italic>sir2</italic> cells, but is an integral feature of replication of the rDNA during normal S phase.</p><p>Our model for the manner in which Sir2 regulates rDNA replication depends critically on the notion that the local nucleosome landscape can influence the activation of MCM helicase complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and in vitro experiments suggest that this is, indeed, the case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azmi et al., 2017</xref> monitored both licensing and firing in vitro, using a 3.8 kb nucleosomal template containing the ARS1 origin. They found that, while licensing was equivalent whether the template had been populated with nucleosomes using Swi/Snf or Rsc remodelers, on the one hand, or Isw1a, on the other, the loaded MCM complexes in the latter templates were more prone to activation. Furthermore, MCM complexes on Swi/Snf- or Rsc-remodeled templates could be made more prone to activation if subsequently treated with Isw1a, although the converse was not true. The salient difference between the two types of nucleosomal landscapes, however, was not obvious, as the distance between the MCM complex and the nearest nucleosome was not notably affected, although it is possible that the composition (e.g. H2A/H2B content) differs. It was also unclear how the nucleosome landscape affected activation of MCM complexes, though the relevant step in activation was determined to be the formation of the CMG complex with Cdc45 and GINS rather than the prior phosphorylation of the complex by DDK. In summary, while it is clear that the local nucleosome landscape can affect origin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eaton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>), the underlying mechanism remains murky.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for relationship between MCM location and replication timing at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA).</title><p>MCM helicase complex (purple ovals) in wild-type abuts the +1 nucleosome (blue cylinder) in G1, making it relatively resistant to activation.

Deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> in a <italic>sir2</italic> mutant leads to increased nucleosome occupancy at the +2 position, adjacent to MCM complex, making this complex resistant to activation. Short red stretch of DNA (e.g. between +2 and +3 nucleosomes in top row) indicates ARS consensus sequence (ACS). ‘Ghost’ Mcm complex in wild-type indicates the small fraction of Mcm that is displaced even in wild-type cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).

We have previously shown that the rightward displacement of MCM double-hexamers in <italic>sir2</italic> is due to de-repression of C-pro transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Foss et al., 2019</xref>), while our current results demonstrate that the displaced MCM is more prone to activation. Combining these two observations, we suggest that the rDNA replicates earlier in <italic>sir2</italic> than in WT simply because more of the MCM complex is in a location that favors its activation; in other words, we favor the view that the region of relatively low nucleosome occupancy to the right of MCM’s normal location is more amenable to MCM activation, regardless of <italic>SIR2</italic> status. In support of this notion, close analysis of our MCM-ChEC data reveals that, while MCM complexes at the displaced location are much rarer in WT than they are in <italic>sir2</italic>, this particular subpopulation appears equally susceptible to activation in both genotypes. This has the important implication that the manner in which the rDNA origin fires in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants may be simply an exaggerated instance of its normal behavior, and that even in WT cells, it is predominantly from MCMs that are displaced, likely due to low level of C-pro transcription, that replication initiates.</p><p>Classic studies that employed EM and 2D gel electrophoresis showed that only a fraction of rDNA origins, estimated at one in five, are activated in any single cell cycle in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brewer and Fangman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Linskens and Huberman, 1988</xref>). These estimates were later corroborated by single molecule analysis, which also observed that the fraction of active origins increases in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pasero et al., 2002</xref>). This low fraction of active rDNA origins could be due to insufficient origins licensing, suppression of activation or licensed origins, or a combination of the two mechanisms. Our measurements of rDNA licensing showed that MCM are loaded in up to 90% of origins in WT cells and allowed us to conclude that regulation or rDNA replication initiation occurs primarily at the level of origin firing.</p><p>CREs have been proposed to assist DNA replication by modulation of nucleosome phasing in the vicinity of replication origins, but it has proven difficult to assign specific roles to remodelers in genome replication in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cutler et al., 2018</xref>). One of the reasons for this difficulty is the redundancy among different remodelers on one hand, and the multiple essential roles CRE play in DNA transactions in addition to replication. For example, in vitro studies have identified four different remodelers that in combination with ORC can phase nucleosome at 320 replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chacin et al., 2023</xref>). However, a deletion of any single of these remodelers had no discernible effect on nucleosome phasing in vivo and a quadruple mutant was required to abolish phasing. While the characterization of this quadruple mutant suggested impaired replication initiation, it was difficult to exclude indirect effects that might have been caused by the effects on transcription. In contrast, the effect of a chromatin remodeler on DNA replication we describe in this work is remarkably specific: we found that the activity of a single remodeler, Fun30, is required to activation not only of a specific origin, but that its action is specific to nucleosomes adjacent to repositioned MCM complexes at the rDNA. The suppression of rDNA origin activity in sir2 mutants, which contained a large fraction of repositioned MCMs, by <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion is so severe that it reduces the rDNA size ~3- to 5-fold, from 160 to 35–50 copies.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence highlighting the importance of positioning of the MCM replicative helicase within the local nucleosome environment in determining replication timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azmi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>). While it is clear that small differences in this positioning can have significant effects on the timing of DNA replication, it is unlikely that a simple rule exists to directly infer origin timing solely based on the distance between the MCM complex and the nearest nucleosome. Nonetheless, our results suggest that this parameter could be a crucial piece of the puzzle in understanding why some origins fire early in S phase, while others fire late. Further research is needed to unravel the precise molecular mechanisms governing the interplay between the MCM complex and nucleosomes and how these dynamics influence replication timing across different genomic loci. Such insights will deepen our understanding of DNA replication regulation in the context of disease states associated with epigenetic drift, such as aging and cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strain</title><p>Strains used in the study were derived from BY4741 (S288C background, EUROSCARF) and W303 and are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Samples were pooled together, and subjected to click chemistry reaction in 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 20 μM biotin-TEG azide (Vector Laboratories), 5 mM THPTA (tris-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethylamine) (Vector Laboratories), 1 mM copper sulfate, and 15 mM sodium ascorbate (total volume 200 μL). Click reaction proceeded for 30 min at room temperature prior to DNA ethanol precipitation. Streptavidin magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) were washed three times with B&amp;W buffer I (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5% SDS) before adding 100 μL of bead suspension to 180 μL DNA plus B&amp;W buffer I. After a 30 min incubation at room temperature while gently inverting tubes, bead bound DNA was washed with 200 μL B&amp;W buffer I followed by 100 μL Stringency wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.1% SSC buffer) and 200 μL Wash Buffer II (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20). DNA was eluted off the beads by denaturation at 98°C for 5 min, followed by cooling at 25°C. Edu-labeled DNA was PCR amplified post-pulldown and subjected to sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Hydroxyurea ChEC time course experiment</title><p>Cells grown in synthetic media to logarithmic phase were arrested in G1 using alpha factor for 90 min, centrifuged, washed in water to remove alpha factor, and released into media containing 200 mM HU.

Each of the ~180 tandemly repeated rDNA gene copies contains a potential replication origin. Early-efficient initiation of these origins is suppressed by Sir2, reducing competition with origins distributed throughout the genome for rate-limiting initiation factors. Previous studies by these authors showed that SIR2 deletion advances replication timing of rDNA origins by a complex mechanism of transcriptional de-repression of a local PolII promoter causing licensed origin proteins (MCMcomplexes) to re-localize (slide along the DNA) to a different (and altered) chromatin environment. In this study, they identify a chromatin remodeler, FUN30, that suppresses the sir2∆ effect, and remarkably, results in a contraction of the rDNA to about one-quarter it's normal length/number of repeats, implicating replication defects of the rDNA. Through examination of replication timing, MCM occupancy and nucleosome occupancy on the chromatin in sir2, fun30, and double mutants, they propose a model where nucleosome position relative to the licensed origin (MCM complexes) intrinsically determines origin timing/efficiency. While their interpretations of the data are largely reasonable and can be interpreted to support their model, a key weakness is the connection between Mcm ChEC signal disappearance and origin firing. While the cyclical chromatin association-dissociation of MCM proteins with potential origin sequences may be generally interpreted as licensing followed by firing, dissociation may also result from passive replication and as shown here, displacement by transcription and/or chromatin remodeling. Moreover, linking its disappearance from chromatin in the ChEC method with such precise resolution needs to be validated against an independent method to determine the initiation site(s). Differences in rDNA copy number and relative transcription levels also are not directly accounted for, obscuring a clearer interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, this paper makes a valuable advance with the finding of Fun30 involvement, which substantially reduces rDNA repeat number in sir2∆ background. The model they develop is compelling and I am inclined to agree, but I think the evidence on this specific point is purely correlative and a better method is needed to address the initiation site question. The authors deserve credit for their efforts to elucidate our obscure understanding of the intricacies of chromatin regulation.</p><p>Overall, the paper is improved by providing additional data and improved analysis. The paper nicely characterizes the effect of Fun30. The model is reasonable but remains lacking in precise details of mechanism.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97438.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors follow up on their previous work showing that in the absence of the Sir2 deacetylase the MCM replicative helicase at the rDNA spacer region is repositioned to a region of low nucleosome occupancy.

This manuscript addresses the mechanism by which Sir2 delays replication timing at the rDNA in budding yeast. Previous work from the same laboratory (Foss et al. PLoS Genetics 15, e1008138) showed that Sir2 represses transcription-dependent displacement of the Mcm helicase in the rDNA. In this manuscript, the authors show convincingly that the repositioned Mcms fire earlier and that this early firing partly depends on the ATPase activity of the nucleosome remodeler Fun30. Using read-depth analysis of sorted G1/S cells, fun30 was the only chromatin remodeler mutant that somewhat delayed replication timing in sir2 mutants, while nhp10, chd1, isw1, htl1, swr1, isw2, and irc5 had no effect. The conclusion was corroborated with orthogonal assays including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analysis of EdU incorporation at early origins. Using an insightful analysis with an Mcm-MNase fusion (Mcm-ChEC), the authors show that the repositioned Mcms in sir2 mutants fire earlier than the Mcm at the normal position in wild type. This early firing at the repositioned Mcms is partially suppressed by Fun30. In addition, the authors show Fun30 affects nucleosome occupancy at the sites of the repositioned Mcm, providing a plausible mechanism for the effect of Fun30 on Mcm firing at that position.

Each of the ~180 tandemly repeated rDNA gene copies contains a potential replication origin. Earlyefficient initiation of these origins is suppressed by Sir2, reducing competition with origins distributed throughout the genome for rate-limiting initiation factors. Previous studies by these authors showed that SIR2 deletion advances replication timing of rDNA origins by a complex mechanism of transcriptional de-repression of a local PolII promoter causing licensed origin proteins (MCMcomplexes) to re-localize (slide along the DNA) to a different (and altered) chromatin environment. In this study, they identify a chromatin remodeler, FUN30, that suppresses the sir2∆ effect, and remarkably, results in a contraction of the rDNA to about onequarter it's normal length/number of repeats, implicating replication defects of the rDNA. Through examination of replication timing, MCM occupancy and nucleosome occupancy on the chromatin in sir2, fun30, and double mutants, they propose a model where nucleosome position relative to the licensed origin (MCM complexes) intrinsically determines origin timing/efficiency. While their interpretations of the data are largely reasonable and can be interpreted to support their model, a key weakness is the connection between Mcm ChEC signal disappearance and origin firing. While the cyclical chromatin association-dissociation of MCM proteins with potential origin sequences may be generally interpreted as licensing followed by firing, dissociation may also result from passive replication and as shown here, displacement by transcription and/or chromatin remodeling. Moreover, linking its disappearance from chromatin in the ChEC method with such precise resolution needs to be validated against an independent method to determine the initiation site(s). Differences in rDNA copy number and relative transcription levels also are not directly accounted for, obscuring a clearer interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, this paper makes a valuable advance with the finding of Fun30 involvement, which substantially reduces rDNA repeat number in sir2∆ background. The model they develop is compelling and I am inclined to agree, but I think the evidence on this specific point is purely correlative and a better method is needed to address the initiation site question. The authors deserve credit for their efforts to elucidate our obscure understanding of the intricacies of chromatin regulation. At a minimum, I suggest their conclusions on these points of concern should be softened and caveats discussed. Statistical analysis is lacking for some claims.</p><p>Strengths are the identification of FUN30 as suppressor, examination of specific mutants of FUN30 to distinguish likely functional involvement. Use of multiple methods to analyze replication and protein occupancies on chromatin. Development of a coherent model.</p><p>Weaknesses are failure to address copy number as a variable; insufficient validation of ChEC method relationship to exact initiation locus; lack of statistical analysis in some cases.</p><p>Review of revised version and response letter:</p><p>In the response, the authors make some improvements by better quantifying 2D gels, adding some missing statistical analyses, analyzing the effect of fun30 on rDNA replication in strains with reduced rDNA copy number, and using ChIP-seq of MCMs to support the ChEC-seq data. However, these additions do not address the main issue that is at the heart of their model: where initiation precisely occurs and whether the location is altered in the mutant(s). Thus, mechanistic insight is limited.</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss the issue regarding the initiation site below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Under the section &quot;Addressing Alternative Explanations&quot;, the authors claim that processes like transcription and passive replication cannot affect the displaced complex specifically. Why? They are not on same DNA (as mentioned in the Fig 1 legend).</p></disp-quote><p>Premature origin activation, not transcription, drives the disappearance of repositioned MCM complexes in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants in HU.</p><p>Indeed, the reviewer is correct in suggesting that C-pro transcription confined to rDNA units with repositioned MCM complexes could selectively displace those complexes, potentially explaining the selective disappearance of displaced MCMs in <italic>sir2</italic> cells. However, our analysis of C-pro transcription and MCM occupancy in G1 versus HU across the genotypes allows us to rule out this possibility.</p><p>We show that the fraction of repositioned MCMs in G1 cells is proportional to the level of C-pro transcription (WT &lt; <italic>fun30</italic> &lt;&lt; <italic>sir2</italic> &lt; <italic>sir2 fun30</italic>), consistent with the involvement of transcription in the repositioning process during MCM loading in G1. Accordingly, with approximately twice the transcription in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> compared to <italic>sir2</italic>, we observe more repositioned MCMs in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> cells than in <italic>sir2</italic> cells in G1 (Fig 5C).</p><p>However, if the disappearance of repositioned MCMs in HU were solely due to C-pro transcription rather than origin activation, we would expect the repositioned MCMs to disappear more quickly in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> cells. Contrary to this expectation, our data show that repositioned MCM complexes are more stable in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> mutants compared to <italic>sir2</italic> mutants, indicating that transcription is not the primary factor in the disappearance of displaced MCM complexes in HU; rather, rDNA origin activation appears to be the key factor.</p><p>Replication initiation site in <italic>sir2</italic>. Using multiple independent approaches, including 2D gels, ChIP-seq, and EdU incorporation, we have demonstrated that <italic>rDNA</italic> origins fire prematurely in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants, a conclusion that the reviewer does not contest. Once an origin fires, the MCM signal disappears from the site of its initial deposition, as expected, and this is confirmed in our MCM ChIP and HU ChEC data, both at rDNA origins and across the genome.</p><p>Given that the majority of MCM complexes in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants are <italic>repositioned</italic><bold>,</bold> it is expected that these repositioned complexes disappear following premature origin activation. With less than half of the licensed origins (or &lt;30% of total rDNA copies) retaining MCM at non-repositioned sites in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants, if only these non-repositioned complexes were firing, and the repositioned MCM complexes were disappearing via mechanisms other than replication initiation (e.g., transcription), rDNA replication in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants would be severely compromised rather than accelerated. Given this, and the strong experimental evidence that repositioned MCM complexes fire prematurely, continued focus on alternative explanations for MCM complex disappearance seems unwarranted.</p><p>We present this analysis in the results section as follows:</p><p>“Finally, although deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> could suppress replication initiation at the rDNA either by inhibiting the firing of the active, repositioned MCM complex or by preventing MCM repositioning to the &quot;active location&quot; in the first place, our results suggest that suppression occurs through the former mechanism. Consistent with previous reports that <italic>fun30</italic> mutants are deficient in transcriptional silencing (Neves-Costa et al. 2009), C-pro RNA levels were approximately twice as high in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> cells compared to <italic>sir2</italic> cells when adjusted for rDNA size (Figure 5—figure supplement 6).</p><p>Moreover, deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> shifts the distribution toward the repositioned MCM location over the non-repositioned one in G1 cells (Figure 5C), aligning with the increased C-pro transcription observed in <italic>fun30</italic> mutants. This shift is evident in both <italic>sir2</italic> and <italic>SIR2</italic> cells. Despite the increased transcription-mediated repositioning in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> cells compared to <italic>sir2</italic> cells during G1, repositioned MCM persists longer in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> cells than in <italic>sir2</italic> cells after release into HU. Additionally, <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> mutants exhibit reduced MCM accumulation at the RFB compared to <italic>sir2</italic> mutants after release into HU, supporting the conclusion that MCM disappearance in HU reflects origin activation rather than transcription-mediated displacement.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The model in Fig 7 implies that initiation sites are different in WT versus the mutants and this determines their timing/efficiency. But they also suggest that the same site might be used with different efficiencies in this response. I agree that both are possibilities and are not resolved.</p></disp-quote><p>Adjustment of the model to account for repositioned MCMs in WT cells</p><p>In Figure 5—figure supplement 5, we demonstrate that even in WT cells, a small fraction of repositioned MCMs (~5%) can be detected, and that these repositioned MCM complexes disappear prematurely. However, because this represents a very small fraction of MCMs in WT cells, we initially did not include it in our overall model in Figure 7. In light of the reviewer's comment, we have now revised the model to incorporate this detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supporting their model requires better resolution to determine the actual replication initiation site.

While high-resolution techniques such as DNAscent or Okazaki fragment mapping could potentially offer another layer of validation, the likelihood of obtaining finer detail that would change the conclusions is minimal.

Sir2 has previously been shown to be recruited by Fob1, which is also required for DSB formation and recombination-mediated changes in rDNA copy number. Are the changes that the authors observe specifically in fun30 sir2 cells related to this pathway? Is Fob1 required for the reduced rDNA copy number in fun30 sir2 double mutant cells?</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Heterochromatin is characterized by low transcription activity and late replication timing, both dependent on the NAD-dependent protein deacetylase Sir2, the founding member of the sirtuins. This manuscript addresses the mechanism by which Sir2 delays replication timing at the rDNA in budding yeast. Previous work from the same laboratory (Foss et al. PLoS Genetics 15, e1008138) showed that Sir2 represses transcription-dependent displacement of the Mcm helicase in the rDNA. In this manuscript, the authors show convincingly that the repositioned Mcms fire earlier and that this early firing partly depends on the ATPase activity of the nucleosome remodeler Fun30. Using read-depth analysis of sorted G1/S cells, fun30 was the only chromatin remodeler mutant that somewhat delayed replication timing in sir2 mutants, while nhp10, chd1, isw1, htl1, swr1, isw2, and irc5 had no effect. The conclusion was corroborated with orthogonal assays including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analysis of EdU incorporation at early origins. Using an insightful analysis with an Mcm-MNase fusion (Mcm-ChEC), the authors</p><p>show that the repositioned Mcms in sir2 mutants fire earlier than the Mcm at the normal position in wild type. This early firing at the repositioned Mcms is partially suppressed by Fun30. In addition, the authors show Fun30 affects nucleosome occupancy at the sites of the repositioned Mcm, providing a plausible mechanism for the effect of Fun30 on Mcm firing at that position. However, the results from the MNAse-seq and ChEC-seq assays are not fully congruent for the fun30 single mutant.

In their rebuttal, the authors state that, &quot;New supporting based evidence: ChIP at rDNA Origins. Our ChIP analysis also shows that the disappearance of the MCM signal at rDNA origins in sir2Δ cells released into HU is accompanied by signal accumulation at the replication fork barrier (RFB), indicative of stalled replication forks at this location (Figure 5 figure supplement 3)....&quot; The ChIP data in Figure 5 supplement 3 show accumulation of the Mcm2 ChIP signal to the left of the RFB in sir2D cells but it doesn't look like there is any decrease in the MCM signal in sir2D relative to wild-type cells for the peak C-Pro.

The MCM-ChIP data are normalized to the highest signal within this rDNA region rather than across the entire genome, meaning that only the relative abundance of MCM within this region is represented, and not comparisons between different conditions. We have now presented the results with the same axes for both alpha factor and HU.</p><p>In wild-type (WT) cells, the MCM signal remains primarily at the initial loading site. However, in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants, a significant portion of the MCM signal shifts rightward, consistent with rDNA origin activation and the movement of MCM along with the progressing replication fork. While some replication forks stall at the RFB, others are positioned between the MCM loading site and the RFB. The additional MCM peak observed does not represent a new MCM loading event, as the experiment was conducted during S-phase, when new MCM loading is not possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>In this revision the authors addressed my concerns and improved the manuscript and the presentation of the data.
