The range of chemical strategies employed across these associations, and how these strategies relate to insect lifestyle, remains underexplored. We assessed subsocial passalid beetles of the species <italic>Odontotaenius disjunctus</italic>, and their frass (fecal material), which is an important food resource within their galleries, as a model insect/actinomycete system. Through chemical and phylogenetic analyses, we found that <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> frass collected across eastern North America harbored multiple lineages of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> and diverse antimicrobials. Metabolites detected in frass displayed synergistic and antagonistic inhibition of a fungal entomopathogen, <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic>, and multiple streptomycete isolates inhibited this pathogen when co-cultivated directly in frass. These findings support a model in which the lifestyle of <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> accommodates multiple <italic>Streptomyces</italic> lineages in their frass, resulting in a rich repertoire of antimicrobials that likely insulates their galleries against pathogenic invasion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chemical ecology</kwd><kwd>symbiosis</kwd><kwd>odontotaenius disjunctus</kwd><kwd>actinomycetes</kwd><kwd>natural products</kwd><kwd>bessbug</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006978</institution-id><institution>University of California Berkeley</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>startup funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pessotti</surname><given-names>Rita de Cassia</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Bridget L</given-names></name><name><surname>Reaso</surname><given-names>Jewel N</given-names></name><name><surname>El-Hifnawi</surname><given-names>Laila</given-names></name><name><surname>Traxler</surname><given-names>Matthew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Searle Scholars Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SSP-2016-1411</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pessotti</surname><given-names>Rita de Cassia</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Bridget L</given-names></name><name><surname>Traxler</surname><given-names>Matthew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PAPM EAGER 1650059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pessotti</surname><given-names>Rita de Cassia</given-names></name><name><surname>Traxler</surname><given-names>Matthew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010336</institution-id><institution>Hellman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellow awards</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pessotti</surname><given-names>Rita de Cassia</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Bridget L</given-names></name><name><surname>Reaso</surname><given-names>Jewel N</given-names></name><name><surname>Traxler</surname><given-names>Matthew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Genomic Science Program as part of the LLNL Biofuels SFA SCW1039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ceja-Navarro</surname><given-names>Javier A</given-names></name><name><surname>Brodie</surname><given-names>Eoin L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The widespread occurrence of metabolically active streptomycetes in <italic>Odontotaenius disjunctus</italic> beetle frass may insulate their galleries against pathogenic fungal invasion through the production of diverse antimicrobial specialized metabolites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The majority of clinically used antibiotics continue to be based on chemical scaffolds derived from natural products (also known as specialized metabolites) made by microbes, namely actinomycete bacteria and filamentous fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chevrette and Currie, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gholami-Shabani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hutchings et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>). However, the spread of resistance among pathogens has led to a steep, and well-documented, erosion in antibiotic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Colavecchio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lekshmi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Richardson, 2017</xref>). The rapidity of resistance evolution in the medical arena raises questions about how the microbes that make antibiotics preserve their advantageous use over evolutionary time and underscores a need to understand the chemical ecology of microbially produced specialized metabolites.</p><p>Symbiotic systems in which actinomycete-derived specialized metabolites are used for chemical defense may provide a blueprint for effectively leveraging antibiotics over long-term timescales. Important examples of such systems include the symbiotic relationships between insects and actinomycetes, in which the insects associate with actinomycetes to protect their food sources, communal nests, or developing larva against pathogenic invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bratburd et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chevrette et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Van Arnam et al., 2018</xref>). Among the most extensively characterized of these systems are the eusocial, neotropical leafcutter ants, who cultivate a food fungus on leaf tissue in their subterranean nests. These ants protect their fungal gardens from a pathogenic fungus (<italic>Escovopsis</italic> sp.) by associating with actinomycetes usually belonging to the genus <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic>, which produce a variety of antifungal molecules (e.g., dentigerumycin and gerumycins) that differentially inhibit the growth of the <italic>Escovopsis</italic> sp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Currie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Menegatti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Oh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Van Arnam et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, the gregarious southern pine beetle, which cultivates fungi to feed its larvae, maintains <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. capable of inhibiting fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Scott et al., 2008</xref>). Another archetypal insect/actinomycete system includes the solitary beewolf wasps, which harbor <italic>Streptomyces philanthi</italic> in specialized antennal reservoirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaltenpoth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaltenpoth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kaltenpoth et al., 2012</xref>). Female beewolves inoculate their brood chambers with these symbionts, which are ultimately incorporated into the cocoons of their pupating larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaltenpoth et al., 2005</xref>). These <italic>Streptomyces</italic> produce a suite of antifungal molecules (piericidins and derivatives, streptochlorins, and nigericin) that protect the brood from opportunistic fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Engl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kroiss et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The exploration of these insect/actinomycete associations has provided key insights into the ecology of microbial specialized metabolites. Importantly, analyses of the leafcutter ant and beewolf systems have shown the co-evolution of the insect hosts and actinomycete symbionts, suggesting that these relationships, and the molecules involved, have remained durable over tens of millions of years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaltenpoth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Both leafcutter ants and beewolves have specialized structures for maintaining their actinomycete symbionts, which facilitate vertical transmission and high symbiont fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaltenpoth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stubbendieck et al., 2019</xref>). However, outstanding questions remain regarding the nature of actinomycete symbioses in other insects, for example, those without specialized compartments for maintaining bacterial symbionts. Specifically, how do different mechanisms of microbial transmission influence symbiont specificity and diversity? And, what are the implications of symbiont specificity/diversity for the chemical repertoires found in these systems? Thus, we were motivated to identify an insect/actinomycete association that (i) utilized a different mechanism of microbial transmission and (ii) enabled direct detection of microbially produced specialized metabolites in situ.</p><p>With this in mind, we assessed <italic>Odontotaenius disjunctus</italic>, a subsocial passalid beetle commonly found in decomposing logs across eastern North America, and its frass (fecal material), as a model system for studying the ecology of actinomycete specialized metabolism. Frass is an abundant and easily sampled material in <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries, and it is an important nutrient source in this system for both adult and larval survival, and pupal chamber construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biedermann, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mason and Odum, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schuster and Schuster, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Valenzuela-González, 1992</xref>). Notably, <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> does not appear to have mycangia or other specialized structures that harbor microbial symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ulyshen, 2018</xref>). While <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> has not been investigated for the presence of actinomycetes and antimicrobials, a previous study on tropical passalid beetles found a diverse community of actinomycetes inhabiting the gut of both adults and larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Vargas-Asensio et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We characterized this system through a combination of (i) direct chemical analyses of microbial specialized metabolites in frass sampled from <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries across its geographic range, (ii) parallel assessment of the phylogeny and specialized metabolite repertoire of actinomycete strains isolated from frass, (iii) investigation of synergism/antagonism between the specialized metabolites found in frass against a beetle pathogen, and (iv) direct assessment of competitive interactions between key <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates and entomopathogenic strains in an in vitro frass experimental system. Collectively, our results indicate that <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> establish stable associations with a comparatively diverse set of actinomycetes relative to other insect/actinomycete associations, which we propose to be a result of microbial transmission via coprophagy. This set of actinomycetes and their antimicrobials likely aid in gallery hygiene and consequently protect both an important nutrient source for <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> and their pupae. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the <italic>O. disjunctus</italic>/actinomycete system represents a tractable system for exploration of actinomycete specialized metabolism at multiple scales, ranging from macroscale biogeography in natura to interactions of microbes at microscopic scales in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Actinomycetes with antimicrobial properties are widespread in <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries</title><p>Passalid beetles of the species <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> (formerly known as <italic>Passalus cornutus</italic>, and commonly referred to as ‘bessbugs’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) are widely distributed across eastern North America, where they are important decomposers of rotting timber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ceja-Navarro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ceja-Navarro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gray, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pearse et al., 1936</xref>). This role has prompted interest in the <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> gut microbiota as a potential source of lignocellulose-processing microbes for biofuel efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ceja-Navarro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ceja-Navarro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Suh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Urbina et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> is subsocial, with mating pairs establishing galleries within decaying logs where they rear their larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schuster and Schuster, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wicknick and Miskelly, 2009</xref>). Large amounts of beetle frass accumulate within these galleries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> is also coprophagic, and it is thought that microbes within frass continue digesting plant material as a kind of ‘external rumen’ between periods of consumption by the beetles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biedermann, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mason and Odum, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ulyshen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Valenzuela-González, 1992</xref>). The frass is also notable as the adults feed it to the larvae, and parents and teneral siblings construct chambers from frass around metamorphosing pupa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biedermann, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gray, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schuster and Schuster, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Valenzuela-González, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Given the high nutrient content of frass and the complex parental behaviors associated with it, we drew parallels between this system and the other insect/actinomycete systems described above. Thus, we hypothesized that <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries, and frass specifically, might contain actinomycete symbionts that have the potential to provide chemical defense to their host galleries and the food source on which their brood subsist.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>O. disjunctus</italic> beetles (<bold>A</bold>) inhabit and feed on decomposing logs.</title><p>They build galleries that are filled with frass (<bold>B</bold>, white arrows are pointing to the frass), which is a central material in this system.

Samples included freshly produced frass from live beetles and larvae (as an indicator of their microbial gut content), and frass and wood from within the galleries. Pupal chamber material was also sampled when available, and in this case, pupae were also gently sampled with a swab. Using two selective media to enrich for actinomycetes, we isolated 339 bacterial strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>—Table S2) and assayed their ability to inhibit growth of the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and the fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic>.

To do so, we extracted frass and pupal chamber material with ethyl acetate, and analyzed the extracts using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Surprisingly, we detected a wide array of microbial specialized metabolites in frass/pupal chamber material with identification levels of 1, 2, or 3 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>—Table S3, and Materials and methods for identification criteria).

Such a pattern could be explained either by intimate, sustained association of these actinomycetes with the beetle across the range of <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> or by frequent reacquisition of the actinomycetes that produce these specific compounds from the environments surrounding <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries. To investigate this question, we built a phylogenetic tree of the actinomycete isolates from which we identified at least one compound. Since it is documented that the 16S rRNA gene, commonly used in bacterial phylogenetic studies, does not provide strong resolution for actinomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choudoir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guo et al., 2008</xref>), we built a tree using concatenated sequences of 16S rRNA and those of three housekeeping genes (rpoB, gyrB, atpD) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1F</xref>—Table S6 for the GenBank accession number of each sequence). Duplicate strains were removed from the tree so as to not overrepresent clonal strains isolated from the same galleries, resulting in a total of 67 isolates placed on the tree. We defined duplicates as strains that were isolated from the same gallery that (i) have identical sequences for at least one of the four genes, (ii) have the same phenotype when growing on International <italic>Streptomyces</italic> Project 2 (ISP2-agar), and (iii) produce the same antimicrobial(s) in vitro.</p><p>Mapping the detected compounds onto a phylogenetic tree showed clear phylogenetic relationships associated with the production of specific compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). For example, actinomycins and filipins were consistently co-produced by a specific clade (bootstrap value of 100%) with high genetic relatedness, here identified as <italic>Streptomyces padanus,</italic> which was found in almost all galleries (19/22, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). We also noted that distinct clades with high sequence similarity produced angucyclinones and bafilomycins, identified as <italic>Streptomyces scopuliridis</italic> and <italic>Streptomyces cellostaticus</italic>, respectively (bootstrap values of 100%). These clades are each composed of highly related strains despite being isolated from geographically distant galleries (as far as ~1900 km, 10 degrees of latitude, and 18 degrees of longitude apart; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>). Thus, we propose that these clades are likely stably associated with <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> throughout its range. Other isolates fell into areas of the tree that held higher phylogenetic diversity, and these strains produced a wider array of compounds, including cycloheximide, PTMs (e.g., alteramides), nigericin, piericidin, nactins, and novobiocin. The higher phylogenetic diversity of these isolates suggests that they represent transient members of the frass microbiota that have been more recently acquired from the environment, as opposed to being stably associated with <italic>O. disjunctus</italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree built using concatenated sequences of four genes (16S rRNA, rpoB, gyrB, atpD) annotated with compounds produced by each microbial strain and their geographic and source origin (both represented by rings around the tree).</title><p>Scale bar represents branch length in number of substitutions per site.

We note that even though environmental frass often contains multiple antimicrobials (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the heterogeneous nature of this material, plus autoclaving during preparation, likely means that any native antimicrobials were at low concentration and/or inactivated in these microbial growth assays.

The best-characterized examples of such symbioses include the eusocial, neotropical leafcutter ants and the solitary beewolf wasps, and their respective actinomycete associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Engl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaltenpoth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Menegatti et al., 2021</xref>). While these systems have provided a remarkable window into the ecology of specialized metabolism, many questions remain regarding insect/actinomycete symbioses in the context of differing social structures, mechanisms of microbial transmission, and strategies to combat pathogens.</p><p>Here, we investigated the subsocial passalid beetle <italic>O. disjunctus</italic>, and its frass, as a system for dissecting the chemical ecology of actinomycete specialized metabolism. Through direct chemical analysis, we found that frass from galleries across the geographic range of <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> contained at least seven different families of known actinomycete-produced antimicrobials, and that production of at least four of these families (actinomycins, angucyclinones, nactins, and cycloheximide) is widely distributed across eastern North America. Additionally, actinomycete isolates from frass produced 12 different families of antimicrobials, including all of those observed in frass. Using a simple assay with frass as a growth medium, we also demonstrated that multiple actinomycete isolates from <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries could directly inhibit the growth of the fungal pathogen <italic>M. anisopliae</italic>. Taken together, these findings place the <italic>O. disjunctus</italic>/frass system among the most chemically rich insect/actinomycete associations characterized thus far. These results are consistent with a model in which this antimicrobial richness benefits <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> by limiting fungal pathogen growth in the frass inside its galleries. Beyond these findings, the tractability of the <italic>O. disjunctus</italic>/actinomycete system makes it an attractive model from multiple experimental perspectives, enabling research across scales from biogeographic surveillance to in vitro mechanistic investigation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The <italic>O. disjunctus</italic>/actinomycete partnership comprises a rich chemical system</title><p>A key obstacle in the study of the ecology of specialized metabolites is the detection of these compounds in situ. Historically, this detection has been challenging for multiple reasons: (i) specialized metabolites exist at relatively low concentrations within complex chemical environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grenni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kellner and Dettner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schoenian et al., 2011</xref>); (ii) their production probably occurs in a dynamic spatio-temporal manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Debois et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pessotti et al., 2019</xref>); (iii) additional factors like light, temperature, and pH might alter their chemical structures and stabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boreen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cycoń et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Edhlund et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gothwal and Shashidhar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mitchell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Thiele-Bruhn and Peters, 2007</xref>); and (iv) some compounds are likely degraded by surrounding microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barra Caracciolo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gothwal and Shashidhar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grenni et al., 2018</xref>). For these reasons, knowledge of when and where microbes produce specialized metabolites in natural settings is extremely limited.</p><p>The frass found in <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries constitutes an important commodity in the lifestyle of this beetle. The frass itself is composed of partially digested wood with high organic carbon content, and nitrogen fixation by microbes in the gut of <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> enhances its bioavailable nitrogen content as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ceja-Navarro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ceja-Navarro et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, frass represents a valuable nutrient source for these beetles, any associated microbes, and potential pathogenic invaders. The frass is also a key component in this system because (i) all of the <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> individuals in a gallery are in constant contact with it, (ii) adults feed it to the larvae, and (iii) pupal chambers, which encapsulate fragile <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> pupae, are made of this material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pearse et al., 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schuster and Schuster, 1985</xref>). Based on parallels between <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> and other social insects that form actinomycete symbioses, we hypothesized that frass material was likely to contain actinomycete symbionts and their specialized metabolites.</p><p>To directly assess if antimicrobial compounds were present in this beetle/frass system, we sampled frass from 22 natural <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries, and in some cases, we were also able to collect pupal chamber material (galleries 2-DC, 15-FL, and 17-LA). When we analyzed the chemical composition of these frass samples using high-resolution LC-MS/MS, we detected seven families of actinomycete-produced antimicrobials: actinomycins (<bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>), angucyclinones (<bold>3</bold>, <bold>4</bold>), cycloheximide (<bold>5</bold>), nactins (<bold>7–10</bold>), polyene macrolides (<bold>13–15</bold>), piericidin A (<bold>24</bold>), and alteramides (PTMs) (<bold>16</bold>, <bold>17</bold>). Actinomycins, angucyclinones, nactins, and polyene macrolides were also detected in pupal chamber material (17-LA). Of these compounds, only actinomycin X2 and piericidin A have previously been directly detected in material associated with insects, for example, waste material of laboratory colonies of <italic>Acromyrmex echinatior</italic> (a species of Attine ant) and associated with beewolf antennal glands and cocoons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Engl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kaltenpoth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kroiss et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ortega et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schoenian et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>This work expands the list of antimicrobials detected directly in material associated with insects to include the PTMs, polyene macrolides, cycloheximide, nactins, and angucyclinones. In addition, we found that <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> frass also commonly contains beauvericin, which is an insecticidal specialized metabolite known to be produced by multiple fungal entomopathogens. This observation, and our isolation of <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> from frass and an <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> carcass, suggests that <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries are likely under pressure from fungal entomopathogens. Moreover, subsocial insects, such as <italic>O. disjunctus</italic>, are at higher risk than solitary insects of pathogenic spread due to their frequent social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Onchuru et al., 2018</xref>). Based on these results, we hypothesized that the rich array of antimicrobials produced by actinomycetes in <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> frass affords these beetles defense against pathogenic overtake of both a food source and material used for protection during metamorphosis. It is important to note that <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. are also known producers of enzymes that degrade wood components, for example, cellulose, lignin, and xylose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Book et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Book et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the streptomycete community associated with <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> may play a nutritional role in this system as well. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Vargas-Asensio et al., 2014</xref> provided strong evidence that <italic>Streptomyces</italic> play an important role as nutritional symbionts in tropical passalid beetles from Central America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Vargas-Asensio et al., 2014</xref>). However, we note that more research is necessary to further investigate this hypothesis specifically for <italic>O. disjunctus</italic>.</p><p>To lay the groundwork for hypothesis testing in this system, we developed an assay using sterilized frass as a growth medium. We used this assay to assess if <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. isolated from <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries grew in this material, produced specialized metabolites, and inhibited the growth of entomopathogens. All three <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates we tested (including strains of <italic>S. padanus</italic>, <italic>S. scopuliridis</italic>, and <italic>S. californicus</italic>) grew, produced antimicrobials, and effectively curtailed pathogen (<italic>M. anisopliae</italic>) growth in frass. Additionally, <italic>S. padanus</italic>, which was the actinomycete most commonly isolated from frass, outcompeted the other two <italic>Streptomyces</italic> strains we tested, providing a rationale for its prevalence in <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries. Together, our findings support a model in which diverse <italic>Streptomyces</italic> in <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> frass benefit this beetle by inhibiting the growth of fungal pathogens in their galleries. Beyond this, these results illustrate that this simple, frass-based assay can be used to study interactions between microbes in this system in a nutrient environment similar (if not virtually identical) to that found in <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries in nature. This assay sets the stage for further genetic/chemical experimentation to dissect the role of individual specialized metabolites that may regulate these microbial interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Contrasting chemical strategies across insect/actinomycete symbioses</title><p>The beewolf, leafcutter ants, and <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> systems may represent a spectrum of chemical defense strategies that are maintained by different modes of transmission and reflect distinct selective pressures. The beewolf system contains the highest level of symbiote specificity, with a single species (or species complex) of streptomycete symbiont, and a relatively low diversity of chemical scaffolds that vary in their relative concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Engl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaltenpoth et al., 2014</xref>). Engl et al. hypothesized that this subtle variation in component concentrations within the beewolf antimicrobial cocktail has been sufficient to maintain its efficacy over evolutionary time due to the lack of a specialized antagonist (i.e., a specific pathogen that is encountered repeatedly over evolutionary time when beewolves construct their brood chambers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Engl et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, various species of leafcutter ants appear to have changed actinomycete partners multiple times throughout the history of their symbioses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cafaro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McDonald et al., 2019</xref>), which has likely led to increased diversity of associated antimicrobials found across and within species of leafcutter ants. Such a strategy makes sense given that leafcutter ants are in a constant arms race with a specific pathogen (<italic>Escovopsis</italic> sp.) that may evolve resistance over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batey et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The specialized metabolite richness we observe directly in frass from wild <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries surpasses that described for beewolves and leafcutter ants. One possible explanation for this richness is that the unique vulnerabilities associated with the high nutritional content of frass, and the important role it plays in <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> social interactions, may place a premium on maximizing antimicrobial diversity in this material. This may be especially advantageous given that multiple types of opportunistic fungal pathogens, including <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> (based on isolations), and possibly <italic>Beauveria</italic> spp. and/or <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. (based on detection of beauvericin), appear to be common residents in <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries.</p><p>Unlike beewolves and leafcutter ants, <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> does not appear to have specialized structures for maintaining and transporting microbial symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ulyshen, 2018</xref>). Instead, we suggest that <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> relies on coprophagy for transmission of associated microbes across generations, which is a common mechanism for transfer of non-actinomycete symbionts in other insect systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Onchuru et al., 2018</xref>). Our phylogenetic and chemical analysis of 67 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates from <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries indicates that at least three clades, including the <italic>S. padanus, S. scopuliridis</italic>, and <italic>S. cellostaticus</italic> clades, contain members that are highly related despite being isolated from across a wide geographic area. This pattern fits the expectation for symbionts that are likely transmitted to the progeny instead of randomly reacquired from the environment. The idea that coprophagy, which is the primary means of larval nutrient acquisition, may serve as a mechanism for microbial transmission is supported by our findings that multiple representatives of these clades were isolated directly from fresh frass produced by larvae and adult beetles. Beyond this, data from our previous metagenomic analysis indicates that <italic>Streptomyces</italic> inhabit the beetle digestive tract, with a notable enrichment in the posterior hindgut (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Our phylogenetic analysis also indicates that frass contains diverse actinomycetes that are transient or recently acquired members of this system.</p><p>Based on this evidence, the <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> system appears capable of maintaining both stable members and migrants that are constantly sampled from the surrounding environment. Thus, we suggest that in the case of <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> the relatively non-specific nature of coprophagy as a microbial transmission mechanism may enable multiple <italic>Streptomyces</italic> lineages to competitively inhabit this system, resulting in a correspondingly wide profile of antimicrobials with varied mechanisms of action. We note that further experiments will be required to directly verify if coprophagy is the main mode of transmission of associated actinomycetes in this system. Beyond this, a deeper chemical sampling of other insect/actinomycete systems will be required to determine if specialized metabolite richness similar to what we observe here for frass is typical for insects that employ coprophagy as a mode of vertical actinomycete transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications of synergy and antagonism in a system rich in antimicrobials</title><p>The high richness of antimicrobials found in <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> frass suggests that synergy or antagonism between these molecules may be commonplace in this environment. Strains of <italic>S. padanus</italic>, which we isolated from 19/22 of the galleries, typically produce both actinomycins and polyene macrolides (e.g., filipins), and these two antimicrobial families were also detected in frass from multiple galleries. When we tested actinomycin and filipin in combination against an <italic>O. disjunctus</italic>-associated strain of <italic>M. anisopliae</italic>, we found that they were strongly synergistic. Likewise, actinomycin X2 was also robustly synergistic with the most commonly detected antimicrobial in frass, STA-21 (an angucyclinone). Thus, synergism may potentiate the antimicrobial activity of multiple molecules produced by single strains, as well as molecules produced across species. These findings are aligned with previous work that has suggested that some insects, such as beewolves, might make use of cocktails of synergistic antimicrobials akin to ‘combination therapy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Engl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schoenian et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, we also found multiple instances of molecular antagonism, including between filipins and STA-21, and between actinomycin and nactins, which were the second most frequently detected antimicrobial in frass samples. While antagonism between molecules in frass may lead to diminished potency in the short term, emerging evidence indicates that antagonism can guard against the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chait et al., 2007</xref>). Collectively, our in vitro results, and the distributions of antimicrobials we detected in situ, lead us to speculate that the actinomycete community in frass likely produces an ever-shifting landscape of antimicrobial combinations, where their activities are constantly enhanced or dampened, but also buffered against the development of pathogen resistance. We hypothesize that such an environment may present a more challenging target for would-be pathogens compared to one in which a single antimicrobial, or antimicrobial combination, is dominant.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title><italic>O. disjunctus</italic>/actinomycete partnership as a model for investigating the biogeography of specialized metabolism</title><p>The detection of specialized metabolites directly in frass, combined with the expansive range of <italic>O. disjunctus</italic>, enabled us to study the biogeography of specialized metabolism within this system on a continental scale. Remarkably, four of the seven actinomycete compound families we detected in situ, including actinomycins, angucyclinones, nactins, and cycloheximide, were found throughout the range of <italic>O. disjunctus,</italic> with each compound being represented in colonies separated by &gt;1900 km. Given the challenges associated with detecting specialized metabolites in situ, and our stringent thresholds for calling positive compound hits, we hypothesize that some compounds found at low frequency in our analyses are also likely to be widely distributed in <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries. Taken together, these results indicate that the broad cocktail of antimicrobials collectively found in <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries is consistently drawn from the same large molecular cohort over thousands of square kilometers, rather than being regionally limited. This wide geographic distribution of compounds is further supported by our in vitro analyses, with producers of actinomycins, polyene macrolides, bafilomycins, cycloheximide, and PTMs commonly isolated from colonies across the entire sampling area.</p><p>Notably, <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species that are candidates for stable members within this system (i.e., the <italic>S. padanus, S. scopuliridis</italic>, and <italic>S. cellostaticus</italic> clades) were found in galleries distributed across 10 degrees of latitude. Similarly, <italic>S. philanthi</italic> is tightly associated with beewolf wasps across an even greater latitudinal range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaltenpoth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaltenpoth et al., 2014</xref>). The wide latitudinal distribution of the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species associated with these two insect hosts stands in contrast with patterns observed for soil-associated streptomycetes. Specifically, previous studies demonstrated that soil-dwelling streptomycetes, and specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters in soil, were limited to much narrower latitudinal distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Charlop-Powers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choudoir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lemetre et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, results presented here, combined with the studies of beewolf wasps/<italic>S. philanthi</italic>, suggest that by partnering with insects, actinomycetes and their specialized metabolite arsenals can escape normally strong latitudinal constraints.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>The <italic>O. disjunctus</italic>/actinomycete system provides a new platform for investigation of the chemical ecology of specialized metabolites. Notably, this system enables investigation of patterns in microbial specialized metabolism associated with a single insect species in natura across scales ranging from thousands of kilometers to binary microbial interactions at micro scales in the laboratory. In contrast to archetypal insect/actinomycete symbioses that rely on highly specific symbiotes that produce a limited number of antimicrobial compounds, our results suggest that the <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> lifestyle enables both microbial and chemical richness in their galleries. Continued exploration of novel insect/actinomycete systems will be critical to gaining a complete understanding of the strategies and mechanisms that underpin evolutionarily durable chemical defenses against pathogenic microbes in natural settings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemical standards</title><p>Actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich, A1410), actinomycin X2 (Adipogen, BVT-0375), antimycin A (Sigma-Aldrich, A8674), bafilomycin A1 (Cayman Chemical, 11038), bafilomycin B1 (Cayman Chemical, 14005), cycloheximide (ACROS Organics, AC357420010), filipin complex (Sigma-Aldrich, F9765), nigericin sodium salt (Cayman Chemical, 11437), nactins mixture (Cayman Chemical, 19468), novobiocin sodium salt (Calbiochem, 491207), piericidin A (Cayman Chemical, 15379), rubiginone B2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-212793), and STA-21 (Sigma-Aldrich, SML2161).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Culture media</title><p>International <italic>Streptomyces</italic> Project 2 (ISP2)-broth: malt extract 10 g/L, yeast extract 4 g/L, dextrose 4 g/L, pH 7.2.

Molecular networking using the GNPS platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) was also performed for de-replication. The extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) of each chemical feature with a hit in one of the databases was inspected manually in order to evaluate the peak quality using a <italic>m/z</italic> range allowing a mass error of ±5 ppm. For environmental samples, chemical features of interest were validated by checking for their presence in both LC-MS/MS run and three LC-MS runs.

For both culture and environmental extracts, a level 1 identification was assigned when both the retention time and fragmentation pattern were matched with a commercial standard. In the absence of a commercial standard, a level 2 identification was assigned by matching the MS2 spectrum with spectra available in the literature or in the GNPS spectral library. A level 3 identification was assigned based on spectral similarities of the compound and a commercially available standard of an analog compound. In cases in which a MS2 was not detected in a given environmental sample, a hit was considered real only if the retention time and mass accuracy were within our tolerance levels (±0.1 min, ±5 ppm error), and if either two adducts were detected and/or other members of the same family of compounds were also detected in the same sample, we consider such IDs level 2 or 3 depending on the availability of standard spectra. If a MS2 was not detected at all in any of the environmental samples, it was not considered a real hit even if it passed all the criteria above. Compounds of the polyene macrolides family, which are known for being unstable (<bold>5</bold>), were challenging to annotate due to their low peak height. For this reason, our criteria for polyene macrolides annotation in environmental samples were retention time and mass accuracy within our tolerance levels (±0.1 min, ±5 ppm error), presence of at least two adducts in one of the technical replicates, and presence of at least one adduct in two other technical replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Multi-locus sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree construction</title><p>Four genes of selected microbial strains were partially sequenced (16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB, atpD).

Since we chose to report our data based on the observed growth inhibition and not survival, the formula was adjusted according to the Bliss Independence model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bliss, 1939</xref>).

Spores of selected microbes were inoculated in 15 µL (0.4–2.8 × 10<sup>3</sup> CFU of each microbe per microtube) in different combinations. Each combination was tested separately in eight different microtubes (biological replicates): (i) a single microbe per tube, (ii) one streptomycete + <italic>M. anisopliae</italic>, and (iii) two streptomycetes. Each microbe was also added to empty microtubes as a growth control, and some microtubes containing frass were inoculated with sterile water as a sterility control. In the case of multiple microbes per tube, spores of each microbe were pre-mixed before adding them to the frass. Therefore, each treatment had its own initial inoculum, which was plated to verify the exact initial concentration of each microbe in each treatment by CFU count. All tubes were vortexed for 3 s and spun down for another 3 s. Microtubes were then incubated at 30°C for 1 week. After the incubation time, 100 µL of a solution of 0.03% of Tween80 was added to each tube and vortexed for 30 s, left at RT for 1 hr, and vortexed again for another 30 s to detach cells from the frass. An aliquot of each tube was serially diluted and plated for CFU count. The rest of the material was extracted with ethyl acetate (aqueous phase) and methanol (frass material). Crude extracts were submitted for metabolomics analysis using the same pipeline described above. In both cases of initial and final CFU counts, <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> counts were performed using PDA plates supplemented with apramycin (25 µg/mL) to suppress the growth of the co-inoculated streptomycete, and streptomycetes counts were performed using ISP2-agar plates.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the staff at Rock Creek and Jean Lafitte national parks for granting us the permission to collect samples inside the parks; Michael E Rush, Terry Presswood, Theresa Presswood, and Janice Tharaldson for granting us access to their private properties and for the support given during sample collection; Daniel and Robbie Williams, and their family, especially Caden Williams, for helping us locate and collect preliminary samples on their land; and Cindy Pino, Vineetha Zacharia, and Carlos E R Machado for their support during the fieldwork.

Overall, the manuscript is well-written and impressive in scope, providing both natural survey data and extensive follow-up experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The claim for 'relaxed symbiont specificity' (from title and abstract) is not well supported. Actually, the work provides support for O. disjuctus having specificity for <italic>Streptomycespadanus</italic>. We believe that you will probably agree that it is extremely likely that some of the actinomycetes you isolated are not actually symbionts of <italic>O. disjuctus</italic>. In addition to beetle symbionts, you almost certainly obtained strains associated with the decomposing logs the beetles consume and live within, as well as environmental contaminants (e.g., from soil, etc). On line 139, you indicate you sampled wood from within galleries, but it does not appear to be used in a way that can inform on wood associated strains versus frass/beetle isolates. Likewise, it would have been helpful to sample decomposing parts of logs not colonized by beetles, to help determine if any of the commonly isolated <italic>Streptomyces</italic> are just ubiquitous within this plant material. We envision that you can address these points without doing more experiments, by improving on the analyses, such as making better use of the metagenomes you have available for O. disjuctus and including analyses of all the sequenced strains (not removing the duplicates, line 221-222) and evaluating the source of each (frass, beetles, wood, etc). Alternatively, you could just rework the manuscript to avoid making claims around specificity and be more conservative with the use of the word 'symbiont' universally for all strains.</p><p>2. You have not directly shown a benefit to the beetles from the <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. We recognize that experiments directly testing this would be difficult, and a lot of compelling indirect support is provided. Nevertheless, it remains possible that <italic>Streptomyces</italic> strains produce antimicrobials to inhibit competitors for the wood substrate/frass and that this provides no immune benefit to beetles. We think you can address this in three possible ways. First, make a stronger case for the benefit around gallery hygiene (the interesting finding of Beauvericin in a significant number of galleries in the field is something you can use to help with this). Second, you can make the case for some of these <italic>Streptomyces</italic> having the potential for being nutritional symbionts (see point 4 included). Third, reword the paper to reduce the sometimes very strong statements around conferred antimicrobial defense for beetles (e.g., from the end of the abstract 'Together, these findings support a model in which coprophagy as a vertical transmission mechanism leads to relaxed symbiote specificity, resulting in a rich and dynamic repertoire of antimicrobials that insulates <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> against the evolution of pathogen resistance.'). The linking to evolution of pathogen resistance seems a stretch too far.</p><p>3. More is needed to test the importance of coprophagy for the vertical transmission of symbionts. To test vertical transmission, you could sample the gallery, the frass, and the intestinal gut of the larvae (potentially also the pupae).</p><p>4. Isolate fungi in that ecosystem that could account for the presence of Beauvericin.</p><p>5. Additional information is needed to assess the validity of the chemical analysis reported. As it stands, it is not a metabolomic profiling but a chemical analysis to find known compounds related to microorganisms. With regards to experimental details, please include if DIA or DDA experiments were used to obtain MS/MS experiments and add three sample TICs (frass from adult, from larvae and gallery if available) in the supplementary material. We suggest performing a multivariate analysis of a feature table from the MS experiments, and validating your findings on prevalence of compounds using PLS-DA. See for example these works: Ernst, M et al. Assessing specialized metabolite diversity in the cosmopolitan plant genus Euphorbia L. Front. Plant. Sci. 2019. 10:846. And Reverter, M et al.

Your revised article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Peter Turnbaugh as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Rutz as the Senior Editor. Following our discussions, the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Please amend the title and abstract to qualify the claims of 'high antimicrobial richness' and its association with 'loose partner specificity'; for clarification, please see the detailed comments by Reviewer #2 below, which refer to essential revision points 1-3 from the first round of review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Point 1:</p><p>De Bary coined the term 'symbiosis' for lichens, where it is clear that the organisms involved are clearly 'living together' and not transient. The issue here is not around 'mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism', but rather determining if strains are 'living together' with the beetles or not.</p><p>The use of the word 'loose' is better than 'relaxed' in the new version of the manuscript. Nevertheless, the evidence in support of an association between <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> and the so-called 'loosely associated' strains of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> is still limited. The authors argue that this is supported by the 'high diversity of <italic>Streptomyces</italic>-produced compounds' present in frass in <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries in situ and the identification of nactins in 15/22 galleries. Of the compounds identified in situ, the Actinomycins, Bafimycins, Flipins, and Angucylinones are all associated with the closely associated clades of <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. That just leaves the nactins as the only compound found more than a few times in situ in frass (e.g., Alteramides in 2 galleries, piericidin A in 1 gallery). I do not find this is particularly compelling for claiming 'high antimicrobial richness' associated with 'loose partner specificity'. The evidence for in vitro production is not informative, as it assumes without evidence that the strain is 'living together' with <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> and that the compound is produced in situ, with the latter even being contradicted by the lack of detection in situ.</p><p>Points 2 and 3:</p><p>The authors have improved their manuscript relating to point 2 (e.g. adding the potential nutritional symbiosis). The responses to each of these two points focuses a lot on the findings around <italic>S. padanus</italic>. For example, <italic>S. padanus</italic> is shown to be a superior competitor in frass. I'm fine with this, but it argues against the claim of 'loose' associations relevant to point 1. Further, the case for coprophagy and vertical transmission is largely focused on the three main clades of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> found with <italic>O. disjunctus</italic>. I should point out that finding <italic>Streptomyces</italic> in the guts of larvae and adults provides only minimal evidence for vertical transmission.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65091.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Alternatively, you could just rework the manuscript to avoid making claims around specificity and be more conservative with the use of the word 'symbiont' universally for all strains.</p></disp-quote><p>In our initial submission, we adopted the broad definition of symbiont coined by De Bary in 1879, which describes symbiosis as &quot;the living together of unlike organisms&quot; (Martin and Schwab, 2012; Saffo, 1993) and encompasses mutualism, commensalism and parasitism. Such a broad definition might require that we consider any strain isolated from within a beetle gallery to be a potential symbiont. However, we acknowledge that there are competing definitions in the literature around the term “symbiont” (which we certainly do not wish to take a stand on here). Beyond this, outside of a few specific streptomycete clades (e.g. <italic>S. padanus</italic>, <italic>S. cellostaticus</italic> and <italic>S. scopuliridis</italic>), we agree with the reviewers that some of the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> we isolated are likely transient or new immigrants in this system. In the light of the reviewers’ comments we opted to be more conservative regarding use of the word ‘symbiont’ in the revised version of this manuscript, especially in regards to strains that fall outside of clades that are likely stably-associated with <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries. Changes have been accordingly throughout the manuscript (lines 36, 44, 75, 86, 105, 429, 438, 543-544, 573, 608).</p><p>As noted by the reviewers, we suggest that at least three <italic>Streptomyces</italic> clades (<italic>S. padanus</italic>, <italic>S. cellostaticus</italic> and <italic>S. scopuliridis</italic>) have a stable association with <italic>O. disjunctus</italic>, given that these clades are composed by highly related strains which were isolated from distant galleries (~1900 km apart), and from both larvae and adults. These three clades, plus the abundance of the other streptomycetes we isolated which may or may not be true symbionts, represent a higher level of potential partner diversity compared to other well-studied archetypal insect/actinomycetes associations, such as the leafcutter ants and beewolf wasps in which only one partner strongly dominates per insect species. Beyond this, we have shown that a high diversity of streptomycete-produced compounds is present in frass in <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> galleries in situ. Our analyses suggest that this diversity of compounds can only be accounted for by a phylogenetically diverse set of metabolically-active <italic>Streptomyces</italic> being present in these galleries. This <italic>Streptomyces</italic> diversity must extend beyond the three stably-associated clades identified here, since for example, nactins (found in 15/22 galleries) are not produced by <italic>S. padanus</italic>, <italic>S. cellostaticus</italic>, or <italic>S. scopuliridis</italic>. Taken together this evidence points to a system that accommodates a comparatively higher level of partner diversity and thus a correspondingly lower level of partner specificity. The terminology for describing systems with many potential symbiotic partners seems relatively poorly defined. Thus, we settled on the term “relaxed” in our prior submission. The term “relaxed” was substituted with “loose” in the new version in an attempt to more accurately capture our meaning.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we built an additional tree (using only the 16S rRNA gene) that included duplicate strains that were removed from the main tree presented in Figure 4 (due to our not wanting to saturate the tree with sequences potentially representing co-isolated clones). As perhaps the reviewers hypothesized, this new tree further reinforces the conclusions made above (i.e. a few clades are robustly associated with <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> frass, while others seem more ambiguous). This new tree was incorporated into the manuscript as Figure 4—figure supplement 6.</p><p>We would also like to point out a new analysis we performed in response to the feedback we received from the reviewers. We built another phylogenetic tree (using the 16S rRNA gene) with our isolates plus sequences available in GenBank for 101 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> from soil sampled from diverse sites around the world in a single study (Schlatter and Kinkel, 2014), and more than 200 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> strains isolated from diverse groups of insects including tropical passalid beetles, termites, bees, wasps and ants (Benndorf et al., 2018; Matarrita-Carranza et al., 2017; Vargas-Asensio et al., 2014). This tree showed that the majority of our isolates grouped in clades with strains isolated from diverse insects from distant parts of the world. In contrast, most of our isolates were not found in interdigitated with isolates from soil. Such a phylogenetic distribution might indicate that most of our isolates belong to lineages that form ready associations with insects. We appreciate that more work would need to be done to further explore these patterns. This new tree was incorporated into the manuscript as Figure 4—figure supplement 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. You have not directly shown a benefit to the beetles from the Streptomyces. We recognize that experiments directly testing this would be difficult, and a lot of compelling indirect support is provided. Nevertheless, it remains possible that Streptomyces strains produce antimicrobials to inhibit competitors for the wood substrate/frass and that this provides no immune benefit to beetles.

The linking to evolution of pathogen resistance seems a stretch too far.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, with which we fundamentally agree. Any benefit the beetles derive from the panoply of antimicrobial compounds made by these <italic>Streptomyces</italic> likely comes from enhanced gallery hygiene, and possibly enhanced hygiene of pupal chambers. These molecules are not a substitute for the immune system of the beetles. We have made changes throughout the manuscript, as suggested, to clarify this point (lines 45-46, 106-108, 430-431).</p><p>We also agree with the reviewers that it is very likely that the antimicrobials that <italic>Streptomyces</italic> strains produce might be used in competition among them. A number of our experimental results and statements made in the manuscript are consistent with this idea. We tested this competition hypothesis in our pairwise frass assay between <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, and found that the selected strains compete strongly when growing on frass, and that <italic>S. padanus</italic> is a superior competitor. We also note this idea on lines 541-545: “Thus, we suggest that in the case of <italic>O. disjunctus</italic>, coprophagy as a microbial transmission mechanism may lead to loose partner specificity and increased competition among the streptomycete community, resulting in a correspondingly wide profile of antimicrobials with varied mechanisms of action.”. This chemical warfare may certainly have the indirect effect of keeping the galleries free of fungal pathogens. In addition, the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> and fungal pathogens may compete directly in the frass environment. This idea is consistent with the results shown in Figure 6D, in which all three <italic>Streptomyces</italic> strains directly inhibited <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic> growth in frass.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for calling attention to the idea of nutritional symbiosis and agree that this is an important hypothesis to be discussed, even though we did not perform any specific experiments to test it. Indeed, <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. are known producers of enzymes that degrade wood components, e.g. cellulose, lignin and xylose (Book et al., 2014, 2016). Therefore, the streptomycete community associated with <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> might be playing a nutritional role in this system as well. In fact, work that was performed in Costa Rica on this topic analyzed the streptomycete community associated with tropical passalid beetles, which provided strong evidence that <italic>Streptomyces</italic> play an important role as nutritional symbionts (Vargas-Asensio et al., 2014). Consistent with this idea, when we cultured three strains directly on frass material (which is largely composed by partially digested wood components) as the only nutrient source, all strains displayed robust growth (Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 1). This result indicates that at least these three <italic>Streptomyces</italic> could be part of the “external rumen” that provides valuable nutrients to both adults and larvae. We modified the manuscript accordingly to include the discussion of this important topic (lines 481-486).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. More is needed to test the importance of coprophagy for the vertical transmission of symbionts. To test vertical transmission, you could sample the gallery, the frass, and the intestinal gut of the larvae (potentially also the pupae).</p></disp-quote><p>As presented in the grey-scale heatmap in the interior of Figure 4, we analyzed strains isolated from old frass/gallery wood (representing strains that are present within the galleries); pupal chamber material/pupal swabs (representing strains associated with pupa); and fresh frass collected inside Petri dishes from both individual adults and larvae (representing a snapshot of the intestinal gut microbial composition of these two developmental stages). We want to note that finding galleries with larvae present was challenging, and we were fortunate that we found three of them (2-DC, 15-FL and 17-LA). Even though the number of samples from the larval stage was very low (13.6% of the galleries), we isolated multiple strains from larval frass, including members of the three clades we highlighted as stable members in this system (<italic>S. padanus, S. cellostaticus</italic>, and <italic>S. scopuliridis</italic>) (Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 6). These findings show that at least these three main clades are present during different developmental stages and are likely widespread within galleries across the eastern US.</p><p>Collectively, our findings support the idea that some clades are being transmitted across <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> generations. Given that no mycangia have been described in passalid beetles, we propose coprophagy as a possible mode for vertical transmission to the progeny, as seen for other insects (Onchuru et al., 2018). We base this on the fact that (1) frass is the major, if not the only, food source provided to the larvae by their parents, (2) strains of the three highlighted clades were isolated from adult and larval fresh frass, which is a snapshot of the gut content, and (3) the finding of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> DNA in the metagenomics analysis of <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> gut by members of our team (Appendix 1 – Figure 6). Additionally, a recent cultured-based analysis of tropical passalid beetles guts showed the presence of <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, indicating that this group of bacteria is present in the guts of the tropical relatives of the beetles studied here (Vargas-Asensio et al., 2014). We have revised the passages about this topic for clarity (lines 219-290, 525-549). Nonetheless, we agree that more experimentation could further substantiate the idea that vertical transmission through coprophagy occurs in this system, and we acknowledge this in the revised version (lines 547-549).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Isolate fungi in that ecosystem that could account for the presence of Beauvericin.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not exactly sure what the reviewers have in mind regarding this request. Our original intent was to assess the <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> system for potential actinomycete partnerships. However, the finding of beauvericin in frass from many galleries, and the presence of <italic>Metarhizium</italic> spp. Isolated from a gallery and from an <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> carcass found in the field, underscored the potential importance of fungal pathogens in this system. While we do not currently have any fungal isolates that produce beauvericin, we note that this compound identification was validated using a commercial standard (Appendix 1 – Figure 1) with high confidence. Beauvericin is a well-known fungal metabolite that has insecticidal, antimicrobial, nematocidal, and anti-tumor activity (Wang and Xu, 2012), and its origins as a mycotoxin are undisputed. For these reasons, we suggest that its detection indicates that entomopathogens like <italic>Beauveria</italic> spp. and/or <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp., which are well-documented producers of beauvericin (Hamill et al., 1969; Logrieco et al., 1998), might be present and posing a threat to the galleries. To clarify this, we made minor modifications in lines 175-176, 179-180, 473-474 and 522.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Additional information is needed to assess the validity of the chemical analysis reported. As it stands, it is not a metabolomic profiling but a chemical analysis to find known compounds related to microorganisms. With regards to experimental details, please include if DIA or DDA experiments were used to obtain MS/MS experiments and add three sample TICs (frass from adult, from larvae and gallery if available) in the supplementary material. We suggest performing a multivariate analysis of a feature table from the MS experiments, and validating your findings on prevalence of compounds using PLS-DA. See for example these works: Ernst, M et al. Assessing specialized metabolite diversity in the cosmopolitan plant genus Euphorbia L. Front. Plant. Sci. 2019. 10:846. And Reverter, M et al.

Sci. 2020. doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.613471</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We welcome the opportunity to fully clarify any questions regarding our chemical analysis. All data were acquired using data-dependent analysis (DDA), sending for fragmentation the 5 most intense ions (also known as a Top5 method), excluding repetitive ions for 5 seconds (dynamic exclusion). This information was added in lines 705-706.</p><p>In terms of environmental sampling, we performed direct extractions of gallery ‘old frass’ and pupal chamber material. We did not perform extractions of fresh frass from adult/larvae, rather we reserved that material for microbial isolations. Therefore, we have added to the supplementary material the TIC of old frass extract from two randomly selected galleries and pupal chamber material extract from one randomly selected gallery, and we also provided the EIC of selected specialized metabolites detected in these samples (Appendix 1 – Figure 4).</p><p>With regard to additional information to assess the validity of the chemical analyses, we would like to point to the extensive supplementary tables that were curated by directly checking each one of the original unconverted spectra files to assess the confidence of the ions detected in the feature table: (1) Supplementary File 1C – Table S3: Identified compounds detected in the frass of each gallery with their respective observed <italic>m/z</italic> of different adducts, retention time (Rt), peak height, and presence of a manually checked MS2 spectrum; (2) Supplementary File 1D – Table S4: Peak heights of annotated compounds detected in each technical replicate of the LC-MS analyses of the environmental frass; (3) Supplementary File 1E – Table S5: Details on the annotation of each one of the 25 compounds. These tables are the result of a manual check of the extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) of each annotated ion. We would also like to point out to the representative MS2 spectra of annotated compounds and commercial chemical standards in Appendix 1 – Figure 1.</p><p>We agree that multivariate analyses are very useful for comparing and detecting patterns in untargeted metabolomics data. To this end we have performed an additional hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) on the feature table from the untargeted runs of the extracts from each of our <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates grown in vitro, and compared it to the phylogenetic tree using a tanglegram (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). This analysis was inspired by the excellent Ernst <italic>et al.</italic> 2019 paper pointed out by the reviewers. In this case we see a very clear correlation between the phylogenetic relationships of the isolates and the content of their metabolomes.</p><p>Near the beginning of this project, we performed multiple NMDS analyses of the frass extracts from all the galleries, but we were not confident of any patterns related to latitude, longitude, altitude, north/central/south subdivision, or frass pH. Our current best guess is that the chemical features present in the frass extracts are probably dominated by compounds associated with the various wood types. <italic>O. disjunctus</italic> does not feed on logs of a specific tree species, and we did not control for this when sampling galleries. We have not performed DNA analyses to assess the tree species of each gallery. Thus, we elected not to include these analyses, since they could potentially invite misleading interpretations. Instead, we chose to pursue a more conservative analysis of the frass, presenting only presence/absence data of the known microbial metabolites that we could annotate with confidence, and stepping away from a broader metabolomic profiling of this material. We made minor changes in the text to make it clear that we focused on a small subset of compounds instead of full metabolomic profiling of the frass material (lines 98 and 157).</p><p>References:</p><p>Benndorf, R., Guo, H., Sommerwerk, E., Weigel, C., Garcia-Altares, M., Martin, K., Hu, H., Küfner, M., de Beer, Z.

The issue here is not around 'mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism', but rather determining if strains are 'living together' with the beetles or not.</p><p>The use of the word 'loose' is better than 'relaxed' in the new version of the manuscript. Nevertheless, the evidence in support of an association between O. disjunctus and the so-called 'loosely associated' strains of Streptomyces is still limited. The authors argue that this is supported by the 'high diversity of Streptomyces-produced compounds' present in frass in O. disjunctus galleries in situ and the identification of nactins in 15/22 galleries. Of the compounds identified in situ, the Actinomycins, Bafimycins, Flipins, and Angucylinones are all associated with the closely associated clades of Streptomyces. That just leaves the nactins as the only compound found more than a few times in situ in frass (e.g., Alteramides in 2 galleries, piericidin A in 1 gallery). I do not find this is particularly compelling for claiming 'high antimicrobial richness' associated with 'loose partner specificity'. The evidence for in vitro production is not informative, as it assumes without evidence that the strain is 'living together' with O. disjunctus and that the compound is produced in situ, with the latter even being contradicted by the lack of detection in situ.</p><p>Points 2 and 3:</p><p>The authors have improved their manuscript relating to point 2 (e.g. adding the potential nutritional symbiosis). The responses to each of these two points focuses a lot on the findings around S. padanus. For example, S. padanus is shown to be a superior competitor in frass. I'm fine with this, but it argues against the claim of 'loose' associations relevant to point 1. Further, the case for coprophagy and vertical transmission is largely focused on the three main clades of Streptomyces found with O. disjunctus. I should point out that finding Streptomyces in the guts of larvae and adults provides only minimal evidence for vertical transmission.</p></disp-quote><p>We were encouraged by last round of review, in which you requested changes be made to the title and abstract.
