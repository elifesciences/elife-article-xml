FD patients have small trigeminal nerves and impaired facial pain and temperature perception. These signals are relayed by nociceptive neurons in the trigeminal ganglion, a structure that is composed of both neural crest- and placode-derived cells. Mice lacking <italic>Elp1</italic> in neural crest derivatives (‘<italic>Elp1</italic> CKO’) are born with small trigeminal ganglia, suggesting Elp1 is important for trigeminal ganglion development, yet the function of Elp1 in this context is unknown. We demonstrate that Elp1, expressed in both neural crest- and placode-derived neurons, is not required for initial trigeminal ganglion formation. However, <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO trigeminal neurons exhibit abnormal axon outgrowth and deficient target innervation. Developing nociceptors expressing the receptor TrkA undergo early apoptosis in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO, while TrkB- and TrkC-expressing neurons are spared, indicating Elp1 supports the target innervation and survival of trigeminal nociceptors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that specific TrkA deficits in the <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO trigeminal ganglion reflect the neural crest lineage of most TrkA neurons versus the placodal lineage of most TrkB and TrkC neurons. Altogether, these findings explain defects in cranial gangliogenesis that may lead to loss of facial pain and temperature sensation in FD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>trigeminal ganglion</kwd><kwd>neural crest cells</kwd><kwd>placode cells</kwd><kwd>trigeminal nerves</kwd><kwd>trks</kwd><kwd>familial dysautonomia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taneyhill</surname><given-names>Lisa A</given-names></name><name><surname>Lefcort</surname><given-names>Frances</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Trigeminal nerve deficits observed in familial dysautonomia, which arises from mutations in <italic>ELP1</italic>, are due to loss of neural crest-derived TrkA nociceptors, while placode-derived TrkB and TrkC neurons are spared.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSANs) are a group of phenotypically similar, yet distinct, peripheral nervous system disorders that stem from unique mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schwartzlow and Kazamel, 2019</xref>). The most prevalent form is HSAN type III, or familial dysautonomia (FD), which is almost exclusively caused by a mutation in intron 20 of the elongator complex protein 1 <italic>(ELP1</italic>, formerly <italic>IKBKAP</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Slaugenhaupt et al., 2001</xref>). This mutation causes mis-splicing and skipping of exon 20 in a tissue-specific manner, consequently reducing ELP1 protein in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Slaugenhaupt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hims et al., 2007</xref>). Elp1 is a requisite scaffolding protein of the six-subunit elongator complex that regulates translation by modifying particular tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Karlsborn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Esberg et al., 2006</xref>). Deletion of elongator subunits has been shown to alter tRNA modifications and protein expression in several systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Esberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goffena et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Karlsborn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kojic et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, loss or reduction of Elp1 protein leads directly or indirectly to the clinical phenotypes seen in FD, which include impaired pain and temperature sensation, feeding and swallowing difficulties, blood pressure instability, tachycardia, optic neuropathy, and gastrointestinal dysfunction, among other symptoms. The disease is fatal, with the majority of patients dying by age 50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gold-von Simson and Axelrod, 2006</xref>). Autopsy reports, patient studies, and animal models demonstrate FD phenotypes are caused by abnormal neurodevelopment, in addition to neurodegeneration across the lifespan of the affected individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pearson et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hunnicutt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">George et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Won et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lefcort et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dietrich and Dragatsis, 2016</xref>).</p><p>FD severely impacts the peripheral nervous system, composed of sensory and autonomic neurons that are mostly derived from neural crest cells and some cranial sensory neurons that arise from ectodermal placodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Méndez-Maldonado et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steventon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kameneva and Adameyko, 2019</xref>). Since mice null for <italic>Elp1</italic> are embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dietrich et al., 2011</xref>), FD has been modeled in mice using conditional knockout of <italic>Elp1</italic> in neural crest cells (<italic>Elp1<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Wnt1-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>, abbreviated ‘<italic>Elp1</italic> CKO’), which recapitulates several aspects of the human disease, including significant loss of sensory and autonomic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">George et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>). To date, these studies have focused on mechanisms of Elp1 in sensory and sympathetic neurons in the trunk. However, FD patients also experience cranial sensory deficits such as impaired sensation of facial pain and temperature, neurogenic dysphagia, absent corneal reflexes, and reduced basal lacrimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mendoza-Santiesteban et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Palma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barlow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geltzer et al., 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutiérrez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Palma et al., 2018</xref>). These functions rely on input from the trigeminal nerve, the largest of the cranial nerves, which contains axons of sensory neurons that reside in the trigeminal ganglion. A quantitative MRI study revealed FD patients have smaller trigeminal nerves compared to healthy, age-matched individuals, but there are no indications of progressive trigeminal nerve degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Won et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, trigeminal ganglia of <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO mice are reduced in size at birth compared to Controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>). Together, these findings suggest Elp1 may play an important role in the development of trigeminal sensory neurons, a critical aspect of FD that has yet to be explored.</p><p>While peripheral neurons in the trunk are exclusively neural crest-derived, cranial sensory neurons arise from two progenitor populations, neural crest cells and ectodermal placodes, which typically contribute neurons to spatially distinct regions of the cranial ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">York et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moody and LaMantia, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Park and Saint-Jeannet, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steventon et al., 2014</xref>). The trigeminal ganglion is unique in that it contains intermixed neural crest- and placode-derived neurons that rely on one another for proper migration, coalescence, and function during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blentic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">D’Amico-Martel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">D’Amico-Martel and Noden, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Freter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hamburger, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Saint-Jeannet and Moody, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shiau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steventon et al., 2014</xref>). Shortly after differentiation, trigeminal ganglion neuron subtypes are discernable by mutually exclusive expression of tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) receptors, TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC, which are required for target innervation and long-term survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilkinson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Scott-Solomon and Kuruvilla, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reichardt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 1999b</xref>). Importantly, Trk expression generally correlates with the ultimate sensory modality encoded by a particular neuron; for example, small-diameter TrkA neurons are typically associated with pain and temperature perception, while large-diameter TrkB and TrkC neurons are usually mechanoreceptors that sense touch, pressure, and vibrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Genç et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">d’Amico-Martel and Noden, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">D’Amico-Martel and Noden, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davies and Lumsden, 1984</xref>).</p><p>In dorsal root, epibranchial (sensory), and sympathetic (autonomic) ganglia, Elp1 is required for the generation and/or survival of TrkA and TrkB neurons, while TrkC neurons are spared during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">George et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tolman et al., 2022</xref>). In these contexts, neuronal loss has been attributed to decreased neurogenesis resulting from early differentiation and apoptosis of progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">George et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goffena et al., 2018</xref>) and to severe target innervation defects and neuronal apoptosis due to insufficient neurotrophic support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tolman et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, other less common forms of HSANs arise from germline mutations in the genes encoding either TrkA or its high-affinity ligand, nerve growth factor (NGF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schwartzlow and Kazamel, 2019</xref>). A growing body of evidence from animal models suggests Elp1 regulates TrkA signaling as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abashidze et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lefler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Naftelberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2020</xref>), although the relationship between Elp1 and TrkA has not been investigated in the cranial ganglia. While there are clear trigeminal sensory deficits in FD, the function of Elp1 in the trigeminal ganglion and its nerves remains unexamined. Moreover, it is unknown whether certain neuronal subtypes within the trigeminal ganglion are more vulnerable to Elp1 loss than others, or whether trigeminal sensory phenotypes in FD patients arise from defects in neural crest-derived neurons, placodal neurons, or both.</p><p>Here, we describe the first comprehensive analysis of neurodevelopmental changes in the trigeminal ganglion using an established <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO mouse model of FD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">George et al., 2013</xref>). We observe that Elp1 protein is enriched in the cytoplasm of differentiated neural crest- and placode-derived neurons in the trigeminal ganglion. In <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO mice, initial formation of the trigeminal ganglion appears unaltered, but trigeminal nerve growth is severely diminished as development proceeds. Innervation deficits correlate with decreased TrkA levels in the peripheral and central projections of trigeminal ganglion neurons and a significant reduction in the number of TrkA neurons due to early apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrate that the majority of TrkA neurons in the trigeminal ganglion are neural crest-derived, whereas the majority of TrkB and TrkC neurons are placode-derived, explaining the specific TrkA defects in the neural crest-targeted <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO. Collectively, these findings indicate Elp1 is required for proper target innervation and survival of neural crest-derived TrkA neurons in the trigeminal ganglion. Moreover, the use of a neural crest-specific knockout sheds light on the lineage and dynamics of neuronal subpopulations in the trigeminal ganglion. Importantly, our findings reveal novel neurodevelopmental defects in cranial gangliogenesis that may ultimately contribute to facial sensory deficits experienced by patients with FD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Elp1 protein is enriched in the cytoplasm of trigeminal ganglion sensory neurons</title><p>While ubiquitous Elp1 expression in rodent embryos has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mezey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">George et al., 2013</xref>), the spatiotemporal distribution of Elp1 in the craniofacial complex had not been evaluated.

In contrast, condensed neural crest cells within the trigeminal ganglion, identified by expression of the surface receptor Neuropilin 2 or the transcription factor Pax3, and devoid of Islet1, expressed little to no Elp1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>).</p><p>At E11.5, when neural crest-derived neurons are also present in the trigeminal ganglion, Elp1 protein was observed in all differentiated neurons expressing β-tubulin III (Tubb3) or Islet1, irrespective of their developmental origin, with the highest signal detected in axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-H</xref>). By E12.5, enrichment of Elp1 protein in the neuronal cytoplasm, especially axons, is still apparent, while Elp1 is absent or expressed at relatively low levels in neural crest-derived Sox10-positive glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N–P</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest important functions for Elp1 in developing sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Neural crest-specific deletion of <italic>Elp1</italic> causes progressive morphological abnormalities in the trigeminal ganglion and nerves</title><p>To gain insight into the etiology of FD phenotypes associated with trigeminal ganglion dysfunction, an established mouse model was used, in which <italic>Elp1</italic> is deleted from neural crest cells and their derivatives via Wnt1-Cre-mediated recombination. <italic>Elp1</italic> conditional knockouts (<italic>Wnt1-Cre<sup>+</sup>; Elp1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>, ‘Elp1 CKO’) were compared to littermate Controls (<italic>Wnt1-Cre<sup>-</sup>; Elp1<sup>flox/+</sup></italic>), with at least two litters analyzed per experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">George et al., 2013</xref>).

First, we examined the dynamics of normal neurogenesis and nerve growth in the trigeminal ganglion, with a focus on the maxillary division. Consistent with reports that TrkB and TrkC neurons are born first in the trigeminal ganglion followed by TrkA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 1999b</xref>), immunohistochemistry on trigeminal ganglion serial sections revealed that all three Trk subtypes are present at E11, but the majority of established infraorbital nerve endings are either TrkB- or TrkC-positive, with little contribution from TrkA-expressing axons at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>).

In accordance with previous reports, the number of TrkB and TrkC neurons did not appear to increase between E11.5 and E12.5, but there was a robust increase in the number of TrkA neurons, such that TrkA neurons became the vast majority of trigeminal ganglion neurons by E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I-K</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 1999b</xref>).

The presence of highly enriched Elp1 protein in neuronal cytoplasm, including axonal compartments, suggests there are extranuclear functions for Elp1 in trigeminal ganglion neurons, as noted in studies in other neuronal systems that localize Elp1 to axonal transport and synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abashidze et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Naftelberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tourtellotte, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Elp1 is required for trigeminal nerve outgrowth and innervation of target tissues</title><p>To further explore trigeminal nerve deficits associated with FD, we examined trigeminal ganglion development using an established mouse model in which <italic>Elp1</italic> is conditionally deleted from neural crest cells and their derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">George et al., 2013</xref>). We found the initial formation and gross morphology of the trigeminal ganglion to be similar between <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO and Control embryos, with condensed placodal neurons and infiltrating neural crest cells both present in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Although migration was not directly examined here, our findings complement conclusions that Elp1 is not required for trunk neural crest cell migration or subsequent formation of dorsal root or sympathetic ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abashidze et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">George et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hunnicutt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, knockdown of another elongator complex member, Elp3, inhibits neural crest cell migration in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, suggesting elongator subunits may have distinct individual functions in the neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>As development proceeds, progressive defects in trigeminal nerve outgrowth and innervation are apparent in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO embryos. By collecting high-resolution images of the intact ganglion and nerves over several timepoints, we observed various axonal abnormalities that precede this outcome. In the ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve at E11.5, axons generally extended in the direction of their respective targets, but many deviated from established fascicles along the way, resulting in disorganized nerves with a ‘hairy’ appearance from ectopic branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). By E12.5, at least some trigeminal axons reached their respective target tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In the ophthalmic division of <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO, the frontal nerve initially extended branches around the eye (albeit less elaborately than in Controls, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) but then retracted by E13, resulting in an even less complex pattern of innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, at least some frontal nerve axons in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO are able to reach their target site but are not maintained. In contrast, the medial and lateral nasal nerves (also ophthalmic division) never formed in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), indicating nasal nerve axons failed to navigate to their target destinations. These data suggest Elp1 is required for axonal outgrowth and proper target innervation in trigeminal ganglion neurons. Even more striking is the occurrence of unique phenotypes in distinct trigeminal nerve branches upon loss of Elp1 from neural crest derivatives, indicating several context-dependent mechanisms likely contribute to <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO and FD phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Elp1 is required for survival of TrkA neurons in the trigeminal ganglion</title><p>Given the drastic trigeminal nerve innervation deficits observed in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO mice, we assessed the different Trk receptor-expressing neuron subpopulations in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO and Control trigeminal ganglia.

Additionally, there were fewer TrkA neurons in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO trigeminal ganglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This result was particularly intriguing since FD patients have reduced facial pain and temperature sensation, and TrkA-expressing sensory neurons generally develop into small-diameter nociceptors that relay pain and temperature signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Genç et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reichardt, 2006</xref>).</p><p>A loss of TrkA neurons could potentially be explained by changes in neurogenesis or survival of TrkA-positive neurons. Reduced TrkA numbers in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO dorsal root ganglia have been partially attributed to early cell cycle exit and death of Pax3-positive TrkA progenitors due to reduced DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">George et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goffena et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, we observed no difference in the number of newly differentiated (Six1-positive) neurons in E11.5 <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO trigeminal ganglia. Moreover, Pax3-positive cells in the trigeminal ganglion express little to no Elp1 during the period of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and are reportedly glial, not neuronal, progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, our findings are most consistent with the idea that loss of Elp1 from neural crest cells has major effects after neuronal differentiation, but we have not definitively ruled out neurogenic deficits.</p><p>Collectively, our data suggest that Elp1 is required for trigeminal ganglion axons to grow and properly invade target tissues in order to prevent neuronal apoptosis. Our observations complement previous studies showing Elp1 is required for the survival of TrkA neurons in sympathetic and dorsal root ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">George et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Naftelberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ohlen et al., 2017</xref>). However, our discovery of <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO phenotypes at relatively early timepoints suggests there are additional functions for Elp1 during initial cranial sensory ganglion development. In sympathetic neurons, Elp1 is reported to modulate TrkA/NGF retrograde signaling by regulating the phosphorylation of TrkA receptors in signaling endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2020</xref>). These studies were largely performed in cultured sympathetic neurons, with Elp1 expression perturbed perinatally, therefore bypassing the period of normal axon pathfinding and early innervation that we have examined here. Thus, our analyses of intact and sectioned embryos provide important context for the role of Elp1 in the development of trigeminal TrkA neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Our findings neither confirm nor negate the possibility that Elp1 modulates TrkA/NGF signaling in some trigeminal ganglion neurons. For those axons that successfully navigate to intended targets, deficient TrkA retrograde signaling could lead to subsequent cell death. Indeed, the retraction of axons in the frontal nerve likely indicates an inability to receive and/or appropriately respond to target-derived neurotrophic support, especially considering we and others observe no changes in the expression of NGF in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO target tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">George et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Naftelberg et al., 2016</xref>). However, the loss of TrkA immunoreactivity in distal axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) potentially contradicts this mechanism since the phosphorylation state of TrkA receptors and/or retrograde transport requires adequate TrkA expression in axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Naftelberg et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, we find that some cranial nerve branches, namely the medial and lateral nasal nerves, never form in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO embryos, pre-empting any potential deficits in retrograde signaling. Given our findings, it will be critical to perform detailed spatiotemporal studies to gain a more complete understanding of TrkA and Elp1 sub-cellular expression and trafficking dynamics in trigeminal neurons and the role of Elp1 in these processes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Context-dependent functions for Elp1 exist during trigeminal ganglion neurodevelopment</title><p>The range of <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO phenotypes in different trigeminal nerve branches strongly implies cell type-dependent functions for Elp1, underscoring the inherent differences between distinct neuronal populations. This conclusion is further supported by contradictory observations that neuronal Elp1 depletion can increase or decrease neurite branching in varying contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hunnicutt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abashidze et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ohlen et al., 2017</xref>). While opposing results may be due to variations in developmental timing or species, they may also highlight genuine differences in Elp1 function, depending upon the identity and environment of individual neurons.</p><p>For example, Elp1 may be required for axonal outgrowth via alternative, NGF-independent mechanisms, including anterograde trafficking of receptors for critical growth factors or guidance molecules and/or regulation of local protein synthesis, all of which are required for growing axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Scott-Solomon and Kuruvilla, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ascano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cioni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Korsak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Batista and Hengst, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kang and Schuman, 1996</xref>). Recently, Elp1 has been shown to regulate neuronal gene expression in a dose-dependent manner in a humanized mouse model of FD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morini et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, these functions of Elp1 could be direct or indirect via its essential role as part of the elongator complex in modifying tRNAs during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goffena et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Karlsborn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Karlsborn et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, the dorsal root ganglia proteome in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO exhibits substantial changes (compared to Control) across a wide range of cellular functions, including axon guidance and pathfinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goffena et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In support of a potential role for Elp1 in axon pathfinding, we noted some degree of axon wandering along the ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular nerves in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Perhaps in these affected neurons, Elp1 is required for axons to respond to long-distance guidance cues. Alternatively, Elp1 may be required for inter-axonal adhesion or to limit axonal branching in order to maintain appropriate trajectories of newly growing axons along a pre-determined tract. While trigeminal ganglion target tissues express other neurotrophins (e.g. BDNF, NT-3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arumäe et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchman and Davies, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ernfors et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">O’Connor and Tessier-Lavigne, 1999</xref>), the axon defasciculation phenotype observed at E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is likely not due to axons trying to access these neurotrophins. In support of this, we note no further increase in defasciculation at later stages (E12.5 and E13). Given the phenotypes we observe are specific to TrkA neurons, we surmise that the defasciculated neurons are expressing TrkA. Use of alternative neurotrophins like BDNF or NT3, however, would require these neurons to switch receptor expression, and we do not see changes in TrkB or TrkC expression in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO embryos. Instead, we speculate the defasciculation is tied, at least in part, to defects in adhesion among axons, particularly since <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO dorsal root ganglia have dramatically reduced levels of Cadherin-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goffena et al., 2018</xref>). In chick cranial motor neurons, Cadherin-7 enhances axonal outgrowth and restricts interstitial axon branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barnes et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, Elp1 plays a role in adhesion in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Johansen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen-Kupiec et al., 2011</xref>). Whether similar <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO proteome changes or adhesive functions for Elp1 are conserved in the mouse trigeminal ganglion remains to be explored. Notably, with our current approach, it is difficult to attribute axon wandering to a specific cellular mechanism, that is, increased branching versus reduced adhesion, etc., due to the inability to isolate individual axons. In the future, it would be informative to apply recently published methods to analyze single axon trajectories of trigeminal ganglion neurons in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Motahari et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Insights into neural crest versus placodal neurogenesis in the developing trigeminal ganglion</title><p>Over the course of this study, we made several observations regarding the temporal sequence of events during trigeminal ganglion neurodevelopment. Although the ganglion contains a mixture of neural crest- and placode-derived neurons, which both express Elp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), only neural crest-derived cells were targeted for <italic>Elp1</italic> deletion in these experiments. Since the vast majority of trigeminal ganglion neurons are placode-derived at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Karpinski et al., 2016</xref>), it is not surprising that trigeminal ganglion neuroanatomy and cellular composition were similar between <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO and Control embryos at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, striking alterations in the <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO trigeminal ganglion and nerves were noted after E10.5, with specific effects on TrkA-expressing neurons. We suspected this effect on TrkA neurons in our neural crest-specific knockout may be explained by the lineage of TrkA versus TrkB and TrkC neurons, rather than a TrkA-specific Elp1 mechanism.</p><p>While previous studies had defined Trk receptor expression and proportions of placode- versus neural crest-derived neurons in the E10.5 mouse trigeminal ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilkinson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Karpinski et al., 2016</xref>), the dynamics of neural crest versus placodal neurogenesis after E10.5 were unclear. In the chick trigeminal ganglion, neural crest-derived cells are reportedly found proximal to the neural tube, whereas placodal neurons are situated in distal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steventon et al., 2014</xref>). This pattern does not translate to the mouse trigeminal ganglion, which has been previously described as a mosaic of cellular subtypes with no preferential aggregation of any particular lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Karpinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Karpinski et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, anatomical position is an unreliable tool for predicting placodal versus neural crest lineage in the mouse trigeminal ganglion. Interestingly, studies in the chick trigeminal ganglion attribute large cell body diameter to potential placode lineage, while small diameter cells have been linked to neural crest lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">d’Amico-Martel and Noden, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">D’Amico-Martel and Noden, 1983</xref>). Coincidently, murine TrkB and TrkC neurons tend to have larger cell bodies compared to small-diameter TrkA-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fariñas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 1999a</xref>). While this relationship has not been explicitly investigated in the mouse embryonic trigeminal ganglion, our data provide indirect evidence to support this link between cellular origin and size.</p><p>Our findings confirm that TrkB and TrkC neurons express Six1 and are the most abundant neurons in the trigeminal ganglion at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Subsequently, the ratio of TrkA neurons to TrkB and TrkC neurons drastically increases by E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 1999b</xref>). After E10.5, TrkA neurons, by far, are the most likely to express the transcription factor Six1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and at least 90% of Six1-positive cells are neural crest-derived (Wnt1-Cre-recombined) at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These results strongly suggest that: (1) TrkB and TrkC neurons are born first from placodal precursors, (2) the majority of TrkA neurons arise later from neural crest progenitors, and (3) Six1 is transiently expressed in all newly differentiated trigeminal ganglion neurons, as it is in the dorsal root ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yajima et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, Six1 is not a reliable marker of placodal lineage in the trigeminal ganglion after neural crest neurogenesis commences.</p><p>To provide experimental evidence for these assertions, we used the <italic>Wnt1-Cre; ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> reporter mouse in which the majority of neural crest derivatives express GFP. We quantified the number of RFP-expressing (non-Wnt1-Cre-recombined, presumably placode-derived) neurons in the trigeminal ganglion after the conclusion of neurogenesis. At E15.5, approximately one quarter of TrkA neurons expressed RFP, while three quarters of TrkB and TrkC neurons expressed RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our results complement a recent study which found that approximately two-thirds of TrkA neurons are Wnt1-Cre-recombined in the trigeminal ganglion of 8-day-old mice (TrkB and TrkC Wnt1-Cre ratios were not reported, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Karpinski et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, these data indicate the Trk-expressing neuronal composition within the trigeminal ganglion is established during mid- to late-gestation and remains fairly constant into early postnatal life.</p><p>Intriguingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Karpinski et al., 2022</xref> also reported targeted effects on TrkA neurons in the 22q11DS deletion mouse, which are preceded by premature neurogenic divisions of neural crest cells and increased variation of neuronal gene expression at E9.5 and E10.5, respectively. Using Six1 as a placode lineage marker, the authors concluded that greater proportions of Six1-positive cells and increased co-localization of Six1 and Wnt1-Cre in the trigeminal ganglion indicated a shift toward placodal differentiation within the 22q11DS trigeminal ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Karpinski et al., 2022</xref>). Adopting the assumption that Six1 is expressed in newly differentiated neurons regardless of lineage, their findings can be reinterpreted instead through the lens of premature neural crest neurogenesis, leading to more Six1-positive cells and increased Six1/Wnt1-Cre co-localization and therefore would complement our conclusions. Moreover, the inclusion of (prematurely differentiated) neural crest-derived neurons along with placode-derived neurons could be an additional or alternative explanation for the increased variation in neuronal gene expression in the 22q11DS trigeminal ganglion at E10.5. Therefore, our findings are broadly relevant for the understanding of normal trigeminal ganglion neurogenesis and suggest that neural crest disorders and/or animal models which genetically target neural crest cells are likely to induce biased effects on TrkA neurons within the trigeminal ganglion.</p><p>In light of our conclusions, it follows that there were no observed differences in placode-derived TrkB or TrkC neurons in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO embryos at the examined stages. Moreover, we did not detect similar neurodevelopmental perturbations in the exclusively placode-derived geniculate ganglion, which contains few, if any, TrkA-expressing neurons at E12.5. Given that Elp1 is expressed in placode-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), and recent reports showing Elp1 is required for the survival of TrkB-positive neurons in epibranchial ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tolman et al., 2022</xref>), we suspect a placode-targeted deletion of Elp1 would lead to TrkB neuronal deficits in the trigeminal and geniculate ganglia. It is also possible that placode-derived TrkB or TrkC neurons will be indirectly affected at later timepoints in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO, given the important reciprocal interactions between the two lineages during trigeminal ganglion development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shiau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shiau and Bronner-Fraser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu and Taneyhill, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steventon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). It would be informative to selectively delete <italic>Elp1</italic> from placode-derived trigeminal ganglion neurons only, or in addition to neural crest cells, in order to better understand the effects of cell type-specific loss of Elp1 on trigeminal ganglion development. Unfortunately, there are no trigeminal placode-specific Cre drivers available at this time.</p><p>Remarkably, the pattern of nerve deficits in <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO embryos provides indirect evidence that certain branches of trigeminal sensory nerves may also be specifically neural crest- or placode-derived. For instance, innervation of the whisker pad is initiated by E11.5 in both Control and <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, the innervation field does not increase substantially in the <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Surviving nerve terminals express very little TrkA, whereas Control embryos develop a more expansive, TrkA-abundant innervation pattern by E13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that placode-derived neurons may reach the whisker pad first and act as scaffolds upon which later-differentiating TrkA axons can traverse. This is supported by distinct Trk receptor expression in the maxillary nerve at E11, in which the vast majority of early maxillary nerve fibers express TrkB or TrkC, with few initial contributions of TrkA-positive axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, some trigeminal nerve branches never form in the <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO, namely the medial and lateral nasal nerves of the ophthalmic division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), begging the question of whether these nerves are exclusively composed of axons from neural crest-derived neurons. While we hoped to assess this in the <italic>Wnt1-Cre; ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> reporter mouse, the presence of GFP-expressing Schwann cell precursors along the embryonic nerves unfortunately hindered analysis using this approach. Thus, more in-depth studies are required to understand the diversity of interactions between neural crest- and placode-derived cells during trigeminal ganglion neurogenesis and innervation and to understand the nuanced roles that Elp1 has in such a complex system.</p><p>An additional limitation to our studies is that the Wnt1-Cre driver does not target every neural crest cell. Our results are similar to previous reports in the trunk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hari et al., 2012</xref>), in that upward of 90% of Sox10-positive neural crest cells undergo Wnt1-Cre-mediated recombination in the trigeminal ganglion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, a population of non-recombined neural crest derivatives is certainly present in the trigeminal ganglion of <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO and <italic>Wnt1-Cre; ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> reporter mice, which may potentially skew our analyses. Little is known about potential subpopulations of neural crest precursors that may exist within the trigeminal ganglion, whether they differentially contribute to neuronal or glial subpopulations, or whether they are preferentially recombined by Wnt1-Cre. Nonetheless, Wnt1-Cre-mediated recombination is commonly used to target neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Debbache et al., 2018</xref>) and achieves more efficient recombination than other drivers, including Sox10-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jacques-Fricke et al., 2012</xref>). Since the precedent for previous FD animal studies is Wnt1-Cre-mediated deletion of <italic>Elp1</italic>, our current model is useful for the initial characterization of effects on the trigeminal ganglion. There are marked differences, though, in the <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO and the presentation of FD in humans. <italic>Elp1</italic> CKO phenotypes are more extreme due to the complete loss of Elp1 from neural crest derivatives, whereas some Elp1 protein is still present in neurons of FD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Slaugenhaupt et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, it is currently unclear at the cellular level whether certain neuronal subpopulations are more greatly affected in FD patients. In the future, use of alternative Cre drivers or humanized FD mice may provide additional insight into yet undiscovered mechanisms in FD.</p><p>In summary, FD is characterized by a wide range of sensory and autonomic phenotypes, including those that implicate involvement of the cranial trigeminal ganglion and its associated nerves. Through studies in a conditional knockout mouse model that eliminate Elp1 from the neural crest lineage, we have uncovered distinct effects on the development of trigeminal sensory neurons, specifically those expressing TrkA that correlate with nociceptive function. Altogether, these findings highlight defects in cranial nerve development that may contribute to loss of facial pain and temperature sensation in FD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>All animal care and use described herein were in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines and approved by Montana State University’s and University of Maryland’s IACUC, under protocols #2018–81 (MSU) and #R-MAR-20–15 (UMD). The generation of the <italic>Elp1</italic> conditional knockout mouse was described previously by Dr. Frances Lefcort (Montana State University) who generously provided embryos and mice for this work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">George et al., 2013</xref>).

When the floxed region is excised via Cre recombinase, the resulting truncated <italic>Elp1</italic> transcript is eliminated from cells by nonsense-mediated decay. The role of Elp1 in Wnt1-expressing neural crest cells and derivatives was examined by crossing homozygous <italic>Elp1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice with hemizygous <italic>Wnt1-Cre<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice (The Jackson Laboratory, stock no. 003829) to create <italic>Elp<sup>fl/+</sup>;Wnt1-Cre<sup>+/-</sup></italic> males, which were then crossed with <italic>Elp1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> females to generate <italic>Elp1</italic> conditional knockout mice (<italic>Elp1<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Wnt1-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>, abbreviated ‘<italic>Elp1</italic> CKO’ throughout) and a 1:3 ratio.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that this is an interesting topic and that the paper has potential. However, they ask for better quantification of the phenotypes and more functional data. In addition, the identity of a Vg neuron as derived from neural crest versus placode needs further study as no marker is perfect. Comparison to a placode-only derived ganglion (e.g. VIIIg) would add a level of experimental comparison that would be informative and novel compared to the previous investigations of DRGs. I refer you to the full reviews below for further details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>• p8, para1, line7: please make the term &quot;the eye&quot; more specific – does this include the lens, retina, cornea?</p><p>• Figure 1 legend: line 8: Carets for Isl1 indicate positive neuronal nuclei – the way the sentence is worded one could read is as cell body. Same for Figure 1 supplemental legend – Isl1 in neuronal nuclei not cell bodies.</p><p>• Figure 2: these are very nice schematics; how were they constructed?</p><p>• Figure 3: perhaps label the NT and VIIg in A and B.</p><p>• p18, para1, line8: is the protein more &quot;selectively expressed&quot; or &quot;most abundantly expressed&quot;? It may be that Elp1 turns over faster in some cells compared to the long-lived LacZ or it is expressed in the other cells but not at levels easily detected by IF.</p><p>• I am not crazy about using the term &quot;model&quot; in the title of the paper because Elp1 is only knocked down in the neural crest, which is not the case in the patients. Or do the aberrant nerves reported herein model the nerve deficiencies seen in patients?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In characterizing Elp1 expression during gangliogenesis, the authors use several markers to identify the placode and neural crest-derived neurons in regions where they appear to overlap. However, these neurons are segregated in the proximal (neural crest) and distal (placode) regions of the ganglion, which in addition to the markers they used would make a stronger point. The authors could also use similar location of neurons in addition to differential expression of TrKA/TrKB to confirm the absence of Elp1 in the neural crest-derived neuron as opposed to the placode-derived neurons of the CKO mice, and also to show that neuron apoptosis occurs in only the distal region of the trigeminal ganglion. Furthermore, the authors could use this differential expression of TrKA and TrKB to show the specific loss of TrKA neurons in the target sites of the Elp1 CKO mice.</p><p>2. The authors state that two litters were examined per experiment, but do not provide the numbers of knockout and wild type mice used for each experiment. In addition, quantification of the data such as the thickness of the central nerve root between control and Elp1 CKO mice would make the authors claim stronger.</p><p>3. The authors conclude that nerve defects caused by loss of Elp1 could be based on the target region. What is the expression pattern of NGF in the target tissues where the nerve bundles appear to be disformed in Elp1 CKO? Does the NGF expression overlap with other neurotrophic factors in this region?</p><p>4. The authors suggest that in Elp1 CKO mice, most TrKA neurons do not express Elp1. Since this was knocked out in NC-derived neurons, these results would be much stronger of they showed that Elp1 expression is maintained in the placode (TrkB) neurons under these conditions.</p><p>5. Are there specific targets innervated by neural crest- or placode-derived neurons? Given the defects observed in Elp1 CKO, what happens to the placode-derived neurons (TrKB neurons) that should be functioning normally?</p><p>Other concerns</p><p>1) Abstract: last sentence; The authors state that &quot;These findings explain the loss of facial pain and temperature sensation in FD.&quot; Since this study did not evaluate facial pain, I suggest that they rephrase this sentence to something like this &quot;These findings explain the defects in cranial gangliogenesis that may lead to loss of facial pain and temperature sensation in FD.&quot;</p><p>2) Introduction: Page 5; The authors introduce the small-diameter TrKA neurons but not the large-diameter TrKB neurons. Making this distinction in the introduction section would be helpful for the readers that are new to this topic.</p><p>3) Results section: Page 8; Based on the β-galactosidase expression, the authors conclude that Elp1 is expressed in cranial neural tissues. Given that there is vivid expression in what appears to be the neuroretina, I suggest that they report this instead of grossly stating that it is expressed in the eye.</p><p>4) Results section: Page 9; (Figure 1K-M) does not show Sox10-positive glia.

However, they ask for better quantification of the phenotypes and more functional data. In addition, the identity of a Vg neuron as derived from neural crest versus placode needs further study as no marker is perfect. Comparison to a placode-only derived ganglion (e.g. VIIIg) would add a level of experimental comparison that would be informative and novel compared to the previous investigations of DRGs. I refer you to the full reviews below for further details.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>• p8, para1, line7: please make the term &quot;the eye&quot; more specific – does this include the lens, retina, cornea?</p><p>• Figure 1 legend: line 8: Carets for Isl1 indicate positive neuronal nuclei – the way the sentence is worded one could read is as cell body.

Or do the aberrant nerves reported herein model the nerve deficiencies seen in patients?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for these suggestions, which have been incorporated into the revised manuscript. The schematics were hand drawn by the first author using an iPad and the Procreate app. We concede that there are aspects of this conditional knockout animal that do not align with the human disorder of Familial Dysautonomia (FD) and have now expanded on these caveats in the Discussion. Nonetheless, this conditional knockout and others with similar limitations have previously been described by leading FD researchers as “animal models of FD”. As <italic>eLife</italic> specifically urges authors to name the model animal used in the title, we have not modified the title at this time but will defer to the Editor on her preference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. In characterizing Elp1 expression during gangliogenesis, the authors use several markers to identify the placode and neural crest-derived neurons in regions where they appear to overlap. However, these neurons are segregated in the proximal (neural crest) and distal (placode) regions of the ganglion, which in addition to the markers they used would make a stronger point. The authors could also use similar location of neurons in addition to differential expression of TrKA/TrKB to confirm the absence of Elp1 in the neural crest-derived neuron as opposed to the placode-derived neurons of the CKO mice, and also to show that neuron apoptosis occurs in only the distal region of the trigeminal ganglion. Furthermore, the authors could use this differential expression of TrKA and TrKB to show the specific loss of TrKA neurons in the target sites of the Elp1 CKO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the point the Reviewer brings up regarding cell position within the trigeminal ganglion, particularly given our own research on chick trigeminal ganglion assembly. In the chick trigeminal ganglion, neurons are segregated by cellular origin such that placode-derived neurons reside in the distal ganglion (relative to the neural tube), while neural crest-derived neurons reside in the proximal ganglion. This pattern does not translate to the mouse trigeminal ganglion, which has been previously described as a mosaic of cellular subtypes with no preferential aggregation of any particular lineage (Karpinski et al., 2016; Motahari et al., 2021). Therefore, anatomical position is an unreliable tool for predicting placodal versus neural crest lineage in the mouse trigeminal ganglion. Our TrkA/B/C immunohistochemistry data, and the distribution of TrkA/TUNEL-double positive cells within Elp1 CKO trigeminal ganglion sections, also support this finding. Because of this, we cannot rely on position as another means to support our results. We have now addressed these differences between chick and mouse in the Discussion.</p><p>We have conducted additional section immunohistochemistry experiments in which we have co-stained for different Trks and Elp1 in control and Elp1 CKO embryos (Figure 5, Figure 5-supplement 1 and 2, E12.5). We discovered a statistically significant decrease in TrkA fluorescence intensity in Elp1 CKO versus control trigeminal ganglia, with no change observed for TrkB or TrkC. Additionally, there were fewer TrkA-expressing nerve endings in sections through the upper lip of Elp1 CKO embryos relative to control embryos, with no change observed in TrkC-expressing nerve endings. Remarkably in the Elp1 CKO, most TrkA neurons were devoid of Elp1 protein, while the majority of Elp1-positive neurons expressed TrkB or TrkC. Altogether, these data provide further evidence to support targeting of presumptive neural crest-derived TrkA neurons in the trigeminal ganglion upon Elp1 loss in neural crest cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors state that two litters were examined per experiment, but do not provide the numbers of knockout and wild type mice used for each experiment. In addition, quantification of the data such as the thickness of the central nerve root between control and Elp1 CKO mice would make the authors claim stronger.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the omission of these numbers and have added them to the manuscript. In addition, we have now quantified several aspects of trigeminal ganglion and nerve development (described in detail in Reviewer 1, Point #5 above), as per the recommendations of this Reviewer and Reviewer 1. We thank the Reviewer for this comment, as the new data have strengthened the manuscript. Additionally, the numbers of animals/litters per experiment have been clarified in figure legends, and graphs representing statistical comparisons between control and Elp1 CKO embryos now include individual data points against the mean/SEM to demonstrate the number of embryos examined and the variation within genotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors conclude that nerve defects caused by loss of Elp1 could be based on the target region. What is the expression pattern of NGF in the target tissues where the nerve bundles appear to be disformed in Elp1 CKO? Does the NGF expression overlap with other neurotrophic factors in this region?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer brings up an excellent point. To address this, we have performed immunohistochemistry to examine NGF expression and distribution in Elp1 CKO and control littermates at E12.5 (Figure 9-supplement 2). Our data reveal NGF protein in trigeminal nerve target tissues of both control and Elp1 CKO embryos. Importantly, given the role of Elp1 in translation, these findings demonstrate that Elp1 is not altering NGF protein levels. These results are consistent with previously published data showing no difference in the amount of <italic>NGF</italic> transcripts (Naftelberg et al., 2016; Morini et al., 2021) or protein (George et al., 2013) levels between control and Elp1 CKO. With regards to other neurotrophic factors, BDNF and NT-3, which can serve as ligands for TrkB and TrkC, respectively, are also expressed in the ophthalmic and maxillary regions targeted by the trigeminal nerves (Ernfors et al., 1992; Arumäe et al., 1993; Buchman et al., 1993; O’Conner and Tessier-Lavigne, 1999).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors suggest that in Elp1 CKO mice, most TrKA neurons do not express Elp1. Since this was knocked out in NC-derived neurons, these results would be much stronger of they showed that Elp1 expression is maintained in the placode (TrkB) neurons under these conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. We now provide data from the Elp1 CKO showing that TrkA neurons are typically devoid of Elp1 protein, while TrkB and TrkC neurons still express Elp1 (Figure 5-supplement 2; see also Point #1 in this section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Are there specific targets innervated by neural crest- or placode-derived neurons? Given the defects observed in Elp1 CKO, what happens to the placode-derived neurons (TrKB neurons) that should be functioning normally?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer raises an excellent question regarding target tissues innervated by neural crest- vs. placode-derived neurons emanating from branches of the trigeminal ganglion. We are actively pursuing this line of research in my lab but it is currently beyond the scope of this study given the mouse work and time required to rigorously interrogate this question. We have speculated about this in the Discussion as a future direction. As a foray into this, however, we have quantified Trk fluorescence at E12.5 and find no statistically significant difference in TrkB (or TrkC) fluorescence throughout the trigeminal ganglion between control and Elp1 CKO embryos (Figure 5), while TrkA fluorescence is reduced. Additionally, we show that TrkA nerve endings are reduced in sections through the whisker pad of E12.5 Elp1 CKO embryos, but TrkC nerve endings are maintained (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Abstract: last sentence; The authors state that &quot;These findings explain the loss of facial pain and temperature sensation in FD.&quot; Since this study did not evaluate facial pain, I suggest that they rephrase this sentence to something like this &quot;These findings explain the defects in cranial gangliogenesis that may lead to loss of facial pain and temperature sensation in FD.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion and have modified the sentence accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Introduction: Page 5; The authors introduce the small-diameter TrKA neurons but not the large-diameter TrKB neurons.

As mentioned in this section in Point #3, other neurotrophins are expressed in trigeminal ganglion target tissues, including BDNF and NT-3, which can serve as ligands for TrkB and TrkC, respectively. However, we think it is unlikely that the defasciculation phenotype we observe at E115 is due to axons trying to access these other neurotrophins. In support of this, we note no further increase in defasciculation at later stages (E12.5, E13) in the Elp1 CKO maxillary branch, providing indirect evidence that the axons are not actively seeking different neurotrophic factors for their support. Given the phenotypes we observe are specific to TrkA neurons, we surmise that the defasciculated neurons are expressing TrkA. Use of alternative neurotrophins like BDNF or NT3, however, would require these neurons to switch receptor expression, and we do not see any changes in TrkB or TrkC expression in Elp1 CKO embryos over developmental time. Moreover, the absence of any increase in defasciculation at later stages (by putative TrkA neurons) can be correlated with the increased apoptosis of TrkA neurons in Elp1 CKO embryos. Instead, we speculate that the defasciculation is tied, at least in part, to defects in adhesion among axons, particularly since Elp1 CKO dorsal root ganglia have dramatically reduced levels of Cadherin-7 (Goffena et al., 2018). In chick cranial motor neurons, Cadherin-7 enhances axonal outgrowth and restricts interstitial axon branching (Barnes et al., 2010). Whether similar <italic>Elp1 CKO</italic> proteome changes or Cadherin-7 functions are conserved in the mouse trigeminal ganglion remains to be explored. Moreover, Elp1 plays a role in adhesion in other cell types (Johansen et al., 2008; Cohen-Kupiec et al., 2010). We have now added this text to the Discussion and thank the Reviewer for raising this interesting point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Discussion section: Page 22; The statement &quot;…deficient TrkA retrograde signaling could result in dying axons and subsequent cell death.&quot; is confusing.

To further bolster our findings, we have now quantified various aspects of the forming trigeminal ganglion and its nerve branches in Elp1 CKO and control embryos (see Reviewer 1, Point #5). Given the TrkA-specific deficits in the trigeminal ganglion, we also evaluated NGF, the ligand for TrkA, and found no change in its distribution in Elp1 CKO compared to control. Finally, we generated a Wnt1-Cre;ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup> reporter mouse in which all neural crest derivatives (Wnt1-Cre-recombined) express GFP, while other cell types like placode cells express RFP. The use of this new mouse model allowed us to answer questions related to the cellular origin of different Trk-expressing neuronal subpopulations in the trigeminal ganglion and to define Six1 as a marker for all newly differentiating neurons in the trigeminal ganglion, irrespective of cellular origin. We hope the Reviewer finds these additional experiments to strengthen the manuscript and deem it suitable for publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There is somewhat of a lack of mechanistic insight beyond the description of the development in this mouse.

However, others have shown that the Sox10-Cre driver does not target all cranial neural crest cells (see Debbache et al., 2018; Jacques-Fricke et al., 2012; Hari et al., 2012). Therefore, we may miss certain populations of neural crest cells if we switch to this line. Importantly, Wnt1-Cre-mediated deletion of <italic>Elp1</italic> is the precedent for previous FD animal studies, making our model appropriate for initial characterization of effects on the trigeminal ganglion. The use of alternative Cre drivers in future studies may provide unique insights into currently unknown mechanisms underlying FD, which is beyond the scope of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors quote 'we deduced that TrkA neurons in the trigeminal ganglion must be primarily neural crest-derived, while TrkB and TrkC neurons are placode-derived – a concept that has been alluded to in the literature, but not explicitly demonstrated'.

We have addressed this by crossing our Wnt1-Cre line with the ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup> reporter. As detailed in Point #1 above, we used this reporter mouse to distinguish neural crest-derived neurons and glia (green) from placode-derived neurons, which remain red. We performed section immunohistochemistry using antibodies to the different Trks and find that most TrkB- and C-expressing neurons are placode-derived, while neural crest cells give rise to the majority of TrkA-expressing neurons (Figure 8).</p></body></sub-article></article>
