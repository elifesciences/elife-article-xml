pathways evolves. While Gal4 mode has been well-characterized in Saccharomycetaceae clade, little is known about the regulation of the <italic>GAL</italic> pathway in other yeasts. Here, we find that Rep1, a Ndt80-like family transcription factor, serves as a galactose sensor in the commensal-pathogenic fungus <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. It is presented at the <italic>GAL</italic> gene promoters independent of the presence of galactose. Rep1 recognizes galactose via a direct physical interaction. The net result of this interaction is the recruitment of a transcriptional activator Cga1 (Candida galactose gene activator, orf19.4959) and transcription of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes proceeds. Rep1 and Cga1 are conserved across the CTG species. Rep1 itself does not possess transcriptional activity. Instead, it provides a scaffold to recruit different factors for transcriptional regulation. Rep1-Cga1 mode of regulation represents a new example of network rewiring in fungi, which provides insight into how <italic>C. albicans</italic> evolves transcriptional programs to colonize diverse host niches.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Candida albicans</kwd><kwd>galactose sensing</kwd><kwd>transcriptional network</kwd><kwd>Gal regulon</kwd><kwd>transcriptional rewiring</kwd><kwd>GAL gene induction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32070074</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32170089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Chang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81973370</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Chang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003819</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022CFB103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Chang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcriptional network for the GAL regulon induction in the pathogenic fungus <italic>Candida albicans</italic> represents an important advance in the evolution of the regulatory circuits, and would make a nice addition to the textbook version of eukaryotic gene regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Galactose is a monosaccharide that is abundant in nature and is found in many forms. The <italic>GAL</italic> pathway of the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is a favorite textbook example of the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. This pathway is controlled through the Gal4 activator, a member of the Cys6 zinc finger class of transcription factors found only in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burger et al., 1991</xref>), as well as a sensor (Gal3) and a repressor (Gal80). In the absence of galactose, Gal80 prevents transcriptional activation of the pathway by means of a physical interaction with Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Platt and Reece, 1998</xref>). In the presence of galactose, Gal3 relieves this repression of Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sil et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Peng and Hopper, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sellick and Reece, 2006</xref>), thereby activating the transcription of target <italic>GAL</italic> genes such as <italic>GAL1</italic>, <italic>GAL7</italic>, and <italic>GAL10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnston, 1987</xref>). The enzymatic products of three Leloir genes act sequentially to convert galactose to glucose-6-phosphate, which enters glycolysis.</p><p>The <italic>GAL</italic> pathway of budding yeasts is a powerful model for inferring the evolutionary principles guiding the evolution of eukaryotic metabolic and genetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harrison et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">LaBella et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hittinger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Slot and Rokas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hittinger et al., 2004</xref>). Although the Gal3-Gal80-Gal4 mode in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is a favorite textbook example of the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnston, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conrad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giniger et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Traven et al., 2006</xref>), we know unexpectedly little about the regulation of the <italic>GAL</italic> pathway in budding yeasts other than the Saccharomycetaceae clade. The DNA-binding domain encoded by <italic>ScGAL4</italic> is conserved throughout the budding yeast subphylum, but its Gal80-binding domain is only conserved in Saccharomycetaceae whose pattern of conservation mirrors that of <italic>GAL80</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Traven et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pan and Coleman, 1989</xref>), arguing that the Gal4-Gal80 mode of regulation is restricted to the Saccharomycetaceae clade. <italic>Candida albicans</italic> exists primarily as a commensal resident of the GI tract of humans. However, it can infect sites ranging from the skin and the oral and vaginal mucosa to deep tissues from colonization of the patientâs own GI tract if host or environmental factors are permissive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2012</xref>). Although the <italic>GAL</italic> regulon structure and the overall logic of regulation have been preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fitzpatrick et al., 2010</xref>), there are significant differences in the quantitative response of these genes to galactose between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>. For example, the <italic>GAL</italic> genes induction is faster and more sensitive to galactose concentration in <italic>C. albicans</italic> compared to that of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalal et al., 2016</xref>). These findings raise the question of how the gene regulatory network of <italic>GAL</italic> regulon has evolved in <italic>C. albicans</italic> to generate such biological diversity since orthologs of Gal80 and Gal3 are absent in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p><p>Considerable efforts have been made to identify numerous transcription factors involved in the galactose-inducible expression of three <italic>GAL</italic> genes in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martchenko et al., 2007</xref>), none of which, however, are necessary for galactose utilization in this fungus. The molecular mechanism whereby <italic>C. albicans</italic> senses galactose and subsequent signaling that activates the expression of <italic>GAL</italic> genes are far less clear. Here, we find that Rep1, a DNA-binding scaffold protein in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, recognizes galactose via a direct physical interaction. The interaction between Rep1 and galactose allows the recruitment of a transcriptional activator Cga1 (Candida galactose gene activator, orf19.4959) to the <italic>GAL</italic> gene promoter, and then initiation of transcription can occur.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rep1 is required for galactose signaling in <italic>C. albicans</italic></title><p>Rep1 was previously shown to be the transcription factor of GlcNAc signaling in <italic>C. albicans</italic> via the recruitment of GlcNAc sensor Ngs1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Su et al., 2016</xref>). Given the intriguing observation that GlcNAc can induce the galactose metabolic genes in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamthan et al., 2013</xref>)<italic>,</italic> it is possible that the key regulators involved in GlcNAc signaling are also important for galactose utilization. In accord with the results from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Su et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Min et al., 2018</xref>), deleting <italic>NGS1</italic> did not display a significant growth defect on galactose as the sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>rep1</italic> mutant cells grew much slower than wild type cells under the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>REP1</italic> is not required for growth on glucose or glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).To test if Rep1 regulates galactose signaling, we measured the expression of <italic>GAL</italic> genes. The expression of <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>GAL10</italic> in the presence of galactose was dramatically reduced in the <italic>rep1</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The defects of <italic>rep1</italic> mutants could be rescued by a wild-type <italic>REP1</italic> under the <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Although <italic>REP1</italic> was essential for the induction of <italic>GAL</italic> genes in response to galactose, disrupting <italic>REP1</italic> resulted in a slight increase in <italic>the</italic> expression of <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>GAL10</italic> in glycerol, and the increase could be erased by adding back a wild-type <italic>REP1</italic> into the <italic>rep1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Unlike Rep1, Ndt80 is not required for the growth on galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To determine whether the functional specificity of Rep1 regarding galactose utilization is the presence of C domain, we designed a chimeric construct in which the C domain from Rep1 was fused to Ndt80 protein at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). This chimeric construct failed to restore the growth defect of the <italic>rep1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>), suggesting that, except for the C domain, regulation of the transcriptional activity of Rep1 upon galactose induction also occurs elsewhere in the protein. The protein level of chimeric construct is comparable to that of wild-type Rep1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C</xref>). We therefore dissected the role of the individual Rep1 domains. As expected, removing the C domain from Rep1 (Rep1<sup>âC</sup>) failed to restore the growth defect of the <italic>rep1</italic> mutant on galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The C domain alone had no function either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To our surprise, the transcriptional activation domain of Rep1 is not necessary for its galactose responsiveness as introducing a truncation lacking this domain (Rep1<sup>âAD</sup>) into the <italic>rep1</italic> mutant showed a comparable growth rate on galactose to that of full-length Rep1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Rep1<sup>âAD</sup> could also induce the expression of <italic>GAL</italic> genes in response to galactose, although a slightly lower expression level was observed in this truncation than that of its full-length counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results indicate that the transcriptional activation domain of Rep1 is not necessary for galactose signaling in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rep1 binding to galactose is essential for the induction of <italic>GAL</italic> genes</title><p>How does Rep1 provide galactose responsiveness? Galactose was unable to increase the protein level of Rep1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed that Rep1 bound to the divergent promoter region shared by <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>GAL10</italic> in a galactose-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, GFP-Rep1 expressed from the <italic>RHO1</italic> promoter accumulated in the nucleus regardless of the presence of galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, Rep1-mediated transcriptional activation regarding galactose signaling cannot be regulated by the control of its expression, DNA-binding properties or localization, but, instead, changes in the Rep1 protein per se must occur in response to galactose. Rep1 was predicted to comprise a putative galectin-like fold by AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Given that galectins were discovered based on their galactoside binding activity, we hypothesize that Rep1 possesses the ability to interact with galactose.To test this possibility, we purified recombinant Rep1<sup>âAD</sup>-His. We removed the transcriptional activation domain, which is not necessary for function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), to improve solubility. Agarose conjugated with galactose, but not control agarose, was able to pull down recombinant Rep1<sup>âAD</sup>-His (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The docking pose with the lowest binding free energy of â4.2 kcal/mol shows that galactose binds to a shallow pocket on Rep1<sup>âAD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Three Rep1<sup>âAD</sup> residues are involved in a network of interactions with galactose. Among them, Y526 is supposed to be central to the interaction as it emerges proximal to galactose and participates in both hydrogen bonding interactions and hydrophobic interactions with galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We therefore replaced Y526 with alanine in Rep1<sup>âAD</sup> and found that this mutation did not change the protein level of Rep1<sup>âAD</sup> both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref> &amp; 1D). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, substitution of Y526 in Rep1<sup>âAD</sup>-His with alanine almost completely abrogated interactions with galactose. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) further confirmed a direct binding between Rep1<sup>âAD</sup>-His and galactose, with the dissociation constant (Kd) measured as ~0.25 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), whereas an interaction between Rep1 and glucose, GlcNAc or arabinose could not be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), indicating that this binding is specific to galactose. Consistent with the immunoprecipitation analyses, the Y526A mutant showed no detectable interaction with galactose in an ITC assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Notably, disrupting the interaction between Rep1<sup>âAD</sup> and galactose by mutating Y526 to alanine resulted in a severe growth defect on galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), as well as a defect in the induction of <italic>GAL</italic> genes expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

We therefore identified proteins that interact with Rep1 specifically in the presence of galactose.

The identiï¬ed proteins that were unique or highly enriched in the GFP-Rep1 samples in galactose from three independent repeats are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. Among the top three hits, we focused on Orf19.4959, which is described to possess potential DNA-binding transcription factor activity in Candida Genome Database (CGD). We then deleted this gene in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and found that cells lacking Orf19.4959 were unable to utilize galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and failed to induce the expression of <italic>GAL</italic> genes as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which resembled the phenotype of the <italic>rep1</italic> mutant. The expression level of Orf19.4959 was largely unchanged in galactose compared to that in glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), and it constitutively accumulated in nucleus regardless of carbon sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), both of which resembled to that of Rep1.

Cga1-Myc, but not no tag control, immunoprecipitated endogenous Rep1-FLAG from lysate of cells grown in galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). No interaction was detected between Cga1-Myc and Rep1-FLAG in glucose or glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

As described above, Rep1 regulates galactose and GlcNAc catabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Su et al., 2016</xref>), whereas Ndt80 is a master regulator of biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>). The difference in phenotype should be due to a difference in the target genes between these regulators,although they are thought to share a conserved DNA binding domain. To this end, we identified the genes directly regulated by Rep1 using chromatin immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged Rep1, as well as an untagged control, in SC medium supplied with galactose as carbon sourcefollowed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq). With a <italic>Q</italic> value cutoff of 0.05, an adenine-rich motif was found in 74 out of 104 sequences by using the FIMO tool from MEMEâs suite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which differs from that of Ndt80 reported previously (CACAAA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nocedal et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>After elimination of the intragenic and downstream peaks, 108 genes showed enrichment in IP versus no tag control in the upstream region. Both galactose catabolic genes (<italic>GAL1</italic>, <italic>7</italic>&amp;<italic>10</italic>) and GlcNAc catabolic genes (<italic>DAC1 </italic>and <italic>NAG1</italic>) were identified as direct targets of Rep1 in our ChIP-Seq assay, supporting for the validity of the full genome ChIP data. We then subjected the target genes of Rep1 to pathway analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) and showed enrichment in diverse processes, including response to extracellular stimulus, carbohydrate metabolic process, organelle disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Although the ChIP-Seq experiment revealed the regions where Rep1 binds, it does not indicate whether these binding events are associated with differences in gene transcription. To assess the relationship of Rep1 binding and transcription, we performed qRT-PCR analyses under galactose or glycerol condition. Rep1-mediated transcriptional activation in response to galactose was observed inGlcNAc catabolic genes <italic>DAC1</italic> and <italic>NAG1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, the induction ratio of these genes in galactose was much lower (~10-fold) than that in GlcNAc (&gt;100-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Su et al., 2016</xref>). Except for GlcNAc and galactose catabolic genes, an increase in the expression of other Rep1 target genes we tested was observed when <italic>REP1</italic> was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), in agreement with an inhibitory role of Rep1 in transcription. These findings suggest that Rep1 is bound to its target promoters irrespective of whether those genes are transcriptionally active. Therefore, it is conceivable that Rep1 provides a scaffold to recruit different transcriptional regulators, thereby enabling transcriptional activation in response to environmental or developmental signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conservation of Rep1-mediated galactose sensing mechanism in fungi</title><p>Having identified Rep1-Cga1 mode of regulation for the <italic>GAL</italic> regulon in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, we wonder whether it is exploited wildly in fungi. To this end, we performed BLAST searches to analyze the distribution of Rep1 orthologs in fungi and found that Rep1 orthologs are presented in CTG clade, and in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> belonging to Eurotiales clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Notably, the distribution pattern of Cga1 almost mirrors to that of Rep1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that the Rep1-Cga1 mode of regulation for galactose utilization should restrict to species most closely related to <italic>Candida branches. To further determine whether the function of Rep1 othologs is conserved in CTG species, we examined the ability of Rep1 in Candida tropicalis</italic> or <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic> to complement the galactose utilization defect in <italic>C. albicansrep1</italic> mutant. The cross-species experiment showed that ectopically expressed <italic>CtREP1</italic> or <italic>CpREP1</italic> rescued the growth defect of <italic>Carep1</italic> mutant on galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), and partially rescued the defects in the induction of galactose catabolic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Similarly, introducing a WT copy of <italic>CtCGA1</italic> or <italic>CpCGA1</italic> into the <italic>Cacga1</italic> mutant could also rescue its defects in galactose utilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2C and D</xref>). The results suggest that galactose sensing and signal transduction mediated by Rep1 and Cga1 is conversed in CTG species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we discover a DNA-binding scaffold protein Rep1 that functions as a galactose sensor in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The recognition of galactose by Rep1 via a direct physical interaction brings about the recruitment of a transcriptional activator Cga1, thereby activating transcription of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Following the Gal4 mode in Saccharomycetaceae clade, our discovery of Rep1-Cga1 mode in <italic>C. albicans</italic> provides a second transcriptional network that dictates the induction of <italic>GAL</italic> regulon in yeasts.</p><p>Rep1 is defined as a Ndt80 family transcription factor, which preserves the DNA-binding property but loses the ability to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). It is essential for the induction of both genes that produce galactose-metabolizing enzymes and GlcNAc catabolic enzymes in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Rep1-mediated transcriptional activation is achieved by either galactose-inducible recruitment of Cga1 to <italic>GAL</italic> promoters, or by Ngs1-induced promoter chromatin acetylation upon GlcNAc binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Su et al., 2016</xref>). Protein binding of Cga1 to Rep1 relies on the presence of galactose. However, the interaction between Ngs1 and Rep1 seems independent of carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Su et al., 2016</xref>). We propose that Rep1 recruits Ngs1 to <italic>GAL</italic> gene promoters; the presence of GlcNAc induces transcription of <italic>GAL</italic> genes via Ngs1 whose <italic>N</italic>-acetyltranferase activity is activated upon GlcNAc binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This idea may help to explain why GlcNAc can induce the <italic>GAL</italic> gene expression in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and different alternative carbon sources can be assimilated simultaneously by this commensal-pathogenic fungus.Although ChIP-Seq data revealed that ~100 genes were identified as Rep1 targets, Rep1 played a minor role on the regulation of their expression under non-inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, unlike Ndt80 that itself serves as a transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), Rep1 provides a scaffold for recruitment of various transcriptional co-regulators, which in turn activates transcription in response to environmental cues.Through these properties, Rep1-mode of regulation may facilitate crosstalk among distinct signaling pathways, which imparts metabolic flexibility of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to colonize diverse host niches.</p><p>Transcriptional rewiring of metabolic pathways probably generates a great diversity of biological responses and evolutionary novelties. Yeasts occupy a great diversity of ecological niches and have therefore provided an excellent opportunity to investigate gene expression circuitries chosen by organisms living in a variety of niches. There is substantial rewiring in the regulatory networks of <italic>GAL</italic> pathway: from Gal3-Gal80-Gal4 mode in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to Rep1-Cga1 mode in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Neither Rep1 nor Cga1 has a clear ortholog in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), and the binding motif of Rep1 also differs from that of Gal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This rewiring therefore occurred through changes in a combination of de novo genes in the regulatory network as well as the cis-regulatory sequences of the control regions of <italic>GAL</italic> genes.The orthologues of both Rep1 and Cga1 seem present only in CTG species and in very limited species in Eurotiales clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), which raises the hypothesis that there is a variety of modes of regulation of galactose metabolism in fungi. Since the <italic>GAL</italic> pathway in budding yeasts has often served as a model for studying gene regulation and evolution in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnston, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harrison et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hittinger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Slot and Rokas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hittinger et al., 2004</xref>), our discovery of Rep1-Cga1 mode adds significantly to the literature of transcription regulatory network for galactose utilization in fungi.</p><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, activation of the <italic>GAL</italic> pathway relies on Gal80, which represses Gal4 activity until Gal3 bound to galactose sequesters it in the cytoplasm. In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, Rep1 and Cga1 create a relatively simple signal-transduction cascade, in which galactose binding to Rep1 recruits Cga1 to initiate transcription of <italic>GAL</italic> regulon. What distinguishes this system from that of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> regarding network architecture is the absence of a factor (like Gal80) that represses Cga1 activity. Given that the induction of <italic>GAL</italic> genes occurs faster in <italic>C. albicans</italic> than that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Escalante-Chong et al., 2015</xref>), our study provides evidence consistent with the idea that short cascades orchestrate rapid gene expression responses to external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosenfeld and Alon, 2003</xref>). In addition, Gal4 abundance is controlled by glucose concentration, which determines the robustness of Leloir genes induction in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, whereas both <italic>REP1</italic> and <italic>CGA1</italic> seem constitutively expressed regardless of carbon sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). This discrepancy with respect to glucose repression on major regulator(s) of the <italic>GAL</italic> regulon likely underlies the differences in quantitative responses to <italic>GAL</italic> gene induction. That is, higher basal level but lower induction ratio and more graded induction in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalal et al., 2016</xref>), rather than the bimodal, on-and-off mode in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ricci-Tam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Venturelli et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As a commensal-pathogenic fungus, <italic>C. albicans</italic> must adapt to dynamic and contrasting host microenvironments such as the gastrointestinal tract, mucosal surfaces, bloodstream, and internal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves et al., 2020</xref>). The ability to respond sensitively and rapidly to changing nutritional conditionscould conceivably be of selective advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pradhan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pradhan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2013</xref>).

Our work provides insights into how <italic>C. albicans</italic> evolves transcriptional programs to adapt to live as commensals or to colonize and grow efficiently within its host tissues during

In the non-pathogenic model yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> this circuit represents a textbook model that rivals the lac operon as a teaching tool. Using a broad array of mainly classical approaches, this study convincingly demonstrates the transcriptional activators that are required for galactose responsive metabolic genes in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The recognition of just how different the regulation of the galactose pathway across fungal species represents an important advance in our understanding of the evolution of the regulatory control of these circuits, and makes a nice addition to the textbook version of eukaryotic gene regulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84155.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Rokas</surname><given-names>Antonis</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02vm5rt34</institution-id><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Whiteway</surname><given-names>Malcolm</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04dwckp88</institution-id><institution>Concordia University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.10.24.513549">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.24.513549v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.
