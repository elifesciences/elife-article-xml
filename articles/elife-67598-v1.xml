In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, spatial control is primarily provided by the GAL4/UAS system, whilst temporal control relies on a temperature-sensitive GAL80 (which inhibits GAL4) and drug-inducible systems. However, these are not ideal. Shifting temperature can impact on many physiological and behavioural traits, and the current drug-inducible systems are either leaky, toxic, incompatible with existing GAL4-driver lines, or do not generate effective levels of expression. Here, we describe the auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES). AGES relies on the auxin-dependent degradation of a ubiquitously expressed GAL80, and therefore, is compatible with existing GAL4-driver lines. Water-soluble auxin is added to fly food at a low, non-lethal, concentration, which induces expression comparable to uninhibited GAL4 expression. The system works in both larvae and adults, providing a stringent, non-lethal, cost-effective, and convenient method for temporally controlling GAL4 activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auxin</kwd><kwd>GAL4/UAS</kwd><kwd>inducible</kwd><kwd>temporal</kwd><kwd>transgene</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104567/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Southall</surname><given-names>Tony D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Society of Developmental Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McClure</surname><given-names>Colin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 NS105942</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barber</surname><given-names>Annika F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Development of a new tool to control the activity of the GAL4 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> allows researchers to switch transgene expression on in specific cell types by feeding them the plant hormone auxin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to manipulate the expression of specific genes in model organisms has been the cornerstone of genetics research over the last 50 years. It is from such studies that geneticists have been able to elucidate fundamental biological process, such as those underlying neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu and Vogel, 2009</xref>), oncogenic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Villegas, 2019</xref>), and neural circuitry involved in memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, has been at the forefront of genetics since its cultivation in the lab in the early 1900s, by geneticist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morgan, 1910</xref>. In the 100 years since, a plethora of genetic tools have been developed for this model organism, enabling geneticists to tightly control and manipulate gene expression, allowing them to study the roles of genes in development, physiology, and behaviour. One of the most prominent developments is the GAL4/UAS system, which has been an incredibly powerful tool for the spatial control of transgenes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>). This system relies on a cloned or endogenous promoter to drive the expression of the yeast transcription factor GAL4, which can then bind to the UAS (upstream activating sequence) sites upstream of a transgene and activate its expression. Since the development of this system, <italic>Drosophila</italic> researchers have created thousands of genetically distinct lines to enable expression of transgenes in specific populations of cells (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robie et al., 2017</xref>). The majority of these lines are publicly available at the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (BDSC) and Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Center (VDRC).</p><p>GAL4 activity can be regulated by GAL80, a protein which antagonises GAL4 by inhibiting its activation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lue et al., 1987</xref>), and thus the ability of the GAL4 to induce transcript expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suster et al., 2004</xref>). The generation of a fly line that ubiquitously expressed a temperature-sensitive version of GAL80 (GAL80<sup>ts</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsumoto et al., 1978</xref>) was a significant advance for the field, as it allowed temporal control of GAL4-induced transgene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>). Flies can be kept at temperatures permissive of transcript expression (29°C) or temperatures that inhibit expression (18°C), offering researchers to control not only where, but when transgenes are expressed. The versatility of this system enabled researchers to determine time-specific effects of gene function, and is a system that is widely employed within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community.</p><p>Although the impact of this technology on the field cannot be understated, it is becoming increasingly evident that using a temperature shift to induce gene expression is far from optimal for some experiments, especially in fields such as behaviour, neuropathy, and ageing. Flies, as ectotherms, are highly dependent on their ambient temperature, which affects a wide range of physiological and behavioural traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abram et al., 2017</xref>). These include sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckwith and French, 2019</xref>), territorial success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zamudio et al., 1995</xref>), lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCabe and Partridge, 1997</xref>), development rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Danjuma et al., 2014</xref>), immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hunt et al., 2016</xref>), metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schou et al., 2017</xref>), and even their microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moghadam et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the use of a significant temperature shift to induce gene expression should be avoided in these contexts.</p><p>As an alternative approach, a range of drug-inducible systems have been developed, where the drug can be administered to flies in their diet to activate transcript expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barwell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kogenaru and Isalan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osterwalder et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Potter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sethi and Wang, 2017</xref>). These systems each have advantages and disadvantages (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and are not often compatible with available GAL4 lines, thus requiring the creation (and optimisation) of their own drivers. In addition, the systems that are compatible with existing GAL4 lines can affect the fly’s physiology or survival, thereby limiting their use, and the certainty of any findings when employed. For example, the GeneSwitch system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osterwalder et al., 2001</xref>) is not compatible with existing GAL4 lines and requires the user to generate a new modified GAL4 line. Furthermore, the system shows leaky expression in the absence of the drug (RU-486) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poirier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scialo et al., 2016</xref>), and RU-486 can cause behavioural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Stavropoulos, 2016</xref>) and is dangerous to handle for pregnant women as it can cause termination of the pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avrech et al., 1991</xref>). Another drug-inducible system utilised in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is the QF system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Potter et al., 2010</xref>). Here, QF is a transcriptional activator that can be inhibited by QS (analogous to GAL4 and GAL80). Quinic acid inhibits the repressive action of QS, therefore, can switch on transgene expression. Quinic acid is non-toxic for flies, however, the drawback of this system is that it is not compatible with the vast collection of existing GAL4 lines.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Main advantages and disadvantages of the most common drug-inducible gene expression systems currently available to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Expression system</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reference</th><th style="author-callout-style-b2">Advantages</th><th style="author-callout-style-b3">Disadvantages</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>GeneSwitch</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osterwalder et al., 2001</xref></td><td style="author-callout-style-b2">Non-toxic for adult flies</td><td style="author-callout-style-b3">Not compatible with existing GAL4 linesLeaky expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poirier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scialo et al., 2016</xref>)Larval exposure impacts on adult sleep patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Stavropoulos, 2016</xref>)Drug is unsafe to handle for female researchersDrug is expensive</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>QF System</bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Potter et al., 2010</xref></td><td style="author-callout-style-b2">Non-toxic for flies</td><td style="author-callout-style-b3">Not compatible with existing GAL4 lines</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Tet-off GAL80</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barwell et al., 2017</xref></td><td style="author-callout-style-b2">GAL4/UAS compatible</td><td style="author-callout-style-b3">Long induction time (&gt;5 days)Requires x2 copies of the GAL80 transgeneAffects microbiota</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>TMP</bold><bold>INDUCIBLE</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kogenaru and Isalan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sethi and Wang, 2017</xref></td><td style="author-callout-style-b2">GAL4/UAS compatible</td><td style="author-callout-style-b3">Currently not compatible for general use with existing GAL4 linesTMP drug is only dissolvable in DMSO (affects survival of larvae) or has to be added as a dry powder to food</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The auxin-degron system, first identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, involves the auxin-dependent ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation, of proteins that are tagged with a specific auxin-inducible degron (AID) sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dharmasiri and Estelle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Its natural function allows for the prompt elimination of Aux/IAA transcription factors in plants and has been adapted for use in other species, most notably <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, to artificially target proteins for rapid degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). In this system, the F-box protein TIR1, an auxin receptor, binds with conserved proteins Skp1 and Cullin to form a Skp1–Cul1–F-box (SCF) E3 ligase complex which ubiquitinates proteins tagged with an AID sequence in an auxin-dependent manner. The specificity and versatility of the system has made it an effective tool in multiple systems including mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yesbolatova et al., 2020</xref>) and human cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the auxin-degron system has been successfully employed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trost et al., 2016</xref>). Trost and colleagues showed that AID-tagged EYFP and AID-tagged Rux protein levels could be knocked down in S2 cell lines and transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic>, respectively. While Chen and colleagues knocked down AID-tagged PERIOD protein in the adult brain. Inspired by these studies, we have applied the auxin-degron system to enable both temporal and spatial control of transgene expression when combined with the GAL4/UAS system in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This was achieved by creating a ubiquitously expressed GAL80 fused with AID tags, such that GAL80 is degraded in the presence of the auxin phytohormone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We demonstrate that this system works in both larvae (5 mM auxin) and adult flies (10 mM), which are concentrations that do not affect fly survival, development, or locomotion (larval crawling and adult climbing). This auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES) is safe to handle, cheap, easy to prepare, provides tuneable and stringent (i.e. not leaky) expression, and most importantly, is compatible with the majority of existing GAL4-driver lines developed by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design and action of auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES).</title><p>A tubulin promoter ubiquitously expresses the bicistronic TIR1 and AGES cassette.

A negative control consisting of fly food without auxin (0 mM auxin) was included to investigate whether there was any leaky GAL4 activity in absence of auxin.

At 5 and 10 mM, GFP fluorescence is clearly detectable in the abdomen of live female flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Based on this assay, 10 mM for 24 hr results in ~60% of the GFP fluorescence levels seen in the positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Time to pupation (from egg-laying) is unaffected for concentrations up to 5 mM, however, 10 mM caused a delay of approximately 1 day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Ten mM auxin causes some developmental delay, although it has no impact on the survival of the flies through these developmental stages (compared to a no auxin control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These data indicate that 10 mM auxin should be avoided for larval induction, however, this is not an issue as &gt;1 mM is sufficient for robust induction of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and 5 mM does not cause any developmental delay.

Control activity tubes contained standard DAM food (2% agar, 5% sucrose) while experimental food contained RU-486 (200 mg/mL) or NAA (2 or 10 mM). In contrast to the previous experiments, NAA auxin was used here instead of K-NAA auxin. Analysis of the amplitude of the behavioural locomotor rhythm in constant darkness by fast Fourier transform (FFT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Plautz et al., 1997</xref>) showed robust inhibition of locomotor rhythms in both male and female experimental <italic>PDF</italic>-GAL4; AGES &gt; UAS-Kir2.1 flies on 2 or 10 mM NAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

Two mM NAA feeding significantly lengthened the behavioural period of male <italic>PDF</italic>-GAL4/+; AGES/+ parental controls by 19 min, with no effect on females of the same genotype. In agreement with the classic study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Depetris-Chauvin et al., 2011</xref>, 200 μg/mL RU-486 feeding also reduced circadian locomotor rhythms in both sexes of flies with <italic>PDF</italic>-GAL4-GeneSwitch-driven expression of Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>), though the effect was not as strong as 2 mM NAA feeding in the AGES flies. In addition, RU-486 feeding resulted in a broader distribution of locomotor rhythm strengths and a net increase in rhythmicity in male <italic>PDF</italic>-GAL4-GeneSwitch parental control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), which was accompanied by a 51 min increased period length and increased average 24 hr locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G</xref>).

Here, we present AGES, an auxin-inducible gene expression system, which eliminates the need for temperature shifts to manipulate temporal expression and lacks many of the drawbacks of the current drug-inducible systems.</p><p>A significant benefit of AGES over existing systems is its compatibility with most existing GAL4-driver lines. Currently, the most prevalent drug-inducible expression systems, that is, the GeneSwitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osterwalder et al., 2001</xref>) and the Q-system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Potter et al., 2010</xref>), require the generation of their own driver lines. AGES uses a GAL80 fusion protein, which allows the use of the system alongside the majority of existing GAL4-driver lines, whereby suppression of the GAL4-<italic>UAS</italic> activation is achieved in all cells where auxin is absent. Notable exceptions are split-GAL4 lines that do not use the GAL4 activation domain. As with all GAL80-based methods of GAL4 control, the GAL4 line must contain the standard GAL4 activation domain for GAL80 to be affective. There are split-GAL4 lines that use the GAL4 activation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>), however, many use a p65 activator domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dionne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tirian and Dickson, 2017</xref>), or a VP16 activator domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luan et al., 2006</xref>), which will not work with AGES. We have demonstrated the system using multiple driver lines, including <italic>c564-</italic>GAL4, <italic>elav-</italic>GAL4, <italic>grh-</italic>GAL4, <italic>Or85a-</italic>GAL4, and <italic>PDF-</italic>GAL4. These were, in part, used to assess whether the auxin hormone used (K-NAA) could freely access various cell types within the fruit fly, particularly the central nervous system where auxin must pass the selectively permeable glial membrane, akin to the mammalian blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Limmer et al., 2014</xref>). Our results, using one fat body GAL4 driver and four different central nervous system GAL4 drivers, demonstrate that auxin can transverse the blood-brain barrier, and that this system should, in theory, be compatible with all other GAL4 lines that contain a GAL4 activation domain.</p><p>Successful gene driver systems require negligible expression when un-induced. While some current systems are known to exhibit leaky expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scialo et al., 2016</xref>), AGES demonstrates an almost complete repression of GAL4 activity when un-induced. Using GFP fluorescence as a readout, 0 mM auxin does not show any greater signal than the negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Also, the level of <italic>GFP</italic> mRNA without auxin showed no significant difference when compared to the negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The AID tags on GAL80 allow the rapid, and tuneable, degradation of the GAL80 protein, providing users with the option to determine the strength of expression by adjusting the concentration of auxin in the food, or by limiting the exposure time of the flies to auxin.</p><p>Temporal control of gene expression is essential for many behavioural experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We demonstrate that AGES can elicit strong behavioural changes through activating expression of Kir2.1 (an inward-rectifier potassium ion channel) in <italic>PDF</italic>-GAL4 expressing adult neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Kir2.1 inhibits the activity of PDF neurons resulting in ablation of circadian rhythms. The strong loss of circadian rhythm was observed in both males and females, and even worked at the lower concentration of 2 mM auxin. This is an important development for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> behaviour field, as it allows experiments to be done with existing GAL4 lines, and without the need of a temperature shift or having to use GeneSwitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osterwalder et al., 2001</xref>). While 2 mM auxin food had no effect on the circadian rhythm of female flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) or the <italic>PDF</italic>-GAL4/+ control male flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), it did impact on the <italic>UAS</italic>-Kir2.1/+ control male flies. We currently have no explanation for this. However, it does emphasise the requirement to always perform the appropriate controls. Also, in this context, 10 mM auxin food did have an effect on both male control lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). So, while 10 mM auxin had no impact on adult climbing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), it did impact on circadian rhythms. It should be noted that NAA was used for the circadian rhythm experiment, whereas K-NAA (more water soluble) was used for all the other experiments. Therefore, K-NAA may have less of an effect on the controls as was seen with NAA.</p><p>AGES is also a system that is safe for both humans and flies alike. Auxin hormone carries no hazardous concerns for human handling, and no lethal effects were identified for the effective concentrations of 10 mM or below for both adult and larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Continuous exposure of larvae to 10 mM auxin does result in some developmental delay; however, it does not affect survival. Higher concentrations of auxin result in increased mortality rates (data not shown) and should be avoided. Users are encouraged to consider this if attempting to optimise exposure conditions for specific experiments, or GAL4-driver lines that have not been assessed in this paper. Overall, based on our data, we recommend the use of up to 5 mM auxin and up to 10 mM for optimal induction in larvae and adults, respectively.</p><p>It is also paramount that inducible systems are easy and cheap to apply, to facilitate their practical use in diverse experimental settings. While expenses of the GeneSwitch system average £0.31 (GBP) per vial, AGES costs ~120× less at £0.0025 per vial (authors’ estimate). Furthermore, the water-soluble auxin (K-NAA) can be easily added to the food immediately before the food is poured into vials or bottles, requiring no additional safety measures, enabling ease of production. In our experience, auxin-containing food can be stored 4°C for up to 15 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>) where the hormone’s potency still persists. Further studies are required to assess the stability and effectiveness of auxin when stored for longer periods of time, or in differing conditions.</p><p>The sensitivity of the system is directly related to the amount of auxin present within the tissue, and thus concerns are raised regarding the fly’s age and sex, as these factors impact feeding rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wong et al., 2009</xref>). As all experimental adult flies were aged to 5 days post-eclosion, the effects of age on the system are yet to be determined, although lower expression is to be expected in older flies. To address these concerns, alterations to the auxin application could be made, such as a longer exposure (&gt;24 hr), which as we have shown does not impact on survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).</p><p>Despite the various advantages that AGES offers the fly community, there are still limitations to consider. These include (i) the response time of the system (18–24 hr), (ii) auxin can have subtle effects on adult behaviour (circadian rhythms), and (iii) induced levels of expression are not always as high as the maximum levels obtained without the system. For example, as male adults eat less than their female counterparts, lower expression of the transgene is observed in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, as GAL4-induced expression is inherently strong, reduced transgene expression may not be an issue. This is evident in our circadian rhythm behavioural experiment, where there is a robust response in both males and females when driving expression of <italic>UAS</italic>-Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). While a 24 hr induction time is not instant, it is both practical and convenient for researchers performing experiments on adult flies in the lab.</p><p>There is scope for AGES to be optimised in the future. One approach would be to utilise a mutated version of TIR1 that can accommodate bulky analogues of auxin. Such mutants, in combination with modified auxins (5-Ph-IAA or 5-adamantyl-IAA), allow the degron system to work with much lower levels of auxin (&gt;500-fold less) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yesbolatova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>) and demonstrate a more rapid degradation. Efforts to test these modifications with AGES are underway.</p><p>In summary, AGES offers the fly community a cheap, safe, and easy system for temporal transgene expression using existing GAL4 lines. Furthermore, it does not require a shift in temperature changes for induction of gene expression. It is a particularly promising tool for research fields where researchers want to avoid using temperature shifts (e.g. ageing, behavioural genetics, and neuropathology), and will undoubtedly have wide-ranging benefits for multiple fields of study.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of <italic>AGES</italic> line</title><p>The <italic>AtTIR1-T2A-AID-GAL80-AID</italic> sequence was synthesised by Twist Biosciences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twistbioscience.com/">twistbioscience.com</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

development of a new tool for temporal control of gene induction by the widely-used bipartite Gal4/UAS system. By transferring protein modules from plants that mediate auxin-dependent protein degradation to control the stability of a Gal4-inhibitor (Gal80), the authors successfully demonstrate the ability to control Gal4 activity in flies through the provision of auxin in the food substrate and provide evidence for the sensitivity, specificity, and non-toxicity of this tool.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67598.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>VijayRaghavan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03ht1xw27</institution-id><institution>National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</institution></institution-wrap><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.01.26.428209">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.26.428209v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

In this study, the authors cleverly engineer a ubiquitously expressed bicistronic transgene that contains all of the necessary components to inhibit Gal4-induced expression in the absence of auxin. The authors convincingly show their system's efficacy, showing the addition of auxin to food enable Gal4-induced gene expression of a GFP reporter in the fat body, examining both external fluorescence and mRNA levels. GFP expression in the nervous system is a necessary addition due, as the authors state, to the blood-brain barrier. As there was nothing quantitative in Figure 3, a negative control (as used in Figure 2) would have been helpful, as it was hard to determine if 0 mM auxin had no GFP expression visually. As many researchers would be particularly interested in using this system for behavioral studies, further investigation of the system's efficacy for studying behaviors would add to the interest and impact of this work; for example, simple behavioral controls when the flies are reared on auxin, e.g., general locomotion. An excellent addition could be to show that a neuronal effector UAS (for example, csChrimson or TRPA1) does not induce a Gal4-driven behavior in the absence of auxin, and perhaps how long after a shift to auxin behaviors can be induced. Lastly, it is notable that all the shifts in this paper turn Gal4-induced expression from an off to an on state. It would be interesting to investigate the temporal dynamics of the opposite (turning the system from on to off), which would also be of great value to the broader community.</p><p>– The paper lacks clarity in parts that may impact its accessibility to a more general audience, for example, the description of the shortcomings of existing systems could be more clearly stated.</p><p>– Line 116 &quot;proper induction of GAL4 activity&quot; is quite a vague statement, perhaps the time course (stated as data not shown) could be added to supplemental.</p><p>– The authors state in line 173/174 that the AGES system is compatible with the majority of existing split-Gal4 lines, however Gal80 itself is not compatible with most extant split-Gal4 combinations as most activation domain lines are not derived from Gal4.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67598.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>It is useful for a new user of this tool to have a more complete description, rather than have to work it out themselves.
