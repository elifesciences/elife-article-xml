programs and neuronal subtypes similar to those of land vertebrates. However, mechanistic studies on little skate motor circuit development have been limited, due to a lack of high-quality reference genome. Here, we generated an assembly of the little skate genome, with precise gene annotation and structures, which allowed post-genome analysis of spinal motor neurons (MNs) essential for locomotion. Through interspecies comparison of mouse, skate and chicken MN transcriptomes, shared and divergent gene expression profiles were identified. Comparison of accessible chromatin regions between mouse and skate MNs predicted shared transcription factor (TF) motifs with divergent ones, which could be used for achieving differential regulation of MN-expressed genes. A greater number of TF motif predictions were observed in MN-expressed genes in mouse than in little skate. These findings suggest conserved and divergent molecular mechanisms controlling MN development of vertebrates during evolution, which might contribute to intricate gene regulatory networks in the emergence of a more sophisticated motor system in tetrapods.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>little skate</kwd><kwd>motor neuron</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>genome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021010004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baek</surname><given-names>Myungin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2019R1I1A2A01041345</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baek</surname><given-names>Myungin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003566</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20180430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Heebal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S10OD023423-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heguy</surname><given-names>Adriana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 NS116858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dasen</surname><given-names>Jeremy S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The generation of high-quality little skate reference genome enables molecular mechanism studies of gene regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The little skate <italic>Leucoraja erinacea</italic> is a marine species of jawed vertebrate which shares a common ancestor with tetrapods 473 MYA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, it displays a walking-like behavior which resembles limb-based locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holst and Bone, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koester et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jung et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the genetic programs and neural subtypes essential for walking existed in a common ancestor of cartilaginous fish and tetrapods. Hence, <italic>Leucoraja erinacea</italic> is a useful model organism for the study of locomotor circuits, as it may provide insights into the genetic programs underlying limb-driven locomotion that may have originated in the common ancestor of vertebrates with paired appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gillis and Shubin, 2009</xref>). Previous developmental studies on the little skate demonstrated a conserved Hox TF-dependent regulatory network that specifies MNs innervating fin and limb muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jung et al., 2018</xref>). Little skate pectoral and pelvic fin MNs express forelimb MN Hox genes, <italic>Hoxa6/7</italic> and a hindlimb MN Hox gene, <italic>Hoxa10</italic>, respectively. In addition, the little skate genome lacks the <italic>Hoxc</italic> cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">King et al., 2011</xref>) and its spinal cord is occupied by fin MNs without an inter-fin region, which is reminiscent of the <italic>Hoxc</italic> cluster mutant mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jung et al., 2014</xref>). However, the mechanisms that regulate expression of genes controlling motor circuit development remain to be identified, and how different species generate MN subtypes to innervate ~10 pelvic fin muscles of little skate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Macesic and Kajiura, 2010</xref>) versus ~50 limb muscles of tetrapods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sweeney et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Landmesser, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sullivan, 1962</xref>) remains to be determined.</p><p>To investigate common and divergent regulatory gene networks of the little skate and tetrapods, integrated analysis of comparative genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics analyses, including assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) can be applied. However, in little skate, such genome-wide omics studies have been limited due to severe fragmentation of the reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wyffels et al., 2014</xref>). Limitations of short-read sequencing, such as the 500 bp read length in the case of skate genome, are unable to cover long repeats, leading to poor assembly of repeat-rich regions. Continuous long read (CLR) sequencing provides a solution to such assembly errors. With the assistance of available high-quality reference assemblies of phylogenetically close species, long read sequencing allows for reference-guided scaffolding and comparative annotations approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiddes et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In response to the limited reference genome of little skate, this and a similar study by Marletaz et al. generated new genome assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marletaz et al., 2022</xref>). Marletaz et al. generated a new chromosome-scale genome via combination of Pacbio, Illumina and Hi-C sequencing. Here, we generated a new genome assembly of 2.13 Gb and gene annotation of little skate by applying a combination of PacBio long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing analyses, a state-of-art assembly and annotation pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiddes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kolmogorov et al., 2019</xref>). Based on the new reference genome, transcriptome and ATAC-seq analyses were performed to identify gene expression patterns and chromatin accessibility of fin-innervating MNs. Through a comparative transcriptome analysis with two well-studied tetrapods (mouse and chick), we identified both conserved and divergent gene expression patterns among different species. Comparative chromatin accessibility analysis revealed more TF motif predictions in the MN-expressed genes in mouse than in little skate, which might support the emergence of a more intricately regulated motor system during evolution. The findings of this study provide deeper insights into the origin of genetic programs underlying limb-based locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High-quality little skate genome assembly through a combination of long and short read sequencing</title><p>The genome of <italic>Leucoraja erinacea</italic> was assembled using a combination of PacBio long read and Illumina short read data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> are the top 49 scaffolds ranked by the length which are equivalent to the number of chromosomes in thorny skate genome (sAmbRad1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhie et al., 2021</xref>). The 49 scaffolds constituted 97.8% of the little skate genome. Compared to the previous assembly, our assembled genome size increased by 36.5%–2.13 Gb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wyffels et al., 2014</xref>) ~93% of the estimated genome size based on K-mer spectra of whole genome sequencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The contiguity of the genome was also improved by over 300-fold, in terms of contig N50 of 214 Kb. The completeness of the new genome assembly is highlighted in the benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO) gene contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Missing and fragmented BUSCO which was 69.1% and 23.9% in the previous assembly has been reduced to 7.3% and 3.6% in our assembly, respectively. Also, the proportion of complete BUSCO genes (89.1%) as well as the long transcript lengths demonstrate improved completeness than that of the previous assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). As repetitive elements are reported to have large variation among cartilaginous fish genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hara et al., 2018</xref>), the repeats were investigated using Repeatmasker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smit et al., 2013</xref>) and were compared. Approximately, 63.6% of the little skate genome is occupied by repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>), which may account for its relatively large genome size compared to elephant shark and zebrafish genomes (C.milii-6.1.3 and GRCz11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Venkatesh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howe et al., 2013</xref>). Among the repeats, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE) were the most abundant of all classes which is similar to thorny skate and three shark genome assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hara et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Assembly and comparison of little skate genomes across diverse phylogenetic lineages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top 49 scaffolds ranked by the length.

Here, in an attempt to understand the origin of the genetic program for tetrapods locomotion, we generated the new reference genome assembly of little skate with gene annotations. We predicted the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in MNs through integrating RNA and chromatin accessibility data from multiple vertebrate species. As a result, we found both conserved and divergent gene expression in MNs across multiple species. Moreover, through chromatin accessibility analysis we found TF motif predictions that could regulate the MN-expressed genes in mouse and little skate. These findings provide deeper insights into the evolution of genetic pathways essential for limb-based locomotion.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>High-quality genome assembly of little skate provides a reference for studying gene regulatory mechanisms in MNs</title><p>A previous highly fragmented and incomplete genome of <italic>Leucoraja erinacea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wyffels et al., 2014</xref>) is unsuitable for post-genome analysis. Therefore, improving the quality of the little skate reference genome is a first step towards a more complete analysis of gene regulatory networks. To improve the quality of the little skate genome, whole genome sequencing data including PacBio long reads and Illumina short reads were generated. Even though this study used fewer resources relative to that of more recent sequencing pipelines, which used multiple sequencing technologies including chromosomal conformation capture and physical maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhie et al., 2021</xref>), this study could assemble a reference genome which is highly contiguous and offers reliable coding and regulatory region data. This was accomplished by using the assembly of a closely-related species—thorny skate—as a reference during scaffolding process. However, it is important to note that the contig N50 of this little skate genome is still lower than that of the thorny skate assembly. Also, the higher number of scaffolds and the presence of little skate contigs which had not been localized to pseudo-chromosomes of thorny skate may indicate that little skate and thorny skate genomes contain a few structural disagreements.</p><p>Despite this limitation, the new reference genome allowed for a more reliable RNA-seq analysis. Through re-analyzing the previously generated RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jung et al., 2018</xref>), we found genes which are consistent with the previous immunohistochemical analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jung et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, we also observed that the expression patterns of MN and interneuron markers in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delile et al., 2019</xref>) are highly similar in skate, supporting previous conclusions. Previously unidentified DEGs were found through re-analysis of RNA-seq data using the new reference genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which reflects the limitation of the previous analyses using the zebrafish transcriptome. Aligning the new gene annotation data against the previous de novo transcriptome, and investigating the distribution of alignment length, we also found that the previous de novo transcriptome contains many fragmented genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). The previous transcripts generally cover only a small fraction (&lt;20%) of the transcripts predicted in our genome assembly while the new transcripts cover close to 100% of the previous transcriptome. An example case is illustrated in the <italic>Foxp1</italic> gene, a well-known limb/fin MN fate determinant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). This improved DEG analysis therefore offers a more complete view of gene expression profiles of MNs in little skate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The evolution of gene regulatory modules for MN development</title><p>During the evolution of motor behaviors, a more complex nervous system likely emerged to control more sophisticated limb movements, such as hand dexterity. Little skate displays walking-like behavior using only around 10 muscles in the pelvic fin, while mammals can use up to 50 muscles in each limb. How the system evolved to generate a more intricate nervous system remains an open question. One mechanism to achieve this might be to increase the number of regulatory modules that control fine-grained gene expression. Recently, an increase in the size of intergenic regions with concomitant increase in the number of ACRs in neuronal genes was proposed as one plausible mechanism to generate a more complex nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Closser et al., 2022</xref>). Although neuronal genes in little skate have much longer intergenic regions than non-neuronal genes, the intergenic regions in neuronal genes contain a similar fraction of ACRs as in non-neuronal genes as opposed to mouse with significantly increased neuronal gene ACRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Other mechanisms seem to be involved in generating complex nervous system. While birds display very complex behaviors, its genome contains short intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, we propose another way of achieving complex nervous system, through more intricate regulatory network. As illustrated in the Figure 5D and a greater number of shared TF motif predictions were found in MN-expressed genes of mouse than in skate allowing an intricate control of gene expression.</p><p><italic>Foxp1</italic>, the major limb/fin MN determinant appears to be differentially regulated in tetrapod and little skate. Although <italic>Foxp1</italic> is expressed in and required for the specification of all limb MNs in tetrapods, <italic>Foxp1</italic> is downregulated in <italic>Pea3</italic>-positive MN pools during maturation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dasen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Catela et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, preganglionic motor column neurons (PGC MNs) in the thoracic spinal cord of mouse and chick express less than half the level of <italic>Foxp1</italic> expression in limb MNs. Although PGC neurons have not yet been identified in little skate, we tested the expression level of <italic>Foxp1</italic> using a previously characterized tetrapod PGC marker, <italic>pSmad</italic>. We observed that <italic>Foxp1</italic> is not expressed in MNs that express <italic>pSmad</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since there is currently no known marker for PGC MNs in little skate, our conclusion should be taken with caution. This predicted complex mechanism of gene expression in mouse may contribute to the emergence of more complex nervous system of mouse compared to that of skate even though the hypothesis remains to be validated in additional organisms.</p><p>In summary, the comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of the current study suggests evidence of species-specific changes apart from the conservation. Divergent expression of genes in MN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) could allow a greater number of motor pools to be generated in mouse to control complex limb structures. Loss of the <italic>Hoxc</italic> cluster in the little skate genome, correlated with high contents of repeat elements in the genomic locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), might underly the expanded fin MN domain in the spinal cord without an inter-fin region; while loss of a subset of CTCF binding motifs in the <italic>Hoxa</italic> cluster of little skate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) may have induced the relatively expanded domain of <italic>Hoxa9</italic>. The changes in genome structure and sequence could lead to changes in the expression of MN-specific genes as well as Hox genes across the rostro-caudal axis of the spinal cord, affecting the MN organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lacombe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machado et al., 2015</xref>). The changes in the MN organization along the rostro-caudal axis of the spinal cord may affect the connectivity of MNs, which would eventually lead to changes in the pattern of locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Osseward and Pfaff, 2019</xref>).

Whether the predicted TFs actually bind to the putative motifs and whether TFs function as activators or repressors are yet to be validated.

For more accurate characterization of regulatory elements, future studies could provide a more comprehensive approach including ChIP-seq and chromatin conformation capture assay together with functional validation of the motifs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal work</title><p>Animal procedures were conducted under the approval of the IACUC at DGIST (DGIST-IACUC-21062403–0002).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sampling and DNA extraction and whole genome sequencing</title><p>For genomic DNA extraction from little skates (Marine Biological laboratory; 5 stage and sex unmatched skate embryos), the guts were removed and washed 2 times with 1 x PBS.

Similar to RNA-seq data, the quality of the raw sequence data was investigated with FastQC (v. 0.11.9) followed by trimming of sequences with low quality and NexteraPE adapter sequences using trimmomatic-0.39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>) with following options: ‘ILLUMINACLIP:[AdapterFile]:2:30:10 LEADING:20 TRAILING:20 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:30’. The clean reads were aligned to the reference genome of little skate with BWA (v. 0.7.17). The quality of the ATAC-seq reads were further checked using R ‘ATACseqQC’ package. After the alignment, duplicated reads were removed with Picard (v. 2.23.2) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_006525">SCR_006525</ext-link>, v. 2.23.2; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>). Moreover, reads with low mapping quality and those reads that were originated from MT genome were removed with samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2009</xref>) (v. 1.9). Peak calling was performed for each tissue after pooling the replicates of respective tissue (fin-MNs and tail-SC) using MACS2 (v. 2.2.7.1) with the following options: ‘–keep-dup all –nomodel, -q 0.05– -f BAMPE -g 1,974,810,099’. ACRs were defined by merging the peaks from the two tissues using bedtools merge (v. 2.29.2). For the visualization of ATAC-seq data, bed files of ACRs and bigwig files generated by deeptools (v. 3.4.3) were used.</p><p>The ACRs identified were further classified into different regions based on gene annotation (including upstream, promoter, 5’UTR, CDS, intron, 3’UTR, downstream and intergenic). The region covering 1000 bp upstream of start of a gene was defined as promoter region and 10,000 bp upstream of promoter region or downstream of 3’ end of a gene was defined as upstream or downstream, respectively. ACRs located in the remaining non-genic regions were considered intergenic ACRs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>TF binding motif predictions</title><p>For the ACRs of interest and promoter regions of the candidate genes, motif enrichment analysis was performed with HOMER and ‘annotatePeaks.pl’ script was used to locate the binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) using the collection of homer vertebrate TFs and the binding motifs of Hox gene families available in HOCOMOCO database v11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kulakovskiy et al., 2018</xref>). The putative CTCF motif prediction was also performed using HOMER vertebrate CTCF binding motifs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Code availability</title><p>This study does not involve previously unreported computer code or algorithms.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you plan the next steps. The reviewers agree that the paper has potential, but extensive revision and new data are needed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors report the identification of conserved and divergent molecular markers across multiple species with RNA-Seq, but they do not validate the expression of novel markers in either category with an independent method (e.g. in situ or antibody staining).</p><p>Such validation is needed to substantiate the authors' conclusions.</p><p>2. The reviewers do recognize that functional analyses are not feasible in the little skate. However, to substantiate the claim that more complex regulatory mechanisms have evolved in tetrapods to accommodate sophisticated motor behaviors, the authors should conduct additional gene expression experiments. For example, as pointed out by reviewer 1, the authors can focus on Foxp1 and Snail.</p><p>3. Reviewers 1 and 3 raised a number of important issues regarding the bioinformatic comparisons (e.g., completeness of datasets, quality control, introduction of bias) that must be carefully addressed. First, the authors must show validation of their RNA-Seq method in chick, as suggested by reviewer 1. Second, the reviewers would like to see a re-analysis of the RNA-Seq datasets in an unbiased manner, for example, by directly comparing MN expression of orthologous genes in the different species (e.g., compare highly expressed genes in MNs of the different species). Two reviewers stressed that comparing a pure MN population to tail tissue in the skate and DRGs in the mouse was not an appropriate comparison. Third, comparisons of mouse and skate-accessible chromatin regions should be done without biasing first to DEX genes. Lastly, additional key aspects of evolution, such as paralogue substitution or expression of species-specific genes should also be considered. Authors could follow comparisons similar to: 10.1038/s41559-021-01580-3.</p><p>4. The reviewers agree that a significantly improved version of the little skate genome is an important contribution. In the first part of the manuscript, the authors should mention the work by Marletaz et al. (bioRxiv) that also provides a new little skate sequenced genome.</p><p>5. There is a propensity to overstate claims throughout the manuscript. For example, without functional data in little skate, the claim that the TF networks are much simpler is not substantiated simply by ATACseq and predicted binding sites. The authors should tone down statements in Abstract and Discussion (as indicated by the reviewers) and always make it very clear that they are simply predicting regulatory connections between all these genes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Based on the low convergence of mouse, skate and chick MN transcriptomes it may be a possibility that one of the datasets is incomplete. The authors should go back to their RNAseq datasets and check for the expression of known MN markers that are conserved in the 3 species to identify where this inconsistency arises. It would also be helpful to show validation of their chick RNAseq method, for example, show the efficiency and specificity of GFP expression in MNs, and what % of MNs were electroporated and sorted before sequencing.</p><p>2) Another surprising finding is that a higher number of putative TF binding sites are found in the tail-SC-specific ACRs for pectoral MNs and that the expression levels of these TFs do not correlate with this trend. The authors should comment on this discrepancy. Similarly, while they were found to be highly expressed in pectoral MNs, 5 genes including Isl1, show no associated ACR (Figure 5C). Do the authors think that this is due to long-range regulation of those genes? Some discussion of this would be clarifying.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As already stated, the main limitation of the study seems to be the strategy followed for the RNAseq and ATACseq comparative analysis. The use of a prior intra-species comparison with heterogeneous criteria is not well-justified, it is a potential source of bias and should be avoided. Why authors do not directly compare MN expression and ATACseq of orthologous genes in the different species? In addition, it is known that there are extensive paralogue substitutions that indicate common regulatory mechanisms but might be missed if not analysed directly. Authors could follow comparisons similar to previously published articles: 10.1038/s41559-021-01580-3.</p><p>Comments on each section:</p><p>1) Abstract:</p><p>Several statements are not strongly supported by data:</p><p>&quot;Conserved MN genes were enriched for early-stage nervous system development.&quot;</p><p>&quot;conservation of the potential regulators with divergent transcription factor (TF) networks through which expression of MN genes is differentially regulated.&quot;</p><p>&quot;TF networks in little skate MNs are much simpler than those in mouse MNs.&quot;</p><p>2) Figure 1 data:</p><p>In the first part of the manuscript, the authors should mention biorxiv Marletaz et al.'s work which also provides a new little skate sequenced genome and analysis, with a higher number of identified coding genes compared to this work and also with 3D chromatin structure data that identifies TAD boundaries that coincide with CTCF sites in Hoxa and Hoxd clusters mentioned in Baek et al.</p><p>3) Figure 2 data:</p><p>(3.1) The comparison of Pectoral MN with tail SC, compares a purified population with a mix of cell types including MN. This unbalanced comparison could explain why tail SC shows 3 times more DEX genes than pec-MN.</p><p>(3.2) In the previous analysis published by the group, 592 genes were identified as 2 fold enriched in pectoral MN, why the new analysis retrieves only 135 genes? This should be clarified for the reader.</p><p>(3.3) Also from previous work of the authors several genes were determined to be expressed in little skate MN (HB9, lhx3, lhx1, Ephs, Ephrins, slit3, onecut1, nell2, nrcam, ngfr, pappa2, cdh7, amigo1, unc5c, lrx5, lrp1b, Zfp804a, etc), which of these genes are predicted to be enriched (or expressed at least) in the Pec-MN data set? Were all the genes found? This could be used as quality control of the data set or data set analysis.</p><p>4) Figure 3 data:</p><p>(4.1) Compares &quot;Highly expressed genes in pec-MN&quot;. What are the criteria followed to assigned &quot;highly expressed genes&quot;?</p><p>(4.2) This data set is now compared with DEX of mouse embryonic MN compared to sensory neurons. Which type of mouse MN? at what A-P level?</p><p>(4.3) If skate genes are selected by high expression, why do mouse MN not follow the same criteria to avoid bias of comparison? As a control for bias in the criteria: What is the overlap of mouse highly expressed genes (with similar criteria to skate gene selection) with the data set of mouse MN DEX compared to sensory mouse neuron?</p><p>(4.4) Same for chick data, how equivalent are brachial MN to mouse MN dataset? Why select DEX compared to the brachial spinal cord and not sensory neurons as in mouse.</p><p>Without any justification for the followed strategy, it seems different populations and comparisons will introduce important biases that limit the conclusions.</p><p>The best strategy would be to compare highly expressed genes in MN in the different species and clarify if used populations are really &quot;homologous&quot; cell types in the different species.</p><p>(4.5) The variability of sampled populations or the biases introduced in the analysis might explain the low overlap found among the 3 species (Figure 3A). For the Venn diagram, is the overlap among categories higher/lower/equal to what would be expected by chance?</p><p>5) Figure 4 data:</p><p>(5.1) Similar to previous comments: Why limit TF motif enrichment of ACRs to only DEXs in pec-MN and tail-SC that (1) highly reduced the number of ACRs and (2) Induces a bias in the analysis?

The new analysis seems much more convincing than the previous one. Some lingering concerns remain, mostly regarding figure 5 and the central claim of the paper, which is still not functionally supported. The authors did however tone down their claims and pointed out the limitations of the study.</p><p>(1) Did the authors perform ATAC-seq from mouse MNs? They show some data in figure 5 but it was not clear from the description of the methods or the results whether they performed the experiment.</p><p>(2) It seems that repeating the motif analysis of the ATAC-seq data gave completely new regulatory factors for FoxP1, even though the same regions as in the original manuscript are shown. It appears that Snai1 is no longer on the list so the experiment in the supplemental figures testing its function is somewhat moot. The authors also do not describe the experiment at all in the Results section so it should be taken out.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript has made important efforts in answering some of the raised concerns but did not address other key issues, particularly at the end of the manuscript.</p><p>The description of the little skate genome is, with no doubt, useful for the field of Evolutionary Biology. Then authors, re-analyse previously published experimental data and compare differential gene expression between isolated pectoral motorneurons and a mixed population of the tail spinal cord of little skate (Figure 2) and differential accessible chromatin regions between Fin motorneurons (Pectoral+pelvic) compared to a mixed population of the tail spinal cord (Figure 4). These two figures are descriptive and it is unclear what insights are provided by the comparison of these heterogeneous populations of cells. Thus do not seem to constitute a great advancement in the understanding of gene regulatory networks present in the little skate or their evolution.</p><p>In the new version of the manuscript authors now compared homologous motorneuron populations of the little skate, mouse, and chick, which reveals a remarkable degree of conservation of the transcriptomes in the 3 species (Figure 3), which is even higher when considering possible paralog substitutions in the few divergently expressed genes. This is radically different from the initial version of the manuscript and I think is an important observation.</p><p>Finally, the authors attempt to describe and compare motorneuron gene regulatory networks in mouse and skate in Figure 5. I think this is the weakest part of the manuscript, not only I found it hard to follow, not clearly explained, and using vague terms and overstatements but in addition the methodology and strategy for the analysis seem incorrect, leading to potentially wrong conclusions.</p><p>To start, it is unclear to me what is exactly the mouse motorneuron population that is being compared and how equivalent it is to the mixed Pectoral and pelvic motorneuron population from the little skate.</p><p>More importantly, Figure 5A: authors describe 18 TF motifs commonly enriched in mouse and skate MN ACRs, among which 6 TFs predicted to bind those motifs are expressed both in mouse and skate. What does this mean? Is this overlap biologically meaningful? How many would overlap if enriched motifs in skate ACRs are compared to motifs in mouse ACRs of a non-related neuron type at a similar developmental stage, such as cortical interneurons cortical projection neurons? Less? More? similar number?</p><p>Authors then look for motif enrichment of these 6 common motif/TFs in ACRs of other expressed TFs (either expressed both in mouse and skate or only in one of them). It is unclear why TFs with enriched motifs in mouse and skate should be upstream of the other TFs, it is equally possible that the 6 common motif/TFs are downstream of the expressed TFs. In addition, using the term &quot;interactions&quot; for motif enrichment of one TF in the ACRs of another TF is an overstatement.</p><p>It is also striking that &quot;interactions&quot; of the 6 mouse common motif/TFs seem equally prevalent within ACRs of mouse-expressed TFs compared to ACRs of TFs expressed in skate but not in mouse. Similarly, for the skate data, motif enrichment in ACRs of commonly expressed TFs or TFs only expressed in the skate is not higher than in ACRs of TF expressed in mouse only. These results again raise doubts if this analysis is meaningful at all. Would it be different using just randomly picked ACRs from other TFs not expressed in MN? Finally, as already mentioned in the first review, the increasing number of motifs for mouse TFs could be again due to methodological limitations (based on known motifs in mouse compared to skate, etc) but not biologically meaningful, it should be stated right away when described and not as a separate paragraph in the section of limitations for the study.</p><p>Considering all these methodologic concerns, together with the lack of any experimental validation of predicted binding sites for any of the TFs, it would be advisable to completely remove that figure.</p><p>In summary, the manuscript has valuable information, namely the description of the little skate genome and the comparison of mouse, chick, and little skate MN transcriptome. It also provides a description and comparison of some heterogeneous populations of neurons in little skate which provide limited insights into gene regulation in skate motorneurons. Most importantly, I think the last part of the manuscript (Figure 5) is below the standards required for a journal such <italic>eLife</italic>. Unfortunately, I don´t think the paper, in its current revised format, provides any mechanism underlying the evolution of vertebrate locomotion as stated in the title.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>Authors constantly use the term &quot;MN genes&quot; or similar expressions when should be referring to &quot;MN expressed genes&quot; or &quot;MN enriched genes&quot;.

Most of the genes were expressed in tissues in accordance with the sequencing results (6 out of 9 common MN genes; 4 out of 6 mouse specific genes; 5 out of 7 skate specific genes). Specifcally, Uchl1, Slc5a7, Alcam, and Serinc1 are expressed in MNs of all three species; Coch, Ppp1rc, Ctxn1, and Clmp are expressed in MNs of mouse but not in MNs of other species; Eya1, Etv5, Dnmbp, and Spint1 are expressed in MNs of skate but not in MNs of other species. In the result section, we have summarized the results as follow:</p><p>“These results were validated by performing RNA in situ hybridization in tissue sections on a subset of species-specific genes …”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The reviewers do recognize that functional analyses are not feasible in the little skate. However, to substantiate the claim that more complex regulatory mechanisms have evolved in tetrapods to accommodate sophisticated motor behaviors, the authors should conduct additional gene expression experiments. For example, as pointed out by reviewer 1, the authors can focus on Foxp1 and Snail.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added further discussion and data about differential expression of Foxp1 in mouse and little skate in Figure 5—figure supplement 16 and have discussed as follows: “Foxp1, the major limb/fin MN determinant appears to be differentially regulated in tetrapod and little skate. Although Foxp1 is expressed in and required for the specification of all limb MNs in tetrapods, Foxp1 is downregulated in Pea3 positive MN pools during maturation in mice (Catela et al., 2016; Dasen et al., 2008). In addition, preganglionic motor column neurons (PGC MNs) in the thoracic spinal cord of mouse and chick express half the level of Foxp1 expression than limb MNs. Although PGC neurons have not yet been identified in little skate, we tested the expression level of Foxp1 using a previously characterized tetrapod PGC marker, pSmad. We observed that Foxp1 is not expressed in MNs that express pSmad (Figure 5‒figure supplement 3). Since there is currently no known marker for PGC MNs in little skate, our conclusion should be taken with caution.”</p><p>As for Snai1, in the revision we performed a motif enrichment analysis with an unbiased gene list where Snai1 didn’t show up. However, when we performed an RNA in situ hybridization experiment for Snai1 (Figure 5—figure supplement 3), we found that Snai1 is expressed in MNs of both mouse and little skate, but not in chick, which has been shown previously (Cheung et al., 2005). In order to examine the function of Snai1 in the regulation of Foxp1 expression, we ectopically expressed Snai1 in chick spinal cord by performing in ovo electroporation. However, we did not detect any changes in Foxp1. Instead we observed an increase in the number of neurons and abnormal MN exits from the spinal cord, which is the reminiscent of a previous observation (Zander et al., 2014). Although we did not detect any changes in Foxp1 expression, we cannot rule out the possibility that Snai1 regulates Foxp1 in mouse and little skate, which may require a gene knock out experiment. Because binding sites of Snai1 were not enriched in the new gene sets that we analyzed in the revision, we have not further discussed the Snai1 in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Reviewers 1 and 3 raised a number of important issues regarding the bioinformatic comparisons (e.g., completeness of datasets, quality control, introduction of bias) that must be carefully addressed. First, the authors must show validation of their RNA-Seq method in chick, as suggested by reviewer 1. Second, the reviewers would like to see a re-analysis of the RNA-Seq datasets in an unbiased manner, for example, by directly comparing MN expression of orthologous genes in the different species (e.g., compare highly expressed genes in MNs of the different species). Two reviewers stressed that comparing a pure MN population to tail tissue in the skate and DRGs in the mouse was not an appropriate comparison. Third, comparisons of mouse and skate-accessible chromatin regions should be done without biasing first to DEX genes. Lastly, additional key aspects of evolution, such as paralogue substitution or expression of species-specific genes should also be considered. Authors could follow comparisons similar to: 10.1038/s41559-021-01580-3.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the four suggestions, additional experiments and analyses have been added.</p><p>1) An additional experiment was conducted on the marker genes of chicken MN to support RNA-seq data and has been added to the Figure 3—figure supplement 1. In summary 11 out of 11 genes showed highly enriched expression pattern in MNs. The gene list includes Galm2, Cap43, str5, Scn2A, Rtn1, Pcp4, Tgs7bp, Mdga1, ChrnB3, Gpc3, and Hs6st3. In the result section, we have added as follow:</p><p>“…wing level MNs of chick embryos at Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) stage 26–27, which was validated by RNA in situ hybridization (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>2) The RNA-seq data has been extensively re-analyzed to address the concerns from the reviewers. Instead of using data from tail-SC of skate and sensory neuron tissues of mouse, comparison was made among the homologous MN populations, and Figures 3 and 5 have been updated accordingly.</p><p>3) The comparison between mouse and skate ACRs was reanalyzed without biasing to DEGs. The entire gene set and the highly expressed genes (expression percentile &gt; 70) were used in the new analysis to avoid biasing genes (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Figure 5 has been revised following this new result.</p><p>4) As the reviewer mentioned, our analysis (Figure 3) could not compare genes which do not have one-to-one orthologues. To account for this, additional analysis was conducted on paralog genes. The eggNog program was used to identify paralogs, and species-specific genes whose functions could be substituted by paralogues are discussed (Figure 3—figure supplement 3, Additional Data 5 and 6). Also, species-specific ortholog groups missed on the analyses with the ortholog genes (Figure 3) were identified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The reviewers agree that a significantly improved version of the little skate genome is an important contribution. In the first part of the manuscript, the authors should mention the work by Marletaz et al. (bioRxiv) that also provides a new little skate sequenced genome.</p></disp-quote><p>We have referenced the study by Marletaz in the introduction as follows:</p><p>“In response to the limited reference genome of little skate, this and a similar study by Marletaz et al., generated new genome assemblies. Marletaz et al. generated a new chromosome-scale genome via combination of Pacbio, Illumina and Hi-C sequencing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There is a propensity to overstate claims throughout the manuscript. For example, without functional data in little skate, the claim that the TF networks are much simpler is not substantiated simply by ATACseq and predicted binding sites. The authors should tone down statements in Abstract and Discussion (as indicated by the reviewers) and always make it very clear that they are simply predicting regulatory connections between all these genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased some of the misleading statements to tone them down as suggested by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Based on the low convergence of mouse, skate and chick MN transcriptomes it may be a possibility that one of the datasets is incomplete. The authors should go back to their RNAseq datasets and check for the expression of known MN markers that are conserved in the 3 species to identify where this inconsistency arises. It would also be helpful to show validation of their chick RNAseq method, for example, show the efficiency and specificity of GFP expression in MNs, and what % of MNs were electroporated and sorted before sequencing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have validated the chick RNA sequencing by performing RNA in situ hybridization. The results are shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Out of 11 tested genes, 11 genes were expressed in MNs. We have also added details of chick electroporation experiment as follow:</p><p>“After electroporation only well electroporated embryos ( &gt; 50% of the brachial MNs) were selected and used for cell sorting. During the FACS sorting, the YFP positive cells were counted to be around 5–10% of the entire population, shown in Figure 3‒figure supplement 1C. After the FACS sorting, we confirmed under fluorescence microscope that most of the sorted cells (&gt; 90%) were YFP positive.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another surprising finding is that a higher number of putative TF binding sites are found in the tail-SC-specific ACRs for pectoral MNs and that the expression levels of these TFs do not correlate with this trend. The authors should comment on this discrepancy. Similarly, while they were found to be highly expressed in pectoral MNs, 5 genes including Isl1, show no associated ACR (Figure 5C). Do the authors think that this is due to long-range regulation of those genes? Some discussion of this would be clarifying.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these issues in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“In addition, whether the predicted TFs actually bind to the putative binding sites and whether TFs function as activators or repressors are yet to be validated.”</p><p>We only consider ACRs in the region of 10 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream from the genes, which may exclude the long-range enhancers. As reviewer #2 suggested, we discussed this issue as follows:</p><p>“As another limitation of the current study, the ACRs analyzed here did not consider longrange regulatory elements, which might have caused the lack of associated ACRs in the MN genes (Figure 5C). For more accurate characterization of regulatory elements, future studies could provide a more comprehensive approach including ChIP-seq and chromatin conformation capture assay together with functional validation of the binding sites.<italic>”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As already stated, the main limitation of the study seems to be the strategy followed for the RNAseq and ATACseq comparative analysis. The use of a prior intra-species comparison with heterogeneous criteria is not well-justified, it is a potential source of bias and should be avoided. Why authors do not directly compare MN expression and ATACseq of orthologous genes in the different species? In addition, it is known that there are extensive paralogue substitutions that indicate common regulatory mechanisms but might be missed if not analysed directly. Authors could follow comparisons similar to previously published articles: 10.1038/s41559-021-01580-3.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer #2 suggested, we have extensively re-analyzed the RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. To avoid biases caused by heterogeneous cell type data, RNA sequencing data was generated from forelimb MNs of mouse and the new analysis focuses on comparisons of homologous MN populations between different species (Figure 3). In addition, the ATACseq data was re-analyzed while avoiding biasing the genes to statistically significant DEGs. The new analysis use all genes or highly expressed genes (Figure 4, 5 and Figure 5‒—figure supplement 1). We agree that there are extensive paralogue substitutions in the homologous cell types during evolution. To account for those genes without one-to-one orthologs, which could also be important for creating species-specific differences, we have added paralog gene analysis using eggNOG. The species-specific genes whose functions could be substituted by paralogues (Figure 3—figure supplement 3, Additional Data 5 and 6). Also, species-specific ortholog groups missed out on the analyses with the ortholog genes (Figure 3) were identified. We have summarized the results as follows:</p><p>“However, considering 11, 17 and 4 genes of mouse, skate and chick MN-specific genes are paralogs of one of the shared genes (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B), the degree of conservation is remarkable between MNs of these species while there are only a few remaining genes which could be species-specific. In addition to the comparisons among ortholog genes, we also identified 12, 171 and 6 paralog genes specifically expressed by skate, mouse and chicken MNs, respectively which could further explain species-specific differences of MNs (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on each section:</p><p>1) Abstract:</p><p>Several statements are not strongly supported by data:</p><p>&quot;Conserved MN genes were enriched for early-stage nervous system development.&quot;</p><p>&quot;conservation of the potential regulators with divergent transcription factor (TF) networks through which expression of MN genes is differentially regulated.&quot;</p><p>&quot;TF networks in little skate MNs are much simpler than those in mouse MNs.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The statements have been toned down following the reviewer #2’s comment.

Thus, the claim is unsubstantiated.</p><p>These examples indicate an overall propensity by the authors to gloss over the fact that no functional connections between any TFs or genes were experimentally demonstrated in little skate. I do not believe it is appropriate to substitute binding motif enrichment for experimentally determined regulatory connections when inferring gene regulatory networks in something as complex as vertebrate development. There are a number of reasons why this is problematic.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer suggested, we have revised the manuscript to avoid overstatements and we have discussed the limitations as follows:</p><p>“However, it is important to note that the motif analysis may be biased towards mouse data, because our motif enrichment analysis is based on motif data from mouse TFs. In addition, whether the predicted TFs actually bind to the putative binding sites and whether TFs function as activators or repressors are yet to be validated. As another limitation of the current study, the ACRs analyzed here did not consider long-range regulatory elements, which might have caused the lack of associated ACRs in the MN genes (Figure 5C). For more accurate characterization of regulatory elements, future studies could provide a more comprehensive approach including ChIP-seq and chromatin conformation capture assay together with functional validation of the binding sites.” [Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (please note that no additional experiments are required at this point):</p><p>1.

Then authors, re-analyse previously published experimental data and compare differential gene expression between isolated pectoral motorneurons and a mixed population of the tail spinal cord of little skate (Figure 2) and differential accessible chromatin regions between Fin motorneurons (Pectoral+pelvic) compared to a mixed population of the tail spinal cord (Figure 4). These two figures are descriptive and it is unclear what insights are provided by the comparison of these heterogeneous populations of cells. Thus do not seem to constitute a great advancement in the understanding of gene regulatory networks present in the little skate or their evolution.</p><p>In the new version of the manuscript authors now compared homologous motorneuron populations of the little skate, mouse, and chick, which reveals a remarkable degree of conservation of the transcriptomes in the 3 species (Figure 3), which is even higher when considering possible paralog substitutions in the few divergently expressed genes. This is radically different from the initial version of the manuscript and I think is an important observation.</p><p>Finally, the authors attempt to describe and compare motorneuron gene regulatory networks in mouse and skate in Figure 5. I think this is the weakest part of the manuscript, not only I found it hard to follow, not clearly explained, and using vague terms and overstatements but in addition the methodology and strategy for the analysis seem incorrect, leading to potentially wrong conclusions.</p><p>To start, it is unclear to me what is exactly the mouse motorneuron population that is being compared and how equivalent it is to the mixed Pectoral and pelvic motorneuron population from the little skate.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the concerns raised by Reviewer #3, we have reanalyzed data in Figure 5 by using publicly available ATAC data of limb-level MNs (forelimb and hindlimb MNs; Sawai et al.).

What does this mean? Is this overlap biologically meaningful? How many would overlap if enriched motifs in skate ACRs are compared to motifs in mouse ACRs of a non-related neuron type at a similar developmental stage, such as cortical interneurons cortical projection neurons? Less? More? similar number?</p></disp-quote><p>Among the TF motif predictions, 14 TF motif predictions were commonly found in genes expressed in skate fin-MNs and mouse limb-level MNs.

It is unclear why TFs with enriched motifs in mouse and skate should be upstream of the other TFs, it is equally possible that the 6 common motif/TFs are downstream of the expressed TFs.

Similarly, for the skate data, motif enrichment in ACRs of commonly expressed TFs or TFs only expressed in the skate is not higher than in ACRs of TF expressed in mouse only. These results again raise doubts if this analysis is meaningful at all. Would it be different using just randomly picked ACRs from other TFs not expressed in MN? Finally, as already mentioned in the first review, the increasing number of motifs for mouse TFs could be again due to methodological limitations (based on known motifs in mouse compared to skate, etc) but not biologically meaningful, it should be stated right away when described and not as a separate paragraph in the section of limitations for the study.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer #3 suggested, we have mentioned the caveat of this finding in the results as follows:</p><p>“However, it is important to note that the larger number of TF motif predictions in mouse MN-expressed genes could be due to the biased motif database toward mouse TFs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Considering all these methodologic concerns, together with the lack of any experimental validation of predicted binding sites for any of the TFs, it would be advisable to completely remove that figure.</p><p>In summary, the manuscript has valuable information, namely the description of the little skate genome and the comparison of mouse, chick, and little skate MN transcriptome. It also provides a description and comparison of some heterogeneous populations of neurons in little skate which provide limited insights into gene regulation in skate motorneurons.
