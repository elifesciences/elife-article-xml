to the pancreatic β cells and an absolute deficiency of insulin, leading to multi-organ involvement and a poor prognosis. The progression of T1DM is significantly influenced by oxidative stress and apoptosis. The natural compound eugenol (EUG) possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. However, the potential effects of EUG on T1DM had not been investigated. In this study, we established the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1DM mouse model in vivo and STZ-induced pancreatic β cell MIN6 cell model in vitro to investigate the protective effects of EUG on T1DM, and tried to elucidate its potential mechanism. Our findings demonstrated that the intervention of EUG could effectively induce the activation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), leading to an up-regulation in the expressions of downstream proteins NQO1 and HMOX1, which are regulated by NRF2. Moreover, this intervention exhibited a significant amelioration in pancreatic β cell damage associated with T1DM, accompanied by an elevation in insulin secretion and a reduction in the expression levels of apoptosis and oxidative stress-related markers. Furthermore, ML385, an NRF2 inhibitor, reversed these effects of EUG. The present study suggested that EUG exerted protective effects on pancreatic β cells in T1DM by attenuating apoptosis and oxidative stress through the activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway. Consequently, EUG holds great promise as a potential therapeutic candidate for T1DM.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pancreatic β cell</kwd><kwd>type 1 diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>eugenol</kwd><kwd>NRF2 signaling pathway</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)</kwd><kwd>Eugenol (EUG)</kwd><kwd>Oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>Apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Pancreatic β cell</kwd><kwd>NRF2 signaling pathway</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100022963</institution-id><institution>Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023C03018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Xiaoling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004731</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LY24H020008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Xiaoling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007835</institution-id><institution>Wenzhou Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>604090352/640</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Xiaoling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004731</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LTGY23H03003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Weiping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Eugenol has the ability to improve the type 1 diabetes mellitus through NRF2-mediated oxidative stress pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic and progressive autoimmune disorder characterized by severe destruction of pancreatic β cells, leading to an absolute deficiency of insulin and subsequent hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu and Zhao, 2020</xref>). The symptoms of this disease include polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, wasting, etc., which can progress to ketoacidosis and even result in death without any treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Syed, 2022</xref>). Additionally, chronic hyperglycemia can cause various complications, including diabetic nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Papadopoulou-Marketou et al., 2018</xref>) and diabetic cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2022a</xref>), which impose huge social and economic burdens. The global incidence of T1DM is rapidly increasing. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), it is estimated that there were approximately 537 million adults (aged 20–79) worldwide affected by diabetes in 2021, while over 1.2 million children and adolescents (aged 0–19) were diagnosed with T1DM. The global prevalence of diabetes is projected to reach approximately 783 million individuals by 2045, with developing countries experiencing the largest increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Magliano and Boyko, 2021</xref>). Currently, insulin intervention remains the most efficacious approach for managing T1DM. However, challenges persist in addressing postprandial glycemic fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cobry et al., 2010</xref>) and life expectancy is shorter. Furthermore, in comparison to the general population, the quality of life is considerably compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalyva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cameron et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial to explore more effective treatment strategies for T1DM patients.</p><p>Oxidative stress, a widely discussed concept in recent years, refers to the imbalance between oxygen free radical production and anti-oxidant reactions within cells, playing a crucial role in diabetes pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rains and Jain, 2011</xref>). Hyperglycemia in diabetic patients can result in an augmented generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the up-regulation of oxidative stress-related markers in vivo, while decreasing expression of anti-oxidant markers and disrupting internal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maiese et al., 2007</xref>). The cells typically possess robust mechanisms for anti-oxidant protection to maintain cellular homeostasis, particularly through the action of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), which serves as an efficient regulator of cellular anti-oxidant defense by modulating the expression of genes encoding anti-oxidant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sajadimajd and Khazaei, 2018</xref>). NRF2 can interact with the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) in the cytoplasm under normal physiological conditions, leading to subsequent degradation through ubiquitination. When cells are exposed to oxidative stress, NRF2 dissociates from KEAP1, evades ubiquitination, and translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Subsequently, it enhances the expression of target proteins, such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) by binding to the anti-oxidant response element (ARE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dinkova-Kostova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wasserman and Fahl, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang and Hannink, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, ROS can induce DNA damage, and modulate the expression of proteins involved in cell regulation inhibition or activation, impair mitochondrial function, ultimately leading to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguiar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Recent findings have indicated that the systemic activation of NRF2 signaling leads to a delay in the onset of T1DM in spontaneous non-obese diabetic mice models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yagishita et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, targeting NRF2 may offer potential for the prevention and treatment of T1DM.</p><p>Eugenol (EUG), a phenolic aromatic compound, is primarily derived from clove oil. The compound exhibits a range of biological activities, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-bacterial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ulanowska and Olas, 2021</xref>). Previous study has demonstrated that EUG could alleviate colitis by reducing oxidative stress through the activation of the KEAP1-NRF2 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, EUG has been observed to attenuate apoptosis induced by transmissible gastroenteritis virus through the ROS-NRF2-ARE signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2022b</xref>).</p><p>So far, no reports have been published to ascertain whether EUG confers a protective effect on damaged pancreatic β cells in individuals with T1DM. Our study aims to investigate the protective effect of EUG on pancreatic β cell damage in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1DM mouse model and STZ-induced MIN6 cell model, with the objective of elucidating the underlying mechanism. The findings may provide a potential novel therapeutic candidate drug for T1DM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EUG can relieve the symptoms associated with T1DM and reduce the blood glucose level in T1DM mice</title><p>The experimental design timeline for in vivo experiments was depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

The findings demonstrated that treatment with EUG resulted in a reduction in blood glucose levels and improvement in islet function in T1DM mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). The chronic and progressive nature of diabetes necessitates vigilance, as prolonged hyperglycemia can exert deleterious effects on vital organs such as the heart, kidneys, and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Papadopoulou-Marketou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khoury et al., 2018</xref>).

The islets’ structural integrity in each group of mice was performed through hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining.

Furthermore, a heat map was generated to visualize the relative abundance of these DEGs affected by T1DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The findings were consistent with previous results, which showed the intervention of EUG could enhance the functionality of islet β cells, augment insulin secretion, and mitigate hyperglycemia in T1DM mice. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) based on BP (biological process) gene revealed that compared to the T1DM group, the EUG intervention group exhibited significant enrichment in pathways, including ‘response to glucose’, ‘response to carbohydrate’, ‘cellular glucose homeostasis’, and ‘positive regulation of insulin secretion’ with NES&gt;0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>).

Consequently, T1DM is more prevalent among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu and Zhao, 2020</xref>). Although subcutaneous insulin injection is the conventional clinical treatment for T1DM, it fails to improve life quality of patients. Therefore, there is an urgent to explore more efficacious therapies for T1DM. A large number of studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress and apoptosis play crucial roles in causing islet damage in T1DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Piganelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Santin and Eizirik, 2013</xref>). In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of EUG on islet damage in both in vivo and in vitro models of T1DM, and tried to illuminate the underlying mechanism.</p><p>EUG is a phenolic compound, which is present in various aromatic plants, exhibits a wide range of pharmacological properties including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-bacterial activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ulanowska and Olas, 2021</xref>). The administration of EUG has been shown to effectively lower blood glucose levels, ameliorate insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al-Trad et al., 2019</xref>), inhibit the activity of key diabetes-related enzymes in diabetic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mnafgui et al., 2013</xref>), and suppress the production of advanced glycosylation end products associated with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singh et al., 2016a</xref>). Therefore, it is speculated that EUG may have a protective effect on diabetes. The meta-analysis conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carvalho et al., 2021</xref> investigated the impact of EUG treatment on hyperglycemic murine models. The findings demonstrated that purified EUG effectively improved glucose levels, blood lipids, body weight, and restored anti-oxidant defense in diabetic animals. Moreover, EUG exhibited a reduction in markers associated with kidney damage in experimental diabetic animals. The purity of the EUG utilized in this study was 99.3%, and the results in this research were consistent with the meta-analysis in Carvalho et al. In this study, we will try to explore the protective effects of EUG on STZ-induced in vitro and in vivo T1DM models. Our in vivo results showed that administration of EUG could effectively ameliorate the T1DM symptoms such as polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, and weight loss. Additionally, it also alleviates ketonuria and glycosuria of T1DM mice. The islet damage in T1DM mice was mitigated, and insulin secretion was enhanced, along with effective alleviation of hyperglycemia symptoms, due to the intervention of EUG. As a chronic disease, diabetes can affect multiple organs, including the kidney, liver, and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Papadopoulou-Marketou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khoury et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, PAS staining showed that EUG intervention could reduce glomerular glycogen accumulation and improved the prognosis in T1DM mice. Our in vitro data showed that treatment with EUG could ameliorate the functional impairment of MIN6 cells induced by STZ, leading to increased insulin secretion levels, and reduced apoptosis and ROS production. Therefore, it can be speculated that EUG has the potential to treat T1DM.</p><p>The individuals suffering from diabetes exhibit persistent hyperglycemia, resulting in the generation of ROS that can cause cellular damage through various mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Mitochondrial function serves as the primary source of ROS, and in cases of mitochondrial dysfunction, there is an augmented production of ROS within the mitochondrial respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pieczenik and Neustadt, 2007</xref>). The mitochondrial respiratory chain complex enzymes are impaired under persistent hyperglycemia, leading to the development of secondary complications in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kowaltowski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jezek and Hlavatá, 2005</xref>). Therefore, oxidative stress is widely recognized as a major factor in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Our RNA-seq analyses showed that the oxidative stress signaling were highly activated in T1DM mice and improved after intervention with EUG. Similarly, our study showed an elevation in MDA levels in T1DM mice. This biomarker is associated with oxidative stress that represents the end product of lipid peroxidation caused by free radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayala et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, anti-oxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px can facilitate the catabolism of superoxide and peroxides in order to protect the body from oxidative stress damage. In our study, there was a reduction in the levels of SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px in T1DM group in vivo, while intervention with EUG could inhibit MDA level and promote productions of SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px in T1DM mice. These anti-oxidant enzymes subsequently inhibited the oxidative stress response in T1DM mice by restricting the occurrence of free radical reactions. Mitochondria play a pivotal role in the regulation of oxidative stress. The results of MitoSOX fluorescence staining and ROS flow cytometry in vitro results showed that there was a increase in mitochondrial ROS and intracellular total ROS levels in STZ-induced MIN6 cells, which could be attenuated by EUG intervention. Furthermore, both in vivo and in vitro findings have demonstrated that EUG exhibited the ability to augment the expression of the relevant indicators within the NRF2 signaling pathway, which is associated with anti-oxidant stress response. To further verify the association between EUG and the NRF2 signaling pathway, the NRF2-specific inhibitor ML385 was used in vitro experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2016b</xref>). Notably, ML385 could abolish the effects of EUG. Therefore, we hypothesized that the activation of NRF2 signaling pathway might function as a protective mechanism of EUG against STZ-induced T1DM.</p><p>NRF2 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in cellular response to oxidative stress by inducing the expression of various anti-oxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Maltagliati, 2018</xref>), and its activity is regulated by the endogenous inhibitor KEAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kansanen et al., 2013</xref>). The NRF2 and KEAP1 proteins form a conserved intracellular defense mechanism to combat oxidative stress. Normally, KEAP1-CUL3-E3 ubiquitin ligase typically targets the N-terminal Neh2 domain of NRF2, and then facilitates NRF2 ubiquitination, thereby maintaining a low level of NRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). In response to oxidative stress, specific cysteine residues in KEAP1 are modified that induce conformational changes in the KEAP1-CUL3-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, thereby disrupting NRF2 ubiquitination and facilitating its translocation into the nucleus for heterodimerization with small MAF protein (sMAF). This complex subsequently binds to ARE located in the promoter region of various cytoprotective genes, thereby facilitating their transcription and inducing the expression of a range of cell-protective genes, including NQO1, HMOX1, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px. This process plays a crucial role in mitigating oxidative stress, exerting an anti-oxidative stress role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tonelli et al., 2018</xref>). Previous study had demonstrated that EUG could attenuate the oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by transmissible gastroenteritis virus through the ROS-NRF2-ARE signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2022b</xref>). To further explore the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation in T1DM, we conducted RNA-seq analysis on pancreatic tissues obtained from the Control group, T1DM group, and EUG group. Our findings from DEGs and heat map revealed the intervention of EUG could enhance the functionality of islet β cells, augment insulin secretion, and mitigate hyperglycemia in T1DM mice. GSEA showed that compared to the T1DM group, the EUG intervention might alleviate T1DM by improving oxidative stress pathway. Additionally, in this study, both in vivo and in vitro data showed that EUG activated NRF2, promoting its translocation into the nucleus, and inducing the expression of cytoprotective proteins NQO1 and HMOX1. Moreover, in vivo study showed that NRF2 regulated the levels of anti-oxidant enzymes such as SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px to suppress free radical reactions, exerting a protective effect on T1DM mice. Our in vivo results suggested that EUG has the potential to alleviate pancreatic β cell damage by activating the NRF2 pathway, thereby augmenting insulin secretion and ameliorating the prognosis of T1DM. Meanwhile, the intervention of ML385 counteracted the anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects of EUG, leading to a reduction in NRF2 nuclear translocation and down-regulation of anti-oxidant oxidases. Therefore, we hypothesized the activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway through EUG might potentially alleviate damage of pancreatic β cells in T1DM.</p><p>Mitochondria are the main sites for cellular production of ROS, and intracellular ROS can function as signaling molecules to regulate physiological functions within the body. Accumulation of ROS caused by hyperglycemia can result in a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and an increased in membrane permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lepore et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rachek et al., 2006</xref>). The apoptotic factor cytochrome <italic>c</italic> is released into the cytoplasm to initiate the activation of the Caspase cascade (e.g. Caspase9 and Caspase3 are activated successively), leading to chromosome aggregation and DNA fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D’Amelio et al., 2010</xref>). The protein Caspase-3, which is essential for cellular function, plays a pivotal role in the intricate process of programmed cell death known as apoptosis. The BCL-2 family proteins, encompassing anti-apoptotic proteins like BCL-2 and BCL-xl, as well as pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAD, can regulate this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams and Cory, 1998</xref>). The dysregulation of the BCL2/BAX, characterized by aberrant expression of anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic genes, can initiate apoptosis and ultimately result in organ damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liao et al., 2019</xref>). The development of T1DM is attributed to the autoimmune destruction of islet β cells, and islet activation stimulates antigen-presenting cells, triggering the activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cells and subsequent the release of chemokines/cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">James et al., 2020</xref>). The activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells is subsequently induced by these cytokines, resulting in the subsequent destruction of β cells. The apoptotic pathways of T1DM include exogenous (receptor-mediated) and endogenous (mitochondria-driven) mechanisms. Exogenous pathway encompasses CD4<sup>+</sup>-CD8<sup>+</sup> interacting Fas pathway, while endogenous pathway is characterized by a delicate balance between anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma (BCL-2) and BCL-xL proteins with pro-apoptotic Bax, Bad, Bid, and Bik proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tomita, 2017</xref>). Therefore, targeted intervention of apoptosis can effectively enhance the prognosis of T1DM. The EUG compound has been reported to alleviate precancerous breast lesions by inhibiting apoptosis through the HER2/PI3K-AKT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullah et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, our in vivo and in vitro results showed that EUG treatment down-regulated the expression of BAX and Cleaved Caspase-3, while up-regulated the level of BCL2 in the T1DM mice. Additionally, it reduced the number of TUNEL positive cells, thereby exerting a protective effect on islet β cells in T1DM mice. The survival of cell is dependent on the integrity of DNA, as any damage to DNA has the potential to induce cellular apoptosis or necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kinner et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, our data demonstrated that the expression of the DNA damage biomarker γH2AX was elevated in T1DM group both in vivo and in vitro, whereas intervention with EUG could reversed this trend. The involvement of NRF2 in the regulation of apoptosis has been observed, and cells lacking NRF2 exhibit an increased occurrence of spontaneous apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Merchant et al., 2011</xref>). Our in vitro results showed that the NRF2-specific inhibitor ML385 could attenuate the anti-apoptosis effect of EUG on STZ-induced MIN6 cells. Consequently, we speculated that EUG exerts its apoptotic suppression through activating the NRF2 signaling pathway. The findings of this study suggest that EUG may exert a protective effect on pancreatic β cell damage in T1DM by mitigating oxidative stress and apoptosis through the activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway.</p><p>In this study, in vivo and in vitro results suggested that EUG may exert a protective effect on pancreatic β cell damages in T1DM by alleviating oxidative stress and apoptosis via activating the NRF2 signaling pathway. However, there are certain limitations to our study. First, ML385 was solely used to assess the protective effect of EUG in vitro but not in vivo, and the inhibitory effect on NRF2 in vivo needs to be further investigated. Second, it is imperative to analyze the dynamics of NRF2 decay in order to ascertain whether EUG affects the stability of NRF2 protein and gain a deeper understanding of its mechanism of action. Lastly, although MIN6 cells are extensively utilized in diabetes in vitro research, the primary islet cells would be optimal for studying T1DM in vitro.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies have demonstrated that EUG treatment could alleviate the symptoms associated with T1DM and ameliorate the damage of islets in T1DM mice. Moreover, EUG exhibited the ability to attenuate the deleterious effects on MIN6 cells induced by STZ in vitro. Additionally, EUG exhibits inhibitory effects on the oxidative stress and apoptosis in T1DM group in vivo and in vitro by activating the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress pathway. These findings suggested that EUG holds potential as a therapeutic option for patients with TIDM.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

C57BL/6 mice (n=150) weighing 18–20 g and aged 5–6 weeks were procured from Zhejiang Weitong Lihua Laboratory Animal Technology Co., LTD. The mice were housed in a temperature-controlled pathogen-free facility (SPF) environment with a light/dark cycle for 12 hr, maintained at a temperature of 23°C ± 2°C, relative humidity between 45% and 55%, and provided ad libitum access to food and water. All experimental operations were approved by the Ethics Committee of Laboratory Animals of Wenzhou Medical University, and were strictly adhered to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (wydw2022-0208).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Animal experiment</title><p>After 1 week of adaptive feeding, T1DM mouse model was established in C57BL/6 mice using STZ (Sigma-Aldrich, CA, USA). Briefly, each morning after 5 hr fasting period in each group of mice, STZ was dissolved in a 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer (Solarbio, China, Beijing), and then intraperitoneally injected into mice at a dose of 50 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Furman, 2021</xref>). The STZ solution was prepared under dark conditions and utilized promptly due to its inherent instability and photosensitivity. The mice were administered a 10% glucose solution instead of water during T1DM modeling to prevent mortality resulting from transient hypoglycemia. Fasting blood glucose levels were measured 3 days after modeling, and mice with fasting glucose levels more than 250 mg/dL were included in the study.</p><p>The intervention treatment of T1DM mice is conducted through two methods: oral administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>) and oral gavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xing et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sudirman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yao et al., 2023</xref>). Due to limited experimental conditions, it is not feasible to feed a single mouse in a single cage, which makes it challenging to precisely control the actual daily intervention dose for each mouse when using oral administration. To ensure that each mouse receives an intervention dose according to its weight and expected dosage, we employ a method of gavage. In addition, oral gavage is more convenient and easier to operate than oral administration.</p><p>In terms of dosage setting for EUG (purity &gt;98%, MedChemExpress, NJ, USA), previous studies have demonstrated that oral gavage of EUG (20 mg/kg/day) is effective in improving hyperglycemic symptoms in mice for 15 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, studies have shown that oral gavage of EUG (5, 10 mg/kg/day) can cure visceral leishmaniasis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charan Raja et al., 2021</xref>). Based on these reports, the T1DM mice in our study were divided into five groups: Control (n=30), T1DM (n=30), T1DM+EUG (5 mg/kg/day) (n=30), T1DM+EUG (10 mg/kg/day) (n=30), and T1DM+EUG (20 mg/kg/day) (n=30). Each group received daily oral gavage for 8 weeks, while the Control group received an equivalent volume of normal saline. Fasting blood glucose levels and fasting weight were measured and recorded on a weekly basis. Finally, serum samples were collected through orbital blood collection technique, while pancreatic tissue was isolated for subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Fasting blood glucose, OGTT</title><p>The OGTT is widely regarded as the criterion for diagnosing T1DM, which is crucial methods for assessing pancreatic islet function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helminen et al., 2015</xref>). Following a 14 hr fasting period, the fasting blood glucose levels were measured in each group mice, and tail vein blood samples were collected and analyzed using a glucometer. OGTT was performed by administering a 20% glucose solution intragastrically after the fasting period, and blood glucose levels were measured at 0 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min following the initial gavage administration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Food, water, urine volume, and urine glucose measurements</title><p>The changes in food and water intake for each group were recorded throughout the experiment by regulating the daily initial food intake (100 g) and water quantity (250 mL). After successful modeling of T1DM mice, the experimental animals were grouped based on the section Animal experiment as follows: Control, T1DM, T1DM+EUG (5 mg/kg/day), T1DM+EUG (10 mg/kg/day), and T1DM+EUG (20 mg/kg/day). To ensure consistency among groups, each group consisted of five mice and had equal amounts of diet (100 g), drinking water (250 mL), and environmental conditions for feeding. The urine volume of each cage was quantified by measuring the area of the bedding material saturated with urine. The urine samples from each group of mice were collected for the detection of urine glucose levels using the Urine Glucose Assay Kit (Jiancheng, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Islet isolation</title><p>The method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2010</xref>, was employed for the isolation of islets. First, the common bile duct was ligated, and a retrograde injection of collagenase V solution (0.8 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, CA, USA) was performed through the common bile duct until the pancreas was completely filled and foliated. The pancreas was then digested in 5 mL of collagenase V solution at a concentration of the same for 15 min at 37°C until the majority of pancreatic tissues were digested into chylous and silt. To stop the process of digestion, 10 mL of 4°C Hank’s solution was added and then centrifuged after gentle shaking. The centrifugation was immediately stopped upon reaching a speed of 2000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded and the sediment was washed twice using Hank’s balanced salt solution. Islet tissues were placed in 5 mL of 4°C Ficoll density gradient medium (1.119). After mixing, a sequence of slow drips consisting of 2 mL 4°C Ficoll density gradient medium (1.077) and 2 mL Hank’s solution was performed before centrifugation at a speed of 2000 rpm for a duration of 5 min. The sediment was washed again with Hank’s solution, and subsequently was picked under a dissecting microscope (Leica, Germany). The isolated islets were promptly utilized for subsequent experimental procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Insulin and ketonuria ELISA</title><p>After collecting the culture supernatant of MIN6 cells and mouse serum from each group, insulin levels in the samples were evaluated using a commercially available ELISA assay kit (Boyun, Shanghai, China) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. The urine samples from each group were collected for the quantification of ketonuria levels using a commercially available ELISA kit (Boyun, Shanghai, China).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>PAS staining</title><p>After dewaxing the paraffin sections, a PAS staining kit (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) was utilized to detect glomerular glycogen accumulation. These tissue sections were immersed in a 0.5% periodate solution for 15 min, and subsequently stained with Schiff reagent for 30 min in darkness. Finally, the nuclei of these tissue sections were stained using hematoxylin reagent. The images of paraffin sections were captured using an optical microscope (Nikon, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>H&amp;E staining</title><p>The fresh pancreatic tissues from mice in each group were carefully separated and promptly fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Solarbio, Beijing, China). After dehydration for 24 hr, they were embedded in paraffin and sliced into 5 μm. Subsequently, the paraffin sections of pancreas were stained with H&amp;E staining kit (Servicebio, Wuhan, China), and the pathological changes of pancreatic islets were observed under an optical microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunohistochemistry staining</title><p>After dewaxing, the peroxidase blockade agent (Zsbio, Beijing, China) was applied to the tissue surface at room temperature (RT) for 20 min. Following a 15 min wash with PBS, sections were subjected to antigen repair by boiling in a pressure cooker containing 10 mM citrate acid buffer for 2 min (pH 6.0, Solarbio, Beijing, China). Subsequently, antigen blocking was performed using 10% goat serum (Beyotime, Shanghai, China), and then the slides were incubated with primary antibodies (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) overnight at 4°C. On the second day, these sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000, Affinity Biosciences) at 37°C for 2 hr, and then stained with a solution of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Zsbio, Beijing, China) and hematoxylin. The images of pancreatic paraffin sections were captured using an optical microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA-sequencing</title><p>Total RNAs were isolated using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies), after which the concentration, quality, and integrity were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Products were purified (AMPure XP system) and quantified using the Agilent high-sensitivity DNA assay on a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent). The sequencing library was then sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina) by Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Co. Ltd.</p><p>The DESeq package was used to analyze the differences in gene expression profiles, and the gseGO function in the clusterProfiler package was used to conduct GSEA according to the Gene Ontology (GO) database. The analysis was performed in the R language environment (version 4.2.0). The gene expression data of the T1DM group and EUG intervention group were thoroughly pre-processed before analysis, including standardization, missing value processing, and other necessary quality control steps. The pre-processed data were used to assess the enrichment of gene sets associated with GO in different biological states. The GO database used covers three main domains: BP, MF, and cell components. The significance level was set as p&lt;0.05 and NES score &gt;1.4. The significance was corrected by multiple tests, and the p-value was adjusted by false discovery rate method. The gseGO function was used to evaluate the enrichment of a gene set in a given gene expression data, including calculating the enrichment score (ES) and standardized enrichment score (NES) of the gene set.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cell culture and treatment</title><p>The mouse pancreatic β cell line MIN6 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), and was cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco, United States) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, CA, USA), 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, CA, USA), and 1% MEM NON-ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS SOLUTION (100×; NEAA, Gibco, USA) at a temperature of 37°C in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator with a concentration of 5%. The cells were passaged every 3 days.</p><p>The in vitro cell model of T1DM was induced by STZ. MIN6 cells were treated with various concentrations of STZ (0.5 mM, 1 mM, 2 mM, 4 mM, and 8 mM) for a duration of 24 hr to determine the optimal working concentration. Subsequently, STZ-induced MIN6 cells were exposed to different concentrations of EUG (50 μM, 100 μM, 200 μM, 400 μM, and 600 μM) for a duration of 2 hr to identify the optimal working concentration. Based on the optimal working concentrations of STZ and EUG respectively, we set different groups, including Control, STZ, STZ+EUG, STZ+ML385 (10 μM, MedChemExpress, NJ, USA), STZ+ML385+EUG. Pre-treatment with either EUG or ML385 occurred 2 hr prior to stimulation with STZ, simultaneous administration of ML385 and EUG mixture took place at the same time. Finally, the cells or cell supernatants from each respective group were collected for subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cell viability assay</title><p>The cell viability of MIN6 cells was assessed using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Yeasen, Shanghai, China) under different treatment conditions. MIN6 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 5×10<sup>3</sup>/well. Once the cells reached 80–90% confluence, they were subjected to treatment with different concentrations of drugs. The different doses of EUG were added into the 96-well plates 2 hr prior to STZ treatment. Subsequent to drug administration, each well was supplemented with 100 µL DMEM containing 10 µL CCK-8 solution.

I summarize them below, together with some that were dealt with in their response but still remain unaddressed or not commented upon.</p><p>- STZ treatment cannot be used as a T1D model for the reasons I outlined in my previous letter. I would have been happy to see a response on that but they did not provide any. The manuscript is misleading in this important respect.</p><p>- Mechanistically, the manuscript remains at a rather superficial level. I highlighted some possibilities to enrich the manuscript but none was addressed even in the discussion.</p><p>(a) How is eugenol penetrating the cell, is there a receptor that could be potentially targeted?</p><p>(b) Are there intermediary proteins that convey the effect to the Nrf2/Keap1 complex or is eugenol directly disrupting their interaction?</p><p>(c) What are direct downstream Nrf2 effectors?</p><p>(d) Besides, streptozotocin is also a powerful DNA alkylating agent, are such effects relieved by eugenol?</p><p>- It is puzzling that all molecular analyses show a gradual reversion effect with increasing doses of eugenol but this gradual effect is apparently missing in many of the physiological parameters assessed in Figure 1, including the all-important OGTT assays. Can the authors interpret this? In the high eugenol group in the OGTT assays there is a group of mice that are clearly outliers. Most likely the STZ treatment for these mice was not efficient and their inclusion skews the results. Besides, it is important to assess differences among eugenol groups (one way ANOVA). The statistical tests provided are incomplete and sometimes not done correctly.</p><p>- Given that medical research is still heavily biased in favor of analyses in males and given that the authors have analyzed in Figure 1 a very large number of animals what are the results stratified by sex?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96600.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Jiang et al. aims to establish the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) mouse model in vivo and the STZ-induced pancreatic β cell MIN6 cell model in vitro to explore the protective effects of Eugenol (EUG) on T1DM.

Eugenol (EUG) is a natural compound previously documented as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-apoptotic. In this manuscript by Jiang et al., the authors study the effects of EUG on T1DM in MIN6 insulinoma cells and a mouse model of chemically induced T1DM. The authors show that EUG increases nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) levels. This results in a reduction of pancreatic beta-cell damage, apoptosis, oxidative stress markers, and a recovery of insulin secretion. The authors highlight these effects as indicative of the therapeutic potential of EUG in managing T1DM.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>Relevant, timely, and addresses an interesting question in the field. The authors consistently observe enhanced beta cell functionality following EUG treatment, which makes the compound a promising candidate for T1DM therapy.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>(1) The in vivo experiments have too few biological replicates. With an n=3 (as all figure legends indicate) in complex mouse studies such as these, drawing robust conclusions becomes challenging. It is important to reproduce these results in a larger cohort, to validate the conclusions of the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments.

Mouse insulinoma cells (MIN6 cell line) are permanent cell lines isolated from mouse islet β cell tumors, which can reflect the functional changes of islet β cells. As mature islet cells, MIN6 cells have been widely used in the study of type 1 diabetes mellitus[1-4], so in this study, MIN6 cells were used as the cell model in vitro. In our future studies, we will try to conduct our findings using more relevant in vitro cell systems (eg. Islets).</p><p>References:</p><p>(1) WU M, CHEN W, ZHANG S, et al.

In fact, many anti-oxidant drugs are used for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus in the clinical. For example, lipoic acid was used to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy[5]. Vitamin E could effectively eliminate free radicals, protect cell membranes, and significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with SPACE or ICARE diabetes[6]. Glutathione played crucial roles in the detoxification and anti-oxidant systems of cells and has been used to treat acute poisoning and chronic liver diseases by intravenous injection[7]. Therefore, eugenol enhances the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus by modulating oxidative stress pathways and holds potential as a future therapeutic choice for clinical application. In the future relevant studies, we will try to use Vitamin C or Vitamin E as the positive control.</p><p>References:</p><p>(5) ZIEGLER D, PAPANAS N, SCHNELL O, et al.

The previous studies on which the dosages were based used oral administration (gavage). (Discussed in methods 4.2).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your professional comments. The intervention treatment of T1DM mice is conducted through two methods: oral administration[8] and oral gavage[9-11]. Due to limited experimental conditions, it is not feasible to feed a single mouse in a single cage, which makes it challenging to precisely control the actual daily intervention dose for each mouse when using oral administration. To ensure that each mouse receives an intervention dose according to its weight and expected dosage, we employ a method of gavage. In addition, oral gavage is more convenient and easier to operate than oral administration. Therefore, in vivo experiment of this study used eugenol gavage intervention as a treatment method.

After successful modeling of T1DM mice, the successful modeling mice were grouped based on method 4.2 as follows Control, T1DM, T1DM + EUG (5 mg/kg/day), T1DM + EUG (10 mg/kg/day), and T1DM + EUG (20 mg/kg/day). To ensure consistency among groups, each group consisted of 5 mice and had equal amounts of diet (100 g), drinking water (250 mL), and environmental conditions for feeding. The urine-soaked area of mice in each group was recorded to quantify the urine volume. The conditions are the same for each group. The description of Method 4.4 has been improved in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• OGTT (Figure 1H) of week 2 is missing.

If possible, add the 120-minute time point to see if the blood glucose levels return to baseline in the control group. The graph shows increased basal glucose levels in the experimental groups, but no differences in insulin tolerance. It also misses the AUC calculations. It is probably not significantly different, which should be noted in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. T1DM primarily manifests as pancreatic β cell damage and the absolute reduction of insulin secretion, resulting in the disorder of glucose metabolism in vivo. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a series of plasma glucose concentrations measured within 2 h after oral gavage of a certain amount of glucose. It is a standard method to evaluate an individual's blood glucose regulation ability and to understand the function of islet β cells. Insulin resistance means reducing the efficiency of insulin to promote glucose uptake and utilization for various reasons, and the body's compensatory secretion of excessive insulin leads to hyperinsulinemia to maintain the stability of blood glucose. The insulin resistance test (ITT) is commonly employed to detect insulin resistance in T2DM. However, it was found that the ITT experiment had little correlation with T1DM. Therefore, the ITT experiment of Figure 1J and related description have been removed from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The staining and FACS data on the effects of STZ+EUG+/- ML385 are not convincing (Figure 6 and Figure 7) and do not seem to align with the bar graphs and the conclusions in the text.

The intervention of STZ was an absolute decrease in the number of islet β cells, so the result of insulin immunofluorescence staining was only a decrease in the number of MIN6 cells in each cell group. In addition, the detection of insulin protein expression level is always through ELISA method to assess the secretion of insulin protein in the cell supernatant. Figure 6E is the ELISA results of insulin protein secretion in the cell supernatant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The experimental design for the in vitro experiments was unclear from the text.

ML385 is a commonly used and stable inhibitor of the NRF2 and has been used in a variety of disease studies[13-15]. The MIN6 cells utilized in this study were cultured under challenging conditions and exhibited a sluggish growth rate. Owing to the cytotoxicity associated with siRNAs transfection reagents, a significant proportion of MIN6 cells succumbed following transfection. Consequently, small molecule inhibitors ML385 were employed in this investigation.

Protein normalization refers to the standardization of proteins from different sources and with different properties, so as to facilitate the comparison of protein content and expression in different samples. In WB experiment, protein expression normalization is one of the essential steps. Western blot of nuclear protein generally cannot be performed using β-Actin as an internal reference. Lamin B was chosen because β-Actin is an intrinsic parameter not found in the nucleus. N-NRF2, as a nuclear protein, requires Lamin B as a reference for protein normalization.

EUG intervention has a dose-dependent effect on T1DM. According to Figure 1B-I, 20 mg/kg EUG has the best effect. Fasting body weight, blood glucose, water intake, food intake, and OGTT were statistically assessed in Figure 1 of the revised manuscript. In addition, we performed statistical analyse of ketonuria between no and high eugenol treatments again in the revised manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we have also made objective revisions to the expression of eugenol's efficacy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) ITT is not used to detect T1DM (line 126).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion.

A likely explanation is that EUG just postpones beta cell death. I assume that these analyses were done in week 10 but it is not stated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your professional suggestion. Perhaps because the file is compressed, the gray value of WB strip is not obvious, so the expression of INS is not seen clearly. In fact, the intervention of STZ resulted in a significant decrease in INS expression compared with the Control group, which could be alleviated by the treatment of EUG. However, due to the large difference in INS between the STZ group, EUG treatment, and the Control group, the gray values of INS in the STZ group and the STZ + EUG group were not clear. As mentioned in the method 4.12-4.13, our WB and PCR samples were from 10 week mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The γH2Ax stainings provided are weak and do not fully correspond to the quantitation - the 5 mg/Kg EUG treatment appears less severe than the 10 mg/Kg. In contrast, changes in the PCD pathway are convincingly demonstrated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your reminder. γH2AX immunohistochemical staining is required to be located in the islets. It measured the number of β cells stained with brown, not the brown area. The ZOOM image of γH2AX staining showed that the EUG improvement effect of 10 mg/kg was better than that of 5 mg/kg. γH2AX, as a marker of DNA damage, exhibits nuclear localization and is absent in the cytoplasmic compartment. Therefore, in Figure 4C-D, we quantified the proportion of cells exhibiting brown staining. In Figure 4C, black arrows were employed to highlight the presence of brown-stained islet β cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Is there a reason for looking at mRNA levels of Ho-1 but not KEAP1 or NQO-1 ? What is the expression of Nrf2 itself at the RNA level? Please give in the text what the abbreviations MDA, SOD, CAT GSH-Px stand for. Are these protein levels or activity assays? Units in the y-axis of graphs?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your constructive suggestion.The required KEAP1 and NQO-1 primers have been synthesized, and the relevant data have been supplemented in the revised manuscript. The expression of Nrf2 itself at the RNA level is T-NRF2 (Total NRF2). The MDA, SOD, CAT and GSH-Px abbreviations stand for Malondialdehyde, Superoxide dismutase, Catalase, Glutathione peroxidase, and the relevant information, which have been supplemented in the revised manuscript. These are activity assays of serum, and units in the y-axis of graphs have been added in the revised manuscripts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The Ins levels in the culture medium of STZ + ML treated cells are much lower than the levels in STZ treated cells (6D). This is not consistent with the results of Ins cell content or Ins expression as stated (6B and D).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your careful review. The experimental samples in Figure 6C in the revised manuscript represent the proteins extracted from cells of each group, while the experimental samples in Figure 6E represent the supernatant of cells from each group. ML385 is an inhibitor of NRF2, which effectively suppresses the NRF2 signaling pathway and aggravates MIN6 cell damage, resulting in lower INS expression observed in both the STZ+ML385 group depicted in Figures 6C and 6E compared to that in the STZ group. Although the sample sources of the two groups differ and there are slight variations in the trend, it can be observed that the overall trend of the STZ+ML385 group is comparatively lower than that of the STZ group.</p></body></sub-article></article>
