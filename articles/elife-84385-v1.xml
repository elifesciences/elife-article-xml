They stand to provide additional insight if integrated with multielectrode techniques common in systems neuroscience. Here, we present and test a platform for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted, intracortical multielectrode probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology. A custom-built current source provides stable current and allows for controlled, repeatable lesions in awake-behaving animals. Performance of this novel lesioning technique was validated using histology from ex vivo and in vivo testing, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesioning. This electrolytic lesioning method avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining neuronal population after lesioning. This technique can be used in many areas of cortex, in several species, and theoretically with any multielectrode probe. The low-cost, external lesioning device can also easily be adopted into an existing electrophysiology recording setup. This technique is expected to enable future causal investigations of the recorded neuronal population’s role in neuronal circuit function, while simultaneously providing new insight into local reorganization after neuron loss.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Over the past three decades, the field of neuroscience has made significant leaps in understanding how the brain works. This is largely thanks to microelectrode arrays, devices which are surgically implanted into the outermost layer of the brain known as the cortex. Once inserted, these devices can precisely monitor the electrical activity of a few hundred neurons while also stimulating neurons to reversibly modulate their activity.</p><p>However, current microelectrode arrays are missing a key function: they cannot irreversibly inactivate neurons over long-time scales. This ability would allow researchers to understand how networks of neurons adapt and re-organize after injury or during neurodegenerative diseases where brain cells are progressively lost.</p><p>To address this limitation, Bray, Clarke, et al. developed a device capable of creating consistent amounts of neuron loss, while retaining the crucial ability to record electrical activity following a lesion. Calibration tests in sheep and pigs provided the necessary parameters for this custom circuit, which was then verified as safe in non-human primates. These experiments demonstrated that the device could effectively cause neuron loss without compromising the recording capabilities of the microelectrode array.</p><p>By seamlessly integrating neuron inactivation with monitoring of neuronal activity, scientists can now investigate the direct effects of such damage and subsequent neural reorganization. This device could help neuroscientists to explore neural repair and rehabilitation after brain cell loss, which may lead to better treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, this technique could offer insights into the interactions between neural circuits that drive behavior, enhancing our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying how the brain works.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuroelectrophysiology</kwd><kwd>lesions</kwd><kwd>microelectrode array</kwd><kwd>single-unit recording</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd>S. domesticus</kwd><kwd>O. aries</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship - 828653</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bray</surname><given-names>Iliana E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Research Fellowship - 1656518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bray</surname><given-names>Iliana E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stanford School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dean's Posdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>Stephen E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stanford Wu Tsai Neurosceinces Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nuyujukian</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neuronal loss can be studied by passing electrical current through the same electrodes used for neuron measurement without disrupting recording ability.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuroelectrophysiology – using electrodes to record the electrical signals generated by neurons – has been the defining technique that shifted neuroscience from macroscale anatomy and loss-of-function studies down to the microscale activity of individual neurons and synapses in a given region of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sporns, 2016</xref>). Prior to the last few decades, electrophysiology was limited to simultaneous recordings of at most five neurons with small numbers of electrodes (typically one, two, or four) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">McNaughton et al., 1983</xref>).

Over the last five years, electrode count has continued to increase, with new probes containing thousands of electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Obaid et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sahasrabuddhe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Musk, 2019</xref>).

A method that works across-species (especially in large-animals like rhesus macaques) would leverage the existing injury literature, recording technologies, and behavioral assays from rodents to new world monkeys, while also being well-suited for the behavioral sophistication and human homology of macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Higo, 2021</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>Neuronal activity can either be temporarily or permanently inactivated, defined as manipulation or termination, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vaidya et al., 2019</xref>). For clarity, termination refers to a technique that causes death of neurons, removing them from the circuit. We non-exhaustively review existing manipulation and termination techniques in Appendix 2. However, none of these existing techniques meet all the above design considerations.</p><p>Manipulations enable a causal understanding of the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior by studying adaptation to and from a perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Slonina et al., 2022</xref>). Existing manipulation methods include intracortical microstimulation, optogenetics, pharmacology, transcranial stimulation, cooling loops, and chemogenetics. Since neurons remain anatomically and physiologically viable, manipulations can be easily repeated, until desensitization occurs.</p><p>As termination causes cell death, it can generate stronger causal evidence than a manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vaidya et al., 2019</xref>). For example, even though a transient manipulation of neuronal activity may temporarily disrupt behavior, only a sustained manipulation could elicit the system’s long-term adaption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Slonina et al., 2022</xref>). Over the days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ferrier and Yeo, 1884</xref>) and potentially weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bundy and Nudo, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zeiler et al., 2016</xref> following a termination, the surrounding circuitry and broader network may adapt, leading to behavioral recovery and demonstrating that although the terminated region was causally implicated in behavioral control in the moment, the terminated neurons are <italic>not themselves</italic> causally necessary. A sustained manipulation could accomplish a similar effect to a termination at the systems level, up to the point at which the manipulation stopped. However, it can be difficult to create sustained inactivation with existing reversible manipulation methods, limiting their ability to study the brain’s natural reorganization over timescales of days to months.</p><p>Termination methods overcome the problem of sustained and consistent inactivation from which temporary inactivation techniques suffer. Therefore, they enable a form of causal inference not possible with temporary inactivation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vaidya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shenoy and Kao, 2021</xref>). Existing termination techniques include mechanical trauma, endovascular occlusion, Rose Bengal mediated photothrombosis, and chemical lesioning. Prior termination studies mostly measure behavioral output, with no simultaneous measures of neuronal activity during the behavior, impairing their ability to provide insight into the causal connection between the brain and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Morissette and Boye, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nudo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nudo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wurtz and Goldberg, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Glees and Cole, 1950</xref>), or with no baseline (i.e. pre-lesion) measures of neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Khanna et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Electrolytic lesioning through a microelectrode array</title><p>In order to best meet the three design considerations, we created a device to make an electrolytic lesion through the same microelectrode array used to record neuronal activity. The dual use of this microelectrode array achieves the first design consideration of stable electrophysiology pre- and post-inactivation, as it enables recording from the exact same signal source with minimal physical disruption or displacement. Aside from the initial implantation of the array, there are no invasive procedures required, removing virtually all risk of destabilizing the recorded population. A further benefit of this surgery-free procedure is avoiding analgesia and sedation and allowing for an unprecedented, minutes-long turn-around between pre- and post-lesion data collection; the experiment can resume as soon as close observation of the animal is complete, the lesion device is disconnected, and the recording stream is reconnected. The electrolytic lesioning technique is repeatable, because the same multielectrode probe can be used many times to create lesions while maintaining stable electrophysiological recordings. Performing electrolytic lesioning requires passing a specified amount of current through two electrodes (one acting as the anode, the other as the cathode). Selecting which electrodes in the microelectrode array should be the anode and cathode sets the location of the lesion origin. By using a Utah multielectrode array as in this work, the location of the lesion can be changed at a 400 μm resolution set by the electrode spacing, while altering the duration and amount of current passed through two electrodes creates changes in the lesion’s spatial extent. Thus, while there is still variation in the precise geometry of damage from each lesion, multielectrode-based lesioning does well to satisfy the second design consideration and is a notable refinement from previous lesioning studies. While this platform was designed for use in rhesus macaques, it could be used in other animals in which multielectrode probes can be implanted, such as other primates, large mammals, and rodents. This technique can also be used in effectively any area of cortex in which a multielectrode probe could be implanted. While the link between the lesion location and the multielectrode location technically constrains the lesion to an area of cortex in which a multielectrode array could be implanted, we see the connection as a positive, because it ensures recording some neuroelectrophysiology from the perilesional area in which recovery is hypothesized to occur (see Appendix 1). Therefore, this platform is compatible across many cortical areas, across several species, and theoretically across multielectrode probes, fulfilling the third design consideration. As the lesioning device is a small, low-cost external system that only needs to be connected for the duration of lesioning, it is easy to adopt into existing electrophysiology recording settings. This platform is anticipated to facilitate causal explorations of the relationship between brain and behavior through its unique combination of inactivation and neuroelectrophysiology. Further, it should enable studies of natural reorganization at the neuronal population level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Electrolytic lesioning device and testing</title><p>We created a custom current source circuit which allows us to use the same microelectrode array used to record neuronal activity to also create an electrolytic lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

While this technique should theoretically work with any multielectrode probe, we performed all proof-of-concept experiments with a Utah microelectrode array (Blackrock Neurotech, Salt Lake City, UT). Lesion size is controlled by the amplitude and duration of the current passed through the two chosen electrodes of the microelectrode array, although the exact extent of damage will vary for each lesion due to anatomical variation. Our circuit supplies the voltage needed to damage cortex while maintaining high precision in the delivered current (precision error not exceeding 10 μA). To find a combination of the current amplitude and duration parameters that would create a reasonable lesion size for our use in rhesus macaques, testing was first performed in ex vivo sheep and pig brains, and then in vivo with anesthetized pigs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The circuit diagram for the electrolytic lesioning device.</title><p>An op-amp is used in a negative feedback loop to maintain a constant current through the two electrodes in the brain (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>).

By further reducing the duration and intensity of the current used to lesion, the extent of the cavitation in the cortex was reduced to the point where there is no longer a cavitation but instead a clear region of damaged parenchyma. One minute of 150 μA direct current, passed through two adjacent electrodes in pig cortex resulted in a well-demarcated region of parenchymal damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The region of parenchymal damage appears paler on H&amp;E staining than the adjacent, unaffected parenchyma and was confined to an upside-down conical region, which was 3.5 mm wide at the cortical surface and extended approximately 2 mm deep. Within this region (seen magnified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), there was widespread coagulative necrosis, parenchymal rarefaction, and perivascular microhemorrhage.

This emphasizes that electrolytic lesioning, not array insertion alone, leads to coagulative necrosis. This testing was performed across many regions of porcine cortex, demonstrating that the electrolytic lesioning technique functions in any area of cortex in which a multielectrode probe can be implanted.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>In vivo testing to further calibrate lesion parameters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) H&amp;E stained slice from an in vivo demonstration of the lesioning technique in pig cerebral cortex. 150 μA direct current passed through two adjacent electrodes (400 μm spacing) for 1 min resulted in a conical region of damaged parenchyma.

In order to characterize this relationship, we compared lesion volume estimates for a variety of direct current amplitudes and durations. We had slightly fewer data points for the in vivo lesions, due to difficulty in obtaining histology slices that captured the damage from the lesion within the slice. Lesion volumes were estimated from histology or photographs taken from our ex vivo and in vivo testing. Volumes were estimated using volume formulas for the approximate geometries observed visually in the histology. Most volumes were estimated assuming a conical lesion volume, chosen based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, though one in vivo volume was visually identified as spherical and estimated as such. We found that as both the amplitude and duration of direct current increase, the volume of the lesion also increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). For ex vivo lesions with a current amplitude of 180 μA, we found that volume was an exponential function of the duration of current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>5.4</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>7</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>5.6</mml:mn><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>,<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.413</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>).

However, after the power to the boost converter is removed, the current supplied by the circuit brieﬂy persists — likely due to residual energy present in the capacitors of the boost converter downstream of the switch. In the lesions for which this data was collected, the current persisted at the calibrated intensity for between 2.5 and 4 s.</p><p>Before performing a lesion, the amount of current to be output by was calibrated using a 50 kΩ resistor in place of the implanted microelectrode array and altering the resistance level of the external potentiometer. Even when calibrated to generate 150 μA, the actual current output when lesioning differed slightly (10–20 μA above or below the set value). In nine out of the fourteen lesions performed in two awake rhesus macaques (thirteen of which had this voltage data collected), the current value was higher than what was calibrated. We hypothesize that this is due to a parasitic parallel resistance to ground through the animal itself (see dashed box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To have created the 10–20 μA increase in current above the set value, this parasitic parallel resistance would have been between 1.2 MΩ and 0.6 MΩ, respectively, which is in the range of the expected resistance when the body is in dry contact with the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fish and Geddes, 2009</xref>). In the three lesions where the current value was 10–20 μA lower than what was calibrated, there may have been some parasitic capacitance present. As these parasitic resistances and capacitances arise only when the animal is part of the experimental setup, and they change across sessions, they cannot readily be calculated and accounted for a priori. These parasitics appear small enough not to significantly impact the desired lesion characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Recording quality</title><p>One advantage of microelectrode arrays is their ability to record from a stable population of cortical neurons over months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Vaidya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dickey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fraser and Schwartz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ganguly and Carmena, 2009</xref>).

A circle that captured half of the scatter points measures the spread, and changes in its radius were assumed to reﬂect changes in the recorded multi-unit activity. Typically, the difference in radius was nearly zero, reﬂecting similar proportions of activity from a similar composition of nearby neurons. Modest decreases and increases in radius were also frequently observed and the projected waveforms appeared similar. Two final categories were observed less commonly, in which the radius decreased or increased dramatically and the projected waveforms were substantially different.</p><p>Comparison days were grouped as pre-pre, pre-post, which included an acute period of up to 3 days following a lesion, and post-post, which compared post-lesion days 4 to 7 and was intended to reﬂect a late post period (not necessarily a complete recovery of brain and behavior).

This is largely due much larger variability in turnover and the fact that these lesions in Monkey H were performed before complete recovery was observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Use of electrolytic lesioning device with other multielectrode probes</title><p>In order to verify that this method for creating electrolytic lesions through a multielectrode probe works with different probe types, we performed tests using a Plexon U-Probe–a linear electrode with 24 contacts spaced 100 μm apart–in ex vivo rabbit cortex. Using our original electrolytic lesioning device and the U-Probe, we created five distinct lesions through contiguous contacts (100 μm apart) by applying differing current amplitudes (240 μA and 150 μA) for differing durations (30, 60, and 120 s). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, we show the location of the five lesions, as well as the current and voltage traces (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

To achieve this, a custom current source was built that would ensure stable current delivery throughout the lesion, for repeated lesions, as well as across different electrode types and animals. This degree of control represents a significant refinement of lesion studies in systems neuroscience research. This model was tested ex vivo with porcine and ovine brains and in vivo with porcine brains. Altering the amount and duration of the current changed the size of the lesion, as evidenced by the histology. Selection of two adjacent lesion electrodes allows for spatial localization under the 16 mm<sup>2</sup> array. Following these preliminary tests, one lesion was performed in a sedated rhesus macaque to verify the safety of the procedure, and fourteen lesions were performed between two awake rhesus macaques. Readouts from the lesioning device itself (both current and voltage) and electrophysiology from the microelectrode array verify that the device delivers the desired power and does not damage the array’s recording ability. We believe that this electrolytic lesioning technique will improve understanding of the motor system by coupling lesioning (an established termination technique) with the detailed spatiotemporal measurements of intracortical electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shenoy and Kao, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vaidya et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although it shares elements with other widely used techniques, performing electrolytic lesioning through a microelectrode array is not a common inactivation technique. For example, injecting current into the brain through microelectrodes is commonly done in intracortical microstimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Weiss et al., 2019</xref>). However, typical current values for microstimulation are around three times smaller than for lesioning, pulse durations are on the order of tens of microseconds, and the pulses are charged balanced so they by design do not lead to cell death or materially affect the electrodes. Similarly, passing current through microelectrodes to mark their location in cortex is a well-established method for tracking the location of electrodes at the end of an animal study. When histology is eventually performed, the lesion is used to find the anatomical location where electrophysiology was conducted, and it is compatible with single or multi-channel electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). However, the intent is different, as electrolytic lesions for marking are not generally used as an inactivation technique. Electrolytic lesioning for inactivation was historically done through a single barrel electrode as the anode and without any post-lesion electrophysiology recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wurtz and Goldberg, 1972</xref>). Therefore, the novel electrolytic lesioning method for inactivation presented here both is a refinement in precision and is unique in its compatibility with electrophysiology.</p><p>Electrolytic lesioning leads to cell death through heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nikfarjam et al., 2005</xref>), electroporation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batista Napotnik et al., 2021</xref>), and local changes in pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nikfarjam et al., 2005</xref>. Demonstration of actual neuronal loss in a primate injury model must work within the guidelines of ethical animal research. Therefore, we have triangulated evidence from three distinct sources that indicate the electrolytic lesioning device reliably delivered current that caused tissue damage and neuron death (termination): ex vivo and in vivo histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), lesion device readouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and relative changes in the turnover rate of recorded neurons in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>, case 1).</p><p>Temporary increases in the day-to-day turnover of recorded waveforms were observed after lesioning (i.e. decreases in the percent of matching neurons). In addition to increases in turnover characteristic of pre-lesion data, we further identified statistically new clusters of lesion evoked perturbations to low-dimensional projections of recorded neurons’ waveforms. On one hand, this is likely an underestimate, as significant neuronal loss is likely occurring just outside of the array electrodes’ recording volume and thus evading detection. However, there is also the potential to overestimate loss as well, given it is impossible to disambiguate between neurons that were silenced but surviving versus truly terminated. We note that these sources of error may be somewhat counterbalanced. The evidence provided here suggests a temporary increase in the recorded waveforms’ turnover after a lesion, which likely captures evoked neuron loss in addition to lesion-evoked changes in the proportions of activity recorded among neurons.</p><p>It is evident in our recordings that many of the array’s electrodes are recording smaller inseparable waveforms (hash) corresponding to many different neurons located between between 50 μm and 140 μm from the electrode tip before the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gerstein and Clark, 1964</xref>). Even if the closest, cleanly separable neurons were terminated by the lesion, the recorded signal would still be comprised of the remaining, surviving neurons in that vicinity. These neurons may also become more active after a lesion, resulting in similar estimated ﬁring rates. This was likely the case for the first lesion in Monkey U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, top) and lesion six (Monkey H; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> bottom), where the average waveforms on the two lesion electrodes themselves appear similar with only slight differences in amplitude.</p><p>While we have thoroughly tested this electrolytic lesioning device to ensure proper function, we emphasize that this is an initial design of the device and a preliminary examination of lesion parameters. We have only begun to explore the full potential for electrolytic lesioning through a microelectrode array, in both its technical implementation and its future use in systems neuroscience. This technique was tested across three species, before settling on a combination of current amplitude and duration that seemed reasonable for experiments in awake-behaving rhesus macaques. Thorough testing had to be balanced with care and respect for appropriate animal use in accordance with the 3 R’s of the guidelines of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">National Research Council, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">National Research Council, 2011</xref>. Future alterations could be made to the design of the lesioning device itself to optimize lesioning through this platform. For example, electronic control of current delivery for lesioning could be refined through the use of digital switching and a resistor shunt to handle any leakage current. Even with such automation, it would be prudent to maintain a physical switch to prevent extremely long periods of current delivery in the case of a malfunction. A circuit revision with these reﬁnements has been designed and validated, but it has not yet been tested in animals out of aforementioned respect for animal use.</p><p>Further exploration into the amplitude and duration parameters of the current used to lesion could lead to markedly different impact on brain tissue. Although these lesions were created with direct current, a variety of current patterns could be used to create a lesion. Catheter ablation of the heart used to be performed with direct current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Scheinman et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gallagher et al., 1982</xref>). Now, the standard of care is using a radiofrequency (350–500 kHz) alternating current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shivkumar, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Morady, 1999</xref>). Similarly, some have explored using radiofrequency (55 kHz) alternating current to create lesions to mark the location of acute electrophysiological recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brozoski et al., 2006</xref>). It is likely that alternating current or more complex current patterns would lead to different spatial distributions of electrolytic lesions. The PA97 op-amp used in this lesioning device has a slew rate of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mn>8</mml:mn><mml:mtext>V</mml:mtext><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mtext>s</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>, and can support AC frequencies in the tens to hundreds of kHz range for the lesioning voltages seen here. At the same time, alternating currents would likely introduce new reactive parasitics, potentially along the electrode wire bundle or at interconnects, and should be evaluated carefully.</p><p>Different selection of electrodes within the microelectrode array could also lead to different lesion characteristics. We chose to lesion with adjacent electrodes only, in order to create the most focused lesion. In theory, larger ablations are possible by supplying larger currents or performing a lesion over non-adjacent electrodes, which can span as much as 5.6 mm for electrodes on the opposite corners of the 4 mm x 4 mm Utah array.</p><p>Electrode shape could also be used to create different lesions. In deep brain stimulation treatment for Parkinson’s disease, new electrodes were designed to directionally focus the stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Steigerwald et al., 2019</xref>). Similar design could be used in creating intracortical electrodes optimized for both elctrophysiology and electrolytic lesioning. We demonstrated that our electrolytic lesioning technique works with a linear multicontact probe by testing with a U-Probe in ex vivo rabbit cortex. There are no particular limitations that would prevent our specific electrolytic lesioning technique and device from working with any passive multielectrode probe. The main requirements for use are that the probe has two electrodes that can directly (via whatever necessary adapters) connect to the lesioning device, such that arbitrary current can be passed into them as the anode and cathode. This would limit use of probes, like Neuropixels, where the on-chip acquisition and digitization circuitry generally precludes direct connection to electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>). The impedance of the multielectrode probe should not be an issue, due to the use of an op amp. We showed use with a Utah array (20–800 kΩ) and a U-Probe (1–1.5 MΩ). The specific op amp used here has a voltage range of ±450 V, which assuming a desired output of 150 μA of current would limit electrode impedance to 6 MΩ. Although a different op amp could easily be used to accommodate a higher electrode impedance, it is unlikely that this would be necessary, since most electrodes have impedances between 100 kΩ to 1 MΩ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Maynard et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Perhaps the most unique advantage of our technique in comparison with other existing inactivation methods lies in Design Consideration #1: stable electrophysiology pre- and post-inactivation (Appendix 1). While several methods exist that allow for localization and size control of the inactivation (Design Consideration #2) and cross compatibility across regions and species (Design Consideration #3), few have achieved compatibility with stable electrophysiology. For example, some studies record electrophysiology only after the creation of the lesion, preventing comparison with baseline neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Khanna et al., 2021</xref>). One recent study, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Khateeb et al., 2022</xref>), developed an inactivation method that is effectively combined with stable electrophysiology by creating photothrombotic lesions through a chronic cranial window integrated with an electrocorticography (ECoG) array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Khateeb et al., 2022</xref>), which may be appropriate for applications where local field potential (LFP) recording is sufficient. This approach has trade-offs with regards to the three design considerations presented in Appendix 1.</p><p>While Khateeb et al., present a toolbox with integrated, stable electrophysiology from an ECoG array pre- and post- inactivation (Design Consideration #1), it demonstrated recordings from an ECoG array with limited spatial resolution. While a higher density ECoG array that would provide higher spatial resolution could be used, increasing the density of opaque electrodes might occlude optical penetration and constrain photothrombotic lesions. Further, ECoG arrays are limited to recording LFP, not electrophysiology at single neuron resolution, potentially missing meaningful changes in the neuronal population activity after lesioning. Khateeb et al., demonstrated localization and control the size of inactivation (Design Consideration #2). In this manuscript, we have shown that the amount and duration of direct current are significant determinants of lesion size and shape, while with photothrombotic lesions, light intensity and aperture diameter are the signiﬁcantly relevant parameters. One potential advantage of photothrombotic approaches is the use of optical tools to monitor anatomical and physiological changes after lesioning through the cranial window, though the research utility of this monitoring remains to be demonstrated.</p><p>Although the method presented by Khateeb et al., shows some cross-compatibility (Design Consideration #3), it has greater limitations in comparison with the method presented here. For example, while Khateeb et al., notes that the approach could be adapted for use in smaller organisms, no modification is needed for use in other species with this work’s approach–so long as a multielectrode probe is implantable. In this manuscript we demonstrate electrolytic lesioning spanning two multielectrode probes across rabbits, pigs, sheep, and rhesus macaques, and our same device could be easily used with other smaller species, like rats, in which multielectrode probes have been successfully implanted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Black et al., 2018</xref>). Further, the approach in Khateeb et al., is limited to superficial brain structures, due to the need for optical accessibility. As noted, fiber optics could allow access to deeper structures, which would bring associated additional tissue damage, but deeper structure lesioning was not demonstrated. In contrast, the approach presented here can be used in any region of cortex in which a multielectrode probe can be implanted, which, depending on the probe used, does not limit it to surface structures. For example, we demonstrated use of our lesioning technique with a linear U-probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), which could be used to reach deeper layers of cortex or specific deep cortical structures. In both techniques, the location of the lesion is tied to the location of the electrophysiology (for Khateeb et al., wherever the cranial window and ECoG array are; for this technique, wherever the multielectrode probe has been implanted), which ensures that the electrophysiology will include recordings from the perilesional area. Neither work addresses the potential of their technique to induce chronic post-lesion behavioral effects, which is a key goal for future work.</p><p>The electrolytic lesioning method presented here enables small, permanent inactivation volumes while maintaining reliable neuroelectrophysiological recordings. Selection of the electrical current pattern, amplitude, and duration, as well as the specific lesion electrodes’ shape and location, offers many different combinations for complementary investigations into the causal role of cortical activity. Further, the same microelectrode array used to create the lesion and record electrophysiology can be used for intracortical microstimulation. This additional aspect of our platform will allow for testing of intracortical microstimulation as a possible treatment or therapy after neuronal loss.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrolytic lesioning device design</title><p>In order to control lesion size, a current source is required to stabilize the output, due to changes in local tissue resistivity and the design of intracortical electrodes. Single unit electrodes are generally coated with some type of dielectric material to maintain a low surface area of exposed metal, yielding a high impedance. This high impedance enables the detection of the weak currents (order tens of nA) associated with single neuron action potentials with voltages on the scale of tens to hundreds of microvolts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carter and Shieh, 2015</xref>). The shafts of the Utah electrode array are insulated with parylene-C (Blackrock Neurotech, Salt Lake City, UT). A small area at the tip of each electrode remains uncoated, through which the ionic current from nearby neurons can be measured. During electrolytic lesioning, applied voltages can be large enough to etch off the dielectric coating from the shaft of the two electrodes used to lesion. As this coating is etched, the impedance of those electrodes falls. Using a constant voltage source to lesion could deliver an inappropriately large amount of current into the brain once the dielectric coating was etched off and impedance reduced, resulting in uncontrolled tissue damage. A constant current source is robust to this changing impedance, maintaining the desired electrical current.</p><p>Single unit electrodes are commonly manufactured to have an impedance on the order of 100 kΩ to 1 MΩ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Maynard et al., 1997</xref>). In past electrolytic lesioning studies, the currents used to create lesions with corresponding behavioral deficits were on the order of 100 μA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Glees and Cole, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wurtz and Goldberg, 1972</xref>). Therefore, in order to supply this current in the face of the high impedance dielectric coating associated with single unit electrodes, high tens to low hundreds of volts are needed, depending on the lesioning parameters chosen. Even though commercial devices exist for electrolytic lesioning (e.g. Ugo Basile, Gemonio, IT), the power supplied may not be sufficient to recreate some current amplitudes used to lesion in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wurtz and Goldberg, 1972</xref>) and generally only support DC waveforms.</p><p>We designed and built a custom current source circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that supplies this voltage while maintaining precision in the delivered current (precision error not exceeding 10 μA).

Most of the dorsal surface of the skull was exposed along with some of the lateral margins to visualize the anatomy. A single, large craniectomy, exposing most of the superior surface of the dura, was made using a high speed bone drill (ANSPACH, DePuy Synthes, Raynham, MA).

Based on this, and a lack of physiological signs of pain from the anaesthetized pig studies, a lesion was performed on a sedated rhesus macaque who was subsequently euthanized due to unrelated health complications (Monkey F; 16-year-old adult, male rhesus macaque) in order to further verify safety before use in awake-behaving rhesus. This lesion was created by applying 150 μA of direct current to two adjacent electrodes in the microelectrode array for 45 s. Again, no physiological signs of stress or complications were observed, increasing confidence for lesions in awake animals. Subsequently, lesions were safely performed in two other rhesus (Monkeys H and U; 14 and 11 years-old, respectively, adult, male rhesus macaques) while awake and seated in a primate chair, without the animals exhibiting any behavioral signs of stress or pain. Across these two animals, fourteen lesions were performed using thirteen unique electrode pairs, demonstrating that the same microelectrode array can be used for several lesions and even the same electrode pair can be used as the anode and cathode for multiple lesions. In these lesions, 150 μA of direct current was applied to two adjacent electrodes in the microelectrode array for 30 or 45 s (30 s for Monkey U, 45 s for Monkey H), except in lesion H200120 where current was applied for 50 s. The Utah array chronically implanted in the monkey’s cortex is connected to the lesioning device via its CerePort (the same one used for recording the neuronal signals from the microelectrode array). The lesioning device is then turned on for a fixed duration, delivering the desired current. The animal is continuously monitored during the procedure for any signs of discomfort. After lesioning is complete and the recording cables are re-connected to the CerePort, the monkey is immediately ready to resume electrophysiological recordings and participate in a wide variety of head-ﬁxed or freely moving behavioral paradigms. Although lesioning itself is painless, the technique is intended to cause a temporary functional impairment.

Only one in vivo lesion, where 150 μA direct current was applied for 30 s, was calculated as a spherical volume (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>) as indicated by the visually identified damage in the histology slice. When we plotted just lesions created with a direct current amplitude of 180 μA, we fit the data with an exponential curve (curve_fit, SciPy optimize).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Neuronal recordings and processing</title><p>Neuronal data was collected at 30 kHz from primary motor cortex of Monkeys H and U using a Utah array (described above), captured using a Cerebus system (Blackrock Neurotech, Salt Lake City, UT), then high-pass filtered offline with a fourth order, zero-phase Butterworth filter using a 250 Hz cutoff frequency. Action potentials were identified by thresholding the ﬁltered membrane potential at −4× the root mean square voltage measured over the first minute of the recording session. Data snippets for comparing electrophysiology pre- and post-lesion were generated by taking the preceding 16 sampled data points (0.53ms), and proceeding 32 sampled points (1.07ms) around the peak depolarization identified after each threshold crossing. Waveforms whose peak-to-trough amplitude exceeded 300 μV are atypical of extracellular recordings from cortical neurons using Utah arrays and were excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chestek et al., 2011</xref>). Waveform width was calculated as the difference between the two prominent peaks in the temporal derivative of the extracellular potential. Unphysiological waveforms whose widths were longer than 1ms were also excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bean, 2007</xref>). The remaining identified action potential waveforms were then averaged for each electrode, and event rates were determined as the number of spikes on a given electrode divided by the duration of the recording session (excluding brief periods of inactivity before the start of the session).</p><p>As a putative indication of neuronal loss, neuron turnover was measured between daily recording sessions (each pair separated by at most three days, a time frame that minimizes natural turnover in recorded waveforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gallego et al., 2020</xref>). For a given electrode, 1000 identified action potential samples each 1.6ms, 48 points sampled at 30 kHz from the first day’s recording session were peak-aligned to create a 1000x48 matrix, where each row contains the 48 time points of a given waveform sampled at 30 kHz. Each of these points in time were considered as a sample feature and principal component analysis was performed. Next, the second day’s waveforms were projected onto the top two principal components of the first day (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The distance of each projected waveform from the origin was calculated for each day; a median radius value was computed and represented as a circle around the origin. Changes in the radius of these circles, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf32"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>, captures changes in the composition of multi-unit activity recorded at each electrode. By fitting Gaussian mixture models to the distributions of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf33"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>, we were able to find evidence of discrete clusters of radial changes. One and two standard deviations from the median cluster value were used to define five categories: matching waveforms, small increase, small decrease, large increase, and large decrease. A given electrode’s waveforms were said to match if <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> and was considered altered otherwise. Electrodes with matching waveforms are presented as a percentage of the array’s total 96 electrodes for a given pair of days (% match).</p><p>These pairwise comparisons were then split up into three groups: pre-lesion versus pre-lesion days (pre-pre), pre-lesion versus post-lesion days (pre-post), and post-lesion version post-lesion days (post-post). Although a set of eleven consecutive days was analyzed for each lesion (four pre- and seven post-), only recording session pairs that were separated by three-days or fewer were analyzed in order to minimize the potential confound of increased neuron turnover resulting from longer separation between sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gallego et al., 2020</xref>). Comparisons were then made between the pre-lesion period, an acute injury period (up to 3 days following a lesion), and a late injury period (days 4 to 7 following a lesion). The Median test was used to test the null hypothesis that lesioning had no effect on recorded turnover with 95% confidence interval, whose signiﬁcance threshold was Bonferroni corrected for the three statistical comparisons made between groups (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula>, significant if <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.017</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Ex vivo testing with a linear multielectrode probe</title><p>Testing of the ability to lesion through a different type of multielectrode probe (a linear multielectrode probe, rather than the microelectrode arrays used throughout the rest of the study) was done in an ex vivo rabbit brain. The un-fixed brain was from an animal that was euthanized earlier that day for unrelated research efforts. As this brain was from an unrelated research effort, we were not given the sex or age of the animal. The brain was kept moist with saline throughout the procedure. A U-Probe (Plexon, Dallas, TX), with 24 contacts, 100 μm spacing between them, and an impedance of 1–1.5 MΩ, was lowered one cm into cortex using a stereotaxic manipulator. Using a modified connector that attached to the female connector at the top of the probe, we connected our electrolytic lesioning device to two of the contacts on the probe, to act as the anode and cathode through which current was passed. The two contacts were contiguous (100 μm apart), and the lesions were created at depths approximately 400 μm below the surface of cortex. The location of the probe insertion was marked using ink injection, and is indicated in a sketch in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures and protocols were approved by the Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (#D16-00134).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Lesion parameters used for ex vivo testing.</title><p>Voltage was monitored with a voltmeter during lesioning, and notes were collected about the voltage.

This comparison would capture the acute effects of inactivation on both the neuronal activity and the animal’s behavior, as well as long term changes associated with behavioral recovery. As any physical disruption of the multielectrode probe would affect the stability of the recordings and negatively impact pre-post comparisons, it is essential to avoid physical disruption of the array from surgical procedures and minimize additional implanted devices or cannulae, which may act as routes for infection to enter the brain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-2"><title>Ability to localize and control the size of the inactivation</title><p>Prior studies suggest that after inactivating neuronal activity in a region, compensatory neuronal changes will happen in the area closely surrounding that region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gould et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nudo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Nudo and Friel, 1999</xref>). In order to ensure that the multielectrode probe is recording from this peri-inactivation area, the location of the inactivation (both point of origin and extent) must be precisely controlled. The multielectrode probe should be close enough to the inactivation to record from the peri-inactivation area, but the inactivation area should not be so large or so close to the multielectrode probe that it completely encompasses the array’s recording area. If the multielectrode probe only records from the inactivated area (and therefore inactivated neurons), the recordings will only verify that the inactivation method worked and will not enable further scientific questions.</p><p>While some methods do allow for inactivation at a certain point in space, the effects can spread quite far or uncontrollably from that point due to various biological mechanisms. These mechanisms can include pharmacological diffusion and continued neuronal death after ischemic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jarrard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kubota, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schieber and Poliakov, 1998</xref>). This spread would not allow control over how much of the recording area of the multielectrode probe was in the peri-inactivation region or the inactivation region itself. Therefore, both precision in localizing the inactivation and control over its spread are required.</p><p>Finally, an inactivation technique should enable studying both the effects of inactivation on neuronal activity and how neuronal activity changes when behavior recovers following inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Slonina et al., 2022</xref>). This requires the inactivation to be small enough for the animal to recover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Glees and Cole, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nudo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wurtz and Goldberg, 1972</xref>). Inactivating a small region may enable investigation about the causal role of the inactivated neurons while avoiding confounding effects across multiple, broad systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-3"><title>Cross-compatibility</title><p>Ideally, a technique that combines electrophysiology with inactivation could be used in any area of cortex, with any multielectrode probe, and in several species in order to enable causal investigation in a large variety of contexts. Flexibility over the cortical area studied and the multielectrode probes used will enable easy adoption into existing neuroelectrophysiology recording setups across many neuroscience contexts. Compatibility with a variety of animal models will further increase the technique’s utility. Electrophysiology studies and animal models of brain disease have spanned many species, from rodents to large animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Finnie and Blumbergs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Le et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lind et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nudo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rousche and Normann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rousche and Normann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kleinschnitz et al., 2015</xref>). While each species offers its own experimental beneﬁts and limitations, the majority of tools and techniques in this space have been developed for rodents. Rather than being limited to rodents, an inactivation technique would ideally also be compatible with large animals such as rhesus macaques, due to their dexterity, ability to perform complex movements, and extensive history in electrophysiology studies of motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Higo, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Manipulations are temporary inactivations of neuronal activity, while terminations are permanent inactivations. There are several existing methods for achieving a manipulation or a termination. Although each existing method has its own strengths, none is able to meet all three of the previously mentioned design considerations of: stable electrophysiology pre- and post-inactivation, ability to localize and control the size of the inactivation, and cross-species and large-animal compatibility.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Existing Manipulation Methods</title><p>Existing temporary inactivation methods include intracortical microstimulation, optogenetics, pharmacology, transcranial stimulation, cooling loops, and chemogenetics.</p><p>Intracortical microstimulation, where small pulses of current are applied to cortex, can be used to temporarily disrupt neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Churchland and Shenoy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mazurek and Schieber, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vyas et al., 2020</xref>). It can be performed using the same neuroelectrophysiology electrodes being used to record, requiring no additional surgical access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Weiss et al., 2019</xref>). However, it can be challenging to sustain a behavioral effect with continuous microstimulation.</p><p>Optogenetic silencing can inactivate an area either by using an inhibitory step-function opsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berndt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kim et al., 2017</xref>) or by activating a local inhibitory circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Vogt, 2020</xref>). Long-term local silencing of a region of cortex could be achieved with continued illumination by a fiber or a chronically implanted array of light-emitting diodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rajalingham et al., 2021</xref>). However, other challenges exist with using optogenetics as an inactivation method in nonhuman primates, including difficulty reliably affecting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afraz, 2023</xref>). While several constructs for rhesus macaques have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Galvan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tremblay et al., 2020</xref>), reports of successfully inducing behavioral effects have a small effect size and are less numerous than might be expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afraz, 2023</xref>), and several null results have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Diester et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Galvan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">O’Shea et al., 2022</xref>). Other remaining challenges include the need to develop a head-mounted, battery powered light delivery system for multi-day delivery of light and difficulty integrating illumination with simultaneous chronic neuroelectrophysiology.</p><p>Pharmacological agents like muscimol and lidocaine can also be used for transient inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clarke and Maler, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kubota, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schieber and Poliakov, 1998</xref>). A pathway is required to deliver the agent to the appropriate area of cortex. If this pathway is chronically implanted (e.g., a cannula), then it can be placed somewhat precisely near the multielectrode probe, but it would act as a potential route for a local infection, which may cause swelling of the tissue and lead to partial displacement of the array or other medical complications. An alternative is to inject the agent though a burr hole created only when lesioning is desired, though it may be difficult to localize the placement of the burr hole within the immediate area of the multielectrode probe. Controlling spread of pharmacological agents is also difficult, especially for drugs with low molecular weight. The effects of pharmacological agents will ﬂuctuate over space and time as they diffuse through the tissue and begin to be cleared or metabolized.</p><p>Non-invasive methods like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS), and transcranial focal ultrasound lead to very temporary inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Klomjai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Woods et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to the short timescale of these inactivations, their effects are dispersed as the signal must travel through the skull. These methods provide neither the spatial resolution nor the temporal duration needed for probing local neuronal circuitry.</p><p>Cooling loops are implanted devices that effectively silence nearby cells by affecting action potential generation, axon conduction velocity, and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lomber and Payne, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lomber et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Long and Fee, 2008</xref>). These devices would be implanted at the same time as the multielectrode probe, and they would not require surgical access to use. However, cooling cannot easily be maintained across days while the animal is in its home environment. In addition to damaging valuable nearby tissue during the implant surgery and introducing another foreign body, cooling inactivates on the scale of millimeters, limiting the ability to titrate the size of the inactivation any smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coomber et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A region of cortex can also be temporarily inactivated with chemogenetic silencing, using chemically activated proteins to inhibit neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sternson and Roth, 2014</xref>). The chemical is injected intravenously, so the process would not disrupt the placement of the multielectrode probe. As with optogenetic silencing, chemogenetics would require the development of rhesus compatible constructs. Additionally, chronic inactivation over days may be logistically challenging, as the half life of clozapine N-oxide (CNO, a ligand used to activate DREADD receptors) is on the order of hours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Existing Termination Methods</title><p>Existing termination methods include physical damage, endovascular occlusion, Rose Bengal mediated photothrombosis, and chemical lesioning.</p><p>There are several well established techniques for mechanically damaging a small area of cortex to create a lesion, including blade lesioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Horsley and Schafer, 1888</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sherrington, 1893</xref>), vacuum aspiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Darling et al., 2016</xref>), vascular cauterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nudo et al., 2003</xref>), and vascular ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rumajogee et al., 2016</xref>). All of these techniques require surgical access to cortex, which would likely disrupt an existing implanted microelectode array. Additionally, the sedation necessary for the surgery would prevent behavioral testing on the day of the lesion, precluding measurements of acute inactivation. Further, these techniques often create large lesions, and do not offer sub-millimeter precision.</p><p>Endovascular techniques are commonly used as models of stroke. For example, endovascular physical occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) of one hemisphere is a common rodent model of stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kleinschnitz et al., 2015</xref>), but it is challenging to precisely control the extent of cortical damage. MCA occlusion could cause indiscriminate injury to a large region of cortex, due to continued, widespread neuronal death after the occlusion. It could potentially damage the area in which the multielectrode probe is implanted, preventing meaningful recordings. As one descends into smaller branches of the MCA, survivability, localization, and reproducibility of ischemic results improve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clark et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kuraoka et al., 2009</xref>), but it is technically challenging to be precise with the occlusion without coming close to the implanted array, again risking disrupting the implantation site.</p><p>Another endovascular technique is photothrombosis, which does not require an additional surgery to implement, limiting disruption of the multielectrode probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gulati et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Khateeb et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Khateeb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ramanathan et al., 2018</xref>). This approach uses rose bengal, a photosenstive dye, injected intravenously into the circulatory system. When 561nm green light is shined over a blood vessel, the dye undergoes a local conformational change and generates singlet oxygen, damaging arterial endothelial cells and initiating the clotting cascade–resulting in damage resembling an ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carmichael, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Watson et al., 1985</xref>). This approach can be used to deliver a well-localized lesional boundary. In rodents, this can be done entirely non-invasively because green light penetrates through the thin layer of skull. In larger animals, a method of light delivery is needed. If an optical fiber is chronically implanted at the time of electrode array insertion, light can be delivered without surgery and lesions can be made without disrupting the array, but this chronically implanted fiber may act as a route for infection. Alternatively, the fiber could be placed though a burr hole made at the time of the lesion, but this may compromise localization accuracy like other burr-hole techniques. Another light delivery method for photothrombosis, compatible with use in large animals, is through a cranial window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Khateeb et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Khateeb et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Chemical lesioning is done by injecting a damaging chemical into the cortical region. These chemicals can be excitotoxic pharmacologic agents like ibotenic acid that selectively and directly damage neuronal cell bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Murata et al., 2008</xref>, or they can be vasoconstrictors like endothelin-1 that create anoxic cortical injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dai et al., 2017</xref>). These chemicals have the same potential drawbacks of other injection-based methods: either a permanent pathway is added to allow precise injection in the area of the multielectrode probe, creating a route for infection, or injection is done through a burr hole, making it difficult to localize to the region of the array and disrupting experimental continuity. It is also difficult to control the spread of the chemicals, preventing precision in lesion extent.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84385.3.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>eLife assessment</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Behrens</surname><given-names>Timothy E</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Oxford</institution><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="evidence-strength"><kwd>Solid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="claim-importance"><kwd>Valuable</kwd></kwd-group></front-stub><body><p>This paper reports a <bold>valuable</bold> new method for creating localized damage to candidate brain regions for functional and behavioral studies.

This type of lesioning technique has the benefit of high spatial precision and low surgical complexity while allowing simultaneous electrophysiology recording before, during, and after the lesion induction. The authors have validated this lesioning method with a Utah array, both ex vivo and in vivo using pig models and awake-behaving rhesus macaques. Given its precision in controlling the lesion size, location, and compatibility with multiple animal models and cortical areas, the authors believe this method can be used to study cortical circuits in the presence of targeted neuronal inactivation or injury and to establish causal relationships before behavior and cortical activity.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- Overall the techniques, parameters, and data analysis methods are better described in the revised version.</p><p>- The authors added the section &quot;Relationship Between Applied Current and Lesion Volume&quot; as well as Figure 4 and 5 to address our comments regarding parameter testing. Multiple combinations of current amplitude and duration were tested and the induced lesion volumes were estimated, providing a better picture of why certain parameters were chosen for in vivo studies.</p><p>- The authors added Figure 7 which addressed our comment &quot;more evidence is needed to suggest robust neuronal inactivation or termination in rhesus macaques after electrolytic lesioning.&quot; They went into more details to explain the observed changes in pairwise comparisons of spike waveforms (difference in projected radii). Particularly in Fig 7C, they identified a new cluster from the pre-post lesioning group, which effectively represented neuronal loss from the</p><p>recorded population.</p><p>- The authors discussed their method in the context of other literature and stating its strength and limitation.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>-The lack of histology limits the validation of lesion induction, ideally cell loss and neuronal loss in vivo needs to be quantified. In addition based on the lack of access to histology, it is not clear how the lesion volumes are calculated which also impacts the scientific rigor of the work. The authors mention that layers 2/3 and maybe 4 have been impacted. The lack of information on the extent of the lesion severely limits the use of their technique for neuroscience experiments.</p><p>-The lack of histology in combination with behavioral measures still limits the impact of the paper in the context of NHP research.</p><p>- Figure 5 involves fitting an exponential model to the generated lesion volume given the applied current amplitude and duration. However, the data from ex vivo sheep and pig cortex with the same current amplitude &amp; three durations showed very large variability in lesion volume at Time = 2min (larger than the difference from 2 to ~2.2min). Very limited data points exist for the other two parameter combinations. These may suggest that the exponential fit is not the best model in this scenario.</p><p>- Regarding the comment on neuronal inactivation, the authors still did not show any evidence of single unit activity loss or changes in local field potential/multi-unit activity from the region being lesioned.</p><p>- Regarding this comment &quot;The lesioning procedure was performed in Monkey F while sedated, but no data was presented for Monkey F in terms of lesioning parameters, lesion size, recorded electrophysiology, histological, or behavioral outcomes. It is also unclear if Monkey F was in a terminal study&quot; the authors explained that &quot;a lesion was performed on a sedated rhesus macaque (monkey F) who was subsequently euthanized due to unrelated health complications, in order to further verify safety before use in awake-behaving rhesus&quot; but still no histology data is shown regarding monkey F to demonstrate this verification. Given that NHPs are highly valuable resources, it's important to make use of all collected data and to show that the induced lesion is comparable to those in the pig cortex.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84385.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bray</surname><given-names>Iliana E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><collab>Brain Interfacing Laboratory</collab><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>Stephen E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Casey</surname><given-names>Kerriann M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nuyujukian</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p><p>We thank the reviewers and editor for their careful review of our work.

There are no particular limitations that would prevent our specific electrolytic lesioning technique and device from working with any passive multielectrode probe. The main requirements for use are that the probe has two electrodes that can directly (via whatever necessary adapters) connect to the lesioning device, such that arbitrary current can be passed into them as the anode and cathode. This would limit use of probes, like Neuropixels, where the on-chip acquisition and digitization circuitry generally precludes direct connection to electrodes [1], [2]. The impedance of the multielectrode probe should not be an issue, due to the use of an op amp. We showed use with a Utah array (20-800 kΩ) and a U-Probe (1-1.5 MΩ). The specific op amp used here has a voltage range of <italic>±</italic> 450 V, which assuming a desired output of 150 µA of current would limit electrode impedance to 6 MΩ. Though a different op amp could easily be used to accommodate a higher electrode impedance, it is unlikely that this would be necessary, since most electrodes have impedances between 100 kΩ to 1 MΩ [3].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Public Weaknesses):</bold></p><p>In many of the figures, it is not clear what is shown and the analysis techniques are not well described.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this feedback.

You are right that the lesioning location is limited to the multielectrode array’s implantation site, while other methods in Appendix 2 do not require prox- imity of the lesion location and the electrophysiology recording site. However, we believe that the closeness of the lesioning location to the microelectrode array is a strength - guaranteeing record- ings from the perilesional area - even with the small negative of reduced flexibility. Multielectrode arrays can be implanted in many areas of cortex. If one wanted to study distal effects of a lesion, additional electrophysiology probes could be implanted to record from those areas. We have noted this on Page 3, Line 117.</p><p>“While the link between the lesion location and the multielectrode location technically con- strains the lesion to an area of cortex in which a multielectrode array could be implanted, we see the connection as a positive, because it ensures recording some neuroelectrophysiology from the perilesional area in which recovery is hypothesized to occur (see Appendix 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the extent of the damage created through the Utah array will vary based on anatomical structures, it is unclear what is the range of lesion volumes that can be created with this method, given a parameter set. It was also mentioned that they performed a non-exhaustive parameter search for the applied current amplitude and duration (Table S1/S2) to generate the most suitable lesion size but did not present the resulting lesion sizes from these parameter sets listed. Moreover, there’s a lack of histological data suggesting that the lesion size is precise and repeatable given the same current duration/amplitude, at the same location.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful feedback.

We have added a section, also responding to their later request for us to compare our work to Khateeb et al. 2022, by adding a section to the Discussion on Page 16, Line 434.</p><p>“Perhaps the most unique advantage of our technique in comparison with other existing inactivation methods lies in Design Consideration #1: stable electrophysiology pre- and post-inactivation (Appendix 1). While several methods exist that allow for localization and size control of the inactivation (Design Consideration #2) and cross compatibility across regions and species (Design Consideration #3), few have achieved compatibility with stable electrophysiology. For example, some studies record electrophysiology only after the creation of the lesion, preventing comparison with baseline neuronal activity [4]. One recent study, Khateeb, et al., 2022, developed an inactivation method that is effectively combined with stable electrophysiology by creating photothrombotic lesions through a chronic cranial window integrated with an electrocorticography (ECoG) array [5], which may be appropriate for applications where local field potential (LFP) recording is sufficient. This approach has trade-offs with regards to the three design considerations presented in Appendix 1.</p><p>While Khateeb, et al., present a toolbox with integrated, stable electrophysiology from an ECoG array pre- and post- inactivation (Design Consideration #1), it demonstrated recordings from an ECoG array with limited spatial resolution. While a higher density ECoG array that would provide higher spatial resolution could be used, increasing the density of opaque electrodes might occlude optical penetration and constrain photothrombotic lesions. Further, ECoG arrays are limited to recording LFP, not electrophysiology at single neuron resolution, potentially missing meaningful changes in the neuronal population activity after lesioning. Khateeb, et al., demonstrated localization and control the size of inactivation (Design Consideration #2). In this manuscript, we have shown that the amount and duration of direct current are significant determinants of lesion size and shape, while with photothrombotic lesions, light intensity and aperture diameter are the significantly relevant parameters. One potential advantage of photothrombotic approaches is the use of optical tools to monitor anatomical and physiological changes after lesioning through the cranial window, though the research utility of this monitoring remains to be demonstrated.</p><p>Although the method presented by Khateeb, et al., shows some cross-compatibility (Design Consideration #3), it has greater limitations in comparison with the method presented here. For example, while Khateeb, et al., notes that the approach could be adapted for use in smaller organisms, no modification is needed for use in other species with this work’s approach–so long as a multielectrode probe is implantable. In this manuscript we demon- strate electrolytic lesioning spanning two multielectrode probes across rabbits, pigs, sheep, and rhesus macaques, and our same device could be easily used with other smaller species, like rats, in which multielectrode probes have been successfully implanted [6]. Further, the approach in Khateeb, et al., is limited to superficial brain structures, due to the need for opti- cal accessibility. As noted, fiber optics could allow access to deeper structures, which would bring associated additional tissue damage, but deeper structure lesioning was not demon- strated. In contrast, the approach presented here can be used in any region of cortex in which a multielectrode probe can be implanted, which, depending on the probe used, does not limit it to surface structures. For example, we demonstrated use of our lesioning tech- nique with a linear U-probe (Fig. 8), which could be used to reach deeper layers of cortex or specific deep cortical structures. In both techniques, the location of the lesion is tied to the location of the electrophysiology (for Khateeb et al., wherever the cra- nial window and ECoG array are; for this technique, wherever the multielectrode probe has been implanted), which ensures that the electrophysiology will include recordings from the perilesional area. Neither work addresses the potential of their technique to induce chronic post-lesion behavioral effects, which is a key goal for future work.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a lack of quantitative histological analysis of the change in neuronal morphology and loss.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s desire for a quantitative histological analysis, however this falls out- side of the scope of this manuscript. We are not attempting to make strong claims about the number of neurons lost through lesioning or thoroughly characterize morphological changes in the neurons. The histology is intended to show that lesioning did lead to a loss of neurons, but the precise num- ber of neurons lost is neither in scope nor is likely to be highly conserved across lesions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a lack of histology data across animals and on the reliability of their lesioning techniques across animals and experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point.

However, the goal here was dramatically different: we sought to calibrate a novel lesion device, ensure it’s safe use in large mammals (specifically, non-human primates) and pro- vide estimates of the lesion size to compare with the literature. The extent of histology that could be performed and the tools available to us prevent such an in depth analysis. We can say based on shank length of the Utah arrays used and known anatomy that we have affected layer 2/3 and maybe a bit of layer 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Figure 5b. It would be helpful if the author could plot the delta match separately for the lesion elec- trodes, near neighbor electrodes, and far neighbors. This would help understand the lesion effect, specifically whether the effect is selective (e.g., more potent for the lesion and adjacent electrodes.)</p></disp-quote><p>The fact that neuron loss is not particularly selective can already be seen in the spike waveform plots, arranged spatially on the array. Plenty of clear change is observed far from the lesion elec- trodes (marked with black dots) as well as nearby. We have made mention of this localized non- specificity in the main text and have ensured to remphasize in the figure legened. While a nice suggestion, we currently don’t feel this result rises to the level of a figure given it is not highly specific spatially.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Overall the quality of the paper, the figures and the analysis used could be significantly improved. There is a lack of scientific rigor in the presentation of figures and analysis techniques. It is not clear what the authors are trying to communicate through the figures and their choice of figures to show is confusing (see below).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their pointed critiques and believe we have addressed their concerns with many changes to the text, a revamped waveforms analysis, and both the expansion and addition of results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The neurophysiology data shown doesn’t suggest neuronal loss, it only shows change which needs strong control data to show it is due to a lesion.</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed below, we have presented a revised analysis that provides this control. While the reviewer is right to point out we can distinguish actual neuron loss from neuron silencing, we be- lieve the new analysis rigorously indicates new rates of sample turnover beyond those expected from healthy state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The histology figure should be replaced with a high-quality representation without folds.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s suggestion. While ideally we would have many histology slices from each lesion, due to cost, we were only able to collect one histology slice per lesion. The folds were introduced by the company that performed the H&amp;E staining, and we unfortunately cannot remove the folds. Therefore, despite the folds, this is the best and only image from this lesion. We hope that the markings on the figure and the comment in the caption is sufficient to explain to readers that the folds are not a result of the lesion but instead a result of the histology process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest that this lesioning method will be compatible with any available multielec- trode probe theoretically. Since all testing was done with a Utah array, it will be helpful to add an explanation about potential constraints that will make a given array compatible with this method.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. As stated above, we have both added a demonstration of use in a different multielectrode probe type (with a U-probe) in Fig. 8, and we have added a discussion about which types of multielectrode probes would be suitable on Page 15, Line 420.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should cite and discuss previous studies using electrolytic lesioning in awake-behaving animals to study the causal connection between the brain and behavior. (One example study: Morissette MC, Boye SM. Electrolytic lesions of the habenula attenuate brain stimulation reward. Behavioural brain research. 2008 Feb 11;187(1):17-26.)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have added a mention of existing electrolytic le- sioning studies on Page 2, Line 88.</p><p>“Prior termination studies mostly measure behavioral output, with no simultaneous measures of neuronal activity during the behavior, impairing their ability to provide insight into the causal connection between the brain and behavior [7]–[11], or with no baseline (i.e., pre- lesion) measures of neuronal activity [4].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should compare their technique with other recent lesioning studies in primates (e.g. Khateeb et al, 2022)</p></disp-quote><p>We again thank the reviewer for this point. Specifically not mentioning Khateeb et al. 2022 was a submission error on our part; we cited the paper in Appendix 2 in the version uploaded to the eLife submission portal, but we had uploaded the version prior to citing it to bioRxiv. We have combined addressing this with addressing a previous comment, as mentioned above, with a section in the Discussion on Page 16, Line 434.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Appendix 2, the authors suggest that a major limitation of optogenetics and chemogenetic in- activation methods is the lack of rhesus-compatible constructs. However, several viral constructs have successful implementation in rhesus monkeys so far (e.g. Galvan A, Stauffer WR, Acker L, El-Shamayleh Y, Inoue KI, Ohayon S, Schmid MC. Nonhuman primate optogenetics: recent advances and future directions. Journal of Neuroscience. 2017 Nov 8;37(45):10894-903; Tremblay et al, Neuron 2020)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing us to these papers. We have added a more thorough description of what we meant by lack of rhesus-compatible constructs in that Appendix.</p><p>“However, other challenges exist with using optogenetics as an inactivation method in nonhu- man primates, including difficulty reliably affecting behavior [12]. While several constructs for rhesus macaques have been developed [13], [14], reports of successfully inducing be- havioral effects have a small effect size and are less numerous than might be expected [12], and several null results have been published [15]–[17]. Other remaining challenges include the need to develop a head-mounted, battery powered light delivery system for multi-day delivery of light and difficulty integrating illumination with simultaneous chronic neuro- electrophysiology.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 5b, only pairwise comparison results from monkey U (L11-14) are shown. It is unclear why such results from monkey H were shown in Figure 5a but not in 5b.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this unconventional one monkey result. As described in the original submission, we previously omitted Monkey H from the analysis in Figure 5b (now Figure 7) since some of the lesions were closely spaced together, preventing well defined pre- and post- lesion rates of turnover. Never-the-less we have included Monkey H in all the revised analysis and believe even the less cleanly separated data shows useful indications of neuron loss or silencing evoked by the lesion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Behavioral data (during a motor task) from the awake behaving monkeys (U and H) would greatly strengthen the claim that this lesioning method is capable of creating a behavioral effect and can be adopted to study the relationship between neural function and behavior outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>While we are grateful for the reviewer’s interest in the application of our lesioning technique to studies involving behavior, a behavioral analysis of the effects of our electrolytic lesions falls be- yond the scope of this Tools and Resources manuscript. We would also like to point out that we do not claim that we have achieved a behavioral deficit in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 would benefit from an illustration of the Utah array placement and the location of the sites used for lesioning. The authors can either overlay the illustrations on the current ex-vivo and histology images or create a separate schematic to demonstrate that for the readers. Also, Figure 2B needs to be replaced with one without the folds to avoid confusion for the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Figure 2 - figure supplement 1, which shows both the location within the Utah array of the two electrodes used to create the lesions as well as the relative size of the surface area of the lesion and the array. Unfortunately, as the lesion was created under the array, the exact location of the array relative to the lesion is unknown.</p><p>As mentioned above, Figure 2B is the only histological image from that lesion. We hope that the markings in the image as well as the caption sufficiently explain that the folds are unrelated to the lesion itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3, the conical region is not well delineated. Data across animals and lesion volume with respect to different parameters should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a supplemental figure, Figure 3 - figure supplement 1, where we have used a dashed white line to clearly indicate the area of damaged parenchyma, in case it was not clear in Figure 3a. We have also added volume estimates from lesions across animals and different param- eters. The ex vivo estimates are shown in Figure 4 and the in vivo estimates are shown in Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: it is not clear what is being communicated, and where the voltage traces are from.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noting this confusion. We have added some lines in the text to explain what the voltage traces show, both in the caption to Fig. 6 and in the text on Page 7, Line 238.</p><p>“Traces only capture the values while the lesioning device was turned on (45 seconds for most lesions and 50 seconds for lesion H200120). (A) Voltage traces. Discontinuity at the beginning of the traces indicates transient voltages that were too rapid to be captured by the voltmeter, lasting between 0.13 and 0.33 s. The fluctuating voltages, especially the rapid in- crease in voltage at the beginning of lesioning, emphasize the importance of using a current source to deliver consistent amounts of current into the brain.”</p><p>“The voltage across the microelectrode array fluctuated much more than the current did, em- phasizing that we made the correct choice in using a current source to ensure delivery of consistent amounts of current into the brain (Fig. 6).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: why did the authors choose to use matching units as a measure of the lesion? It is surprising that there are still units on the location that the authors claim to be a lesion. To clarify that it would be helpful to show the location of the lesion in Figure 4a. Also, what can we conclude about the lesion induction when we see units on the lesion electrode? The change in unit match shows that there is a change in the network (although the authors need to show control for that so we know those changes don’t happen due to natural dynamics). It is not clear what is the time duration for pre-pre and post-post (i.e. minutes, seconds, hours). Do these comparisons come from the same time frame or are they coming from two fragments of time for both pre and post- conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>Aside from post-mortem histology and tissue assays, there is no good way to confirm neuron loss with chronically implanted electrode arrays in nonhuman primates. Waveforms were chosen as they are the one readily isolated physical measure of the system we are injuring. Although functional measures of activity could indicate neuron loss (topic of following papers), there are many conceivable changes in firing rate patterns that could manifest spuriously as loss, making the estimation of loss even more ambiguous and challenging this way.</p><p>We believe the new Figure 7 will make the procedure much more clear, while also providing the control requested by the reviewer, illustrating that new statistical categories of altered waveforms emerge during a lesion, beyond those associated with typical changes in waveform composition within multi-unit recordings seen during recording sample turnover fom healthy animals. We further note that by confining this analysis to four day spans at most, we have limited the impact of daily sample turnover described in the literature (Gallego, 2020).</p><p>The time duration for pre-session versus pre-session (pre-post and post-post), is some multiple of the approximate 24 hours between each daily recording session. Therefore, since restricting our- selves to four days separation, between 24 and 96 hours. Spikes are sampled from successful trial periods (so on the order of seconds, compiled into minutes across the whole recording session). Although already described in the main text, these points have been reemphasized in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>CNO (line 931) needs to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. We have defined CNO and its relevance in Appendix 2.</p><p>“Additionally, chronic inactivation over days may be logistically challenging, as the half life of clozapine N-oxide (CNO, a ligand used to activate DREADD receptors) is on the order of hours.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
