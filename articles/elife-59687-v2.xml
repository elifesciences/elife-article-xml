Despite the diverse pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, increasing evidence suggests that a disrupted ER–mitochondria connection is a common underlying feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Area-Gomez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernard-Marissal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Calì et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hedskog et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, many of the cellular processes associated with neurodegeneration such as mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial fragmentation, disrupted autophagy, and oxidative stress are regulated by the ER–mitochondria axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Csordás et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rowland and Voeltz, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Precise regulation of mitochondrial calcium levels is essential for mitochondrial metabolism and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cárdenas et al., 2010</xref>). The association of mitochondria with ER facilitates efficient uptake of calcium by the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krols et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rizzuto et al., 1998</xref>). Calcium released from the ER forms highly concentrated calcium microdomains that are necessary to override the low affinity of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), the primary mitochondrial calcium uptake channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rizzuto et al., 2012</xref>). However, overly close inter-organelle distances or excessive ER–mitochondria contact points can result in increased calcium transfer, which in turn can overstimulate mitochondrial bioenergetics leading to the production of pathological levels of the energy byproduct, reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accumulation of ROS can then lead to oxidative stress, fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam-Vizi and Starkov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brookes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deniaud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Esterberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Iqbal and Hood, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ježek et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, tight regulation of the distance and frequency of contacts between the ER and mitochondria is critical for proper mitochondrial calcium load. Previous studies investigating regulation of ER–mitochondria associations have focused on identifying proteins involved in tethering the ER to the mitochondria. However, the upstream molecular pathways that act to prevent excessive and pathologically tight ER–mitochondria associations, and the mechanisms by which these molecular pathways are regulated remain unknown.</p><p>To investigate these mechanisms, we are using zebrafish lateral line hair cells, which share molecular, functional, and morphological similarities with mammalian inner ear hair cells. Hair cells of the inner ear and lateral line system are specialized sensory neurons that transduce acoustic information and relay it to the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McPherson, 2018</xref>). Sensory hair cells are an excellent model to investigate mechanisms regulating ER–mitochondria associations. Their high metabolic requirements make them particularly vulnerable to disruptions in mitochondrial calcium load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 2017</xref>). Indeed, excess mobilization of calcium from the ER to the mitochondria was recently shown to underlie aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death in the zebrafish lateral line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Esterberg et al., 2014</xref>). These findings highlight the importance of the ER–mitochondria connection in regulating hair cell survival. Given that hair cell death causes hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eggermont, 2017</xref>), identifying molecular factors that regulate the ER–mitochondria connection may provide insight into potential therapeutic targets to combat ototoxin-induced hearing loss.</p><p>We showed previously that pregnancy-associated plasma protein-aa (Pappaa) regulates mitochondrial function in zebrafish lateral line hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>). Pappaa is a locally secreted metalloprotease that regulates Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. IGF1 is sequestered extracellularly by IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) that prevent it from binding to its receptor. Pappaa cleaves inhibitory IGFBs, thereby stimulating local IGF1 availability and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hwa et al., 1999</xref>). We found that loss of Pappaa, and the consequential reduction in IGF1 signaling, resulted in mitochondrial calcium overload, ROS buildup, and increased susceptibility to ROS-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, other studies have shown that declining IGF1 levels correlate with conditions such as aging, neurodegenerative disorders, and obesity, in which the ER–mitochondria connection is known to be altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arruda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hedskog et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu and Zhu, 2017</xref>). However, a causative link between IGF1 signaling and ER–mitochondria associations has not been shown.</p><p>In this study, we reveal that Pappaa, an extracellular regulator of IGF1 signaling, is critical for regulation of the ER–mitochondria connection. We use electron microscopy (EM) to show that ER–mitochondria associations are closer and greater in number in <italic>pappaa</italic> mutant hair cells. Hair cells in <italic>pappaa</italic> mutants are more sensitive to pharmacological induction of ER-mediated calcium release and show changes in mitochondrial morphology and stunted autophagic response. Loss of Pappaa also results in ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response. Together, our results suggest that Pappaa exerts its effect on hair cell survival by serving as a key regulator of the ER–mitochondria axis. Given the widespread roles for IGF1 receptors and the suppressive effects of IGFBPs, exogenous IGF1 treatment may not be an effective therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases. A factor such as Pappaa that can locally activate IGF1 signaling may provide a more promising therapeutic target to prevent hearing loss.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pappaa influences ER–mitochondria associations</title><p>Zebrafish lateral line hair cells lie on the surface of the skin and are arranged into structures called neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Each neuromast consists of a cluster of hair cells surrounded by the glia-like support cells. Our previous work showed that hair cells in <italic>pappaa</italic> mutants (hereafter referred to as <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic>) are more susceptible to ROS-induced death and their mitochondria have increased calcium load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> mitochondria may have an increased frequency of ER-mitochondria associations. To test this, we used EM to visualize ER-mitochondria associations. We collected 80 nm thick sections along the apical-basal axis of anterior lateral line neuromasts of 5 days post fertilization (dpf) wild-type and <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Hair cells were identified based on their central location and darker cytoplasm as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Owens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Suli et al., 2016</xref>). We quantified the number of ER tubules within 100 nm of mitochondria, the maximum distance for effective mitochondrial calcium uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Csordás et al., 2018</xref>). The ER was identified by its ribosome-rich membrane and elongated shape (blue profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because the ER at post-synaptic sites adjacent to efferent inputs has a distinct role in buffering high levels of post-synaptic calcium influx, and thus may impact the ER–mitochondria axis differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moglie et al., 2018</xref>), we did not include ER within 100 nm of the post-synaptic sites in our analysis. To identify the post-synaptic ER, we used the efferent terminal as a landmark, which presents as an electron light body filled with vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–A’</xref>). We also did not include ER in EM sections with presynaptic terminals, identified by synaptic ribbons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–B’</xref>). We found that <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells had on average 34% more ER tubules in close association with each mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Furthermore, we quantified the percentage of mitochondria in close association with a given number of ER tubules. We found that 61% of mitochondria in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells had one or more ER tubules in close association compared to 40% of wild-type hair cell mitochondria, and 25% of mutant mitochondria had two or more associated ER tubules compared with only 9% in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>).

We used an antibody shown to specifically label KDEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blanco-Sánchez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blanco-Sánchez et al., 2014</xref>), an ER C-terminal peptide retention signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Munro and Pelham, 1987</xref>), to visualize the ER in the transgenic line <italic>Tg(brn3c:mGFP)</italic>, in which the lateral line hair cells are labeled with membrane-targeted GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We measured the percentage of area occupied by KDEL immunofluorescence per neuromast using an approach previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blanco-Sánchez et al., 2014</xref>). We found that the mean KDEL % area per neuromast was not different between wild-type and <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> larvae, suggesting there is no ER expansion in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). As another means to assess ER abundance, we measured the length of ER tubules in our EM images. We found that there is no difference in the length of individual ER tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Notably, the total number of ER tubules in this analysis did not significantly differ between wild type (119 tubules) and <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> (123 tubules) hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These results, in addition to our previous findings showing no difference in mitochondrial mass between wild-type and <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>), indicate that the increase in the number of ER-mitochondrion associations we see in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>) is not simply due to increased ER or mitochondrial mass, but instead reflects a specific effect on promoting close associations.</p><p>The distance between ER and mitochondria also influences the efficiency of mitochondrial calcium intake and must be tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rizzuto et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we asked whether <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells also had tighter ER–mitochondria associations. We measured the distances between all ER and mitochondria within 100 nm of each other. We found that the ER-mitochondria distance was on average 5 nm shorter in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,I</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that Pappaa is important for preventing excessive and overly tight ER–mitochondria associations. Interestingly, another study used a synthetic linker to shorten the inter-organelle distance and showed a surge in mitochondria calcium load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Csordás et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that the excessively tight connections we see in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells could be causing their increased mitochondrial calcium load. Given the novelty of Pappaa’s role in regulating ER-mitochondria associations, it will be interesting to identify the downstream molecular targets of Pappaa within the ER–mitochondria tethering complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pappaa loss sensitizes hair cells to increased ER–mitochondria calcium transfer</title><p>Given the increased ER–mitochondria associations in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells, we hypothesized that they experience excessive ER–mitochondria calcium transfer. If so, we would expect that <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells would show increased vulnerability to pharmacological stimulation of ER-mitochondria calcium transfer. To address this question, we used thapsigargin, a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor, which prevents ER calcium influx and thereby allows for more available calcium in the cytosol to be taken up by the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Esterberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A previous study used a transgenic zebrafish line with a mitochondria-targeted calcium indicator (mitoGCaMP3) to show that thapsigargin treatment caused increased mitochondrial calcium uptake in lateral line hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Esterberg et al., 2014</xref>). We treated wild-type and <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> larvae with thapsigargin and used the <italic>Tg(brn3c:mGFP)</italic> transgene to assess hair cell survival. We used a series of thapsigargin doses, either chronic exposure to low concentrations or acute exposure to high concentrations. We found that treatment for 24 hr with low doses of thapsigargin caused 11–21% more hair cell death in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> larvae compared to wild-type larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly, we found that 1 hr exposure to relatively high doses of thapsigargin at 5 dpf resulted in 13–22% more hair cell death in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). These findings suggest that <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells are more sensitive to fluctuations in calcium and further support the idea that <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells have a disrupted ER–mitochondria connection that results in greater mitochondrial calcium uptake. However, it is difficult to discern whether the elevated levels of calcium in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> mitochondria are solely due to the altered ER-mitochondria associations. It is possible that <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells experience increased ER calcium efflux and/or mitochondrial calcium uptake. Protein kinase B (Akt), which is a downstream effector of multiple signaling pathways including IGF1, has been shown to inhibit IP3Rs and reduce ER calcium release in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Marchi et al., 2008</xref>).

Pappaa is a secreted metalloprotease and a known regulator of IGF1 signaling. Through its proteolytic activity, Pappaa cleaves the inhibitory IGFBPs, freeing IGF to bind to its receptor and thereby increasing IGF bioavailability and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boldt and Conover, 2007</xref>). To determine whether Pappaa regulates ER–mitochondria calcium transfer by stimulating IGF1 signaling, we took two approaches. First, we reasoned that if IGF1 signaling plays a role in regulating ER–mitochondria calcium transfer, then attenuating IGF1 signaling would result in increased sensitivity of wild-type hair cells to thapsigargin. Second, we reasoned that pharmacological stimulation of IGF1 bioavailability in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> mutants would improve hair cell survival in response to thapsigargin. To attenuate IGF1 signaling, we used a transgenic line with an inducible heat shock promoter that drives the expression of a dominant negative IGF1 receptor [<italic>Tg(hsp70:dnIGF1Ra-GFP)</italic>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kamei et al., 2011</xref>). Given that we previously showed IGF1 signaling acts post-developmentally to support hair cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>), we induced <italic>dnIGF1R</italic> expression on day four and exposed the larvae to thapsigargin for 1 hr. Notably, heat shock alone in wild-type or <italic>Tg(hsp70:dnIGF1Ra-GFP)</italic> larvae did not alter hair cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, expression of <italic>dnIGF1R</italic> did exacerbate hair cell loss in response to thapsigargin. Interestingly, 10 μM thapsigargin did not kill wild-type hair cells; however, it did cause hair cell death in <italic>dnIGF1Ra-GFP</italic> expressing larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), similar to <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> larvae. This suggests that IGF1R signaling attenuates ER–mitochondria calcium transfer. To stimulate IGF1 bioavailability in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> mutants, we treated larvae with NBI-31772, an IGFFBP inhibitor, for 24 hr and then exposed the larvae to a 1 hr treatment with thapsigargin. We found that treatment with NBI-31772 significantly improved hair cell survival in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These data support the idea that Pappaa regulates ER-mitochondria calcium transfer via its ability to increase the bioavailability of IGF1.</p><p>Pappaa is not expressed by the hair cells themselves, rather it is expressed by the surrounding support cells of the neuromast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>). Because Pappaa is a secreted protein, it could potentially affect IGF signaling in the hair cells, support cells, or both. To ask which cells show altered IGF1 signaling in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> mutants, we used an antibody against phosphorylated IGF1R (pIGF1R) that was previously validated using an IGF1R inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chablais and Jazwinska, 2010</xref>). IGF1R undergoes autophosphorylation when it binds to IGF1, thereby activating its signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feldman et al., 1997</xref>). We quantified the fluorescent intensity of pIGF1R in wild-type and <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> neuromasts. We found that loss of Pappaa caused a substantial reduction in pIGF1R fluorescence in the hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), suggesting that Pappaa secreted by support cells can impact IGF1R signaling in the neighboring hair cells. Interestingly, the support cells in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> mutants also showed reduced pIGF1R fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>), suggesting that Pappaa can have an autocrine effect on support cells. It is possible that hair cells are also affected indirectly by reduced IGF signaling in support cells. In support of this idea, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which is downstream of IGF1R, in the support cells of mammalian cochlea resulted in enhanced survival of hair cells against cisplatin, a chemotherapy agent, suggesting that IGF1 signaling in support cells could influence hair cells. However, the mechanism by which PI3K signaling in support cells ultimately affects cochlear hair cells is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jadali et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pappaa regulates mitochondrial morphology</title><p>Mitochondria undergo constant fission and fusion as a form of quality control. Damaged mitochondria are excised from the mitochondrial network through the process of fission and cleared by autophagy, while the remaining reusable pool of mitochondria fuse back together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ni et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, a balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion must be achieved to maintain cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liesa et al., 2009</xref>). Under pathological conditions, such as oxidative stress in which there is an excess of damaged mitochondria, the balance between fission and fusion tips toward fission. Excessive fission can lead to fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and ultimately to cell death. Recently, it was shown that mitochondrial fission occurs at the site of ER-mitochondria contacts. ER tubules were found to wrap around mitochondria and mark the site for fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>). Given that <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells experience oxidative stress, have dysfunctional mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>), and exhibit increased ER-mitochondria associations, we hypothesized that <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells experience increased fission. Mitochondrial morphology can be predictive of fission and fusion events. Small, round, and clustered mitochondria are often indicative of fission events, whereas large and branched mitochondria are indicative of fusion events. To test our hypothesis, we used EM and measured several parameters of mitochondrial morphology that are typically used as a readout of mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wiemerslage and Lee, 2016</xref>). These parameters include the area, perimeter, aspect ratio (major axis/minor axis; a measure of elongation), circularity (4π × area/perimeter<sup>2</sup>), and network interconnectivity (area/perimeter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wiemerslage and Lee, 2016</xref>). We found that <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> mitochondria had a smaller area, perimeter, and aspect ratio than wild-type mitochondria. Moreover, they were more circular and showed reduced network interconnectivity, suggesting excessive mitochondrial fission and possible network fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–F</xref>). To further investigate mitochondrial integrity in whole cells, we labeled hair cells with the vital mitochondrial dye Mitotracker. Using confocal microscopy, we acquired z-stacks of neuromast hair cells. Mitochondria in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells appeared less connected and more rounded compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). Analysis of mitochondrial circularity using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) revealed results similar to the EM data, supporting the idea that <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> mitochondria are fragmented. Taken together, our data suggest that Pappaa regulates mitochondrial fission. Our findings are consistent with a previous study showing that treatment with IGF1 maintained mitochondrial integrity in denervated muscle cells by promoting mitochondrial fusion and preventing mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ding et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Pappaa loss causes mitochondrial fragmentation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative EM images of mitochondria in lateral line hair cells in 5 dpf wild-type and <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> larvae.

Pharmacological and genetic manipulations that tighten or increase ER–mitochondria associations result in reduced autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gomez-Suaga et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gomez-Suaga et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sano et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells have an attenuated autophagic response. Interestingly, neomycin, to which <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells show hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>), was shown to be sequestered into autophagosomes upon entry into hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hailey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">He et al., 2017</xref>). These authors also showed that blocking autophagy exacerbates neomycin-induced damage presumably due to the heightened exposure of vital intracellular components to neomycin. Thus, neomycin uptake into autophagosomes can be used as an indicator of the robustness of the autophagic response. To test whether <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells show a dampened autophagic response to neomycin treatment, we used a fluorescently tagged neomycin (Neomycin-Texas Red). Upon cell entry through the mechanotransduction (MET) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alharazneh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hailey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kroese et al., 1989</xref>), neomycin-Texas Red appears as a diffused pool in the cytosol. Within minutes, neomycin gets captured by autophagosomes and high fluorescent intensity puncta begin to appear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hailey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). We counted the number of puncta within visually accessible neuromast hair cells in wild-type and <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> larvae.

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>), indicating that neomycin-induced autophagy was attenuated in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells. This reduction in autophagy may allow neomycin to accumulate in the cytosol, causing more damage to intracellular compartments. To test the possibility that the increased neomycin-induced hair cell death in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>) is the result of enhanced entry of neomycin through the MET, we measured the change in fluorescent intensity of neomycin-Texas Red (ΔF/F0) in individual hair cells at 2.5, 4.5, and 6.5 min post neomycin-Texas Red exposure.

In addition to acting as the largest calcium reserve in the cell, the ER is the primary hub for protein processing. Newly synthesized proteins enter the ER for chaperone-assisted folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gregersen et al., 2006</xref>). Improper or insufficient folding results in the accumulation of unfolded proteins, which causes ER stress and increased calcium efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Houck et al., 2012</xref>). This efflux results in an increase in highly concentrated calcium ‘hot spots’ that act as arresting signals for mitochondria, tethering the mitochondria to the ER and thereby increasing the frequency and tightness of ER–mitochondria associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bravo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bravo et al., 2011</xref>). To ask whether <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells experience ER stress, we FACsorted hair cells from wild-type and <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup> Tg(brn3c:mGFP)</italic> larvae and evaluated gene expression of the unfolded protein response (UPR) by RT-qPCR. The UPR consists of three ER transmembrane receptors that act as sensors for unfolded proteins, IRE1, ATF4, and PERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Normally, Bip, an ER-resident chaperone, is bound to the UPR receptors. When unfolded proteins begin to accumulate, Bip dissociates from the UPR receptors to assist in protein folding. The uncoupling of Bip activates the UPR signaling cascade signifying ER stress. During the early phase of ER stress, the UPR promotes cell survival by improving the folding capacity of the ER through the upregulation of pro-survival factors including <italic>bip</italic>, <italic>atf4</italic>, and the splicing of <italic>xbp1.</italic> However, a switch from an adaptive to a pro-apoptotic UPR occurs during the late phase of ER stress, in which <italic>chop</italic>, a pro-apoptotic transcription factor, is upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oslowski and Urano, 2011</xref>). Our analysis revealed that components of the ‘adaptive’ UPR pathway (<italic>bip</italic>, <italic>atf4</italic>, and <italic>spliced-xbp1</italic>) were upregulated in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Notably, the ‘pro-apoptotic’ factor, c<italic>hop</italic>, was not differentially expressed in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells. These results suggest that <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells experience early ER stress but not the later, pro-apoptotic response. To further investigate whether <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells are in the process of apoptosis, we performed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and used phalloidin as a counterstain to identify hair cells. As a positive control, we treated wild-type larvae with neomycin, a known apoptosis-inducing drug, for 30 min prior to fixation, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goodman and Zallocchi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In all neuromasts analyzed (head neuromasts in 10 larvae/group), we observed multiple TUNEL-positive hair cells in the positive controls. In contrast, in both untreated wild-type and <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> larvae, we did not observe any TUNEL-positive neuromasts, which is consistent with the lack of spontaneous hair cell death in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>). Together with our finding that <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells do not exhibit ER expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>), an event associated with advanced ER stress as a result of extreme accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chavez-Valdez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dorner et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Welihinda et al., 1999</xref>), these data support the idea that the ER in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells is in the early stages of stress. Interestingly, another study using a zebrafish model of Usher syndrome, a genetic disorder that can cause hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blanco-Sánchez et al., 2014</xref>), found that while Usher mutant larvae did not show spontaneous hair cell death, the hair cells were TUNEL positive and showed ER expansion, suggesting that Usher mutants experience more advanced stages of ER stress than <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> mutants.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Pappaa loss causes ER stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the UPR pathway.

Disruptions to this connection can cause damage to vital cellular components and is found to occur in many neurodegenerative diseases. To identify potential targets for therapeutic interventions, we must define and characterize the genetic and molecular mechanisms regulating the ER–mitochondria axis. Here, we describe a novel role for Pappaa, a local stimulator of IGF1 signaling, in regulating the ER–mitochondria axis and its essential downstream processes. We previously showed that mitochondria in <italic>pappaa</italic> mutant hair cells are dysfunctional, resulting in oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>). Here we provide additional mechanistic insight into Pappaa’s role in hair cell survival. We show that Pappaa is essential for the function of ER and its relationship to mitochondria in hair cells. Hair cell function and activity are influenced by the surrounding support cells as well as the efferent and afferent neurons that innervate hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Babola et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Faucherre et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pichler and Lagnado, 2020</xref>). A caveat to our pharmacological experiments is that drug treatments will affect all of these cell types, and some effects on hair cells may be indirect. Nonetheless, we show that the ER stress, excessive and abnormally tight ER–mitochondria associations, defects in mitochondria morphology and reduced autophagic activity in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> mutants occur in the hair cells. A challenge to determining the initial site of dysfunction within <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells is the functional coupling of the ER and mitochondria. ER-mediated calcium release acts as a key regulator of mitochondrial bioenergetics, and thereby ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Görlach et al., 2015</xref>). In turn, mitochondria-generated ROS can stimulate the activity of ER-associated calcium channels causing further calcium release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brookes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chaudhari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Görlach et al., 2015</xref>). Given that many ER-resident molecular chaperones are calcium dependent, ER stress can be both a cause and a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhu and Lee, 2015</xref>). While it is difficult to definitively determine which organelle is affected first when the ER–mitochondria axis is compromised, several of our findings support an ER-driven dysfunction in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> mutants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bravo et al., 2011</xref> showed that during early ER stress, increased ER–mitochondria coupling occurs to enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics. <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells display all the telltale signs of early ER stress, including activation of the adaptive UPR branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), heightened mitochondrial bioenergetics evident by increased calcium load, ROS, and hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Esterberg et al., 2014</xref> characterized the timeline of subcellular events following ER calcium release in hair cells. They showed that calcium released from the ER is quickly taken up by the mitochondria and initially causes mitochondria hyperpolarization suggesting increased bioenergetics. However, once a certain threshold is crossed, depolarization of the mitochondria occurs, which is followed by permeabilization of the outer membrane and eventually cell death, hence this step is often referred to as ‘the point of no return’. <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> mitochondria are hyperpolarized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>), which places them a step after ER–calcium release and before depolarization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and hair cell death. Indeed, <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells do not spontaneously degenerate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Although it is difficult to determine with absolute certainty, we speculate that ER stress may precede mitochondrial dysfunction in <italic>pappaa<sup>p170</sup></italic> hair cells. Precise temporal dissection is needed to identify Pappaa’s primary subcellular target, whether the mitochondria, ER, or both.</p><p>IGF1 emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate due to its known role in influencing the function of the ER and the mitochondria. Studies using exogenous IGF1 treatment showed it can alleviate pharmacologically induced ER stress in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Novosyadlyy et al., 2008</xref>) or attenuate mitochondria-generated ROS in cirrhosis or aging disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Castilla-Cortazar et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">García-Fernández et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Novosyadlyy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sádaba et al., 2016</xref>), supporting the possibility that IGF1 signaling may play a role in regulating the ER-mitochondria axis. However, exogenous IGF1 treatment presents its own set of challenges for developing an IGF-based therapy. IGF1 signaling has a broad cellular impact and ubiquitous overexpression could affect many systems. Additionally, the suppressive effects of IGFBPs on IGF1 may render this approach inefficient. Indeed, patients with neurodegenerative disorders have not shown significant improvement following systemic IGF1 administration. These disappointing outcomes are thought to be due to the suppressive effects of IGFBPs on IGF1 bioavailability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Raoul and Aebischer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sakowski et al., 2009</xref>). This was evident in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive motor neuron disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bowling et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shaw et al., 1995</xref>), in which total IGF1 levels appeared to be normal, whereas ‘free’ IGF1 levels were reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilczak et al., 2003</xref>). As an upstream regulator of IGF1 signaling that is spatially restricted, Pappaa may provide a more viable therapeutic alternative.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"

To stimulate IGF1 bioavailability, larvae were pre-treated with 100–120 µM NBI-31772 (Fisher Scientific 519210; dissolved in DMSO) for 24 hr starting from day 4, then exposed to 20 µM thapsigargin for 1 hr. Optimal drug concentrations and exposure times were determined from pilot experiments with a wide range of doses. The highest dose that yielded hair cell death but was not lethal to the larvae was chosen as the upper limit for the dose ranges used in experiments. Following each treatment period, larvae were washed three times with E3 before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (diluted to 4% w/v in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) from 16% w/v in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4).

Z<italic>-</italic>stack images of each neuromast were acquired at baseline (prior to Neo-TR exposure) for 2.5 min at 30 s intervals. Following the addition of neomycin-Texas Red to the larva, images were acquired at 30 s intervals for 1 hr. Hair cells within each neuromast that were visually accessible with no significant physical overlap with neighboring hair cells were selected for analysis. Neomycin-Texas Red puncta were counted manually for each hair cell. For the rescue experiment, larvae were treated with 120 μM NBI-31772 for 24 hr starting from 4 dpf. At 5 dpf, larvae were anesthetized in 0.02% tricaine in 133 μM NBI-31772 and transferred to the imaging chamber. Neomycin-Texas Red was added to a final concentration of 120 μM NBI-31772. Z-stack summation projections that included the full depth of the neuromast hair cells were used to quantify fluorescent intensity of neomycin-Texas Red. A region of interest around <italic>brn3c:GFP</italic>-labaled hair cells was drawn with the free hand tool in ImageJ.

Mitochondrial morphology and ER–mitochondria associations were analyzed using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). For mitochondrial morphology, a ROI was manually drawn around each mitochondrion using the free hand tool. The ‘Analyze Particles’ function was used to measure the area, perimeter, and circularity. Mitochondrial interconnectivity was calculated as the area/perimeter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wiemerslage and Lee, 2016</xref>). To measure the inter-organelle distance, the line segment tool was used to draw a straight line connecting the two closest points between the ER and mitochondria. Any ER–mitochondria associations with distances exceeding 100 nm were discarded from the final analysis.

reticulum-mitochondria associations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alison Coffin (Reviewer #2); Katie Kindt (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This current study builds on previous work from the same group published in e<italic>Life</italic>. This past work focused on the mechanism that renders lateral line hair cells of pappaa mutants more susceptible to the ototoxin neomycin. This work found that mitochondrial dysfunction was the underlying cause for neomycin susceptibility. This current study expands on the previous work and suggests that not only defects in mitochondria, but also the ER are involved in neomycin susceptibility. The authors use a variety of approaches including TEM, live imaging, pharmacology and RT-qPCR in their present study. Using TEM the authors show that mitochondria – ER associated are more numerous. Furthermore, similar to disrupting mitochondrial calcium pharmacologically, disrupting ER calcium also renders Pappaa-deficient hair cells more susceptible to neomycin. The authors suggest that this ER dysfunction manifests in several ways. They use live imaging to show that in pappaa mutants hair cells are unable to properly package neomycin into autosomes. In addition, via RT-qPCR they show that pappaa mutants have an increased unfolded protein response (UPR). Currently the relationship between all of these pathological issues is unclear, but this work does reveal additional mechanisms that could render loss of Pappaa detrimental to hair cell health. Although the work is well written and presented and statistically sound, it there are several experiments that are needed to strengthen the claims presented in this study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Location of TEM micrographs in hair cell</p><p>The morphology of organelles can vary based on location within the cell. For example, in hair cells the ER near the nucleus can be distinct from the ER present near the contacts made with efferent neurons or afferent neurons. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1430341/; https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/jphysiol.2013.267914).</p><p>Can the authors indicate what direction the sections (apical-basal or transverse) were taken, where in the hair cells are the sections were taken and how they determined this location?</p><p>2. Quantification of mitochondrial fragmentation</p><p>It is clear from the TEM cross sections that the mitochondria in hair cells (Figure 3 A) are quite different between pappaa mutants and controls. Whether there are mitochondria or ER networks are present is not apparent from these TEM images. Nor is it entirely clear that the networks are fragmented. The authors use plugins developed for confocal imaging to estimate fragmentation base on circularity and area/perimeter measurement. It is unclear if these measurement translate to hair cells or TEM. In addition to fragmentation in TEM images, the fragmented mitochondria in pappaa mutants are also hard to see in the live, max-projected mitoTimer images.</p><p>The mitochondrial networks and fragmentation may be clearer or be better quantified by acquiring super resolution images of hair cells labeled with mitoTracker. In addition, it is possible that the fragmentation may also be visible or more convincing in videos of Z-stacks of mitoTracker label compared to in the max-projected images provided.</p><p>3. Examination of hair cell ER morphology</p><p>The previous work on Pappaa in zebrafish hair cells focused extensively on the mitochondria while the currently study the shifted the focus to the hair cell ER. While the ER-mito distances are convincing, a more wholistic picture of the amount or distribution of the ER in wildtype and mutant is lacking.</p><p>This could be accomplished either using a transgenic line that labels the ER or a KDEL antibody (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4007406/).</p><p>4. It qualitatively appears that pappaa mutant hair cells are taking up a greater quantity of fluorescent Neo faster than WT i.e. the fluorescent intensity is greater in more hair cells. Did the authors quantify Neo-TR uptake?</p><p>5. Specificity of the pharmacological treatments</p><p>The authors perform numerous pharmacological experiments to disturb ER calcium. The authors suggest that their pharmacological manipulations trigger hair cell death due to the alteration in the interplay between ER/mito calcium in hair cells. What concentration of either of these drugs does it take to kill WT hair cells? Dose-response curves comparing WT and mutant would help support the idea that hair-cell death observed is a direct effect of the drugs on hair-cell ER-mitochondria calcium signaling.</p><p>Pharmacology is non-cell autonomous and the authors do not present evidence that these compounds specifically impact hair cell ER or mitochondrial calcium. Alternatively, these compound could impact supporting cell ER (https://elifesciences.org/articles/52160) as well as the ER in the innervating afferent or efferent neurons.</p><p>More direct evidence show that hair cell mitochondria or ER calcium (measurements using mitoGCaMP such as in the previous study) are impacted by these treatments would make the author's claims more compelling.</p><p>6. The disconnect between IGFR1 and results in the current study.</p><p>The identify and location of IGFR1 and the IGFBP are still undefined in this system and therefore it remains unclear exactly how IGRR1 or Pappaa impact sensory hair cells. In previous work on pappaa mutants (enhanced startle response, defects in photoreceptor synapse formation, defects in hair cell mitochondria) the role of IGFR1 in these processes was validated. In the current study, the link with IGFR1 is implied throughout.</p><p>It is true that the relationship between IGFR1 and Pappa is well characterized and that currently the only known substrates of Pappa are IGFBPs. Despite this work, it is still possible that given the range of phenotypes in pappaa mutants, that Pappa has other protein substrates that have not yet been identified, or other has biological functions unrelated to the IGF system.</p><p>To verify IGFR1 in this current study the authors could use NB1-31772 to stimulate IGF1 bioavailability and test whether this rescues either the autophagy or UPR defects in pappaa mutants. Being able to rescue these phenotypes also makes the study more compelling.</p><p>7. The authors state that there is not more spontaneous hair cell death in pappaa mutants compared to controls (line 443). Previous work has shown in zebrafish that Usher mutants (cdh23, ush1c, myo7a) also have an early UPR (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4007406/). Similar to pappaa mutants usher mutants have the same # of hair cells compared to controls, indicating no spontaneous hair cell death. But interestingly Usher mutants do have more TUNEL positive hair cells compared to controls, indicating that more hair cells in Usher mutants are in the process of apoptosis. Based on this new finding implicating the UPR response in pappaa mutants, could pappaa mutants, similar to hair cells in Usher mutants be more fragile (neomycin susceptible) as they are more likely to be in the process of apoptosis? A TUNEL label in pappaa mutants could reveal this. In addition, this paper on UPR in Usher mutant hair cells could be a useful paper to add to the discussion.</p><p>8. Line 445-451: &quot;Together, these findings suggest that Pappaa may regulate ER-mitochondria associations by promoting ER homeostasis. It is important to note that the ER and mitochondria are engaged in a constant feedback loop.&quot; This line of reasoning seems rather circular, considering that the previous study showed Pappaa regulates mitochondrial function. If mitochondrial function is impaired, it seems likely that ER homeostasis would be disrupted as well.</p><p>9. Methods: Overall, the methods section needs more detail. All experiments that were not previously performed by the author or the author's lab should have a concise description of what the authors did next to the reference (e.g. fish were imaged under Lab-Tek Chambered Coverglass (Fisher Scientific) where they were immobilized under a nylon mesh and two stainless-steel slice hold-downs (Warner Instruments) per Stawicki et al., 2014) A detailed description of how individual pappaa170 larvae used in experiments were genotyped is needed. A comprehensive description of how mitochondrial circularity was measured using the &quot;mitochondrial morphology&quot; plug-in in ImageJ is needed.</p><p>10. Statistics: how did the authors determine the power of the experiments were sufficient to avoid Type I and Type II error?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Pregnancy associated plasma protein-aa regulates endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria associations&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>This current study builds on previous work from the same group published in <italic>eLife</italic>.

In addition, via RT-qPCR they show that pappaa mutants have an increased unfolded protein response (UPR). The work is well written and presented and statistically sound.</p><p>Overall, this revision addressed a number of specific concerns experimentally, including providing pharmacological evidence that IGF system is involved in the hair cell processes they're examining. However some issues still need to be addressed:</p><p>1. More is needed is needed on the locus of action where Pappaa/ IGF signaling regulates the hair cell ER-mitochondria axis. The first author has previously reported pappaa expression to be in supporting cells. However igf1rb expression in neuromasts has also been reported to be predominantly in supporting cells (e.g. https://piotrowskilab.shinyapps.io/neuromast_homeostasis_scrnaseq_2018/). If Pappa/IGF signaling is occurring in supporting cells, the effect on hair cells would be indirect. Resolution of where signaling occurs would be a valuable addition to this study. At the very least, this issue warrants discussion in the manuscript.</p><p>2. Currently the relationship between the numerous pathological issues present in pappaa hair cells (mitochondria and ER morphology disruption, lysosomal packaging) is unclear. Does the origin of the deficit rest in the mitochondria, the ER or another organelle? Overall, this work does reveal an additional mechanism (ER calcium) that renders loss of Pappaa detrimental to hair cell health. One caveat of the study is that it relies heavily on pharmacology which impacts not only the ER in hair cells, but also the glial-like supporting cells that surround hair cells, as well as the afferents and efferents that innervate this sensory system.</p><p>These points would be worth discussion.</p><p>3. The authors indicated in Figure 1A the orientation of the TEM sections and identified which anterior neuromasts. But it was not entirely clear how they determined the location of their organelles relative to neuronal contacts. There was no discussion in the manuscript on how they analyzed the images using the post-synaptic density and synaptic ribbons as landmarks. Additionally, there was no mention of efferent contacts in either the manuscript or the rebuttal.</p><p>4. KDEL labeling does not appear to be specifically labeling ER in the images shown in Figure 1F. Instead, the labeling appears completely colocalized with hair cell plasma membrane bound GFP. For comparison, Blanco-Sánchez et al., 2014 showed discrete labeling of membrane within hair cells. Specificity of labeling should be verified if KDEL labeling will be used to measure the amount or distribution of the ER in wildtype and pappaa mutants.</p><p>5. The authors did not answer the question of how they determined their experiments were sufficiently powered.</p><p>6. The x/z and y/z max intensity images of Mitotracker are better illustrations of what appear to be more fragmented mitochondria. The Imaris 3D reconstructions the authors mentioned in the rebuttal would have been informative, but they did not include them in Figure 3.</p><p>7. The P values for non-significance should be reported.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59687.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The section orientation is best illustrated by Figure 1B, where the apical stereocilia are at the top of the image and basal is at the bottom. We added more detailed description of the section plane and specific neuromasts to the Results and Methods text, and indicated section plane in Figure 1A. Hair cells were identified based on their central location and darker cytoplasm as noted by (Owens et al., 2007; Behra et al., 2009; Suli et al., 2016). We do not see the stacked ER cistern morphology mentioned in (Chang et al., 1992). This is perhaps because lateral line hair cells more closely resemble type 2 hair cells which lack the perinuclear ER (Song et al., 1995; Nicolson, 2017). We thank the reviewers for drawing our attention to the difference in ER based on its proximity to the synaptic terminal. We re-analyzed our images using the post-synaptic density and synaptic ribbons as landmarks to help us identify pre-synaptic terminals. The data we included in the analysis presented in Figure 1 did not include the “thin near-membrane cistern” mentioned in (Fuchs, 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We used the “free hand” tool to manually draw a ROI around each individual mitochondrion, then used the “analyze particles” function to measure the area, perimeter, and circularity. We understand that mitochondrial fragmentation is difficult to visualize in EM images. Therefore, we changed the text from “Pappaa loss causes mitochondrial fragmentation” to “Pappaa regulates mitochondrial morphology” which we believe is a better interpretation of our results. In addition, to better show the mitochondrial networks, we used Imaris software to make 3D reconstructions of the mitotracker-stained hair cells. In the revised manuscript Figure 3G, we include both the maximum intensity projection and sections in the xz and yz planes. We hope that the difference in mitochondrial morphology between wild type and <italic>pappaa</italic> mutants is more evident in these updated images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Given the high cost of Adensophostin A, we chose to focus on Thapsigargin experiments. In the revised manuscript, we include dose-response data for two ranges of Thapsigargin concentrations: lower concentrations with chronic exposure (Figure 2C) and higher concentrations with acute exposure (Figure 2D). Both these ranges span from doses that cause little to no hair cell death in wild type larvae to doses that cause low levels of wildtype cell death.

Second, we found that treatment with NBI-31772 to increase IGF1 bioavailability improves hair cell survival in <italic>pappaa</italic> mutant larvae treated with Thapsigargin (Figure 2F).

A comprehensive description of how mitochondrial circularity was measured using the &quot;mitochondrial morphology&quot; plug-in in ImageJ is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised our manuscript to add more detail throughout the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Statistics: how did the authors determine the power of the experiments were sufficient to avoid Type I and Type II error?</p></disp-quote><p>In general, we use the number of larvae as the N for statistical analyses, however, we analyzed at least 3 neuromasts per larva. In the revised manuscript, we include detailed numbers of neuromasts and larvae in the figure legends. All pharmacological experiments included a minimum of 24 neuromasts from 8 larvae per group which we believe to be sufficient to avoid type I and II error. For live imaging experiments, we were somewhat limited in the number of larvae we could test, because in order to maintain consistency of conditions among samples, we imaged all experimental and control groups for each experiment on the same day. The live imaging of Neo-TR autophagy experiment included 22 hair cells from 4 larvae per genotype, and the mitotracker experiment included 8 larvae per genotype. These numbers are in line with other zebrafish lateral line publications.</p><p>Alassaf M, Daykin EC, Mathiaparanam J, Wolman MA (2019) Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-aa supports hair cell survival by regulating mitochondrial function. <italic>eLife</italic> 8.</p><p>Behra M, Bradsher J, Sougrat R, Gallardo V, Allende ML, Burgess SM (2009) Phoenix is required for mechanosensory hair cell regeneration in the zebrafish lateral line.

However some issues still need to be addressed:</p><p>1. More is needed is needed on the locus of action where Pappaa/ IGF signaling regulates the hair cell ER-mitochondria axis. The first author has previously reported pappaa expression to be in supporting cells. However igf1rb expression in neuromasts has also been reported to be predominantly in supporting cells (e.g. https://piotrowskilab.shinyapps.io/neuromast_homeostasis_scrnaseq_2018/). If Pappa/IGF signaling is occurring in supporting cells, the effect on hair cells would be indirect. Resolution of where signaling occurs would be a valuable addition to this study. At the very least, this issue warrants discussion in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We added an experiment to ask where Pappaa/IGF signaling occurs, using an antibody against phosphorylated IGF1R (pIGF1R), which recognizes the IGF1R autophosphorylation event that occurs when the receptor is activated by IGF1 binding. This antibody has previously been validated using the IGF1R inhibitor NVP (Chablais and Jazwinska, 2010). We quantified the fluorescent intensity of pIGF1R in neuromasts and found that loss of Pappaa caused a reduction in pIGF1R fluorescence in both the hair cells and the support cells. The data are reported in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. The results and discussion of potential direct and indirect effects are added to the manuscript text on p. 6, lines 247-265. The detailed methods are reported in the Methods section p. 13, lines 521-528.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Currently the relationship between the numerous pathological issues present in pappaa hair cells (mitochondria and ER morphology disruption, lysosomal packaging) is unclear. Does the origin of the deficit rest in the mitochondria, the ER or another organelle? Overall, this work does reveal an additional mechanism (ER calcium) that renders loss of Pappaa detrimental to hair cell health. One caveat of the study is that it relies heavily on pharmacology which impacts not only the ER in hair cells, but also the glial-like supporting cells that surround hair cells, as well as the afferents and efferents that innervate this sensory system.</p><p>These points would be worth discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more discussion of these caveats and questions to the manuscript text, in the Conclusion section, p. 9-10, lines 404-436.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors indicated in Figure 1A the orientation of the TEM sections and identified which anterior neuromasts. But it was not entirely clear how they determined the location of their organelles relative to neuronal contacts. There was no discussion in the manuscript on how they analyzed the images using the post-synaptic density and synaptic ribbons as landmarks. Additionally, there was no mention of efferent contacts in either the manuscript or the rebuttal.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new supplemental figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) showing images of the efferent contacts and synaptic ribbons in our EM sections. We added the following text to the manuscript, p. 4, lines 147-153:</p><p>“Because the ER at post-synaptic sites adjacent to efferent inputs has a distinct role in buffering high levels of post-synaptic calcium influx, and thus may impact the ER-mitochondria axis differently (Moglie et al., 2018), we did not include ER within 100 nm of the post-synaptic sites in our analysis. […] We also did not include ER in EM sections with presynaptic terminals, identified by synaptic ribbons (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-B’).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. KDEL labeling does not appear to be specifically labeling ER in the images shown in Figure 1F. Instead, the labeling appears completely colocalized with hair cell plasma membrane bound GFP. For comparison, Blanco-Sánchez et al., 2014 showed discrete labeling of membrane within hair cells. Specificity of labeling should be verified if KDEL labeling will be used to measure the amount or distribution of the ER in wildtype and pappaa mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>The nuclei in the macula hair cells shown in the Blanco-Sanchez et al. study do not occupy as large a proportion of the cell as the nuclei in lateral line hair cells, thus allowing the ER in the cytoplasm to be spatially distinguished from the plasma membrane. In lateral line hair cells, the nucleus is large and the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus is contained in a thin layer between the nucleus and plasma membrane. The previous image we showed in Figure 1F was of a single plane through the part of the cell containing the nucleus, and the resolution of our light microscopy was not sufficiently high to distinguish the thin layer of cytoplasm from the plasma membrane. We replaced that image with a maximum projection of several z-planes, including regions of the cytoplasm apical to the nucleus, where cytoplasmic ER labeling is distinguishable from the plasma membrane. The KDEL antibody was shown by Blanco-Sanchez (2018) to specifically label the ER by comparing to a transgenic line <italic>Tg[myo6b:kdel-crimson]<sup>b1319</sup></italic> that labels the ER.</p><p>To complement the KDEL antibody labeling, we used another measure to assess the amount of ER present. We quantified the length of ER profiles in our EM sections, reasoning that increased abundance of ER in the cells may be reflected in longer tubule profiles. We found no difference in ER tubule profile length in mutants versus wild type hair cells. We also did not find a difference in the total number of ER tubules between mutants and wild type. We report these data in the new Figure 1H and have added the results to the manuscript text on p. 4, lines 169-173.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors did not answer the question of how they determined their experiments were sufficiently powered.</p></disp-quote><p>We used JMP Pro 15.0 software to perform power analyses for our experiments. Power analysis on the number of neuromasts, hair cells, or mitochondria we used for each experiment showed that all our experiments were sufficiently powered to avoid type 1 and 2 errors. We include this information in our Methods section, p. 16, lines 647-649, and added it to our Transparent Reporting form.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
