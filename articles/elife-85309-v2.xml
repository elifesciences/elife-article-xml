Previous studies have identified intrinsic regenerative ability regulators that act on gene expression in injured neurons. However, it is less known whether RNA modifications play a role in this process. Here, we systematically screened the functions of all common m<sup>6</sup>A modification-related enzymes in axon regeneration and report ALKBH5, an evolutionarily conserved RNA m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase, as a regulator of axonal regeneration in rodents. In PNS, knockdown of ALKBH5 enhanced sensory axonal regeneration, whereas overexpressing ALKBH5 impaired axonal regeneration in an m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent manner. Mechanistically, ALKBH5 increased the stability of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA and thus limited regenerative growth associated lipid metabolism in dorsal root ganglion neurons. Moreover, in CNS, knockdown of ALKBH5 enhanced the survival and axonal regeneration of retinal ganglion cells after optic nerve injury. Together, our results suggest a novel mechanism regulating axon regeneration and point ALKBH5 as a potential target for promoting axon regeneration in both PNS and CNS.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells, or neurons, are the key communication components of the body. Each neuron takes signals from many inputs and transmits them through a single output called the axon. In the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, damaged neurons do not generally repair themselves. But in the peripheral nervous system, where neurons branch out to other parts of the body, they can regenerate. For this to happen, genes which promote axon regrowth must be expressed.</p><p>Messenger RNA carries DNA information from the nucleus of a cell to the cytoplasm where it serves as instructions for generating proteins. Certain enzymes can modify messenger RNA, changing how long it lasts, where it goes in the cell and what proteins it makes. It has been suggested that a particular RNA modification, known as m<sup>6</sup>A, plays an important role in axon regrowth as increased m<sup>6</sup>A levels have been reported in some neurons after a peripheral nerve injury.</p><p>Wang et al. studied the impact of m<sup>6</sup>A modifications on axon regrowth by examining the effects of several genes associated with these modifications in rats. The experiments showed that expression of a gene called <italic>Alkbh5</italic> – which codes for an enzyme that removes m<sup>6</sup>A modifications – regulates the amount of axon regrowth following an injury to peripheral nerves. Reducing the amount of <italic>Alkbh5</italic> expression rates increased axon regrowth, whereas in rats where <italic>Alkbh5</italic> was overexpressed, regrowth was reduced. Further experiments showed that the ALKBH5 enzyme helps to make mRNA from the gene <italic>Lpin2</italic> more stable, which affects how it processes fats and lipids during the regeneration process. Moreover, in the central nervous system, reducing <italic>Alkbh5</italic> expression enhanced survival and axon regrowth of neurons in the eye after they were injured in mice.</p><p>The findings suggest that <italic>Alkbh5</italic> influences axon regrowth and are an important step towards understanding how biological systems repair nerve damage. Future work should investigate if stopping <italic>Alkbh5</italic> expression allows injured neurons to recover their function and how different m<sup>6</sup>A-associated enzymes work together in this process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon regeneration</kwd><kwd>nerve injury</kwd><kwd>DRG neuron</kwd><kwd>m<sup>6</sup>A</kwd><kwd>ALKBH5</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFA1201404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32071034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32200799</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Dong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004608</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BK20220606</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Dong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Collegiate Natural Science Fund of Jiangsu Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21KJA180002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Susu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Collegiate Natural Science Fund of Jiangsu Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22KJB180024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Dong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibiting RNA N6-methyladenosine demethylase ALKBH5 promoted axonal regeneration of dorsal root ganglion neurons by regulating stability of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA and enhanced the survival and axonal regeneration of retinal ganglion cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Triggering axon regeneration, accelerating nerve regeneration, and extending the regenerated nerve length are the most straightforward methods of nerve repair following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Costigan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moore and Goldberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palmisano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith and Skene, 1997</xref>). These processes are highly dependent on the intrinsic regeneration ability of neurons. However, diminished intrinsic regeneration ability is one of the major barriers for axonal regeneration following nerve injury. Although central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) possess distinct regenerative outcomes, recent studies suggested that these neurons share certain molecular mechanisms that regulate their regenerative capacity. For example, genes such as <italic>Pten</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>Lin28</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nathan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>), <italic>Socs3/Jak</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Atf3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seijffers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seijffers et al., 2007</xref>), and <italic>Cbp/P300</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hutson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Müller et al., 2022</xref>) have been shown to regulate axon regeneration in different types of CNS and PNS neurons. Noticeably, most of these genes and pathways act by altering transcriptional programs. However, transcription is the first step of gene expression. For efficient protein translation, mRNA splicing and stability control are important, but it is unknown whether these processes are involved in axon regeneration.</p><p>N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), the most abundant internal modification of mRNA, plays important roles in diverse physiological and pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Desrosiers et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frye and Blanco, 2016</xref>). In eukaryotic cells, m<sup>6</sup>A is added by a methyltransferase complex consisting of METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, or other components, is removed by demethylases FTO and ALKBH5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zaccara et al., 2019</xref>), and is recognized by recognition proteins, including the YTHDF family (YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3), YTHDC1, YTHDC2, and IGF2BP family (IGF2BP1, IGF2BP2, and IGF2BP3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He and He, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murakami and Jaffrey, 2022</xref>). Increasing evidence indicates that m<sup>6</sup>A exerts critical several molecular functions, including RNA splicing, localization, decay, and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alarcón et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study showed that the m<sup>6</sup>A level of regeneration-associated genes is altered in DRG neurons following sciatic nerve injury, and that the m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex component METTL14 or m<sup>6</sup>A-binding protein YTHDF1 supports nerve regeneration through effects on the protein translation process in the PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weng et al., 2018</xref>). These observations lead us to hypothesize that m<sup>6</sup>A is critical for axonal regeneration after nerve injury. However, whether other m<sup>6</sup>A modification-associated genes are involved in axonal regeneration, and if so, their underlying mechanisms remain unclear.</p><p>Herein, we screened the roles of several m<sup>6</sup>A modification-associated genes in axon regrowth and identified ALKBH5 as an axon regrowth regulator. ALKBH5 is an evolutionarily conserved RNA m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase, whose m<sup>6</sup>A binding pocket and key residues related to m<sup>6</sup>A recognition were identified. Mutation at the iron ligand residues with H204A or H266A in ALKBH5 showed compromised demethylation activity, with H204A exhibiting complete loss of demethylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). Numerous studies have reported the pivotal functions of ALKBH5 in diverse biological processes and diseases, including those related to neuron dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Du et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ensfelder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yen and Chen, 2021</xref>). However, its function in axonal regeneration remains unknown. In this study, we showed that ALKBH5 inhibition promoted axon regrowth by regulating lipid metabolism via its effects on <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA stability in DRG neurons. Furthermore, ALKBH5 inhibition induces retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival and optic nerve regeneration post-optic nerve crush (ONC) injury. Thus, we propose that rewiring the mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A level may enhance axonal regeneration and that ALKBH5 is a potential target for nerve repair after injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNA m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase ALKBH5 is a candidate regulator of axonal regeneration</title><p>Although a previous study demonstrated that conditional knockout of the METTL3 or YTHDF1 impaired axonal regeneration in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weng et al., 2018</xref>), whether other key proteins involved in m<sup>6</sup>A modification could modulate axonal regeneration remains unknown. To answer this question, we analyzed the expression profile of methyltransferases, demethylases, and m<sup>6</sup>A reader proteins in the lumbar 4 and 5 (L4-5) DRG following sciatic nerve crush (SNC) injury in rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is a classic animal model used for axon injury repair study. QRT-PCR analysis showed that the RNA levels of the genes involved in RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification were not significantly changed following SNC. Given that <italic>Mettl3</italic>, <italic>Wtap</italic>, <italic>Fto</italic>, <italic>Alkbh5</italic>, <italic>Ythdc1</italic>, and <italic>Ythdf1-3</italic> were expressed in DRG with relatively high abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we selected these genes to perform RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated functional screening through an in vitro neurite regrowth assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). We found that the neurite outgrowth induced by cell replating was significantly enhanced by silencing <italic>Alkbh5</italic> or <italic>Ythdf3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). ALKBH5 knockdown exhibited the most dominant phenotype and was chosen for subsequent research. To investigate the potential role of ALKBH5 in axonal regeneration of DRG neurons after SNC, we performed immunofluorescent (IF) staining of rat DRG sections using specific antibodies against ALKBH5. The results showed that ALKBH5 protein was predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm of the soma of DRG neuron and was downregulated following SNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Approximately 51.9% of neurofilament-200 (NF200, a marker for medium/large DRG neurons and myelinated A-fibers) positive neurons were labeled with ALKBH5, constituting 18.5% and 30.5% of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP, a marker for small peptidergic DRG neurons) and isolectin B4 (IB4, a marker for small non-peptidergic DRG neurons)-positive neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). Western blot further validated the markedly reduced expression of ALKBH5 protein in the DRGs following SNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>).

To explore the mechanism by which <italic>Lpin2</italic> is regulated through ALKBH5-induced m<sup>6</sup>A demethylation, we first examined RNA nuclear export by separating the isolated nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs. The results showed no significant difference in the nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of both pre- and mature mRNAs of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA between the control and ALKBH5-manipulated DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that ALKBH5 has no impact on nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of <italic>Lpin2</italic> pre- and mature mRNA. Next, we detected RNA stability by treating DRG neurons with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (Act-D). We found that the half-life of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mature mRNA in ALKBH5-knockdown DRG neurons was significantly shorter than that in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), although there was no significant difference in the level of remaining <italic>Lpin2</italic> pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, the half-life of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mature mRNA was upregulated in neurons with overexpression of wt-ALKBH5, but not of mut-ALKBH5, compared to that in the neurons with EGFP overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). In contrast, there were no significant changes in the <italic>Lpin2</italic> pre mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Previous studies have shown that ALKBH5 regulates mRNA stability through m<sup>6</sup>A sites located in the 3' UTR region near the stop codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). In the present work, by using SRAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>), we predicted the specific m<sup>6</sup>A modification sites of <italic>Lpin2</italic> and identified the GGACA motif with the highest prediction score in the 3' UTR region near the stop codon as the candidate site involved in <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA stability regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). To determine the confident changes of m<sup>6</sup>A levels in putative targets of <italic>Lpin2</italic>, we employed a sensitive and reliable site-specific method SELECT-m<sup>6</sup>A to detect m<sup>6</sup>A in <italic>Lpin2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). With the probe targeting GGACA, we found that the m<sup>6</sup>A level at motif GGACA in <italic>Lpin2</italic> 3' UTR region was significantly increased in ALKBH5 knockdown DRG neurons compared with NC. Moreover, overexpression of wt-ALKBH5, but not mut-ALKBH5, reduced the m<sup>6</sup>A level at motif GGACA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K and L</xref>). These findings strongly support the role of ALKBH5 in reducing the m<sup>6</sup>A level at the m<sup>6</sup>A motif GGACA located in the 3' UTR of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA. Then, we performed a luciferase assay to further elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying m<sup>6</sup>A-mediated regulation of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA stability. The results showed that ALKBH5 knockdown decreased the activity of the luciferase vector containing the 3′UTR of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA, while overexpression of wt-ALKBH5, but not of mut-ALKBH5, increased the luciferase activity. Mutation of the luciferase reporter at the potential m<sup>6</sup>A site (A to C) almost completely reinstated the luciferase activity when ALKBH5 was knocked down or overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M and N</xref>). These data indicate that ALKBH5 upregulates the level of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mature mRNA by increasing its stability through m<sup>6</sup>A in the 3' UTR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ALKBH5 regulates axonal regeneration through lipid metabolism-associated LPIN2</title><p>LPIN2, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase enzyme, plays a central role in the penultimate step of the glycerol phosphate pathway and catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid (PA) to diacylglycerol (DG) in coordination with LPIN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donkor et al., 2007</xref>). Recent reports have indicated the pivotal function of LPIN1 in retina axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2020</xref>); however, the role of LPIN2 in sciatic nerve regeneration remains unknown. We found decreased expression of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and protein following SNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>), indicating that <italic>Lpin2</italic> is an injury-reduced gene. To further explore the direct role of LPIN2 in axonal regeneration, we first examined the function of LPIN2 in neurite outgrowth in vitro and observed that the axon length in DRG neurons with LPIN2 overexpressed was significantly decreased compared to that in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). We also determined the contribution of LPIN2 to axonal regeneration in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

It is worth noting that previous studies have indicated that sciatic nerve regeneration can be hindered by an excess of lipid droplets containing triglycerides. Interfering with LPIN1, a key enzyme in the glycerol phosphate pathway that converts phosphatidic acid to diglyceride, has been shown to enhance axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). To further investigate the link between lipid droplets and LPIN2 in axon regeneration, we examined DRG neurons with overexpressed LPIN2 and found that these neurons had an increased presence of visible lipid droplets containing triglycerides, unlike the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J and K</xref>).

The present study showed that ALKBH5 plays a critical role in axonal regeneration after nerve injury. The ALKBH5 protein level was reduced in DRG neurons following SNC, which enhanced neurite outgrowth in vitro and sciatic nerve regeneration in vivo. Mechanistically, the induced axonal regeneration following ALKBH5 knockdown is driven by downregulated <italic>Lpin2</italic> with increased m<sup>6</sup>A modification on its 3′ UTR.</p><p>Several reports have indicated that RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification plays a critical role in neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haussmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>). For example, m<sup>6</sup>A methylation is important for transcriptional pre-patterning in mammalian cortical neurogenesis and embryonic neural stem cell self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, the m<sup>6</sup>A level is dynamically changed during neurite extension in neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>). The function of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in DRGs has recently gained attention, with one study demonstrating that the increased expression of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase FTO contributes to spinal nerve ligation-induced neuropathic pain in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Another study revealed that conditional knockout of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer <italic>Mettl14</italic>, or reader <italic>Ythdf1</italic> in mice impairs sciatic nerve regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weng et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that m<sup>6</sup>A modification plays significant roles in physiological and pathological processes of DRG neurons. Although the functions of m<sup>6</sup>A writer METTL14 and reader YTHDF1 in axonal regeneration of DRG neurons have been explored, the expression and function of numerous other m<sup>6</sup>A-related proteins remain unclear. Through expressional and functional screening, we identified m<sup>6</sup>A eraser ALKBH5 and reader YTHDF3 as novel regulators of axonal regeneration. In principle, the function of m<sup>6</sup>A modification requires the joint participation of m<sup>6</sup>A writer, reader, and eraser. Weng et al. have reported that deletion of m<sup>6</sup>A writer METTL14 or reader YTHDF1 inhibited axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weng et al., 2018</xref>). In our functional screening, we found that the siRNA targeting <italic>Ythdf1</italic> had no significant effect on the axon regrowth of primary DRG neurons, possibly due to the compensatory effect of other m<sup>6</sup>A reader proteins and the residual YTHDF1 in our screening system. Instead, we identified another reader YTHDF3 as a novel regulator of axonal regeneration. As the low expression level of METTL14 in DRG, we did not test its role in axon regrowth in the present study. Since the role of m<sup>6</sup>A erasers in axon regeneration has not been examined previously, and given its more significant in vitro effect compared with YTHDF3, we focused on the m<sup>6</sup>A eraser ALKBH5 in this study.</p><p>ALKBH5 is an RNA demethylase, widely expressed in adult neurons and decreased during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du et al., 2020</xref>), that regulates mRNA metabolism and translation via m<sup>6</sup>A demethylation of the transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Our results indicate that the ALKBH5 protein level is dramatically reduced in DRG neurons after SNC, and that ALKBH5 inhibition enhances sciatic nerve regeneration. Furthermore, our study revealed that H205 is the conserved site of ALKBH5 for RNA demethylase activity in rats, and the mutation of H205A almost completely diminished the m<sup>6</sup>A modification activity. Similar result were observed for ALKBH5-induced osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2021</xref>), in which the H204A mutation in human ALKBH5 resulted in a complete loss of m<sup>6</sup>A modification activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although <italic>Alkbh5</italic> knockout (KO) mice have been used in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hong et al., 2022</xref>), unfortunately, we were unable to acquire these mice for our present study due to experimental constraints. Furthermore, we originally used rats to study the role of ALKBH5 in DRG neurons. Therefore, the <italic>Alkbh5</italic> KO rats are more suitable in the present research, but these rats are not yet available. Instead, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the gene in rats, as has been employed in other studies investigating axon regeneration after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lindborg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nix et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). However, it should be noted that there are some potential limitations associated with using gene knockdown rather than a gene KO animal to investigate the role of ALKBH5. Firstly, knockdown of ALKBH5 does not result in complete elimination of its expression, but rather reduces its mRNA expression levels to varying degrees depending on the efficiency of the knockdown. Therefore, it is possible that the ALKBH5 protein may still retain some level of function despite the knockdown. Additionally, RNAi may have off-target effects, leading to unintended knockdown of other genes, which could also potentially impact axon regeneration. In contrast, using <italic>Alkbh5</italic> KO animals would allow for a more precise assessment of the role of ALKBH5 in axon regeneration as it completely eliminates its expression without off-target effects. Overall, while our study provides valuable insights into the role of ALKBH5 in axon regeneration, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results due to the limitations associated with using gene knockdown method.</p><p>We also demonstrated that ALKBH5 regulates axonal regeneration in the PNS by modulating, at least in part, LPIN2. LPIN2 is a key player in the canonical pathway that regulates lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eaton et al., 2014</xref>). We found that ALKBH5 knockdown reduced LPIN2 expression via its RNA demethylation activity on m<sup>6</sup>A modification, which inhibited the stability and accelerated the degradation of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA in DRG neurons. We provide convincing evidence that ALKBH5 modulates the <italic>Lpin2</italic> mature mRNA stability through its m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase activity. First, ALKBH5 deficiency drastically reduced the level of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mature mRNA but did not affect its pre-mRNA expression. Second, ALKBH5 inhibition increased the m<sup>6</sup>A level in <italic>Lpin2</italic> mature mRNA; this was reduced by wt-ALKBH5, but not mutant ALKBH5, indicating that this regulation process is m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent. Third, ALKBH5 increased <italic>Lpin2</italic> mature mRNA stability, but not nuclear/cytoplasmic localization, through its H205 site. Lastly, the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mature 3′ UTR is necessary for the sequential action of ALKBH5-induced RNA decay. Thus, we believe that ALKBH5 downregulates the mature <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA through its RNA m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase activity. Injured neurons need a large supply of lipids for cell membrane formation during axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bradke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pfenninger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vance et al., 2000</xref>). Yang et al. have demonstrated that lipid metabolism plays a critical role in axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). As LPIN2 is a master regulator of lipid metabolism, the induced axonal regeneration ability of the ALKBH5-inhibited animals in this study may be attributed to the appropriate lipid metabolism in DRG neurons. The retention of the lipid droplets was observed in LPIN2 overexpressed neurons, and the rescue experiment indicated that forced expression of LPIN2 largely impaired the axonal regeneration induced by ALKBH5 deficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that rewiring neuronal lipid metabolism during axonal regeneration is regulated by RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification, which may serve as a therapeutic target for nerve injury repair.</p><p>In contrast to the observations in DRG neurons, ALKBH5 expression was unchanged in the RGCs following ONC, which may partially contribute to the different regenerative abilities between neurons in the PNS and CNS. Previous studies have reported that the methyltransferase METTL14 is essential for retinal photoreceptor survival, while inhibition of m<sup>6</sup>A demethylases FTO supports the survival of dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Selberg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that m<sup>6</sup>A plays important roles in neuronal survival. Consistent with these results, we revealed that ALKBH5 knockdown promotes RGC survival. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report that manipulating m<sup>6</sup>A-related proteins could induce axonal regeneration in the CNS. However, the underlying mechanisms need further investigations.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified ALKBH5 as a regulator of axonal regeneration following nerve injury and demonstrated that injury-induced ALKBH5 inhibition decreased the LPIN2 expression through increased m<sup>6</sup>A in the 3′ UTR of <italic>Lpin2</italic>, thus inhibiting the formation of lipid droplets and further promoting axonal regeneration. Our study suggests that blocking ALKBH5 has potential clinical application in neuronal injury repair both in the PNS and CNS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Alkbh5</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene ID: 303193</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>R. norvegicus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Lpin2</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene ID: 316737</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK-293T</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-3216</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV2/8-CMV bGlobin-eGFP-U6-shRNA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OBiO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Express control shRNA in DRG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV2/8-CMV bGlobin-eGFP-U6-<italic>Alkbh5</italic> shRNA1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OBiO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Express <italic>Alkbh5</italic> shRNA-1 in DRG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV2/8-CMV bGlobin-eGFP-U6-<italic>Alkbh5</italic> shRNA2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OBiO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Express <italic>Alkbh5</italic> shRNA-2 in DRG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV2/8-CMV-3xFLAG-P2A-mNeonGreen-tWPA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OBiO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Express EGFP in DRG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV2/8-CMV-LPIN2-3xFLAG-P2A-mNeonGreen-tWPA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OBiO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Express LPIN2 in DRG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV2/8-hSyn-EGFP-WPRE-hGH polyA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BrianVTA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Express EGFP in DRG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV2/8-hSyn-ALKBH5-EGFP-WPRE-hGH polyA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BrianVTA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Express wild type rat ALKBH5 in DRG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV2/8-hSyn-ALKBH5(H205D)-EGFP-WPRE-hGH polyA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BrianVTA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Express mutant rat ALKBH5 in DRG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV2/2-CMV bGlobin-eGFP-U6-shRNA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OBiO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Express control shRNA in RGC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV2/2-CMV bGlobin-eGFP-U6-<italic>Alkbh5</italic> shRNA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OBiO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Express <italic>Alkbh5</italic> shRNA in RGC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-ALKBH5 (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# ab195377;

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor and Joseph Gleeson as the Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ki-Jun Yoon (Reviewer #1) and Benjamin Wolozin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The Editors have separated the comments into essential revisions, which we request you to fully address to include additional experiments that could take up to a few months to complete, as well as appended the full comments of the reviewers below that include many suggestions and criticisms that we request you to address in the text to better define the potential weaknesses and limitations of the interpretations. You will see that the 3 reviewers were somewhat mixed in their level of enthusiasm. In particular, Reviewer 2 is more critical. The reviewers have discussed each other's reviews and considered that a revision should be ready for resubmission within a relatively short timeframe.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide quantitative information on m6A in the predicted m6A sites with a more accurate method than RIP-qPCR. This request derives from the reviewer's comment that, in the literature, putative ALKBH5 targets are difficult to validate, and although many have been suggested, there remains some debate about stoichiometry. Reviewers would like to have more certainty that the ALKBH5 deficient conditions result in confident changes in m6A levels in putative targets, and in levels of the mRNA.</p><p>2) Please discuss the potential limitations of the study in the reliance on gene knockdown compared with using a gene knockout mouse for studies on the role of ALKBH5.</p><p>3) Please provide better justification for the selection of LPIN2, and clarify how the potential m6A sites were selected, particularly as this is a GGACA site whereas most occur at GGACU sites.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a fine and well-conducted study with potential therapeutic applications. Most of the conclusions were well supported by in vivo and in vitro experiments, but several questions remained to clarify some critical issues. The authors majorly focus on the role of ALKBH5 and m6A-dependent Lpin2 mRNA stability during injury-induced axon regeneration but somewhat neglect the upstream and downstream mechanisms of this process. Several suggestions are listed below.</p><p>– In Figure 1E-G, the expression level of ALKBH5 after sciatic nerve crush is reduced at a very late time point, around 72 hrs after injury. What is the molecular basis of this delayed response on the ALKBH5 expression?</p><p>– Authors described that ALKBH5 does not affect Lpin2 mRNA subcellular localization, but they only examined nuclear/cytoplasmic localization, not other subcellular compartments, including synapse, axon, and cytoplasmic RNA granules. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that ALKBH5 does not affect Lpin2 mRNA nuclear/cytoplasmic localization.</p><p>– Lipid metabolism signaling is crucial for axon regeneration whereas triglyceride and phospholipids are crucial factors for axon regeneration. In Figure 6J, the authors found that LPIN2 overexpression resulted in increased lipid droplets with triglyceride, which require additional explanation for the link between decreased regeneration shown in Figure 6G and Figure 6J.</p><p>– Although the authors showed knockdown of YTHDF3 enhanced the neurite outgrowth in Figure 1C-D, it was not explained at all how YTHDF3 regulates axon regeneration. Especially, although the authors suggest that m6A-tag in the 3'UTR reduced the stability of Lpin2 mRNA, it has been previously reported that YTHDF3 facilitates rapid mRNA degradation (PMID: 28106072; PMID: 32492408). It is contradictory that both an m6A eraser and an m6A reader limit the axon regeneration through mRNA degradation in the same direction. What is the exact function of YTHDF3 in the context of axonal regeneration?</p><p>– There are some recent reports on selective ALKBH5 inhibitors (PMID: 35384315, PMID: 34141055). To emphasize the therapeutic potential of modulating ALKBH5 function to enhance axon regeneration, it will be very helpful to test ALKBH5 inhibitors on the condition of axonal injury in vivo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript seeks to identify a role for m6A pathway proteins in axonal regeneration. Based on a screen of a small number of m6A pathway genes, they identify ALKBH5 as potentially having a role. However, the data as presented are highly preliminary and unconvincing. Improper techniques are used throughout. Experiments to test the central idea about the role of ALKBH5 are poorly executed and strangely do not involve the available ALKBH5 knockout mice. The proposed mechanism is not based on a proper transcriptome-wide mapping of m6A to identify ALKBH5 target mRNAs. The effect of ALKBH5 on m6A stoichiometry in the putative Lpin2 target mRNA is not measured. Overall, this manuscript does not make a compelling scientific case that ALKBH5 has a role in axonal regeneration and I doubt that any of the major conclusions will turn out to be correct.</p><p>1. One of the major problems with this manuscript is that Figure 1 uses a single siRNA to knock down m6A pathway genes such as ALKBH5. SiRNA is well known to have off-target effects. The Ythdf3 result likely is an artifact and explains its lack of reproducibility. But in the case of ALKBH5, It is puzzling that the authors have used this siRNA approach when ALKBH5 knockout mice are readily available. These animals appear completely neurological normal. They only have defects in sperm development. This is because ALKBH5 is primarily expressed in reproductive tissues. This implies that ALKBH5 is unlikely to have an essential role in normal developmental axonal growth and axon pathfinding. Most proteins involved in axon regeneration have roles in axonal growth during development. However, this may not always be the case, so it is valid to determine if it has a specific role in axonal regeneration, the authors should have used these knockout mice. The knockdown results look fairly unimpressive in terms of their ability to lower ALKBH5, which further makes me think that the effects of the knockdown constructs are nonspecific. The use of knockouts is routine for these types of studies.</p><p>2. The authors describe the localization of ALKBH5 in DRG neurons and report that its expression goes down after nerve crush. They described the localization as being in the cytoplasm. This is clearly an artifact. ALKBH5 is a nuclear protein. It is possible that there is a very unusual localization in this subset of sensory neurons. Therefore, yet again, the authors have failed to use the appropriate controls. The knockout mouse would have allowed them to establish that the antibody staining that they are looking at indeed represents ALKBH5. The cytoplasmic localization of ALKBH5, if correct, would imply that ALKBH5 could demethylate cytosolic mRNAs which goes against current thinking based on its nuclear localization seen by most others when using validated antibodies.</p><p>3. The second part of the paper seeks to address whether ALKBH5 mediates its effects in an m6A-dependent manner. This experiment is done improperly. To determine if ALKBH5 has an effect in an m6A-dependent manner, the authors should have looked at METTL3 knockout DRGs, and tested whether their ALKBH5 knockdown still induces axonal growth. METTL3 knockout leads to a loss of the ability to produce m6A in nearly all mRNAs, so ALKBH5 cannot cause an increase in m6A. The experiment that they performed involved overexpression of ALKBH5 and an ALKBH5 that is catalytically inactive. I suspect that they simply observe toxicity associated with overexpression of ALKBH5 and nothing selectively related to axonal growth.</p><p>4. In order to identify the targets of ALKBH5, the authors have failed to properly analyze and identify mRNAs that are controlled by ALKBH5. The proper experiment would be to do a quantitative analysis of m6A in the transcriptome in cells containing normal expression level of ALKBH5, and ALKBH5 knockout. Quantitative methods include assays such as GLORI (for transcriptome-wide methods) or site-specific methods in LPIN2 using methods such as SCARLET. Instead, the authors have looked at gene expression changes and more or less arbitrarily picked a gene that they found interesting since it has been implicated in axon regeneration in other systems. This is a very biased way to identify a target transcript. They say that they examine the m6A modification using MeRIP-qPCR. The problem with this assay is that most transcripts have some degree of methylation and will be identified using this assay. Quantitative measurements of the stoichiometry of m6A at each site are critical. The authors should have reported the exact stoichiometry of m6A at the putative-regulated site in normal cells, and then after ALKBH5 knockdown/knockout. We should see a dramatic change in stoichiometry. Importantly, many people have tried to identify targets of ALKBH5 using quantitative m6A measurements and have found only subtle effects. Therefore, it is particularly important for the authors to clearly document that there is indeed a clear and robust change in the m6A level at a specific site in the putative mediator, Lpin2. The use of gene expression changes is a very indirect method and problematic since there are many indirect effects of ALKBH5 knockdown. Thus, the selection of Lpin2 was improper, and the evidence that Lpin2 is a direct ALKBH5 target is missing.</p><p>5. In the authors' model, ALKBH5 knockdown leads to more m6A on Lpin2 and thus less Lpin2. They believe that ALKBH5 deregulates lipid metabolism to promote axon growth. They should have done experiments to show that ALKBH5 knockdown phenocopies Lpin2 knockdown in terms of the various metabolic and lipid parameters associated with Lpin2 function. I only see experiments in which Lpin2 expression is used to reverse the effects of Alkbh5 knockdown – this can be due to the toxic effects of Lpin2 overexpression. The more relevant experiments on lipid deregulation in ALKBH5 knockdown, which are central to the authors' hypothesis, are not presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85309.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide quantitative information on m6A in the predicted m6A sites with a more accurate method than RIP-qPCR.

We acknowledge the limitations of most m<sup>6</sup>A sequencing methods relying on m<sup>6</sup>A-antibody immunoprecipitation for accurate measurement of m<sup>6</sup>A, which cannot pinpoint the exact location or density of m<sup>6</sup>A modifications within individual transcripts (Wang et al., 2020). Therefore, we agreed with the reviewer's suggestion, and employed a sensitive and reliable site-specific method SELECT-m<sup>6</sup>A to detect m<sup>6</sup>A in <italic>Lpin2</italic> (Liu et al., 2019; Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020; Xu et al., 2021). With the specific probes and primers (Up Probe sequence: <named-content content-type="sequence">tagccagtaccgtagtgcgtgAGTGCCAGCTTCGGGGACTCTG</named-content>; Down Probe sequence: <named-content content-type="sequence">5phos/CCCTGTTCTGGAAAGCAGGTTCCTcagaggctgagtcg ctgcat</named-content>.

Moreover, overexpression of wt-ALKBH5, but not mut-ALKBH5, reduced the m<sup>6</sup>A level at GGACA motif (Figure 5K and L). These findings strongly support the role of ALKBH5 in reducing the m<sup>6</sup>A level at the m<sup>6</sup>A GGACA motif located in the 3' UTR of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please discuss the potential limitations of the study in the reliance on gene knockdown compared with using a gene knockout mouse for studies on the role of ALKBH5.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the editor and reviewers' suggestions and have made revisions to the Discussion section of our manuscript accordingly. In particular, we have expanded upon the limitations of our study in relying on gene knockdown rather than using a gene knockout (KO) animal to investigate the role of ALKBH5 in axon regeneration. Although <italic>Alkbh5</italic> KO mice have been used in previous research (Chen et al., 2023; Han et al., 2021; Hong and Shen, 2022), unfortunately, we were unable to acquire these mice for our present study due to experimental constraints. Furthermore, we have originally used rats to study the role of ALKBH5 in DRG neurons. Therefore, the <italic>Alkbh5</italic> KO rats are more suitable in the present research, but these rats are not yet available. Instead, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the gene in rats, as has been employed in other studies investigating axon regeneration after nerve injury (Lindborg et al., 2021; Nix et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2023).</p><p>However, it should be noted that there are some potential limitations associated with using gene knockdown rather than a gene KO animal to investigate the role of ALKBH5. Firstly, knockdown of ALKBH5 does not result in complete elimination of its expression, but rather reduces its mRNA expression levels to varying degrees depending on the knockdown efficiency. Therefore, it is possible that the ALKBH5 protein may still retain some level of function despite the knockdown. Additionally, RNAi may have off-target effects, leading to unintended knockdown of other genes, which could also potentially impact axon regeneration. In contrast, using <italic>Alkbh5</italic> KO animal would allow for a more precise assessment of the role of ALKBH5 in axon regeneration, as it completely eliminates its expression without off-target effects. Overall, while our study provides valuable insights into the role of ALKBH5 in axon regeneration, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results due to the limitations associated with using gene knockdown method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please provide better justification for the selection of LPIN2, and clarify how the potential m6A sites were selected, particularly as this is a GGACA site whereas most occur at GGACU sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We thanks for the constructive comments. In the present study, we found that quite a few differential expressed genes in ALKBH5-knockdown neurons were enriched in metabolic pathways (Figure 4A). Through examining the expression levels of genes involved in metabolic pathways when ALKBH5 was knocked down, their m<sup>6</sup>A levels after nerve injury in DRG, as well as their effects on axon regrowth in vitro, we identified <italic>Aldh3b1</italic> and <italic>Lpin2</italic> as potential targets of ALKBH5 in regulating axon regeneration. Recent studies have shown that lipid metabolism plays a critical role in neurite outgrowth by supplying the materials for axon extension or regeneration, and that increased lipid droplet storage can impair sciatic nerve regeneration (Tassew et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2020). Interfering with expression of LPIN1, which plays a central role in the penultimate step of the glycerol phosphate pathway and catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diglyceride, can increase axon regeneration. Considering the pivotal role of LPIN2 in lipid metabolism and its more significant regulatory impact on axon regeneration compared to <italic>Aldh3b1</italic>, <italic>Lpin2</italic> was elected as the target for subsequent investigative pursuit.</p><p>The m<sup>6</sup>A consensus sequence has been identified as RR(m<sup>6</sup>A)CH (R=A/G, H=A/C/U) with a terminal U being a dominant part (Meyer et al., 2012). Although the GGACU motif occurs in 42% of all mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A peaks, the GGACA also represents a large proportion (Dominissini et al., 2012). In the present study, we found that ALKBH5 impacted the <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA stability (Figure 5). Previous studies indicated that ALKBH5 regulated the mRNA stability via the m<sup>6</sup>A sites in the 3' UTR region near the stop codon (Tang et al., 2018). To determine the exact ALKBH5 target site, we used SRAMP (http://www.cuilab.cn/sramp/) to predict m<sup>6</sup>A sites of <italic>Lpin2</italic>, and chose GGACA motif as the potential m<sup>6</sup>A site with the highest prediction score in the 3' UTR region near the stop codon (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). Next, we designed specific probes and primers to determine the m<sup>6</sup>A level in that motif with the SELECT-m<sup>6</sup>A method (Figure 5K and L), which is a single-base extension and ligation qPCR amplification technology. Our results confirmed that ALKBH5 reduced m<sup>6</sup>A methylation at the m<sup>6</sup>A motif GGACA located near the stop codon in the 3' UTR of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a fine and well-conducted study with potential therapeutic applications.

The present study has revealed that the level of ALKBH5 protein in DRG is significantly reduced at day 3 after sciatic nerve injury, with a mild decrease observed at day 1. As previously reported, the expression levels of regeneration-associated proteins may be changed at a late time point. For example, SPRR1A, a well-known regeneration-associated protein, is not detectable 1 day after injury but is significantly upregulated by day 4 and reaches peak levels 1-2 weeks after sciatic nerve injury (Bonilla et al., 2002). These findings suggest that ALKBH5 may be an axon regeneration-associated protein rather than an injury response protein that exhibits rapid expression changes during the early stages of nerve injury.</p><p>Recent research has indicated that miRNAs modulate the expression of <italic>Alkbh5</italic> by interacting with the 3' UTR region of its mRNA (Han et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). In the present study, we observed a significant reduction in the protein level of ALKBH5 after sciatic nerve injury (Figure 1E-H), while the mRNA level remained unchanged (Figure 1B). This suggests that post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>Alkbh5</italic> may be involved. Using TargetScan (https://www.targetscan.org/), we predicted several potential miRNAs, including miR-221, that could be involved in regulating <italic>Alkbh5</italic> expression in the post-transcriptional level (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Since miR-221 was significantly increased in DRG after rat sciatic nerve injury in our previous work (Yu et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2011), we hypothesize that miR-221 may play a role in the delayed response of the ALKBH5 expression following injury.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The prediction result for miR-221 binding with the 3'UTR region of <italic>Alkbh5</italic>.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85309-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Authors described that ALKBH5 does not affect Lpin2 mRNA subcellular localization, but they only examined nuclear/cytoplasmic localization, not other subcellular compartments, including synapse, axon, and cytoplasmic RNA granules.

We agree that phospholipids play a critical role in neurite outgrowth, as they serve as essential building blocks for membrane formation during axon extension or regeneration (Bradke et al., 2012; Tassew et al., 2014). It is worth noting that previous studies have indicated that sciatic nerve regeneration can be hindered by an excess of lipid droplets containing triglycerides. Interfering with LPIN1, a key enzyme in the glycerol phosphate pathway that converts phosphatidic acid to diglyceride, has been shown to enhance axon regeneration (Yang et al., 2020). In the present work, we found that overexpression of LPIN2 decreased axon regeneration (Figure 6G). To further investigate the link between lipid droplets and LPIN2 in axon regeneration, we examined DRG neurons with overexpressed LPIN2 and found that these neurons had an increased presence of visible lipid droplets containing triglycerides, unlike the control group (Figure 6J and K). Therefore, our findings suggest that LPIN2 plays an important role in regulating axon regeneration by modulating lipid metabolism. We have now acknowledged this explanation in the Result part.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Although the authors showed knockdown of YTHDF3 enhanced the neurite outgrowth in Figure 1C-D, it was not explained at all how YTHDF3 regulates axon regeneration.

This observation suggests that ALKBH5 and YTHDF3 may target different mRNAs in regulating axon growth of DRG neurons. Previous studies have reported that YTHDF3 can promote both mRNA degradation and translation (Li et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2015; Zaccara and Jaffrey, 2020), indicating that it may facilitate degradation of mRNAs that enhance axon regeneration or translation of mRNAs that inhibit axon regeneration.

As suggested, we tried to analyze the effect of two SAI (Z56957173 (Sabnis, 2021) and Z52453295 (Takahashi et al., 2022)) on axon regeneration of DRG neurons. We first performed the CCK-8 assay to determine the effect of the SAI on cell viability to exclude the possible cell toxicity. The results showed that no more than 5 μM Z56957173 or no more than 20 μM Z52453295 has no toxicity to DRG neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A, B). Next, we chose two dose of the two SAI respectively to perform the in vitro neurite outgrowth assay, and observed that 10 μM Z52453295 or 0.5 μM Z56957173 presented the significant promotion effect on axon growth (Figure 3—figure supplement 3C, D). Furthermore, we examined the in vivo effect of Z52453295 on sciatic nerve regeneration through intrathecal injection with a dose course. The results showed that Z52453295 significantly increased the length of the maximum regenerated axon at 6.25 and 25 mM after SNC (Figure 3—figure supplement 3E, F). These results indicated that ALKBH5 inhibition by SAI promoted axon regeneration after nerve injury, and suggested the therapeutic potential of modulating ALKBH5 function with SAI in nerve injury repair.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript seeks to identify a role for m6A pathway proteins in axonal regeneration. Based on a screen of a small number of m6A pathway genes, they identify ALKBH5 as potentially having a role. However, the data as presented are highly preliminary and unconvincing. Improper techniques are used throughout. Experiments to test the central idea about the role of ALKBH5 are poorly executed and strangely do not involve the available ALKBH5 knockout mice. The proposed mechanism is not based on a proper transcriptome-wide mapping of m6A to identify ALKBH5 target mRNAs. The effect of ALKBH5 on m6A stoichiometry in the putative Lpin2 target mRNA is not measured. Overall, this manuscript does not make a compelling scientific case that ALKBH5 has a role in axonal regeneration and I doubt that any of the major conclusions will turn out to be correct.</p></disp-quote><p>We deeply appreciate this reviewer's professional comments on our manuscript. According to the suggestions, we made extensive corrections to our original draft, and the detailed responses are listed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. One of the major problems with this manuscript is that Figure 1 uses a single siRNA to knock down m6A pathway genes such as ALKBH5. SiRNA is well known to have off-target effects. The Ythdf3 result likely is an artifact and explains its lack of reproducibility. But in the case of ALKBH5, It is puzzling that the authors have used this siRNA approach when ALKBH5 knockout mice are readily available. These animals appear completely neurological normal. They only have defects in sperm development. This is because ALKBH5 is primarily expressed in reproductive tissues. This implies that ALKBH5 is unlikely to have an essential role in normal developmental axonal growth and axon pathfinding. Most proteins involved in axon regeneration have roles in axonal growth during development. However, this may not always be the case, so it is valid to determine if it has a specific role in axonal regeneration, the authors should have used these knockout mice. The knockdown results look fairly unimpressive in terms of their ability to lower ALKBH5, which further makes me think that the effects of the knockdown constructs are nonspecific. The use of knockouts is routine for these types of studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate this reviewer's comments. <italic>Alkbh5</italic> KO mice have been used in previous research (Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023; Han <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021; Hong and Shen, 2022). Interestingly, although the <italic>Alkbh5</italic> KO mice display normal development kidney or blood vessel, recent studies indicated that inhibition of ALKBH5 attenuates I/R-induced renal injury in male mice and loss of m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase ALKBH5 promotes post-ischemic angiogenesis (Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023; Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021), suggesting that although ALKBH5 has no obvious effects on tissue development, it may play important roles after tissue injury. We agree that using <italic>Alkbh5</italic> KO animal would allow for a more precise assessment of the role of ALKBH5 in axon regeneration, as it completely eliminates its expression. Unfortunately, we were unable to acquire these mice for our present study due to experimental constraints. Furthermore, we have originally used rats to study the role of ALKBH5 in DRG neurons. Therefore, the <italic>Alkbh5</italic> KO rats are more suitable in the present research, but these rats are not yet available. Instead, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the gene in rats, as has been employed in other studies investigating axon regeneration after nerve injury (Lindborg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021; Nix <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014; Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023). In order to increase the credibility of our experimental results, we added an additional siRNA for each gene on top of the original single siRNA (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). This allowed us to examine the function of each gene using two different siRNAs, respectively. Through mutual verification of these results, the experiment demonstrated that downregulation of ALKBH5 can indeed significantly promote axon regeneration (Figure 1C, D).</p><p>However, it should be noted that there are some potential limitations associated with using gene knockdown rather than a gene KO mouse to investigate the role of ALKBH5. Firstly, knockdown of ALKBH5 does not result in complete elimination of its expression, but rather reduces its mRNA expression levels to varying degrees depending on the knockdown efficiency. Therefore, it is possible that the ALKBH5 protein may still retain some level of function despite the knockdown. Additionally, RNAi may have off-target effects, leading to unintended knockdown of other genes, which could also potentially impact axon regeneration. Overall, while our study provides valuable insights into the role of ALKBH5 in axon regeneration, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results due to the limitations associated with using gene knockdown method. We have now acknowledged these potential limitations in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors describe the localization of ALKBH5 in DRG neurons and report that its expression goes down after nerve crush. They described the localization as being in the cytoplasm. This is clearly an artifact. ALKBH5 is a nuclear protein. It is possible that there is a very unusual localization in this subset of sensory neurons. Therefore, yet again, the authors have failed to use the appropriate controls. The knockout mouse would have allowed them to establish that the antibody staining that they are looking at indeed represents ALKBH5. The cytoplasmic localization of ALKBH5, if correct, would imply that ALKBH5 could demethylate cytosolic mRNAs which goes against current thinking based on its nuclear localization seen by most others when using validated antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for raising this concern. We totally agree that the knockout mice would help confirm the localization of ALKBH5 in DRG neurons in mice. However, in the present study, to investigate the expression of ALKBH5 in DRG neurons of rats, we chose a rabbit monoclonal [EPR18958] antibody against rat ALKBH5, which is knockout validated according to the manufacturer and used in rats by several other studies (Qin et al., 2021; Song and Wang, 2020; Xu et al., 2020). It has been reported that while ALKBH5 is functional as a nuclear protein in some cases, it is largely cytoplasmic located in certain cell types (Yu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017), and is detected in the cytoplasm of diverse neurons during brain development (Du et al., 2020). Moreover, we also tested the antibody we used in a positive control sample (kidney) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and found that ALKBH5 was largely expressed in the cytoplasm (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Together with the observation in the present study (Figure 1E), these results indicate the cytoplasmic localization of ALKBH5 in certain cell types. Interestingly, recent research has revealed that the RNA demethylase FTO localized within the nucleus and cytoplasm varies between cell types, and the cytoplasmic FTO can demethylate a portion of m<sup>6</sup>A of mRNAs in cytoplasm (Wei et al., 2018). These results suggest that the cytoplasmic ALKBH5 may also possess demethylate activity on cytoplasmic mRNAs in certain cell types.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Kidney sections from adult rat stained with ALKBH5 antibody (Abcam, Cat# ab195377) (green) and DAPI (blue); scale bar: 25 μm.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85309-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The second part of the paper seeks to address whether ALKBH5 mediates its effects in an m6A-dependent manner. This experiment is done improperly. To determine if ALKBH5 has an effect in an m6A-dependent manner, the authors should have looked at METTL3 knockout DRGs, and tested whether their ALKBH5 knockdown still induces axonal growth. METTL3 knockout leads to a loss of the ability to produce m6A in nearly all mRNAs, so ALKBH5 cannot cause an increase in m6A. The experiment that they performed involved overexpression of ALKBH5 and an ALKBH5 that is catalytically inactive. I suspect that they simply observe toxicity associated with overexpression of ALKBH5 and nothing selectively related to axonal growth.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comments and ingenious experiment design. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain <italic>Mettl3</italic> or <italic>Alkbh5</italic> KO mice in our laboratory due to restricted experimental conditions. However, we did observe an increase in axon regeneration in DRG neurons following ALKBH5 knockdown by two siRNAs or two AAVs expressing <italic>Alkbh5</italic>-shRNA respectively. When we overexpressed the wild-type ALKBH5 but not the mutant ALKBH5 in DRG neurons by AAVs with the same titer, we observed impaired neurite outgrowth. Additionally, we conducted toxicity tests on ALKBH5 knockdown and overexpression AAVs used in this experiment, and found no significant toxicity difference in the DRG neurons among different groups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>). Furthermore, SELECT-m<sup>6</sup>A showed that the m<sup>6</sup>A level at GGACA motif in <italic>Lpin2</italic> 3' UTR region was significantly increased in ALKBH5 knockdown DRG neurons compared with NC (Figure 5K). And overexpression of wt-ALKBH5, but not mut-ALKBH5, reduced the m<sup>6</sup>A level at GGACA motif (Figure 5L). Altogether, we believe that ALKBH5 regulates axon regeneration in an m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent manner.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>The viability of cultured DRG neurons infected with various AAVs.</title><p>(A, and B) DRG neurons were infected with various AAVs (Control, wt-ALKBH5, mut-ALKBH5 or NC, KD1, KD2) for 16 hours, cultured for 7 days and replated for another 16 hours.

In order to identify the targets of ALKBH5, the authors have failed to properly analyze and identify mRNAs that are controlled by ALKBH5. The proper experiment would be to do a quantitative analysis of m6A in the transcriptome in cells containing normal expression level of ALKBH5, and ALKBH5 knockout. Quantitative methods include assays such as GLORI (for transcriptome-wide methods) or site-specific methods in LPIN2 using methods such as SCARLET. Instead, the authors have looked at gene expression changes and more or less arbitrarily picked a gene that they found interesting since it has been implicated in axon regeneration in other systems. This is a very biased way to identify a target transcript. They say that they examine the m6A modification using MeRIP-qPCR. The problem with this assay is that most transcripts have some degree of methylation and will be identified using this assay. Quantitative measurements of the stoichiometry of m6A at each site are critical. The authors should have reported the exact stoichiometry of m6A at the putative-regulated site in normal cells, and then after ALKBH5 knockdown/knockout. We should see a dramatic change in stoichiometry. Importantly, many people have tried to identify targets of ALKBH5 using quantitative m6A measurements and have found only subtle effects. Therefore, it is particularly important for the authors to clearly document that there is indeed a clear and robust change in the m6A level at a specific site in the putative mediator, Lpin2. The use of gene expression changes is a very indirect method and problematic since there are many indirect effects of ALKBH5 knockdown. Thus, the selection of Lpin2 was improper, and the evidence that Lpin2 is a direct ALKBH5 target is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks very much for these comments and suggestions. In the present study, we found that quite a few differential expressed genes in ALKBH5-knockdown neurons were enriched in metabolic pathways (Figure 4A). Through examining the expression levels of genes involved in metabolic pathways when ALKBH5 was knocked down, their m<sup>6</sup>A levels after nerve injury in DRG, as well as their effects on axon regrowth in vitro, we identified <italic>Aldh3b1</italic> and <italic>Lpin2</italic> as potential targets of ALKBH5 in regulating axon regeneration. Recent studies have shown that lipid metabolism plays a critical role in neurite outgrowth by supplying the materials for axon extension or regeneration, and that increased lipid droplet storage can impair sciatic nerve regeneration (Tassew <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014; Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). Interfering with expression of LPIN1, which plays a central role in the penultimate step of the glycerol phosphate pathway and catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diglyceride, can increase axon regeneration. Considering the pivotal role of LPIN2 in lipid metabolism and its more significant regulatory impact on axon regeneration compared to <italic>Aldh3b1</italic>, <italic>Lpin2</italic> was elected as the target for subsequent investigative pursuit.</p><p>We acknowledge the limitations of most m<sup>6</sup>A sequencing methods relying on m<sup>6</sup>A-antibody immunoprecipitation for accurate measurement of m<sup>6</sup>A, which cannot pinpoint the exact location or density of m<sup>6</sup>A modifications within individual transcripts (Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). Therefore, we agreed with the reviewer's suggestion, and employed a sensitive and reliable site-specific method SELECT-m<sup>6</sup>A to detect specific m<sup>6</sup>A modification in <italic>Lpin2</italic> (Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019; Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020; Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). With the specific probes and primers (Up Probe sequence: <named-content content-type="sequence">tagccagtaccgtagtgcgtgAGTGCCAGCTTCGGGGACTCTG</named-content>; Down Probe sequence: <named-content content-type="sequence">5phos/CCCTGTTCTGGAAAGCAGGTTCCTcagaggctgagtcgctgcat</named-content>. Forward primer: <named-content content-type="sequence">TACAGATGAAGACCCAGGAG</named-content>; Reverse primer: <named-content content-type="sequence">TGAGTGGTGGCTTAGGAA</named-content>), we found that the m<sup>6</sup>A level at motif GGACA in <italic>Lpin2</italic> 3' UTR region was significantly increased in ALKBH5 knockdown DRG neurons compared with NC. Moreover, overexpression of wt-ALKBH5, but not mut-ALKBH5, reduced the m<sup>6</sup>A level at motif GGACA (Figure 5K and L). These findings strongly support the role of ALKBH5 in reducing the m<sup>6</sup>A level at the motif GGACA located in the 3' UTR of <italic>Lpin2</italic> mRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the authors' model, ALKBH5 knockdown leads to more m6A on Lpin2 and thus less Lpin2. They believe that ALKBH5 deregulates lipid metabolism to promote axon growth. They should have done experiments to show that ALKBH5 knockdown phenocopies Lpin2 knockdown in terms of the various metabolic and lipid parameters associated with Lpin2 function. I only see experiments in which Lpin2 expression is used to reverse the effects of Alkbh5 knockdown – this can be due to the toxic effects of Lpin2 overexpression. The more relevant experiments on lipid deregulation in ALKBH5 knockdown, which are central to the authors' hypothesis, are not presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this meaningful comment. It was reported that phospholipids play a critical role in neurite outgrowth, as they serve as essential building blocks for membrane formation during axon extension or regeneration (Bradke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012; Tassew <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014). It is worth noting that previous studies have indicated that sciatic nerve regeneration can be hindered by an excess of lipid droplets containing triglycerides. Interfering with LPIN1, a key enzyme in the glycerol phosphate pathway that converts phosphatidic acid to diglyceride, has been shown to enhance axon regeneration (Yang et al., 2020). In the present work, we found that overexpression of LPIN2 decreased axon regeneration (Figure 6G). To further investigate the link between lipid droplets and LPIN2 in axon regeneration, we examined DRG neurons with overexpressed LPIN2 and found that these neurons had an increased presence of visible lipid droplets containing triglycerides, unlike the control group (Figure 6J and K). Therefore, our findings suggest that LPIN2 plays an important role in regulating axon regeneration by modulating lipid metabolism. And the subsequent rescue experiment further supported that ALKBH5-deficiency induces axonal regeneration through LPIN2 following SNC. Additionally, we conducted toxicity tests on LPIN2 overexpression AAVs used in this experiment, and found no significant toxicity difference in the DRG neurons between different groups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>The viability of cultured DRG neurons infected with AAVs overexpressing LPIN2.</title><p>DRG neurons were infected with EGFP or LPIN2 AAVs for 16 hours, cultured for 7 days and replated for another 16 hours.
