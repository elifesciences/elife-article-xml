Targeting cells driving matrix remodeling could be a promising avenue for IPF treatment. Analysis of transcriptomic database identified the mesenchymal transcription factor PRRX1 as upregulated in IPF. PRRX1, strongly expressed by lung fibroblasts, was regulated by a TGF-β/PGE2 balance in vitro in control and IPF human lung fibroblasts, while IPF fibroblast-derived matrix increased <italic>PRRX1</italic> expression in a PDGFR-dependent manner in control ones. PRRX1 inhibition decreased human lung fibroblast proliferation by downregulating the expression of S phase cyclins. PRRX1 inhibition also impacted TGF-β driven myofibroblastic differentiation by inhibiting SMAD2/3 phosphorylation through phosphatase PPM1A upregulation and TGFBR2 downregulation, leading to TGF-β response global decrease. Finally, targeted inhibition of <italic>Prrx1</italic> attenuated fibrotic remodeling in vivo with intra-tracheal antisense oligonucleotides in bleomycin mouse model of lung fibrosis and ex vivo using human and mouse precision-cut lung slices. Our results identified PRRX1 as a key mesenchymal transcription factor during lung fibrogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fibrosis</kwd><kwd>lung</kwd><kwd>fibroblasts</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>TGF beta pathway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JCJC ANR-16-CE14-00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mailleux</surname><given-names>Arnaud A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008593</institution-id><institution>European Respiratory Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERS-LTRF 2015 - 4476</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Froidure</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDT2021060129750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Homps-Legrand</surname><given-names>Méline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDM41320</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Justet</surname><given-names>Aurélien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibition of a single fibroblast-associated transcription factor, namely Paired-related Homeobox Protein 1 (PRRX1), is sufficient to dampen lung fibrogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic remodeling is a key feature of many Human diseases associated with aging. In particular, chronic respiratory diseases, including lung fibrosis, are a major and increasing burden in terms of morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common form of pulmonary fibrosis. IPF is defined as a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause. IPF patients have an overall median survival of 3–5 years<italic>,</italic> although current antifibrotics (pirfenidone and nintedanib) slow lung function decline and may improve survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Froidure et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>According to the current paradigm, IPF results from progressive alterations of alveolar epithelial cells leading to the recruitment of mesenchymal cells to the alveolar regions of the lung with secondary deposition of extracellular matrix, and destruction of the normal lung structure and physiology. IPF develops in a susceptible, aging individual and is promoted by interaction with environmental agents such as inhaled particles, tobacco smoke, inhaled pollutants, viral and bacterial agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Froidure et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In any given cell, a set of transcription factors is expressed and works in concert to govern cellular homeostasis and function. Dysregulation of transcriptional networks may therefore account to aberrant phenotypic changes observed in lung fibrosis, as reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Froidure et al., 2020</xref>. Among the multifaceted tissue cellular ‘ecosystem’, cells of mesenchymal origin such as fibroblasts are the main cellular components responsible for tissue remodeling during normal and pathological lung tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez and Eickelberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, targeting master transcription factors preferentially expressed in fibroblast could be a promising avenue for IPF treatment.</p><p>Using an in silico approach, we identified the ‘Paired Related Homeobox Protein-1’ (<italic>PRRX1</italic>) gene as a potential candidate for transcriptional regulation differently modulated in IPF compared to control lungs. The <italic>PRRX1</italic> mRNA generates by alternative splicing two proteins, <italic>PRRX1a</italic> (216 aa) and <italic>PRRX1b</italic> (245 aa) that differ at their C-terminal parts. Functional in vitro studies suggested that PRRX1a promoted transcriptional activation whereas PRRX1b may act rather as a transcriptional repressor in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Norris and Kern, 2001</xref>).</p><p><italic>Prrx1</italic> is implicated in the regulation of mesenchymal cell fate during embryonic development. PRRX1 is essential for fetal development as <italic>Prrx1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice present severe malformation of craniofacial, limb, and vertebral skeletal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martin et al., 1995</xref>). <italic>Prrx1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice also display hypoplastic lungs with severe vascularization defects and die soon after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ihida-Stansbury et al., 2004</xref>). PRRX1 function is not restricted to embryogenesis. It has been also shown that PRRX1 was a stemness regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shimozaki et al., 2013</xref>), involved in adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2013</xref>), epithelial tumor metastasis and pancreatic regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fazilaty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ocaña et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reichert et al., 2013</xref>) as well as liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2017</xref>). PRRX1 transcription factors are also at the center of the network coordinating dermal fibroblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomaru et al., 2014</xref>). A <italic>Prrx1</italic>-positive fibroblast subpopulation was also characterized as pro-fibrotic in the mouse ventral dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Currie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leavitt et al., 2020</xref>) as well as modulating mouse skin inflammation during atopic dermatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ko et al., 2022</xref>). This <italic>Prrx1</italic> mesenchymal subpopulation was also recently involved in scarless repair within the oral mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ko et al., 2023</xref>) in mice. In the adult mouse lung, <italic>Prrx1</italic> mRNA expression was associated with a sub-population of matrix fibroblast using single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xie et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether and how PRRX1 plays a functional role in lung fibrogenesis still remains elusive. Given its central position in fibroblast transcriptional network, we hypothesized that PRRX1 transcription factors are important drivers of the fibroblast phenotype in IPF, promoting the development/progression of fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of <italic>PRRX1</italic> isoforms as mesenchymal transcription factors associated with IPF</title><p>Since mesenchymal cells are thought to be one of the major effector cells during fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez and Eickelberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>), we sought to identify mesenchymal transcription factors associated with IPF in patients. We screened three curated publicly available transcript microarray databases from NCBI GEO (GDS1252, GDS4279, GDS3951) for transcription factor expression in IPF and control whole lung samples. Among the 210 common genes upregulated at the mRNA level in all three IPF lung datasets compared to their respective control ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), 12 genes were annotated as transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) after gene ontology analysis.

Interestingly, amongst their multiple targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez and Eickelberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>), Imatinib and Nintedanib are known to both inhibit PDGFR. Treatment with a specific PDGFR inhibitor (PDGFR V <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Furuta et al., 2006</xref>) at the nanomolar range (10 nM) did confirm the PDGFR-dependency of this effect of IPF fibroblast-derived ECM on <italic>PRRX1a</italic> and –<italic>1b</italic> mRNA levels in control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

(<bold>B</bold>) Model of PRRX1 function in lung fibroblasts at steady state and after TGF-β1 driven myofibroblastic differentiation. Left panel: in complete growth medium, PRRX1 TFs influence cell cycle progression by regulating key factors associated with cycle progression during the G1 and S phases (KI67, Cyclin A2 and E2). PRRX1 was detected in the promoter regions of those genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). In presence of PRRX1, the expression of the serine / threonine phosphatase PPM1A is downregulating (PRRX1 TFs binding to PPM1A promoter region was demonstrated by ChIP) and TGFBR2 expression is also maintained. Thus, TGF-β1 responsiveness and the phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 may be therefore promoted by PRRX1 TFs in lung fibroblasts at steady state. Right panel: TGF-β1 stimulation of lung fibroblasts will trigger their differentiation into myofibroblasts, concomitantly with a downregulation of PRRX1 TFs at late time point (48 hr).

These findings may suggest that broad phenotypical changes are associated with <italic>Prrx1</italic> knockdown in lung fibroblasts.

TGF-β1 induced PRRX1 inhibition in lung fibroblasts could also correlate with progressive proliferation loss during the differentiation process.</p><p>Overall, we propose that PRRX1 TFs in the lung would maintain mesenchymal cells in a proliferative state but would also act as enablers to promote full myofibroblastic differentiation in response to pro-fibrotic cues such as TGF-β1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Inhibition of the mesenchymal PRRX1 transcription factor is sufficient to dampen lung fibrosis in vivo</title><p>To inhibit PRRX1 TFs in the lung, we used a LNA-modified ASO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Soifer et al., 2012</xref>) targeting both mouse and Human isoforms. Endotracheal administration of this ASO from day 7 in the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model allowed us to inhibit locally and efficiently <italic>Prrx1</italic> TFs during the active fibrosis phase in a ‘curative’ protocol. LNA-modified ASOs are protected from nuclease-mediated degradation, which significantly improves their stability and prolongs their activity in vivo. In comparison to earlier generations of ASO modifications, they have a massively increased affinity to their target RNA and their in vitro and in vivo activity does not depend on delivery reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Soifer et al., 2012</xref>) with potential translational applications in patients. As a proof of concept, we confirmed that intratracheal administration of <italic>Prrx1</italic>-specific ASO inhibited the upregulation of mouse PRRX1a and 1b expression at both mRNA and protein level at day 14 in bleomycin-treated mice. Pulmonary fibrosis development was also reduced in these animals. While our in vitro findings in adult Human lung fibroblasts showed that PRRX1 inhibition mainly impacted ACTA2 expression levels, <italic>Prrx1</italic> ASO treatment in the bleomycin mouse model of lung fibrosis also inhibited the deposition of ECM proteins such as Collagen 1, Fibronectin, Tenascin C, and Elastin. This difference regarding ECM compound at day 14 may reflect the effect of <italic>Prrx1</italic> ASO on the overall fibrosis development; upon the proliferation / accumulation as well as impaired myofibroblastic differentiation of mesenchymal cells in vivo from the beginning of the ASO treatment at day 7. The impact of <italic>Prrx1</italic> ASO was found to be less pronounced in mice treated during the late fibrosis phase (between day 21 and 28). These findings suggest that <italic>Prrx1</italic> inhibition may be more effective during the active phase of fibrosis. However, inhibiting <italic>Prrx1</italic> during the late phase did not appear to affect lung repair in vivo, which is also supported by the lung alveosphere assay with <italic>Prrx1</italic> deficient MEFs. In addition, we confirmed the anti-fibrotic effect of the <italic>Prrx1</italic> ASO in a second model of fibrosis using ex vivo culture of Human or mouse PCLS stimulated with a cocktail of fibrosis-associated cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lehmann et al., 2018</xref>). A promising anti-fibrotic effect was also observed in IPF PCLS treated with <italic>PRRX1</italic> ASO. To confirm and study further these results obtained with <italic>Prrx1</italic> ASO, it will be interesting to perform in vivo CRE-mediated conditional and inducible loss of <italic>Prrx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feldmann et al., 2021</xref>) in the different mesenchymal lung cell lineages expressing this transcription factor in the bleomycin model of lung fibrosis as discussed above. Similarly, lineage tracing experiments in mice should be undertaken to identify the source of those <italic>Prrx1</italic>-positive mesenchymal cells during lung fibrosis development.</p><p>Targeting of others transcription factors such as GLI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moshai et al., 2014</xref>), FOXM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Penke et al., 2018</xref>), FOXF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Black et al., 2018</xref>), FOXO3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Tamari et al., 2018</xref>), RUNX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mümmler et al., 2018</xref>), and TBX4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xie et al., 2016</xref>) was also shown to inhibit fibrosis development in this mouse experimental model of pulmonary fibrosis. However, at the exception of TBX4 and PRRX1, the expression of all these other TFs is not restricted to mesenchymal lineages, which means that targeting those TFs may impact both lung fibrosis and epithelial regeneration/repair. Finally, PRRX1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach in fibrosis is not restricted to the lung. Adenoviral shRNA mediated inhibition of <italic>Prrx1</italic> in the thioacetamide model of liver fibrosis in rats also decreased fibrotic lesions, collagen deposition and hepatic stellate cells myofibroblastic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study unveils the role of the pro-fibrotic and mesenchyme associated PRRX1 TFs in lung fibrosis, involved in fibroblasts proliferation and TGF-β pathway responsiveness during myofibroblastic differentiation. Direct inhibition of PRRX1 transcriptional activity in mesenchymal cells may be a potential therapeutic target in IPF as supported by our encouraging results in Human IPF PCLS. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the administration of <italic>Prrx1</italic> ASO in the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis is particularly interesting. The route of administration we used constitutes a first attempt to locally inhibit a pro-fibrotic TF. The possibility of a local administration of an antifibrotic is seductive: current antifibrotics, administered systemically, are burdened with significant adverse events, which significantly attenuates their effect on health-related quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graney and Lee, 2018</xref>). Inhaled pirfenidone and other inhaled compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaminskas et al., 2019</xref>) are currently investigated in IPF, but none are directly acting on a mesenchymal transcription factor.

Does Prrx1 ASO more efficiently knockdown Prrx1 if used in in vitro?</p><p>The authors mentioned that Prrx1 is expressed in Col14a1+ fibroblasts in normal lungs according to Xie et al. 2018. More recent studies showed that Col14a1+ fibroblasts in the lung are Pi16+ adventitial fibroblasts that reside in bronchovascular bundles, which are distinct from fibroblasts that arise in injured lungs. Addressing if Prrx1 is upregulated in injured-lung specific fibroblasts by using other data sets (Tsukui et al. 2020 Nature Communications, or Redente et al. 2020 JCI Insight) may help understand the in vivo regulation of Prrx1.</p><p>Figure S9A Immunofluorescence.

The expression of PRRX1 seems to be also in Donor fibroblasts (open circles) and not only in lung fibrosis (closed circles). This does not fit necessarily with the data shown in C. The authors should discuss this difference and also propose a function for PRRX1 in donor fibroblasts.</p><p>Figure 3: PRRX1 is modulated by growth factors and matrix environment.</p><p>Figure 3A: the authors need to look at different time points to find out when the negative feedback loop leading to the decrease in PRRX1 expression following TGFb1 treatment starts. Figure 3B: It was expected that the stiffer ECM (28 kPA\a) should have triggered a higher level of PRXX1 expression compared to the soft ECM (1.5 kPa). However, the authors observe the opposite and should offer some interpretation. Figure 3D and E need to be better explained especially the quantification for Figure 3D which seems to suggest that there is no difference in the elastic modulus of the IPF ECM vs Control ECM.

Would the decrease in Prxx1 expression lead to a change in the activity of the resident mesenchymal niche (Cd45-Cd31-EpCam-Sca1+ cells)? This can be easily tested using alveolospheres (co-culture of normal mature AT2s with either rMC coming from ASO control or ASO Prrx1 lungs). If the mesenchyme from ASO Prrx1 lung is more efficient in promoting alveolosphere formation and growth, this would argue that the cells are less prone to adopt a myofibroblast-like phenotype when Prrx1 is silenced.</p><p>Supplemental Figure S2: PRRX1 expression profiles at single-cell resolution using the &quot;IPF Cell Atlas&quot; web database (http://ipfcellatlas.com/).</p><p>Figure S2C: Increase in PRRX1 expression is observed in Myofibroblasts in IPF vs. Control as expected.</p><p>However, there is also a significant increase in PRRX1 expression in the PLIN2+ fibroblasts in IPF vs. Control. What is the significance of this increase? Could it be that this leads to the loss of mesenchymal niche activity for AT2 cells (see comments for figure 7)?</p><p>Supplemental Figure S10: PRRX1 is increased during the fibrotic phase in mice with bleomycin-induced fibrosis.</p><p>What is happening to PRRX1 expression from d14 to d28 (during fibrosis resolution… Is PRRX1 expression decreasing)?</p><p>Supplemental Figure S15: a summary sketch of PRRX1 regulation and functions in lung fibroblasts.</p><p>The model is not clear as we would expect PRRX1 to first be upregulated in the context of TGFb1 signaling and then downregulated at a later stage due to the establishment of a negative feedback loop.

These plots were generated from the Banovich/Kropski datasets, which included both control and fibrotic lungs. In the Banovich/Kropski dataset, PRRX1 expression was predominantly associated with adventitial fibroblasts in control human lungs (see lines 154-155).</p><p>Accordingly, we agree with the reviewer that control fibroblasts express PRRX1, as supported by the lines of evidence presented in Figures 1 and 2. As stated in the manuscript regarding Figure 2C: &quot;in vitro, both isoforms of <italic>PRRX1</italic> mRNA (<italic>PRRX1a</italic> and <italic>PRRX1b</italic>) were found to be strongly expressed by primary control lung fibroblasts compared to primary alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AECII) and alveolar macrophages (Figure 2C) as determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR)&quot; (lines 157-162). Moreover, we investigated the function of PRRX1 in control fibroblasts using siRNA, as shown in Figures 4 and 5. Our results demonstrated that PRRX1 TFs promote the proliferation of these primary lung fibroblasts and are also involved in their myofibroblastic differentiation in the presence of TGFb1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: PRRX1 is modulated by growth factors and matrix environment.</p><p>Figure 3A: the authors need to look at different time points to find out when the negative feedback loop leading to the decrease in PRRX1 expression following TGFb1 treatment starts.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we performed a time course analysis of PRRX1 isoform expression levels and showed that PRRX1 was downregulated only after 48h. This late downregulation of PRRX1 in response to TGF-b1, could be the signature of a negative feedback loop to limit cell-responsiveness to TGF-b1 when lung fibroblasts are fully differentiated into myofibroblasts at 48h as discussed in the revised manuscript (see Figure 9)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3B: It was expected that the stiffer ECM (28 kPA\a) should have triggered a higher level of PRXX1 expression compared to the soft ECM (1.5 kPa). However, the authors observe the opposite and should offer some interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>Overall, our in vitro findings suggest that myofibroblastic differentiation in lung fibroblasts is associated with downregulation of <italic>PRRX1</italic> TFs. Interestingly, while the inhibitory effect of a stiff substrate (both basal plastic and 28kPa conditions) on PRRX1 levels is not complete, it is known that substrate stiffness regulates the degree of myofibroblastic differentiation. Therefore, the observed upregulation of PRRX1 on a soft substrate could reflect a potentiation effect associated with decreased myofibroblastic potential, whereas the decrease on a stiff substrate could indicate a potential feedback loop or rheostat, as has been observed with TGF-b1 (although in the latter case, the stimulus was stronger).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3D and E need to be better explained especially the quantification for Figure 3D which seems to suggest that there is no difference in the elastic modulus of the IPF ECM vs Control ECM. Was this result expected? Figure 3E: the interpretation and the significance of the data shown are not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting that the purpose and significance of the experiments involving fibroblasts-derived ECM needed further clarification. In the revised manuscript, we now state that: “this 3D in vitro model will enable the study of how the interactions between lung fibroblasts and control or IPF stroma may affect PRRX1 expression levels.” for example (see lines 211-212). We further clarified this section of the paper by adding introductory sections and additional intermediary conclusions (as described in line 217-218 and lines 223-224).</p><p>As pointed out by the reviewer, we observed no significant difference in the elastic modulus between control and IPF-fibroblast derived ECM. Although we had no preconceived expectations about these results, we performed these measurements to determine whether the observed effects were driven by differences in ECM stiffness (as tested in Figure 3C-D) or were a consequence potential of variations in the ECM itself. With respect to interpretation and the significance of the data<italic>,</italic> “Our findings indicate that constitutive components of the microenvironment may play a role in controlling the expression of PRRX1 transcription factors in control fibroblasts (through PDGFR activation), regardless of local stiffness.” (lines 236-238) and “These results suggested that components present in IPF ECM directly modulated the expression of PRRX1 TFs in control fibroblasts independently of ECM stiffness. Further research will be necessary to determine the mechanisms that activate PGDFR by IPF-fibroblast derived ECM, leading to upregulation of PRRX1 TFs in control fibroblasts” (lines 551-555) as described in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In conclusion, the experiments featured in Figure 3 showed that PRRX1 TF mRNA levels were regulated by both ECM origin and stiffness in control fibroblasts, while only ECM stiffness modulated PRRX1 expression in IPF fibroblasts. Further investigation is also necessary to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the interactions between IPF fibroblasts and ECM origin, as well as a comprehensive study of the ECM components secreted by lung fibroblasts. These topics will be the focus of future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: PRRX1 knockdown decreased cell proliferation.</p><p>A supplementary panel showing Edu staining would have been great to confirm the decrease in proliferation triggered by the silencing of PRRX1 expression.

We selected this time window because the protocol approved by our local animal ethical committee only allowed for one week of ASO treatment, and we aimed to target the rebound in PRRX1 TF expression observed between day 21 and 28 (as discussed in response to comment #14). Interestingly, we found that the effects of <italic>Prrx1</italic> inhibition during the late fibrosis phase were less (but still) potent compared to <italic>Prrx1</italic> inhibition during the active/early fibrotic phase (see new Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Unfortunately, we were unable to validate the data by measuring lung function in control and Prrx1 ASO animals at this time. The necessary devices are not available in our animal facility. As suggested by the reviewer, schematics showing the experimental approaches were added in Figure 6 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7: PRRX1 inhibition decreases fibrosis markers in bleomycin mice.</p><p>As Prrx1 is also expressed in the adult lung mesenchyme, it would be interesting to determine what is the impact of silencing Prrx1 expression during homeostasis.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have updated our findings to include the following statement (lines 417-420): “After treating naive mice with PBS, control, or Prrx1 ASO every other day for a week, we observed no evidence of inflammation or upregulation of fibrosis markers associated with Prrx1 inhibition in healthy lungs, when compared to the PBS and control ASO groups (data not shown)”.

This can be easily tested using alveolospheres (co-culture of normal mature AT2s with either rMC coming from ASO control or ASO Prrx1 lungs). If the mesenchyme from ASO Prrx1 lung is more efficient in promoting alveolosphere formation and growth, this would argue that the cells are less prone to adopt a myofibroblast-like phenotype when Prrx1 is silenced.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment and suggestions. However, it is worth noting that our study used a pharmacological approach, which may have limited the duration and extent of <italic>Prrx1</italic> inhibition after isolation of the mesenchymal cells. We would like to highlight that this approach may not be suitable for long-term culture of lung spheroids, embedded in thick Matrigel. Matrigel could have also restricted the diffusion of additional ASO treatment in culture. Usually, mesenchymal cells with constitutive alterations, derived from transgenic models, would be more appropriate for this assay.</p><p>As a surrogate, we used instead wild-type or <italic>Prrx1-/-</italic> MEFs as stromal cells in a lung spheroid assay to investigate whether PRRX1 loss could perturb epithelial homeostasis and regeneration. The results, which we now mention in the revised manuscript (lines 371-375 and revised Figure 5—figure supplement 5), showed that <italic>Prrx1</italic> loss did not dampen but rather promoted epithelial spheroid formation. As suggested by the reviewer, these findings may suggest that <italic>Prrx1-</italic>deficient stromal cells, specifically MEFs in this case, may be less likely to adopt a myofibroblast-like phenotype when Prrx1 is silenced. The altered myofibroblastic differentiation of <italic>Prrx1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs in response to TGF-β1 also supported this hypothesis (see Figure 5—figure supplement 5). While these findings are promising, it is important to note that further research using isolated lung mesenchymal cells after conditional loss of <italic>Prrx1</italic> in transgenic mice is necessary to confirm our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplemental Figure S2: PRRX1 expression profiles at single-cell resolution using the &quot;IPF Cell Atlas&quot; web database (http://ipfcellatlas.com/).</p><p>Figure S2C: Increase in PRRX1 expression is observed in Myofibroblasts in IPF vs. Control as expected.</p><p>However, there is also a significant increase in PRRX1 expression in the PLIN2+ fibroblasts in IPF vs. Control.
