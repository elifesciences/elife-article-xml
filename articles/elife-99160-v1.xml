have acquired similar traits independently in each of the three lakes during the process of adaptive radiation. In particular, ‘hypertrophied lip’ has been highlighted as a prominent example of parallel evolution. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted an integrated comparative analysis between the hypertrophied and normal lips of cichlids across three lakes based on histology, proteomics, and transcriptomics. Histological and proteomic analyses revealed that the hypertrophied lips were characterized by enlargement of the proteoglycan-rich layer, in which versican and periostin proteins were abundant. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of extracellular matrix-related genes, including collagens, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, was higher in hypertrophied lips, regardless of their phylogenetic relationships. In addition, the genes in Wnt signaling pathway, which is involved in promoting proteoglycan expression, was highly expressed in both the juvenile and adult stages of hypertrophied lips. Our comprehensive analyses showed that hypertrophied lips of the three different phylogenetic origins can be explained by similar proteomic and transcriptomic profiles, which may provide important clues into the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic parallelisms in East African cichlids.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cichlid</kwd><kwd>parallel evolution</kwd><kwd>hypertrophied lip</kwd><kwd>multi-omics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23KJ0951</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Machii</surname><given-names>Nagatoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H04606</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nikaido</surname><given-names>Masato</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20KK0167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nikaido</surname><given-names>Masato</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJSP2106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatashima</surname><given-names>Ryo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A shared molecular basis of proteoglycan accumulation, driven by Wnt signaling, underlies the parallel evolution of hypertrophied lips in East African cichlids.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parallel evolution is evidence of natural selection that drives adaptive solutions to the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Losos, 2011</xref>). Acquisition of similar traits in distantly related lineages can be observed in multiple lineages, such as the loss of eyes in cave fish, patterns of wing colors in Heliconius butterflies, and body armor of sticklebacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krishnan and Rohner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stern, 2013</xref>). Since it is unlikely that such a complex phenotype was acquired repeatedly by neutral evolution alone, the same direction of natural selection among species is likely to drive the parallel phenotypic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Losos, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stern, 2013</xref>). Therefore, research on parallel evolution enables us to compare the commonalities and differences in the mechanisms behind the acquisition of novel traits and elucidate how adaptation occurs in similar environments.</p><p>East African cichlids offer one of the best opportunities to examine the molecular basis of parallel evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kocher et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muschick et al., 2012</xref>). There are hundreds of endemic cichlid species in the East African Great Lakes, Victoria, Malawi, and Tanganyika, as a result of explosive adaptive radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salzburger, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Santos et al., 2023</xref>). As a result of independent adaptations in each lake, parallel evolution is often observed among lakes, such as that of the nose snout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duenser et al., 2023</xref>), jaw morphology, and body shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kocher et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muschick et al., 2012</xref>). To reveal their evolutionary mechanisms, genetic bases of the phenotypes have been investigated. For example, the parallel evolution of body stripes in cichlids of Lake Victoria and Lake Malawi was explained by relatively simple changes in pigmental cell arrangement caused by mutations in the cis-regulatory element of agouti-related peptide 2 (agrp2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kratochwil et al., 2018</xref>). Although this parallel evolution of body stripe patterns can be explained by a single gene, most traits are likely to be polygenic, hindering elucidation of the parallel evolution mechanism.</p><p>Cichlid fishes have acquired a huge diversity in their oral morphologies, reflecting ecological and trophic specializations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Kocher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kocher, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lecaudey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lecaudey et al., 2019</xref>). Hypertrophied lips, one of the most prominent examples of oral diversity, have been independently acquired in cichlids inhabiting each of the East African Great Lakes, as well as in the Nicaraguan crater lakes and South American rivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henning et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kautt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masonick et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masonick et al., 2022</xref>). Several hypotheses have been proposed for the adaptive roles of hypertrophied lips, such as for effectively sucking prey out from narrow crevices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lukas et al., 2015</xref>), reducing mechanical stress during foraging in rocky habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fryer, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenwood, 1974</xref>), and facilitating prey detection by providing an enlarged area for taste receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnegard and Snoeks, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oliver and Arnegard, 2010</xref>). Thus, hypertrophied lips are considered an adaptive trait for a specific trophic niche, making them an ideal model for understanding the mechanism of parallel evolution.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms underlying hypertrophied lips have been investigated in various lineages of cichlids. For example, transcriptome comparisons between hypertrophied and normal lips of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colombo et al., 2013</xref>) and South American crater lakes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manousaki et al., 2013</xref> have identified some differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as candidates for lip hypertrophy; however, their primary regulators remain to be elucidated. In addition, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henning et al., 2017</xref>) and genome-wide association study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masonick et al., 2023</xref> have been conducted to elucidate the genomic loci responsible for hypertrophied lips in the cichlids of Lake Victoria and Lake Malawi. These genome-wide studies concluded that lip hypertrophy was a polygenic trait involving several candidate genes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying lip hypertrophy has not yet been elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we comprehensively compared the hypertrophied and normal lips of cichlids across all East African Great Lakes at various biological levels using histology, proteomics, and transcriptomics. As a result, we showed that a novel key pathway commonly involved in the formation of hypertrophied lips, providing insight into a better understanding of the molecular basis of a typical example of parallel evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comparative histology of hypertrophied and normal lips among cichlids from the East African Great Lakes</title><p>We compared the histological structures of hypertrophied and normal lips among cichlids from Lake Victoria, Lake Malawi, and Lake Tanganyika.

As a result, we identified 2720 proteins in total from three types of lip samples: the tip of hypertrophied lips (proteoglycan-rich loose connective tissue), the base of hypertrophied lips (collagen-rich loose connective tissue), and normal lips.

Comparison of the developmental stages revealed differences in the expression patterns between the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways: the genes of the canonical Wnt pathway were highly expressed in both stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–I</xref>), whereas those of the noncanonical pathway were highly expressed only in the adult stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–N</xref>).

Histological comparisons revealed that cichlids with hypertrophied lips from all three East African Great Lakes exhibited an enlargement of the proteoglycan-rich loose connective tissue. By integrating proteomics and transcriptomics, we identified several proteins that were significantly accumulated in the hypertrophied lips. Among them, proteoglycans and their related proteins such as vcan and postn, could be a primary factor that explains lip hypertrophy. Interestingly, these proteins are known to be involved in the formation of human keloids, a skin disease characterized by an overabundance of ECM in the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Naitoh et al., 2005</xref>). It has been discussed that excessive deposition of vcan retains large amounts of water in the sulfate or carbonyl moieties, contributing to the increase in keloid volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yagi et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, postn is involved in fibrosis through its ability to interact with multiple ECM proteins. For example, upregulation of postn leads to strengthening of the ECM by crosslinking with collagens and excessive deposition of ECM proteins by differentiating quiescent fibroblasts into activated myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>). In cichlid, vcan and postn may have a similar function, leading to hypertrophied loose connective tissue.</p><p>The Wnt signaling pathway was also elevated in both the adult and juvenile stages of hypertrophied lips. The Wnt signaling pathway is known to be a key regulator of the expression of ECM-related genes; for example, vcan is directly regulated by the Wnt/b-catenin and tcf4 signaling pathways, leading to vcan upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rahmani et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, Wnt5a, a noncanonical pathway, plays a critical role in dermal condensation during mouse and sugar glider development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feigin et al., 2023</xref>). Cellular-level localization of gene expression for the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathway is required for future examination of the involvement of the Wnt signaling pathway in lip hypertrophy.</p><p>From a genomic perspective, several studies have investigated the genetic basis of hypertrophied lip cichlids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masonick et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakamura et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, some Wnt pathway-related genes (tcf4 and daam2) and ECM-related genes (postna, col12a1a, and col12a1b) have been found to be under positive selection in cichlids with hypertrophied lips of Lake Victoria (see Table S3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakamura et al., 2021</xref>). For future research, examining whether these genes are under selection in other lakes is crucial to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the parallel evolution of hypertrophied lips.</p><p>Although the parallel evolution of hypertrophied lips in cichlids has received considerable attention in evolutionary biology, the commonality and diversity underlying their molecular basis remain poorly understood. This might be primarily due to the fact that many genetic factors are possibly involved in the dynamic organization of hypertrophied lips. We uncovered the apparent relationships between hypertrophied lips and the expression profiles of ECM proteins, in particularly proteoglycans. The trends for the overall expression of ECM-related genes were similar across hypertrophied lip species, but we rarely observed a specific gene that was commonly expressed at high or low levels in all three examples of hypertrophied lips across all East African Great Lakes. Furthermore, although we focused primarily on the relationship between the Wnt signaling pathway and lip hypertrophy, several other pathways may be involved in the development of hypertrophied lips. For example, our enrichment analysis in adult cichlids identified VEGF-related pathways, which could contribute to lip hypertrophy by increasing vascularization and nutrient supply to the lip tissue. In addition, previous QTL analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henning et al., 2017</xref> concluded that lip hypertrophy is likely influenced by numerous loci with small additive effects. These lines of data imply that although enlargement of proteoglycan-rich loose connective tissue is common in hypertrophied lips, the developmental pathways to accomplish this are diverse in each lake. The pathways responsible for lip hypertrophy therefore require further investigation. In conclusion, our approach of integrating histology, proteomics and transcriptomics revealed complex evolutionary pathways for hypertrophied lips in cichlids of the East African Great Lakes, providing an opportunity to further understand the molecular mechanism underlying the parallel evolution of polygenic traits, such as jaw morphology or body shape.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Three species of Victoria cichlids (<italic>Haplochromis chilotes</italic> with hypertrophied lips; <italic>H. sauvagei</italic>, and <italic>H. pyrrhocephalus</italic> with normal lips), four species of Malawi cichlids (<italic>Placidochromis milomo</italic> with hypertrophied lips; <italic>Maylandia lombardoi, M. zebra,</italic> and <italic>Labidochromis caeruleus</italic> with normal lips), and two species of Taganyika cichlids (<italic>Lobochilotes labiatus</italic> with hypertrophied lips; <italic>Tropheus moorii</italic> with normal lips) were used in the experiments. <italic>H. chilotes, H. sauvagei</italic>, and <italic>H. pyrrhocephalus</italic> were collected from the Mwanza gulf of Lake Victoria during an exploration that was led by the Nikaido Laboratory in 2018.

The amount of sequence data ranged from 4.22 Gb (SAMD00762492) to 13.91 Gb (SAMD00024161). The extracted total RNA was sequenced at 100 bp paired-end reads on a Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by Macrogen Japan Corp, using a TruSeq stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina). The raw FASTQ data were qualified using fastp version 0.20.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) in default option. The high-quality reads were mapped to <italic>M. zebra</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Conte and Kocher, 2015</xref>) using STAR version 2.7.10a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) and quantified using rsem-calculate-expression version 1.3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>). PCA was conducted using Python scikit-learn package. Low-expression genes (average transcripts per kilobase million (TPM) below 5.0) were removed, and expression rates were normalized by <italic>Z</italic> score. The resulting 12,231 genes were used for PCA analysis. For PCA of ECM-related genes, we used 186 genes as inputs, which were extracted in the same manner. DEGs were detected using the TCC package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun et al., 2013</xref>) with the TMM–edgeR–edgeR combination. Enrichment analysis was conducted using DAVID version 2023q3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2009b</xref>) after the gene IDs of <italic>M. zebra</italic> were converted to human gene IDs using ensembl biomart. The annotation terms used for functional annotation clustering were collected from biological process (Gene Ontology), KEGG, and Reactome.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were conducted according to the Institutional Animal Experiment Committee of the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

Importantly, some Wnt pathway-related genes (tcf4 and daam2) and ECM-related genes (postna, col12a1a, and col12a1b) have been found to be under positive selection in cichlids with hypertrophied lips of Lake Victoria (see Nakamura et al., 2021 Table S3).

We calculated the multiple corrected p-value in the Benjamini Hochberg method (Author response image 1, right).

Do you have any evidence?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your comment regarding possible evidence for the involvement of multiple pathways in hypertrophied lip development. Our statement was based on two main points:</p><p>(1) While we highlighted the Wnt pathway because this pathway is known to increase proteoglycan expression, we cannot exclude the possibility of the involvement of other pathways. For instance, our enrichment analysis in adult cichlids identified VEGF-related pathways, which could contribute to lip hypertrophy by increasing vascularization and nutrient supply to the lip tissue.</p><p>(2) Previous quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis by Henning et al. (2017) concluded that lip hypertrophy is likely influenced by numerous loci with small additive effects. This indicates that lip hypertrophy is a complex phenotype consisted of multiple genetic factors, some which probably correspond to different molecular pathways.</p><p>Given these points, we draw a conclusion that emphasize the importance of Wnt pathway while also recognizing the potential cooperative interaction of multiple pathways in developing lip hypertrophy. Without confusing the two statements, we corrected our manuscript as follows.</p><p>Line 398-412: “We uncovered the apparent relationships between hypertrophied lips and the expression profiles of ECM proteins, in particularly proteoglycans. The trends for the overall expression of ECM-related genes were similar across hypertrophied lip species, but we rarely observed a specific gene that was commonly expressed at high or low levels in all three examples of hypertrophied lips across all East African Great Lakes. Furthermore, although we focused primarily on the relationship between the Wnt signaling pathway and lip hypertrophy, several other pathways may be involved in the development of hypertrophied lips. These findings imply that although enlargement of proteoglycan-rich loose connective tissue is common in hypertrophied lips, the developmental pathways to accomplish this are diverse in each lake.”</p><p>“We uncovered the apparent relationships between hypertrophied lips and the expression profiles of ECM proteins, in particularly proteoglycans.

Transcriptome analysis at different developmental stages showed that the genes in Wnt signaling pathway was highly expressed in cichlids with hypertrophied lips at both the juvenile and adult stages. It is noteworthy that the distinct expression profiles observed in the proteome and transcriptome analyses of hypertrophied lips were similar among cichlids from each of the East African Great Lakes.
