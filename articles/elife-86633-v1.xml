It has been reported that inhibitory interneurons that express neuropeptide Y (NPY), either permanently or during development, suppress mechanical itch, with no effect on pain. Here, we investigate the role of interneurons that continue to express NPY (NPY-INs) in the adult mouse spinal cord. We find that chemogenetic activation of NPY-INs reduces behaviours associated with acute pain and pruritogen-evoked itch, whereas silencing them causes exaggerated itch responses that depend on cells expressing the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor. As predicted by our previous studies, silencing of another population of inhibitory interneurons (those expressing dynorphin) also increases itch, but to a lesser extent. Importantly, NPY-IN activation also reduces behavioural signs of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. These results demonstrate that NPY-INs gate pain and itch transmission at the spinal level, and therefore represent a potential treatment target for pathological pain and itch.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NPY</kwd><kwd>chemogenetics</kwd><kwd>neuropathic pain</kwd><kwd>inflammatory pain</kwd><kwd>pruritogen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102645/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Todd</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>219433/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Todd</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N006119/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riddell</surname><given-names>John S</given-names></name><name><surname>Todd</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P007996/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>David I</given-names></name><name><surname>Riddell</surname><given-names>John S</given-names></name><name><surname>Todd</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/S002987/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riddell</surname><given-names>John S</given-names></name><name><surname>Todd</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/T01072X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weir</surname><given-names>Gregory A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/V033638/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riddell</surname><given-names>John S</given-names></name><name><surname>Todd</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

This information is relayed via projection cells to supraspinal sites, where it leads to perceptions, including pain and itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Todd, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mishra and Hoon, 2015</xref>). However, projection cells represent only ~1% of dorsal horn neurons, with the vast majority comprising excitatory and inhibitory interneurons that are arranged into local microcircuits that process somatosensory information. Altered function of these circuits contributes to chronic pain and pruritus (itch) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cevikbas and Lerner, 2020</xref>). Dysregulation of inhibitory circuits has attracted particular interest, as broad disruption of spinal inhibitory signalling produces behaviours reminiscent of symptoms seen in patients suffering from chronic pain or pruritus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beyer et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sivilotti and Woolf, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yaksh, 1989</xref>).</p><p>We have described a molecular classification scheme that assigns the inhibitory interneurons in mouse superficial dorsal horn (SDH; laminae I and II) to five largely non-overlapping populations, based on expression of calretinin (CR), parvalbumin (PV), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), dynorphin and galanin (Dyn/Gal), or neuropeptide Y (NPY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>). This scheme has since been validated and extended by large-scale transcriptomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Häring et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sathyamurthy et al., 2018</xref>). These molecularly defined interneuron populations appear to be functionally distinct as they display differential activation profiles in response to noxious and innocuous stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Häring et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sathyamurthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Polgár et al., 2013</xref>). A major advantage of this approach is that it allows investigation of the function of different populations through targeted manipulation with techniques such as chemogenetics, optogenetetics, and toxin-mediated silencing or ablation. Studies of this type have implicated the PV interneurons in preventing tactile allodynia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Petitjean et al., 2015</xref>), the nNOS interneurons in gating both mechanical and thermal inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), and the Dyn/Gal population in suppressing mechanical pain and pruritogen-evoked itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duan et al., 2014</xref>). Ablation or silencing of dorsal horn NPY-lineage neurons (i.e. cells that express NPY transiently during development or persistently into adulthood) has been reported to cause spontaneous itching behaviours and enhancement of touch-evoked (mechanical) itch, without affecting pruritogen-evoked itch or pain behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourane et al., 2015</xref>). This has led to the view that the main function of the NPY cells is suppression of mechanical itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen and Sun, 2020</xref>). This limited role for NPY interneurons is surprising for several reasons: (1) they account for one-third of all inhibitory interneurons in SDH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>; (2) they innervate a population of nociceptive projection cells that belong to the anterolateral system (ALS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Polgár et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cameron et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iwagaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kókai et al., 2022</xref>); (3) while mechanical itch is restricted to hairy skin, NPY-expressing neurons are present throughout the dorsal horn, including areas innervated from glabrous skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Polgár et al., 2011</xref>); and (4) NPY itself has a role in modulating chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Solway et al., 2011</xref>). As noted above, the approach used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourane et al., 2015</xref> targeted a broad population of inhibitory interneurons that express NPY during development, as well as those that express NPY in adulthood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tashima et al., 2021</xref> recently attempted to target NPY-INs by injecting adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) with a <italic>Npy</italic> promoter into the rat spinal cord. However, expression was largely restricted to lamina IIo (even though many NPY cells are found in other laminae) and fewer than half of the targeted cells contained either NPY or its mRNA. Therefore, the role of those dorsal horn interneurons that continue to express NPY (NPY-INs) remains unclear.</p><p>Here, we use intraspinal injections of AAVs carrying Cre-dependent expression cassettes into young adult Npy-Cre mice to target dorsal horn NPY-INs. We demonstrate that this technique can be used to manipulate inhibitory interneurons that express NPY in adulthood, while avoiding those cells that transiently express NPY during development. We show that chemogenetic activation of dorsal horn NPY-INs suppresses acute mechanical and thermal nocifensive behaviours, as well as those resulting from pruritogen-evoked itch, and reduces activity in spinal networks that process nociceptive and pruritoceptive information. Furthermore, NPY-IN activation abolishes mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Finally, we show that silencing of NPY-INs results in spontaneous itch and an exaggerated response to pruritogens, and that this depends on a circuit involving GABAergic input from NPY-INs to excitatory interneurons that express the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR). Together these results demonstrate that dorsal horn NPY-INs have a far broader role than previously suggested, since they gate transmission of nociceptive and pruriceptive information. They therefore represent a potential target for the development of new treatments for pain and itch.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cre-dependent AAV injections in young adult Npy-Cre mice target dorsal horn inhibitory NPY interneurons and avoid transient NPY-expressing cells</title><p>We initially assessed the suitability of using intra-spinal injection of AAVs encoding Cre-dependent constructs in RH26 Npy-Cre mice (the line used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourane et al., 2015</xref>) to target NPY-INs in the dorsal horn.

In these animals, tdTom-positive cells were seen throughout the dorsal horn, and were much more numerous than eGFP-expressing cells in the region of the injection site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). All tdTom-labelled cells were IR for the transcription factor Pax2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which is expressed by all dorsal horn inhibitory neurons in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larsson, 2017</xref>), and these accounted for 40.8% ± 10.0% of Pax2 cells in laminae I–III. Virtually, all eGFP-expressing neurons within this region were tdTom-positive (97.8% ± 0.2%), but these only accounted for 51.1% ± 3.5% of the tdTom-positive population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, I</xref>). In agreement with the data presented above, the great majority tdTom+;eGFP+ neurons were found to be NPY-IR (85.2% ± 0.2%), and these accounted for 67.0% ± 6.3% of the NPY-IR cells in laminae I–III. In contrast, only 32.1% ± 2.1% of the tdTom+;eGFP-negative cells displayed NPY immunoreactivity, corresponding to just 24.1% ± 2.7% of all NPY-IR interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, I</xref>). Overall, 58.3% ± 0.9% of tdTom+ neurons were NPY-IR.</p><p>These results suggest that transient Cre expression occurs in a broad population of dorsal horn inhibitory interneurons in Npy-Cre mice, presumably driven by NPY expression during development. However, Cre expression in adult mice occurs in a much more restricted population of inhibitory interneurons that express NPY persistently. To characterise these cells in relation to the neurochemical populations of inhibitory interneurons that we had identified in the SDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>), we focussed our analysis on laminae I–II and compared the expression of the different neurochemical markers between the tdTom+;eGFP+ and tdTom+;eGFP-negative cells. Within this region, 85.8% ± 2.5% of tdTom+;eGFP+ cells were NPY-IR, while approximately 10%, 3%, and 1% expressed galanin, nNOS, or PV, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This is in good agreement with the degree of overlap between these markers and NPY that we have previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, 23.7% ± 7.0% of tdTom+;eGFP+ cells expressed CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which has previously been reported to show minimal overlap with NPY-IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). Nonetheless tdTom+;eGFP+ cells are largely restricted to the NPY+ population of inhibitory interneurons. In contrast, tdTom+;eGFP-negative neurons were much more broadly spread across four of the populations, with approximately 28% expressing NPY, 44% expressing CR, and 24% each expressing galanin or nNOS, although virtually none (1.4% ± 1.4%) expressed PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Because we intended to use Cre-dependent expression of the excitatory DREADD hM3Dq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2018</xref>) to activate NPY-INs, we also assessed targeting of this receptor to the appropriate interneurons following injection of AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry into the lumbar dorsal horn of adult Npy-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). hM3Dq-mCherry-expressing cells in the SDH displayed a near-identical pattern in terms of co-localisation with inhibitory interneuron markers to that of the eGFP+ cells following AAV.flex.eGFP injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). For the mCherry+ cells, 90.5% ± 6.2% co-expressed NPY (accounting for 66.1% ± 4.8% of all NPY interneurons) and there was little or no overlap with the galanin, nNOS, and PV populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Again, significant overlap was observed between hM3Dq-mCherry- and CR-positive cells, with 28.0% ± 1.5% of mCherry-labelled cells displaying CR-IR. NPY-IR was detected in 93.1% ± 3.7% of mCherry+;CR+ cells in sections co-stained with NPY antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), demonstrating that this represents Npy-Cre-driven recombination in interneurons co-expressing NPY and CR, rather than ectopic recombination in CR+;NPY-negative interneurons. The level of NPY-IR in the CR cells was generally very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), which probably explains why this overlap was not detected previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). As expected, virtually all mCherry-labelled cells were inhibitory (97.4% ± 2.6% Pax2-positive), and these accounted for a quarter of all inhibitory interneurons in the SDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Crucially, no mCherry-labelled cells were observed in the ipsi- or contralateral L3, L4, or L5 DRG of four AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry-injected Npy-Cre mice (data not shown), as would be expected from the lack of NPY expression in uninjured mouse DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Honore et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these results demonstrate that injection of AAVs encoding Cre-dependent constructs into the dorsal horn of adult Npy-Cre mice allows specific targeting of most inhibitory interneurons that persistently express NPY, and avoids capturing a broader population of inhibitory interneurons that express NPY transiently during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Activation of inhibitory NPY interneurons reduces activity in dorsal horn circuits recruited by nociceptive and pruritic stimuli</title><p>We initially assessed the efficacy of our chemogenetic strategy to activate NPY-INs in Npy-Cre mice injected with AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry by comparing expression of the activity marker Fos 2 hr after administration of the hM3Dq ligand clozapine-<italic>N</italic>-oxide (CNO) or vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Only 8.8% ± 4.7% of mCherry-labelled cells in laminae I–III displayed Fos-IR in vehicle-treated animals, but this rose dramatically to 82.9% ± 2.5% in CNO-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Of these mCherry+;Fos+ cells, 87.5% ± 3.1% displayed detectable NPY immunoreactivity, and these accounted for 53.9% ± 1.2% of all NPY-IR neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). Surprisingly, we also observed a small but significant increase in the proportion of mCherry-negative cells that expressed Fos following CNO (from 2.7% ± 0.3% in vehicle-treated to 5.8% ± 1.0% in CNO-treated mice), and this increase was entirely restricted to inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). A significant proportion of these mCherry-negative;Fos+ cells were also NPY-IR (31.3% ± 4.8%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and these may represent NPY-INs that express hM3Dq-mCherry at a level sufficient for direct CNO-mediated activation, but that is too low for immunohistochemical detection. Alternatively, they may have been indirectly recruited via disinhibition following CNO-mediated activation of hM3Dq-mCherry-expressing NPY-INs. Overall, CNO treatment resulted in Fos expression in 65.9% ± 2.8% of all NPY-INs, and these comprised 65.5% ± 3.8% of Fos-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In summary, intraspinal injection of AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry into adult Npy-Cre mice allows chemogenetic activation of two thirds of dorsal horn NPY-INs, and a small proportion of other dorsal inhibitory interneurons.</p><p>We then assessed the ability of dorsal horn NPY-INs to suppress the transmission of pain- and itch-related information at the circuit level. Npy-Cre mice that had had intraspinal injections of AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry were injected with vehicle or CNO, and then received a noxious heat (hindpaw immersion in 52°C water) or pruritic (intradermal injection of chloroquine, CQ, in the calf) stimulus ipsilateral to the viral injection under brief general anaesthesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Mice that received the pruritic stimulus were fitted with an Elizabethan collar to prevent Fos induction due to itch-related biting of the leg. Following a 2-hr survival period, mice were perfused with fixative and spinal cord sections were processed for Fos-IR. In vehicle treated animals, the noxious heat and pruritic stimuli resulted in ipsilateral Fos expression in the somatotopically relevant areas of the dorsal horn. Fos+ cells were particularly clustered in the medial half of the SDH following noxious heat, and the middle third of the SDH after CQ, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gutierrez-Mecinas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Accordingly, analysis of Fos expression was performed within these regions of the SDH. In CNO-treated mice there was a clear increase in the proportion of mCherry-labelled cells expressing Fos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>), presumably due to direct chemogenetic activation of these cells (as described above). However, for both the noxious heat and pruritic stimuli, we observed a significant decrease in the proportion of mCherry-negative cells that were Fos-positive, when compared to vehicle-treated mice (noxious heat: vehicle = 26.1% ± 3.1% vs. CNO = 7.2% ± 0.8%; CQ injection: vehicle = 12.9% ± 4.2% vs. CNO = 2.1% ± 0.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>). In both cases, the decrease was largely restricted to Pax2-negative (excitatory) neurons, although a significant decrease was also observed in Pax2-positive cells in heat-stimulated mice, with a similar trend in CQ-stimulated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Activation of inhibitory neuropeptide Y (NPY) interneurons reduces activity in dorsal horn circuits recruited by noxious and pruritic stimuli.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) The experimental approaches used to generate the data presented in (<bold>C</bold>, <bold>E</bold>) and (<bold>D</bold>,<bold> F</bold>), respectively.

To investigate the nature of this inhibition in more detail, we performed optogenetic experiments in spinal cord slices from Npy-Cre mice that had received intraspinal injections of AAV.flex.ChR2-eYFP, resulting in expression of eYFP-tagged channelrhodopsin in NPY-INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Short pulses of blue light reliably evoked inward currents and action potential firing in all (10/10) eYFP-ChR2+ cells tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Recordings were made from 41 ChR2-eYFP-negative cells in the SDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>), with an optogenetically evoked postsynaptic current (oPSC) being seen in 29 cells (70.7%). In seven of the cells with oPSCs, bath application of the AMPAr and NMDAr antagonists, NBQX and D-APV, respectively, did not alter the peak amplitude of the current (baseline = −779.8 ± 267.7 pA vs. NBQX/D-APV = −756.6 ± 285.8 pA, p = 0.578, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>), demonstrating that these were not mediated by glutamate and were therefore optogenetically evoked IPSCs (oIPSCs). The GABAergic/glycinergic nature of these oIPSCs was investigated by bath application of gabazine and strychnine, respectively (in the presence of NBQX and D-APV). All oIPSCs tested (6/6) were reduced by gabazine, but not strychnine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, I</xref>), indicating that inhibition is predominantly mediated by GABA. This is consistent with the finding that NPY neurons in laminae I–III are all GABA-IR, but are not enriched with glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rowan et al., 1993</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that NPY-INs provide a powerful GABAergic inhibitory input to surrounding dorsal horn neurons and can reduce the activation of excitatory neurons that are normally recruited by noxious or pruritic stimuli, suggesting that when activated they supress the transmission of pain- and itch-related information in the dorsal horn.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Activation of inhibitory NPY interneurons increases acute nocifensive reflex thresholds and reduces pruritogen-evoked itch behaviour</title><p>We then looked for behavioural correlates of the NPY-IN-mediated suppression of dorsal horn pain and itch circuits. To do this, we assessed mechanical and thermal nocifensive reflexes, as well as CQ-induced itch behaviour, in Npy-Cre mice that had received unilateral spinal injections of AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry and were then treated with vehicle or CNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In vehicle-treated mice, as expected, there were no significant differences between the hindpaws contralateral and ipsilateral to the AAV injection for the 50% mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) or for withdrawal latencies to noxious heat or cold. However, in CNO-treated mice nocifensive thresholds/latencies in the ipsilateral paw were significantly increased across all three modalities, demonstrating a generalised anti-nociceptive effect of NPY-IN activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). CNO-treated mice also spent significantly less time biting the calf area in the 30 min following CQ injection than vehicle-treated controls, demonstrating a reduction in pruritogen-evoked itch upon NPY-IN activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). It has been proposed that when used at high doses, systemic CNO may have off-target effects as a result of conversion to clozapine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gomez et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore tested the effect of 5 mg/kg CNO (the dose used throughout our study) on naive wild-type mice, and found no change in mechanical or thermal nocifensive thresholds, or on locomotor performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This confirms that the effects observed in AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry-injected Npy-Cre mice are due to DREADD activation, and not the result of off-target effects of CNO.

Intraplantar complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) resulted in punctate mechanical and heat hypersensitivity of the ipsilateral paw of AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry-injected Npy-Cre mice that received i.p. injection of vehicle prior to behavioural testing. However, the mechanical and heat hypersensitivity were completely blocked in mice treated with CNO, and the heat latencies were significantly increased above the pre-CFA baseline values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). Vehicle-treated AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry-injected Npy-Cre mice that had undergone spared nerve injury (SNI) also displayed mechanical and heat hypersensitivity of the ipsilateral paw, compared to pre-surgery thresholds. Both the mechanical and heat hypersensitivity were blocked in CNO-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>). Because de novo expression of NPY is known to occur in injured A-fibre afferents following nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Honore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Intondi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wakisaka et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wakisaka et al., 1992</xref>), this could result in expression of hM3Dq in these afferents, thus confounding interpretation of our results. We therefore quantified the number of mCherry-labelled cells in the somatotopically relevant L4 and L5 DRG 4 weeks following SNI surgery in four mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, no labelled cells were observed contralateral to the AAV injection and SNI surgery in either DRG in any of the mice. A few mCherry-labelled cells were observed in both L4 and L5 DRG on the ipsilateral side (cells per DRG: L4 = 12.5 ± 2.3, L5 = 17.5 ± 3.6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because the numbers of A-fibre sensory neurons within the mid-lumbar DRG are estimated to be in the thousands in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duchen and Scaravilli, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lawson, 1979</xref>), it is highly unlikely that CNO-mediated activation of the very few hM3Dq-expressing cells observed in the L4 and L5 DRG following SNI would contribute to the blockade of neuropathic pain that we observed. We therefore conclude that this effect is due to activation of spinal inhibitory NPY-INs. We also assessed mCherry expression in the L4 and L5 DRG of five CFA-treated AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry-injected Npy-Cre mice, 3 days following CFA injection.

Therefore, the suppression of neuropathic hypersensitivity that we observed during chemogenetic activation of NPY-INs could be due to GABAergic transmission, NPY signalling, or a combination of both. To assess the potential role of Y1R signalling, we systemically co-administered CNO and the Y1R-selective antagonist BMS 193885 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acton et al., 2019</xref>) prior to behavioural testing in AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry-injected Npy-Cre mice that had undergone SNI surgery.

A wild-type control group that had undergone SNI was also included to test for any possible preference of (or aversion to) the effects of CNO that could have resulted from off-target effects independent of DREADD activation. CNO did not induce preference or aversion in either of these experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). However, using the same experimental setup we observed preference for a chamber paired with gabapentin in mice that had undergone SNI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>), showing that the CPP method was sufficiently sensitive to detect ongoing neuropathic pain. Together, these findings suggest that activating NPY-INs may not alleviate ongoing pain in the SNI model. We also assessed SNI-induced cold hypersensitivity in the cohort of AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry-injected Npy-Cre mice that were used for CPP testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We observed a marked increase in the duration of the response to an acetone droplet applied to the ipsilateral hindpaw relative to the pre-SNI baseline when the mice had been dosed with a vehicle control. Administration of CNO completely blocked this hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), demonstrating a reversal of SNI-induced cold allodynia when NPY-INs are activated. This result also demonstrates that the lack of CPP in the chemogenetic experiments was not due to a failure to activate NPY-INs.</p><p>In summary, chemogenetic activation of NPY-INs supresses both mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and the suppression of neuropathic hypersensitivity appears to be mediated predominantly by GABAergic transmission from NPY-INs.

In 2/3 cells the oIPSC was gabazine sensitive/strychnine insensitive, indicating GABA-mediated inhibition, while in the other cell the oIPSC was sensitive to both gabazine and strychnine, indicating mixed GABA and glycine inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acton et al., 2019</xref> provided evidence that GRPR-INs lack the Y1R, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref> reported that 35% of GRPR cells had <italic>Y1R</italic> mRNA. We therefore tested the effect of bath-applying the Y1R agonist [Leu<sup>31</sup>,Pro<sup>34</sup>]-neuropeptide Y, while recording from GRPR-INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

We also investigated inhibitory NPY-IN input to GRPR-INs anatomically. To do this, we quantified the proportion of inhibitory synaptic contacts onto GRPR-INs (labelled through spinal injection of Cre-dependent AAV-Brainbow2 into <italic>Grpr<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) at which NPY was present in the presynaptic bouton. Inhibitory synapses were identified by the presence of VGAT-positive presynaptic boutons apposed to puncta of the postsynaptic protein gephyrin. Many of the gephyrin puncta on the GRPR-INs were contacted by NPY-IR boutons, and these accounted for 45.0% ± 1.9% of all inhibitory synapses on the GRPR-INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J, K</xref>). This was significantly higher than the proportion of inhibitory (VGAT+) boutons in the vicinity of the analysed cells that contained NPY (36.2% ± 2.6%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Together these data provide strong evidence that NPY-INs selectively target GRPR-INs and generate a powerful GABAergic inhibition of these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Toxin-mediated silencing of dynorphin interneurons enhances pruritogen-evoked itch</title><p>Dorsal horn inhibitory interneurons that co-express dynorphin and galanin have been implicated in suppression of itch as their activation reduces pruritogen-evoked itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), while constitutive loss of B5-I neurons, which include this population, results in enhanced pruritogen-evoked itch and skin lesions due to spontaneous scratching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kardon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ross et al., 2010</xref>).

One explanation for this could be that although Dyn-INs form inhibitory synapses onto GRPR cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), the density of these synapses is less than that of those arising from the NPY-INs. To test this, we assessed contacts from inhibitory dynorphin cells onto GRPR-INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>), using an antibody against dynorphin B (DynB) and found that these constituted only 20.9% ± 2.2% of the inhibitory synapses on these cells. This did not differ significantly from the proportion of inhibitory boutons that contained DynB in the vicinity of the analysed cells (22.6% ± 1.6%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, E</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that unlike NPY-INs, Dyn-INs do not preferentially target GRPR-INs. In addition, they contribute a far lower proportion of inhibitory synapses on the GRPR-INs (compared to the NPY-INs), and loss of this input has a much less dramatic effect on itch.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Inhibitory interneurons in the SDH play an important role in suppressing pain and itch. NPY-expressing cells constitute around a third of the inhibitory neurons in this region and are also present in deeper laminae. Previous studies in which NPY-lineage neurons were ablated demonstrated that these cells are responsible for preventing mechanical itch through a mechanism involving NPY and the Y1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acton et al., 2019</xref>). Here we show, by selectively activating those cells that continue to express the peptide, that the NPY cells inhibit acute nocifensive reflexes and reduce mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in both inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. In addition, they strongly suppress itch evoked by CQ. Silencing the NPY cells causes spontaneous itch and exaggerated responses to CQ, and both of these effects are reduced by simultaneously silencing GRPR-expressing excitatory interneurons, indicating that suppression of itch by the NPY cells operates through downstream GRPR-INs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A broad inhibitory role for NPY cells</title><p>Our findings indicate that NPY-INs have a far broader role in suppressing pain- and itch-related behaviours than had been suggested by previous studies that used the same Npy-Cre line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acton et al., 2019</xref>), despite the fact that we were targeting a more restricted neuronal population. The differences in experimental findings are likely to result from two methodological issues: (1) the technique used to target cells, and (2) the use of loss-of-function or gain-of-function approaches. In each of these other studies, cells were targeted by an intersectional genetic approach that limited expression to spinal cord and brainstem, but would have included a large additional group of inhibitory neurons that expressed NPY only during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourane et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we used an alternative strategy to restrict expression: intraspinal injection of AAVs coding for Cre-dependent constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). While this approach failed to capture a minority of NPY-expressing neurons, it enabled us to target a large number of these cells. Importantly, expression was restricted to those cells that continue to express NPY. This was confirmed by our finding that up to 85% of the virally transfected cells contained detectable levels of NPY.</p><p>The main differences in interpreting the roles of NPY cells are likely to depend on whether the cells were inactivated (through ablation or synaptic silencing) or chemogenetically activated. In agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourane et al., 2015</xref>, we found that silencing NPY cells had no effect on acute nociceptive thresholds. However, chemogenetically activating these cells increased thresholds for both thermal and mechanical nocifensive reflexes, and reduced hypersensitivity in neuropathic and inflammatory pain models. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acton et al., 2019</xref> also observed an anti-nociceptive effect on mechanical stimuli when they chemogenetically activated NPY-lineage neurons, but attributed this to ectopic activation of Y1 receptors on primary sensory neurons. However, although Y1 is present in cell bodies of some primary sensory cells, it is not thought to traffic to their central terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nelson and Taylor, 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acton et al., 2019</xref> did not test whether activating NPY-lineage neurons had any effect on responses to thermal stimuli, or on neuropathic/inflammatory hypersensitivity, so it is not possible to compare our findings in these contexts. The most likely explanation for discrepancies between the findings of loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies is that although NPY cells have an antinociceptive action, other interneurons provide sufficient inhibition to maintain nocifensive reflexes when NPY cells are silenced. Our findings therefore indicate that NPY-INs have a far broader role in somatosensory processing than was previously recognised.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>NPY cells suppress spontaneous and pruritogen-evoked itch</title><p>Our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kardon et al., 2014</xref>) had implicated dynorphin/galanin cells in suppression of pruritogen-evoked itch. This was based on the findings that <italic>Bhlhb5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (which lack these cells) show exaggerated responses to pruritogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kardon et al., 2014</xref>), and that chemogenetic activation of Dyn-INs suppressed CQ-evoked itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). In support of this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019</xref> subsequently showed that activating galanin-expressing cells also suppresses pruritogen-evoked itch. This anti-pruritic action is likely to involve dynorphin acting on κ-opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kardon et al., 2014</xref>) as well as direct inhibition of GRPR cells (which are an integral part of the spinal itch pathway) by GABA and/or glycine released from the dynorphin/galanin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Liu et al also showed that ablating galanin-expressing cells enhances pruritogen-evoked itch, and consistent with this we find enhancement of CQ-evoked itch when cells belonging to this population are silenced by injecting AAV.flex.TeLC into <italic>Pdyn<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>Here, we show that activating NPY cells also strongly suppresses CQ-evoked itch. This is at odds with findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acton et al., 2019</xref>, who reported that chemogenetic activation of NPY-lineage neurons failed to alter scratching in response to CQ. There are technical differences between these studies, since Acton et al. used a reporter mouse line to express hM3Dq, and injected CQ intradermally behind the ear. The discrepancy between the results of these studies is most likely to result from higher levels of DREADD expression following viral transfection, and therefore more effective neuronal activation. However, there may also have been a contribution from regional differences in the itch tests used (hindlimb vs. head), as well as in the neuronal populations targeted (as noted above). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourane et al., 2015</xref> reported that ablating ~70% of NPY-lineage neurons had no effect on itch evoked by CQ, we found that synaptic silencing of the NPY cells with TeLC increased CQ-evoked itch, and often resulted in development of skin lesions, presumably secondary to the spontaneous itch-related biting that was also observed. In fact, the antipruritic action of the NPY-INs may be more powerful than that of the dynorphin/galanin cells, since TeLC silencing in the <italic>Pdyn<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mouse caused less of an increase in CQ-evoked itch behaviour (compared to silencing in the Npy-Cre line) and did not result in the development of spontaneous itch or associated skin lesions. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate that both NPY-INs and Dyn-INs contribute to the suppression of pruritogen-evoked itch thus revealing an overlap of function of these neurochemically distinct inhibitory interneuron populations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>NPY cells operate through a circuit involving GRPR neurons</title><p>Both spontaneous and CQ-evoked itch behaviours were suppressed when GRPR and NPY cells were silenced simultaneously, and we show directly, using both anatomical and electrophysiological methods, that the NPY cells provide a strong inhibitory input to GRPR-INs. This indicates that GRPR cells are downstream of the NPY cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This inhibitory input to GRPR cells appears to be even more powerful than that originating from the dynorphin/galanin cells, since NPY-IR boutons accounted for 45% of the inhibitory synapses on the GRPR cells, compared to the 21% from dynorphin-IR boutons. Consistent with this we found that optogenetic activation of NPY cells elicited oIPSCs in all of the GRPR cells tested. Interestingly, these were of much higher mean amplitude (~250 pA), than the ~80 pA oIPSCs reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019</xref> in GRPR cells when galanin cells were optogenetically activated using a very similar experimental approach. The inhibition of GRPR cells by NPY-INs is likely to be predominantly GABAergic, since oIPSCs were reduced by gabazine in all cells (with one also sensitive to strychnine). Also, consistent with previous evidence showing that the majority of GRPR cells lack Y1 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), we did not detect outward currents in any of the GRPR cells that were tested with a Y1 agonist.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Suggested roles of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-expressing inhibitory interneurons in spinal itch and pain circuits.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Circuits involved in suppression of itch. NPY-INs provide a high proportion (45%) of the inhibitory synapses on GRPR-expressing excitatory interneurons. The GRPR cells have vertical (Vert) morphology and are thought to transmit itch- and pain-related information to spinal projection neurons in lamina I (LI PNs). Pruritogen-evoked itch is markedly reduced by NPY-IN activation, while silencing of NPY-INs enhances pruritogen-evoked itch and results in spontaneous itch. Dyn-INs also provide inhibitory input to GRPR cells, but only account for ~20% of their inhibitory synapses. Silencing of Dyn-INs increases pruritogen-evoked itch, but to a lesser degree than NPY-IN silencing, and without the appearance of spontaneous itch.

Chemogenetic activation of GRPR-expressing vertical cells elicits both itch- and pain-related behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Polgár et al., 2023</xref>). NPY-INs may therefore act to supress acute nociception, as well as inflammatory and neuropathic hypersensitivity, via inhibition of vertical cells. Additionally, NPY-INs have previously been shown to directly innervate nociceptive projection neurons of the anterolateral system in lamina I and laminae III–IV (LIII–IV PN).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86633-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Although GRPR-expressing excitatory interneurons have been strongly implicated in itch, we have recently shown that these cells respond to noxious as well as pruritic stimuli, that they correspond morphologically to a class of SDH excitatory interneurons known as vertical cells, and that chemogenetically activating them results in behaviours reflecting both pain and itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Polgár et al., 2023</xref>).

This direct input to ALS projection neurons will presumably contribute to the antinociceptive action of the NPY cells. The present findings raise the possibility that the powerful inhibitory GABAergic NPY-GRPR circuit that we have identified contributes not only to the alleviation of itch, but also to the suppression of nocifensive reflexes and the reduction of hypersensitivity in persistent pain states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Activating NPY cells suppresses hypersensitivity in persistent pain states</title><p>Importantly, in addition to its effect on acute nocifensive reflexes and itch, activating NPY cells also blocked thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity in both inflammatory and neuropathic pain states.

NPY acting on Y1 receptors expressed by spinal neurons is known to reduce signs of neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Solway et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nelson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Intondi et al., 2008</xref>); however, it appears that chemogenetic activation of NPY cells generated GABAergic inhibition that was sufficiently powerful to reverse the hypersensitivity independently of Y1 signalling.

The following AAV constructs were used: AAV.flex.eGFP (1.72 × 10<sup>9</sup> GC), AAV.flex.tdTomato (1.76 × 10<sup>9</sup> GC), and AAV.flex.ChR2-eYFP (5.09 × 10<sup>8</sup> GC), all from Penn Vector Core, PA, USA; AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry, University of North Carolina Vector Core, NC, USA; or University of Zurich Viral Vector Facility, Switzerland (3.8 × 10<sup>8</sup> or 7.65 × 10<sup>8</sup> GC, respectively); AAV.flex.eGFP (2 × 10<sup>8</sup> GC), AAV.flex.TeLC.eGFP (2 × 10<sup>8</sup> GC), and AAV.FRT.mCherry (8.7 × 10<sup>8</sup> GC), all from University of Zurich Viral Vector Facility, Switzerland; and AAV-Brainbow2 (1.5–5.96 × 10<sup>7</sup> GC), Addgene, MA, USA. Further details of the viruses used can be found in the Key Resources Table. 300 nl of virus was infused per injection site (or 500 nl for AAV-Brainbow2) at a rate of 30–40 nl/min using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, MA, USA). Pipettes were left within the spinal cord for 5 min to minimise leakage of injectate. Once injections were complete the wound was closed and animals recovered with appropriate analgesic administration (0.3 mg/kg buprenorphine and 5 mg/kg carprofen). The success of spinal AAV injections was assessed by post hoc immunohistochemical staining for the appropriate fluorescent marker protein. Mice were only included for behavioural analyses if the AAV injection(s) into the spinal segments relevant to the dermatome(s) being tested were successful (L4 and L5 for plantar hindpaw-directed tests, L3 for calf skin-directed tests; see below). In some experiments Npy-Cre;<italic>Grpr<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> mice were injected with AAV.flex.eGFP or AAV.flex.TeLC.eGFP, which should result in both NPY- and GRPR-expressing virus-infected cells being labelled with eGFP. This was confirmed for each injection site in each animal by two methods: (1) by assessing the distribution of eGFP-labelled cells, as NPY-INs are located throughout laminae I–III, whereas GRPR-INs are almost entirely restricted to laminae I and IIo, and (2) by antibody co-staining for the inhibitory marker Pax2, as NPY-INs in laminae I–III are exclusively inhibitory, whereas GRPR-INs in laminae I and IIo are exclusively excitatory. Post-AAV-injection behavioural testing was performed within 1–5 weeks for experiments using AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry, and within 4–6 days for experiments using AAV.flex.TeLC.eGFP. For anatomical analyses of inhibitory synaptic input on to GRPR-INs AAV-Brainbow2 injections were performed unilaterally into the L3 and L5 segments and mice were perfused 2–3 weeks post-surgery. For electrophysiological studies, AAV.flex.ChR2-eYFP, on some occasions combined with AAV.FRT.mCherry, was injected unilaterally or bilaterally into the L3 and/or L5 segments and spinal cord slices were prepared from the mice 1–3 weeks post-surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Intraplantar CFA injections</title><p>Mice were briefly anaesthetised with 1–2% isoflurane, the plantar surface of the hindpaw ipsilateral to the spinal AAV injection was wiped with 70% ethanol and 20 µl of 1 mg/ml CFA was injected subcutaneously.

The tibial and common peroneal branches were identified, and 7–0 Mersilk (Ethicon, Puerto Rico) was used to apply two tight ligatures 2–3 mm apart on each nerve branch. The length of nerve between the ligatures was then removed and the wound was closed. Great care was taken to avoid damage to the sural branch of the sciatic nerve during the surgery. Behavioural testing was performed prior to (pre-SNI baseline) and from 2 to 4 weeks following SNI surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Drug administration</title><p>CNO (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) dissolved in a 10% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO)/90% sterile saline mixture was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 5 mg/kg; 10% DMSO/90% sterile saline mixture alone was used as a vehicle control. In some cases, we used CNO-dihydrochloride (Tocris Bioscience), dissolved in 10% water/90% sterile saline at a dose of 5 mg/kg, with 10% water/90% sterile saline as a vehicle control. For some experiments, the Y1 antagonist BMS 193885 (Bio-Techne, Abingdon, UK) dissolved in a 40% PEG-400/60% sterile saline mixture was co-injected i.p. at a dose of 10 mg/kg with CNO; co-injection of the respective vehicles for CNO and BMS 193885 was used as a control. Gabapentin (Sigma-Aldrich) was injected i.p. at a dose of 100 mg/kg. The timing of CNO or gabapentin injections for CPP testing are described in the relevant section below. For all other behavioural testing, CNO, CNO + BMS 193885 or vehicle were injected a minimum of 30 min prior to the start of testing, and all testing was completed within a maximum of 5 hr following injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioural testing</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>von Frey test (noxious punctate mechanical sensitivity)</title><p>Mice were placed in a plastic enclosure with mesh flooring and allowed to acclimatise for at least 45 min. von Frey filaments of logarithmically incremental stiffness (range 0.01–4 g) were applied to the plantar surface of the hindpaw and the 50% MWT was determined using Dixon’s up-down method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaplan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dixon, 1980</xref>). Briefly, filaments were applied sequentially, beginning with the mid-range filament (0.4 g), and the presence or absence of a withdrawal response (lifting and/or shaking of the paw) was noted. If a withdrawal response was observed, the next lowest filament was used subsequently; if no response was observed, the next highest filament was used subsequently. Testing continued until a series of six filaments had been applied from the point when the response threshold was first crossed, and the 50% MWT was calculated using the formula 50% MWT = (10<sup>[<italic>Xf</italic>+<italic>kδ</italic>]</sup>)/10,000, where <italic>Xf</italic> = log value of the final filament applied, <italic>k</italic> = tabular value (taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaplan et al., 1994</xref>) based on the pattern of six positive/negative responses and <italic>δ</italic> = mean difference (in log units) of the range of filaments used (0.323).

A radiant heat source (IITC, CA, USA) set to 25% active intensity was targeted to the plantar surface of the hindpaw to be tested (using an angled mirror and guide light), and the time until paw withdrawal from the heat source (withdrawal latency) was noted. Testing of ipsi- and contralateral paws was alternated with at least 3-min interval between consecutive tests, and a cut-off time of 25 s was used to prevent tissue damage. Each hindpaw was tested five times, and the average withdrawal latency calculated.

They then received 10 µl of 1% CQ dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) via intradermal injection into the calf ipsilateral to the spinal AAV injection (which had been shaved 24 hr prior to testing). Successful intradermal injection of CQ was assessed by the appearance of a skin bleb at the injection site. Mice were video recorded for 30 min following CQ injection (post-CQ). The amount of time spent biting the injected area was scored offline either manually with a stopwatch or using BORIS event logging software (freely available, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.boris.unito.it/">https://www.boris.unito.it/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friard et al., 2016</xref>).

The custom 3-chamber CPP apparatus consisted of two conditioning side chambers (170 × 150 mm) connected by a centre chamber (70 × 75 mm), 180 mm tall, with infrared-transparent plastic lids (QD Plastics, Dumbarton, UK). Mice were able to discriminate between chambers using visual (vertical vs. horizontal black-and-white striped walls) and sensory (rough vs. smooth textured floor) cues. On day 1 (acclimation, 7 days after SNI surgery), mice had free access to explore all chambers for 30 min. On days 2 and 3 (preconditioning), mice were again allowed to freely explore for 30 min whilst their position was recorded using an infrared camera and AnyMaze 7.16 software (Stoelting, USA). To avoid pre-existing chamber bias, mice spending more than 90% or less than 5% of time in either side chamber during preconditioning were excluded (1 mouse from each experimental group). For conditioning (days 4–6), each morning, mice received i.p. vehicle injection, were returned to their home cage for 5 min, then confined to their preferred side chamber for 30 min. Four hours later, mice received i.p. CNO (5 mg/kg) or gabapentin (100 mg/kg), were returned to their home cage for 5 min, and then placed in their non-preferred chamber for 30 min. On test day (day 7), mice could freely explore all chambers whilst their position was recorded, as during pre-conditioning, for 30 min. Difference scores were calculated as the time spent in each chamber on test day minus the mean time spent during pre-conditioning. We have previously shown that CNO given at a much lower dose (0.2 mg/kg) to mice in which spinal GRPR neurons expressed hM3Dq resulted in itch- and pain-related behaviours that started within 5 min of administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Polgár et al., 2023</xref>). It is therefore very likely that NPY neurons would have been activated throughout the conditioning period for CNO. In addition, the timecourse of action of CNO and gabapentin are likely to be similar, since both were administered i.p., and there was a clear preference for the chamber paired with gabapentin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Noxious heat and pruritic induction of Fos</title><p>Mice were injected i.p. with CNO or vehicle 30 min prior to receiving noxious heat or pruritic stimulation under brief isoflurane anaesthesia, ipsilateral to spinal AAV.flex.hM3Dq-mCherry injection. The noxious heat stimulus was immersion of the hindpaw into 52°C water for 15 s. The pruritic stimulus was intradermal injection of CQ into the calf as described above, following shaving of the leg 24 hr prior to CQ injection. These mice were fitted with Elizabethan collars to prevent Fos induction through scratching and/or biting of the injected area. Mice were transcardially perfused under deep terminal general anaesthesia 2 hr after stimulation, and spinal cord tissue was processed for imaging and analysis as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Electrophysiological studies were performed on spinal cord slices from Npy-Cre or Npy-Cre;<italic>Grpr<sup>FLPo</sup></italic> mice that had received an intraspinal injection of AAV.flex.ChR2-eYFP or AAV.flex.ChR2-eYFP combined with AAV.FRT.mCherry, respectively, 1–3 weeks prior to recordings. Additional recordings were performed on spinal cord slices from <italic>Grpr<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic>;Ai9 mice.

Mice were decapitated under isoflurane anaesthesia and the spinal cord removed in ice-cold dissection solution. In some cases decapitation was performed following transcardial perfusion with ice-cold dissection solution under terminal anaesthesia with pentobarbital (20 mg i.p.). The lumbar region was embedded in an agarose block and 300 µm parasagittal or 350 µm transverse slices were cut with a vibrating blade microtome (Thermo Scientific Microm HM 650V, Loughborough, UK; Leica VT1200s, Milton Keynes, UK; or Campden Instruments 7000smz-2, Loughborough, UK).

The presence of optogenetically activated currents were observed in voltage clamp mode, from a holding potential of −70 mV, by illuminating the slice with brief (1–4 ms) pulses of blue light, generated by a 470-nm LED (CoolLED pE-100, Andover, UK) and delivered via the microscope objective. The ability to optogenetically drive action potential firing in NPY neurons was similarly tested by applying brief pulses of blue light while the membrane potential was held around −60 mV in current clamp mode.</p><p>Inhibition from NPY cells to other cells in the SDH was investigated in tissue from Npy-Cre mice, by recording from ChR2-eYFP-negative cells that were within the region of the viral injection, as determined by eYFP expression, and applying pulses of blue light as detailed above. Inhibition of GRPR cells by NPY cells was similarly assessed by recording from mCherry+ GRPR cells in slices from Npy-Cre;<italic>Grpr<sup>FLPo</sup></italic> mice. Cells were classed as receiving optogenetically evoked IPSCs (olPSCs) if there was a clear reliably evoked inward current (CsCl-based intracellular, <italic>V</italic><sub>hold</sub> −70 mV), or outward current (K-based intracellular, <italic>V</italic><sub>hold</sub> −40 mV; Cs-methanesulfonate-based intracellular, <italic>V</italic><sub>hold</sub> 0 mV), that was time locked to the light pulse. In a subset of recordings, using CsCl-based intracellular solution (<italic>V</italic><sub>hold</sub> −70 mV), the optogenetically evoked postsynaptic currents were confirmed to be non-glutamatergic by bath application of NBQX (10 µM) and D-APV (30 µM). The nature of the oIPSCs recorded in unlabelled (CsCl-based intracellular, <italic>V</italic><sub>hold</sub> −70 mV) and GRPR (Cs-methanesulfonate-based intracellular, <italic>V</italic><sub>hold</sub> 0 mV) cells was investigated by bath application of the GABA antagonist, gabazine (300 nM) and the glycine antagonist, strychnine (300 nM); in the case of unlabelled cells this was done in the presence of NBQX and D-APV. oIPSCs were evoked six times (0.05 Hz) (Baseline) prior to the application of gabazine or strychnine, which was added to the recording solution and washed into the recording chamber for 5 min before and during the recording of a further six oIPSCs. Strychnine was then added to gabazine or gabazine added to strychnine and following a further 5 min wash in period six oIPSCs were recorded. oIPSCs were classified as ‘sensitive’ to gabazine and/or strychnine if the drug reduced the mean peak amplitude of the oIPSC to a level that was less than 2 SD of the mean peak amplitude recorded during baseline or the previous drug application, and ‘insensitive’ if this threshold was not met. The monosynaptic nature of the oIPSCs was tested in a subset of GRPR cells, by investigating whether oIPSCs that were abolished by the application of TTX (0.5 µM) could be rescued by the addition of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 100 µM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>).

All structures labelled with the neuronal marker NeuN that had their bottom surface between reference and look-up sections separated by 10 µm (10 optical sections) were marked within the injection site in laminae I–III. The NPY-IR, eGFP, and/or tdTomato channels were then viewed separately and sequentially, and the NeuN profiles were marked as positive or negative as appropriate. As NPY-IR varies greatly from cell to cell and is often observed as discrete clumps within the perikaryal cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iwagaki et al., 2016</xref>), cells were classified as NPY-positive if clear above-background signal was observed in at least three consecutive optical sections.

Cell selection was performed before the staining for axonal markers was visualised and was based on the completeness of dendritic labelling and separation from other nearby mTFP-labelled neurons. The selected cells were scanned through a ×63 oil-immersion lens (numerical aperture 1.4) at a z-separation of 0.3 µm. Z-series were obtained from as much of the dendritic tree as was visible in the section. For analysis, the mTFP and gephyrin channels were initially viewed and the cell bodies and dendritic trees were traced based on the mTFP signal. The locations of all gephyrin puncta associated with the cell body and dendritic tree were then plotted. The VGAT channel was then viewed and the presence or absence of an apposed VGAT-IR bouton was noted for each gephyrin punctum. Finally, the remaining channel (corresponding to NPY or dynorphin B) was revealed and the presence or absence of peptide staining was noted for each of the VGAT boutons that contacted a gephyrin punctum on the selected cell. To determine the frequency of all boutons arising from inhibitory interneurons that were positive for each of the neuropeptides, we sampled from those VGAT-IR boutons in the vicinity of the mTFP-labelled cell. A 4 × 4 µm grid was applied within a box drawn to include the entire dendritic tree of the cell. Only the VGAT channel was viewed initially and in each successive grid square, the VGAT-IR bouton nearest the bottom right of the square was selected. The presence or absence of NPY or dynorphin B was then recorded for each of these selected VGAT-IR boutons.</p><p>For comparison of <italic>Cre</italic> and <italic>Npy</italic> mRNA in FISH sections, all NucBlue profiles within a single optical section were marked throughout laminae I–III. The <italic>Cre</italic> and <italic>Npy</italic> channels were then viewed separately and sequentially and cells were marked as positive if they contained ≥4 labelled transcript particles. Markers from the mRNA channel that was assessed first were hidden during assessment of the second channel to prevent bias.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Data are reported as mean ± standard error of the mean, unless stated otherwise. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism software (v7, v8, and v9, GraphPad Software, CA, USA). Behavioural and anatomical analyses involving drug treatments were analysed blind to treatment group. Behavioural analyses involving AAV.flex.TeLC.eGFP-mediated silencing and AAV.flex.eGFP-injected controls were analysed blind to the AAV injected. The statistical tests used for each experiment, including tests for multiple comparisons, are given in the appropriate figure legends. A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant, and significance markers are denoted within figures as follows: *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001, ****p &lt; 0.0001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were approved by the Ethical Review Process Applications Panel of the University of Glasgow, and were carried out in accordance with the European Community directive 86/609/EC, the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and ARRIVE guidelines.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-86633-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data can be accessed from an open repository at the following link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5525/gla.researchdata.1448">http://dx.doi.org/10.5525/gla.researchdata.1448</ext-link>.

Here peripheral inputs are processed by local interneuron circuitry before ascending to the brain. The spinal dorsal horn is organized into lamina with the resident interneurons differentiated by their anatomy, physiological and molecular properties. Over the past decade, the restricted expression of select genes has been used to assign potential function to dorsal horn neuron &quot;cell types&quot;. This type of work has relied on the genesis of Cre-reporter mouse strains and intersectional tools to generate mice where select sets of neurons can be activated, inhibited, or ablated. The picture that has emerged from these types of experiments is murky but favors the model where there exist genetically defined cell-types play distinct roles in the detection of painful, itchy, thermal, and mechanical stimuli under normal and pathological situations. The current work by Boyle and colleagues concerns itself with the dorsal horn neurons expressing the neuropeptide NPY. This study is directly related to previously published work that demonstrated that ablating spinal cord neurons that express Npy, including those who express this gene transiently during development, resulted in mice that had heightened touch-evoked itch that seemed different from the canonical chemical itch pathways previously identified. A major conclusion from this previous work was that other modalities were unaffected. Subsequent work built on these findings to identify the potential touch inputs and spinal neuron expressing the Npy receptor as part of a mechanical itch circuit.</p><p>This current work by Boyle and colleagues challenge challenges this view by providing evidence that in adult mice, the dorsal horn neurons expressing Npy function to broadly inhibit pain and itch. The authors use direct injection of viral vectors, chemogenetics and synaptic silencing to probe the behavioral effects of stimulating or silencing Npy-expressing dorsal horn neurons in a variety of assays under normal and pathological conditions known to produce allodynia and hyperalgesia. Overall, this is a rather carefully conducted study with the appropriate controls. The data are clear, the effect sizes robust and the presentation easy to follow. These findings challenge the conclusion that these neurons are involved selectively in mechanical itch and instead reveal a potentially clinically important group of neurons for pain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86633.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Whether and how molecularly defined neuronal groups in the spinal cord process distinct modalities are of great interest. In this study, Boyle et al. characterized roles of inhibitory neurons expressing NPY in adult mice. By using chemogenetic, electrophysiological tools and behavioral measurements, the authors discovered that activating NPY+ interneurons strongly reduced pruritogen-evoked itch and reflexive behaviors (acute nociception or under inflammation / neuropathic pain states). Silencing NPY+ spinal interneurons enhanced spontaneous and chemical itch in a GRPR+ neurons dependent manner. The authors concluded that, unlike previous findings suggesting that these neurons are selective for mechanical itch, adult NPY+ interneurons play dual roles in gating various types of itch and pain.</p><p>The authors performed careful characterization and comparisons between development lineage and adult spinal neurons expressing NPY.

While the function of these neurons has been addressed previously, the difference to previous studies is the combinatorial use of AAV encoded effectors and cre transgenic mice whereas previous studies relied on cre transgenic mice and reporter mice encoding the effector or only viruses. Boyle at al. demonstrate that their strategy enabled them to restrict the analysis to only those neurons expressing NPY in the adult mouse compared to a more heterogenous population that had been studied before. By using a combination of morphology, electrophysiology and behavioral paradigms they convincingly show that NPY neurons impact pruritoception via inhibiting GRPR neurons. Furthermore, they indicate a role of NPY neurons also in nociception as activation attenuates not only responses to acute nociceptive stimuli but also blocks inflammation or nerve injury induced mechanical and heat hypersensitivity. Selectively activating NPY neurons in vivo may therefore be a promising strategy to treat neuropathic pain.</p><p>The result of this study extends and partially contrast previous studies. The authors argue that contrasting results may be due to the different experimental strategies (e.g. only neurons expressing NPY adult in the present study versus a more heterogeneous population before).</p><p>Overall, the experiments are convincing, and the quality of the data/figures is exceptionally high.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The strikingly different conclusion from the previous Bourane study seems to stem from the experimental approaches. Rather than using genetic crosses that target all neurons from the hindbrain and spinal cord that express Npy at any point in development, Boyle et al target their manipulations specifically to the lumbar region of the superficial dorsal horn in adult mice using direct viral injections. Thus, Boyle is almost certainly manipulating much fewer neurons that the original study. How then is their behavioral effects so much greater? At the minimum, the authors need to discuss this discrepancy head on. Better would be a direct molecular/anatomical comparison of the neurons targeted by each approach. This could be done using Nyp-Cre mice crossed to a Rosa-LSL-reporter strain and quantifying the overlap with the same markers used here. Perhaps, the intersectional approach with Lbx1 resulted in labeling of a different population of neurons than the adult AAV injections? Although likely outside the scope, given this work directly questions the main conclusion of the Bourane paper, it will be important to see a replication of the original finding of selectivity to mechanical itch.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We agree that our approach should be manipulating a smaller population of neurons, and that it is therefore suprising that we see greater behavioural effects. Please see our response to &quot;Weakness 1&quot; of Reviewer 2 for consideration of this point. We have already provided a direct molecular comparison as requested by the reviewer, and this appears in Figure 1 supplement 1. Here we used tissue from NPY::Cre that had been crossed with Ai9 mice (i.e. a Rosa-LSL-reporter) and had received intraspinal injections of AAV.flex.GFP. We then characterised the neurochemistry of tdTomato+ cells that were GFP+ or GFP-negative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors state that, &quot;91.6% ± 0.3% of cells classed as Cre-positive cells were also Npy-positive, and these accounted for 62.1% ± 0.6% of Npy-positive cells&quot; If I am reading this correctly, does that mean that 40% of the Npy+ cells are Cre negative? If so, how is this possible?</p></disp-quote><p>This interpretation is correct. For quantification of RNAscope data we used a cut-off level of 4 transcripts, and cells with fewer than 4 transcripts were classed as negative. It is likely that some of the NPY cells classified as negative for Cre would have had some Cre mRNA (sufficient to cause recombination), but at a level below this threshold. It is also possible that some NPY+ cells would fail to express Cre, since this is a BAC transgenic mouse, rather than a knock-in.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Similarly, the authors state that &quot;great majority of FP-expressing neurons in laminae I-III were immunoreactive (IR) for NPY (78.5% ± 3.6%), and these accounted for 74.6% ± 109 1.9% of the NPY-IR neurons in this area&quot;. So does this mean 20% of the recombination is non-specific/in other cell types that could be involved in pain/itch sensation?</p></disp-quote><p>Our finding that 91.6% of cells with Cre mRNA were also positive for Npy mRNA (see above) indicates that Cre expression was largely restricted to NPY cells. The failure to detect NPY peptide in some of these cells probably results from the relatively low level of peptide seen in the cell bodies of peptidergic neurons, which results from the rapid transport of peptides into their axons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Comparing Fig 3B and Fig4B it seems the control baseline von Frey responses are different. In fact, baseline response in Fig4b is quite like the CNO effect in Fig 3B. Unless I'm misunderstanding something, this seems quite odd?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there is a difference between the baseline responses. We are not aware of any particular reason for this, and we think that it reflects a degree of variability that is seen with the von Frey test. Interestingly, the baseline values for the SNI cohort (Fig 4E) lies between the values in Fig 3B and Fig 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Fig 4E, the behavior of the CNO treated mice is quite variable. Can the authors comment as to how this might be happening? Does the effect correlate with viral transduction?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not see any obvious correlation between the extent of viral transduction and the behaviour of individual mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Fig6, the PDyn-Cre experiment, is a bit of a non sequitur?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to &quot;Weakness 2&quot; of Reviewer 2 for consideration of this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The conclusion is unusually long. I recommend trimming it to make it more concise.</p></disp-quote><p>We presume that this refers to the Discussion. However, this was ~1550 words, and we do not feel that that is unusually long.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Public Review):</bold></p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses</p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>There is inadequate discussion about previous studies of NPY interneurons. Specifically, the authors should address why a more restricted subset of these neurons (this study) have broader effects than seen previously.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the discussion on the discrepancies between our findings and those reported previously. We state at the outset that we are targeting a more restricted population (lines 509-10), and we now go into more detail concerning both similarities and differences between our findings and the reasons that we think may underlie any discrepancies (various changes between lines 522-575).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I cannot see the reason for including results from manipulation of Dyn+ interneurons in this paper. First, the title does not reflect roles of spinal Dyn+ population. In addition, without further experiments characterizing relationships between NPY and Dyn interneurons in modulating itch and/or nociception, Dyn datasets seem to deviate from the main theme.</p></disp-quote><p>We had previously shown that activating Dyn-INs suppressed pruritogen-evoked itch (Huang et al 2018), but it was important to test whether silencing these cells would have the opposite effect. Our finding of overlap in function (i.e. both NPY-INs and Dyn-INs suppress itch, and that both innervate GRPR cells) provides strong evidence against the idea that neurochemically-defined interneuron populations have highly specific functions, and we now state this in the Discussion. The anatomical experiments (which follow on from the functional studies) provide important new information concerning synaptic circuitry of the dorsal horn, by showing that NPY-INs preferentially innervate GRPR cells, and provide around twice as many synapses on these cells, compared to the Dyn-INs. Interestingly, this correlates with the relatively large optogenetically-evoked IPSCs that we saw when NPY-INs were activated, compared to those reported by Liu et al (2019) when galanin-expressing (which largely correspond to Dyn-INs) were activated. By including these findings in the paper, we are able to make comparisons between these two populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. While the authors provided convincing evidence that GRPR+ neurons serve as a downstream effector of NPY+ neuron evoked itch, the relationship between GRPR and NPY neurons in modulating pain is not examined. Therefore, Fig. 7B is pure speculation and should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that our recent findings that GRPR neurons correspond to vertical cells, that they respond to noxious stimuli, and that activating them results in pain-related behaviours, makes it reasonable to speculate that the NPY/GRPR circuit may also be involved in the anti-nociceptive action of NPY cells. The legend for Fig 7B already refers to this as a &quot;potential circuit&quot;, and we have toned down the corresponding part of the discussion to say that our findings &quot;raise the possibility&quot; that this is the case (lines 605-7). We feel that this part of the figure is important, as otherwise our summary diagram ignores some of the main findings of the paper, and we hope that this is now acceptable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations For The Authors</p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Fig. 1G: the &quot;misexpression&quot; of tdTomato neurons was much more prominent in deep dorsal horn laminae but not in the superficial ones. Was this representative? Can the authors perform a laminae specific characterization?</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We did test for this possibility in 2 NPY::Cre;Ai9 mice that had received intraspinal injections of AAV.flex.GFP, and found that there was a modest difference - 62% of tdTomato+ cells in laminae I-II, but only 39% of those in lamina III, were GFP+. This suggests that &quot;misexpression&quot; may have differed slightly between these regions. However, since the difference was quite modest, and we were only able to analyse tissue from two mice in this way, we did not include these findings in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I have a lot of problems interpreting the c-Fos data in Fig. 2 E and F. For the mCherry- population, how was the quantification performed? From the image, it does not look like 2030% of cells express c-Fos; at a minimum a clear stain of neurons would be needed. Similarly, the identification of NPY cells is not particularly convincing (e.g., middle arrowhead lower 2 panels in C).</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided further details on how the analysis was performed (changes made to lines 1016-29). NeuN staining was used to reveal all neurons, and a modified optical disector method was performed from somatotopically appropriate regions of the dorsal horn. As noted by the Reviewer, NeuN staining was required to allow identification of mCherrynegative cells. However, we have not included the NeuN immunoreactivity in the image, as this would add considerably to the complexity. These images are from single optical sections, and therefore the overall numbers of cells are low (in comparison to what would be seen in a projected image). The intensity of mCherry staining varied between cells. However, for all mCherry-positive cells (including the example referred to by the Reviewer), there was clear staining in the membrane, which could be followed in serial sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Yet, suppression of c-fos activity in excitatory spinal dh neurons was observed 30min after CNO injection.

We found that these started within 5 minutes of i.p. CNO injection (e.g. Fig S2 in that paper). In addition, the timecourse of action of gabapentin and CNO (both given i.p.) are likely to be similar, and there was a preference for the chamber paired with gabapentin. We are therefore confident that the conditioning period with CNO was adequate. We now explain this in the Methods section (lines 846-52). The timing of CNO injections for the nociceptive and CQ tests is now described (lines 749-55).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
