origin-of-life studies and synthetic biology. In each of these fields, the development of model systems with varied and tuneable material properties is of great importance for replicating properties of life. Here, we develop a ligase ribozyme system capable of concatenating short RNA fragments into long chains. Our results show that the formation of coacervate microdroplets with the ligase ribozyme and poly(L-lysine) enhances ribozyme rate and yield, which in turn increases the length of the anionic polymer component of the system and imparts specific physical properties to the droplets. Droplets containing active ribozyme sequences resist growth, do not wet or spread on unpassivated surfaces, and exhibit reduced transfer of RNA between droplets when compared to controls containing inactive sequences. These altered behaviours, which stem from RNA sequence and catalytic activity, constitute a specific phenotype and potential fitness advantage, opening the door to selection and evolution experiments based on a genotype–phenotype linkage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ribozyme</kwd><kwd>coacervates</kwd><kwd>peptide</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>364653263</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salibi</surname><given-names>Elia</given-names></name><name><surname>Mutschler</surname><given-names>Hannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>802000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mutschler</surname><given-names>Hannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>92772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le Vay</surname><given-names>Kristian Kyle</given-names></name><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Basusree</given-names></name><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>TY Dora</given-names></name><name><surname>Mutschler</surname><given-names>Hannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Open access funding provided by Max Planck Society.

Condensed phases studied in the context of origin of life can also be formed from RNA and peptides. Catalytic nucleic acids, including ribozymes and DNAzymes, are central to ‘Nucleic Acid World’ hypotheses, where they act as both the medium of information storage and the catalyst for its replication in early life-like systems. Peptide–RNA condensation forms discrete protocellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oparin, 1965</xref>). RNA–peptide interactions are in many cases beneficial for the function of these early catalysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frenkel-Pinter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tagami et al., 2017</xref>), and may promote the folding and oligomerisation of certain peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seal et al., 2022</xref>). Perhaps surprisingly, the function of ribozymes and other nucleic acid enzymes in coacervate phases has only been recently established, with catalytic rate being enhanced and enzyme function altered in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drobot et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poudyal et al., 2019a</xref>; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poudyal et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iglesias-Artola et al., 2022</xref>). For example, coacervation with poly(L-lysine) shifts the reaction equilibrium of a minimal hairpin ribozyme from cleavage to ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Vay et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The ability of coacervate phases to strongly partition a wide range of molecular and macromolecular species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frankel et al., 2016</xref>), and to support a variety of complex enzymatic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dora Tang et al., 2015</xref>), makes them appealing proto- and artificial cell models in origin-of-life studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghosh et al., 2021a</xref>), synthetic biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Stevendaal et al., 2021</xref>), and modern biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yewdall et al., 2021</xref>). Simple coacervates that form from oppositely charged polymers have been rigorously investigated for their ability to selectively partition biomolecules and host a variety of different chemistries and reactions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yewdall et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakashima et al., 2019</xref>). However, biological condensates formed by protein–protein or protein–nucleic acid interactions are dynamic systems, and their formation, dissolution, and physical properties are subject to spatiotemporal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ismail et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, in order to realise a truly convincing model proto- or artificial cell, life-like behaviours such as growth, division, and other dynamic, responsive or non-equilibrium processes are essential. Several dynamic and responsive coacervate systems have been established, which are characterised by a phase change in response to environmental stimuli such as light exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kubota et al., 2022</xref>), changes in temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2021</xref>), or pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Love et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karoui et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, non-equilibrium environments formed by gas bubbles inside heated rock pores have been shown to drive the growth, fusion, and division of otherwise inert coacervate microdroplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ianeselli et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Enzymatic processes that alter the properties of the coacervate components also affect coacervate properties and behaviour. In charge-based condensates, inducing phase change via enzymatic processes has been achieved by, for example, the conversion of ADP into charge-dense ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakashima et al., 2018</xref>), or the alteration of peptide charge state by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aumiller and Keating, 2016</xref>). This has allowed the reversible generation of coacervate droplets by enzymatic networks. In addition, the polymerisation of UDP in U<sub>20</sub>-spermine coacervates by polynucleotide phosphorylase has been shown to induce transient non-spherical coacervate morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spoelstra et al., 2020</xref>). All these systems depend on the action of proteinaceous enzymes, which presumably emerged later in molecular evolution, perhaps after the first protocells. However, droplets capable of dynamic change via the action of nucleic acid enzymes such as ribozymes have not been previously reported, partially because the catalytic repertoire of these catalysts is limited when compared to their proteinaceous counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doudna and Lorsch, 2005</xref>). Beyond environmental factors such as solution pH and salt concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2018</xref>), the physical properties and association behaviour of coacervate droplets are determined by factors such as component chain length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spruijt et al., 2010</xref>) and charge density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neitzel et al., 2021</xref>). Of these factors, we noted that polymer chain length could potentially be addressed by the action of a nucleolytic or ligase ribozyme. Thus, in a coacervate composed of RNA and a positively charged polymer, ribozyme-catalysed RNA cleavage or ligation might alter the physical properties or association behaviour of the system if a sufficiently large change in average RNA length were achieved. In particular, we hypothesised that the elongation of the RNA component could lead to the formation of a denser separated phase with altered physical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we demonstrate that coacervate microdroplets formed from a ligase ribozyme and lysine-based peptides display reciprocal and synergistic behaviour, in which coacervation enhances and modulates ribozyme activity, and ribozyme activity modulates droplet properties and therefore phenotype. We employ a modified ligase ribozyme that ligates short substrate strands into long concatemers, thus increasing the length of the polyanionic coacervate component. We find that coacervation enhances the rate of substrate ligation 50-fold and inhibits the formation of circular reaction products. In turn, the activity of the ribozyme imparts specific physical properties or phenotypes to the droplets it is contained within, which are not observed in droplets containing inactive ribozymes. These altered behaviours include the inhibition of droplet growth, surface wetting, and content exchange, which could provide fitness advantages under certain conditions. Connecting the sequence information of the ribozyme RNA to the physical properties of the resulting microdroplets is an example of a phenotype–genotype linkage, which is a fundamental requirement for the Darwinian evolution of protocellular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tawfik and Griffiths, 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the effect of ribozyme activity on coacervate behaviour, we initially sought to design a ribozyme system capable of increasing RNA chain length via concatenation. Although several examples of RNA ligase ribozymes have previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paul and Joyce, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ekland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayden et al., 2005</xref>), these typically catalyse the ligation of a single junction, which results in only a modest overall increase in average RNA chain length. To achieve greater product lengths, we harnessed the catalytic core of the R3C ligase ribozyme (E<sub>R</sub>), whose RNA ligation activity is based on 5′-triphosphate activated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paul and Joyce, 2002</xref>). This system has recently been shown to be active in the presence of poly(L-lysine) under certain conditions, and so was a promising starting point when considering compatibility with coacervate systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iglesias-Artola et al., 2022</xref>). We previously redesigned the ribozyme–substrate complex to iteratively produce long RNA concatemers from short oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matreux et al., 2021</xref>). In our final design, the ribozyme (E<sub>L</sub>) catalyses concatenation of a 31 nt substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Screening of reaction conditions established that strong activity was observed at pH 8.6 in the presence of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at a range of temperatures (30, 37, and 45°C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The strongest activity was observed with a 1:1 monomer concentration ratio of substrate:ribozyme, while excess substrate inhibited the formation of longer length products at lower temperatures, most likely because the ribozyme has a higher probability of binding unligated substrates than already growing chains. In order to reduce hydrolytic degradation of RNA, we chose to maximise activity at 30°C with a 1:1 substrate:ribozyme ratio in all subsequent experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design of the E<sub>L</sub> R3C ladder ribozyme system and activity in the presence of (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub> peptides.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The secondary structure of the ladder ribozyme and a schematic showing its function.

The reaction products were separated by urea PAGE and stained using SYBR Gold to visualise all reaction components. The activity of the ribozyme was inhibited in the presence of excess peptide ((Lys)<sub>19-72</sub>:RNA &gt; 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), but yields of extended products at the endpoint of the reaction (2 hr) were enhanced above the solution reaction at lower ratios (lane profiles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The reported concentration ratios are calculated from RNA and peptide monomer unit concentrations, and as such are also equivalent to charge ratios. The addition of (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub> led to a gradual increase in turbidity due to phase separation above the critical coacervation concentration of CCC<sub>19-72</sub> ≈ 0.14:1 (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub>:RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). These experiments were repeated with a shorter peptide ((Lys)<sub>5-24</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), for which the onset of coacervation occurred at higher peptide:RNA ratios (CCC<sub>5-24</sub> ≈ 0.93:1 (Lys)<sub>5-24</sub>:RNA), corroborating previous observations with poly(L-lysine) and the HPz ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Vay et al., 2021</xref>). In this case, the activity of the ribozyme was not inhibited in the presence of excess peptide, and again yields of extended products were enhanced above the solution condition (lane profiles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). For further experimentation, we selected specific peptide:RNA ratios of 0.75:1 (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub>:RNA and 3:1 (Lys)<sub>5-24</sub>:RNA, both of which supported coacervation and ribozyme catalysis. Different concentration ratios are required to produce similar droplets for each peptide due to their differing critical coacervation concentrations. Both selected concentration ratios corresponded to points immediately before the plateau in the respective peptide titration turbidity curves and allowed the formation of liquid coacervate droplets without suppression of ribozyme activity. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Fluorescence imaging of samples at these ratios confirmed the formation of phase-separated coacervate droplets that strongly partitioned the Cy5-labelled RNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the kinetics of chain elongation and quantify the final product length, we conducted experiments using a 5′-fluorescently labelled substrate to visualise ligation products. At the chosen ratios, ligation rate and product length were greatly enhanced in the coacervate phase compared to solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The kinetic analyses show that the addition of either (Lys)<sub>n</sub> peptide resulted in an approximately 50-fold increase in the rate of concatenation and led to the formation of substrate chains with an average length approximately 30 nt greater than those produced in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In solution, the kinetics of chain elongation were best approximated using a first order model (<italic>k</italic> = 1.5 × 10<sup>–2</sup> ± 1.0 × 10<sup>–3</sup> min<sup>–1</sup>), and a final average product length (n) of 52.2 ± 0.5 nt was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In the (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub> coacervate phase, the ribozyme kinetics were best described by a two-phase model (<italic>k</italic><sub>fast</sub> = 7.7 × 10<sup>–1</sup> ± 0.7 × 10<sup>–1</sup> min<sup>–1</sup>, <italic>k</italic><sub>slow</sub> = 6.6 × 10<sup>–2</sup> ± 1.3 × 10<sup>–2</sup> min<sup>–1</sup>), with a final product length of n = 77.8 ± 0.4 nt for (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub>. Similar values were obtained for the short peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e</xref>, Source data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s2sdata4">Figure 1—figure supplement 2—source data 4</xref>). We have previously observed a coacervation-induced shift from monophasic to biphasic kinetic behaviour for the hammerhead ribozyme, albeit without an associated increase in rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drobot et al., 2018</xref>). High local RNA and Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations may lead to enhanced activity by promoting folding and increasing substrate and Mg<sup>2+</sup> cofactor abundance within the RNA–peptide coacervates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iglesias-Artola et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frankel et al., 2016</xref>). To clarify origin of the enhancement reported here, we performed reactions at varying total RNA concentrations, varying MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations and in the presence of crowding agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Briefly, doubling the current total RNA concentration increased product yields, but not to the level observed in the presence of poly(L-lysine), whilst halving the current total RNA concentration reduced product yields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>). The addition of either PEG or increased MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations to the reaction mixture increased reaction yields relative to solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4b and c</xref>), although again not to the same extent as phase separation with poly(L-lysine). We then tested the effect of combinations of PEG and Mg<sup>2+</sup> on activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4d</xref>) and found that under certain conditions the presence of the crowding agent and additional Mg<sup>2+</sup> resulted in ligation yields similar to those observed in the RNA-peptide coacervates. These results suggest that multiple factors, including increased concentrations of both RNA and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, are required for enhanced activity in the RNA-peptide coacervates.</p><p>In solution, the E<sub>L</sub> ribozyme produced both linear and circular concatenates, the latter of which are visible on urea PAGE gels as additional bands visible in between and above the regularly spaced linear ladder of products due to the different mobility of linear and circular products through the gel matrix. The presence of circular products was confirmed by treatment of reacted RNA with RNase R, a 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease that only digests linear strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The presence of the long peptide (0.75:1 (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub>:RNA) suppressed circularisation altogether, whilst the short peptide (3:1 (Lys)<sub>5-24</sub>:RNA) reduced the formation of circular products.</p><p>Having demonstrated that the E<sub>L</sub> ribozyme is capable of substrate concatenation in both solution and in (Lys)<sub>n</sub> coacervate droplets, and that its activity is enhanced within the coacervate environment, we aimed to determine whether the elongation of the RNA component would lead to differences in droplet properties, thus altering phenotype. To identify changes due solely to chain concatenation, we developed an inactive mutant of the ribozyme by introducing several point mutations (‘Methods’, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), without altering the substrate binding region. Ribozyme activity assays revealed that the mutant was completely inactive in solution and in the presence of both (Lys)<sub>n</sub> peptides at the previously specified charge ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Populations of droplets containing either the active or inactive ribozyme were loaded into a passivated well plate and imaged over the course of 24 hr. In these experiments, (Lys)<sub>n</sub> was added to the RNA reaction mixture immediately, so that all ligation activity would occur in the presence of the peptide. In all cases, phase-separated droplets were observed which persisted over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a and c</xref>). Whilst many droplets remained static, some coarsening to form larger droplets was observed, particularly in the droplet populations containing the inactive ribozyme. To fully quantify these observations, a segmentation algorithm was used to identify droplets and thereby measure their size and population density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>). Droplets which contained active ribozyme maintained a constant average area over the 24 hr period, whilst droplets containing inactive ribozyme grew, in some cases reaching a final area more than twice that of the active system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). As the average droplet area increased for the inactive droplets, there was a concomitant decrease in droplet population density (the average number of droplets per 100 µm<sup>2</sup>), indicating that the growth was at least, in part, due to coalescence events between the droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). A minimal decrease in droplet population density was observed for active droplets, suggesting that lack of coalescence prevented growth. Similar behaviour was observed for both the long and short peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>), although for the short peptide system, the number of both active and inactive droplets decreased similarly over the course of the experiment, indicating that coalescence was not completely supressed in the active droplets. Intriguingly, some particles formed from the short peptide and active ribozyme system initially adopted a non-spherical morphology and relaxed to form round droplets over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), similar to morphological changes induced by the extension of UDP in spermine-based coacervates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spoelstra et al., 2020</xref>). This indicates that the material properties of the droplets change over time.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Sequences of DNA oligomers used in this study.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Name</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Length</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence (5' to 3')</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Substrate</bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">53</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">ATACTTCCAACAGCAGTTAAGTTGCGGTCTC<italic>TATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTC</italic></named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Active ribozyme</bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">87</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">AACTGCCGTTATCATACTTCAACCCATCCAAAGTGTTACTTACGTAACAAGTGATAACAACTTCC<italic>TATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTC</italic></named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Inactive ribozyme</bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">87</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">AACTGCCGTTAAAATACAAAAACCCATCCACGCTGTTACGGACGTAACAGGTGATAACAACTTCC<italic>TATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTC</italic></named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>T7 promoter P<sub>FWD</sub></bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">23</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAG</named-content></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Sequences of RNA oligomers used in thisstudy.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Name</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Length</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">5' end</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence (5' to 3')</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Substrate</bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">31</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Triphosphate</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">GAGACCGCAAC</named-content>UUAACUGCUGUUGGAAGUAU</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IVT</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Fluorescent sub</bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">31</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FAM or Cy5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">GAGACCGCAAC</named-content>UUAACUGCUGUUGGAAGUAU</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IDT</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Active ribozyme</bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">65</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GGAAGUUGUUAUCACUUGUUACGUAAGUAACA<break/>CUUUGGAUGGGUUGAAGUAUGAUAACGGCAGUU</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IVT/IDT</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Inactive ribozyme</bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">65</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GGAAGUUGUUAUCAC<bold>C</bold>UGUUACGU<bold>CC</bold>GUAACA<break/><bold>GCG</bold>UGGAUGGGUU<bold>UUU</bold>GUAU<bold>UU</bold>UAACGGCAGUU</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IVT/IDT</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Red bases represent inactivating mutations.</p></fn><fn><p>IVT: in vitro transcription.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Droplet morphology over time in active and inactive coacervate systems formed from R3C RNA and (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub>.</title><p>Representative images of coacervate droplets prepared with active (<bold>a, e</bold>) or inactive ribozyme (<bold>b, f</bold>) and 0.75:1 (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub>:RNA in passivated (<bold>a, b</bold>) and unpassivated (<bold>e, f,</bold>) environments.

Consequently, we repeated the previous experiment on an unpassivated polystyrene surface (Greiner µclear microplate, medium binding). The coacervate droplets containing the active ribozyme behaved as previously observed, with discrete round morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) and little change in both average droplet area and population density over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g and h</xref>). These droplets exhibited greater average areas than those in the passivated environment, likely due to wetting onto the surface. In contrast, droplets containing the inactive ribozyme wet the surface and rapidly spread, eventually merging to form a film of the condensed coacervate phase on the bottom of the well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). The measured average particle area therefore increased greatly over the course of the experiment, whilst the number of particles decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g and h</xref>).</p><p>These differences in behaviour indicate that the generation of longer RNA within the coacervate environment imparts altered physical properties on the droplets, despite maintaining a spherical morphology typical of a liquid system. To further investigate this phenomenon, we added the (Lys)<sub>5-24</sub> and (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub> peptides to pre-reacted RNA mixtures. Here, we observed that mixtures containing the active ribozyme and therefore pre-concatenated RNA initially formed non-spherical gel-like condensates with both peptides, which relaxed to form spherical droplets over the course of 24 hr, whilst mixtures with inactive ribozyme yielded spherical droplets from the outset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). This suggests that large morphological differences between active and inactive systems are not observed when peptide is added to ribozyme and substrate mixtures without pre-reaction because the average RNA length is initially identical. As the reaction proceeds in the active systems, a transition to a more viscous or gel-like state may occur whilst maintaining the initially formed spherical morphology.</p><p>Given the effect of RNA concatenation on the coacervate droplets, we asked whether the activity of the E<sub>L</sub> ribozyme could affect the interactions between different populations of droplets. Using the previously established conditions and concentration ratios, we mixed populations of droplets containing either a Cy5- or FAM-tagged substrate (10% total substrate concentration) and monitored mixing and content exchange over the course of 24 hr. These effects can be quantified by the calculation of a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), which measures the correlation of pixel intensities between the two fluorescence channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunn et al., 2011</xref>). Two coefficients were calculated: PCC<sub>droplet</sub>, which measures the degree to which fluorophores mix within individual fused droplets, and PCC<sub>pop</sub>, which is calculated on a population level and measures the degree of mixing between the two populations. Positive values indicate spatial colocalisation of fluorophores, whilst negative values indicate spatial separation of fluorophores and therefore the presence of discrete regions or populations.</p><p>Shortly following mixing, discrete populations of Cy5- and FAM-labelled droplets are clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Fused and unevenly mixed droplets containing both fluorophores are visible, providing evidence that coalescence is the mechanism of droplet growth in this system. After 24 hr, visual inspection of the images reveals that discrete populations of Cy5- and FAM-labelled droplets only persist in droplets containing the active ribozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In the inactive droplets, both fluorophores appear evenly distributed throughout the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In all cases, the PCC<sub>droplet</sub> increased over time, tending towards unity, indicating that labelled RNA was able to equilibrate within the droplets via diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). However, it is notable that the rate and magnitude of increase in PCC<sub>droplet</sub> was greater in droplets containing the inactive ribozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating greater RNA mobility. For active and inactive (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub> droplets, PCC<sub>pop</sub> was initially negative, implying discrete and distinct populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Over the course of the experiment, the active system maintained this separation, whilst the PCC<sub>pop</sub> of the inactive system tended towards unity. These trends are further confirmed by scatter plots of normalised FAM and Cy5 fluorescence intensity in individual droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), which show the clearly separated populations of active systems and mixing in inactive systems. As observed in our previous experiments, mixtures of the active ribozyme and peptide produced smaller droplets which did not grow over the course of the experiment compared to inactive populations, suggesting that droplets with inactive ribozyme are more prone to coalesce and therefore mixing than droplets containing the active ribozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e and f</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Mixing and content exchange between populations of active or inactive coacervate systems formed from R3C RNA and (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub> peptide.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) Example images of mixtures of orthogonally labelled coacervate droplets prepared with 0.75:1 (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub>:RNA containing either active (<bold>a</bold>) or inactive (<bold>b</bold>) ribozyme.

Although ribozyme systems that concatenate a short substrate have been previously reported, these do so via a reversible cyclic-phosphate-mediated mechanism, and as such the concentration of extended products decreases rapidly as product length increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mutschler et al., 2015</xref>). The R3C ligase ribozyme was thus an attractive starting point for the development of our system as the 5′-triphosphate activated reaction it catalyses is quasi-irreversible, and the ribozyme is already optimised for high rate and yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paul and Joyce, 2002</xref>). Indeed, the E<sub>L</sub> ribozyme was able to generate RNA strands of &gt;500 nt in length, including circular species, and this activity was enhanced in terms of both rate and yield in (Lys)<sub>n</sub> coacervates. Although the observation of circular products in concatenation reactions has been previously reported in ribozyme systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeancolas et al., 2021</xref>), the inhibition of this behaviour by coacervation is notable. Whilst the mechanism of this inhibition is unknown, the absence of circular products suggests that the ends of a substrate strand do not meet, hinting at a decrease in RNA mobility, increased chain stiffness, or reduced release of ligated substrate from the ribozyme within the condensed phase compared to the bulk solution. The suppression of circularisation should lead to higher overall RNA lengths as the concentration of RNA ends available for ligation is not decreased over the course of the reaction. It is challenging to quantify this difference under the current experimental setup, as measurement of the average chain lengths requires the use of a 5′ fluorescent tag (as in the kinetics experiment), which itself prevents formation of circular products due to the blocked 5′ end. A potential solution to overcome this limitation would be to use a substrate with an internal fluorophore (assuming it does not affect ligation activity) or a radiolabel.</p><p>We have previously reported that the activity of the hairpin ribozyme (HPz) is greatly enhanced in condensed phases comprised of catalytic RNA and (Lys)<sub>n</sub> peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Vay et al., 2021</xref>). The increase in turbidity observed on titrating either (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub> or (Lys)<sub>5-24</sub> into a fixed concentration of R3C ribozyme and substrate was similar to that observed for HPz, although in this study the resultant condensed phase appeared liquid rather than gel-like. This variation in condensed phase morphology may be due to the influence of RNA structure, sequence, and hybridisation state on condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vieregg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boeynaems et al., 2019</xref>), with a higher degree of single-stranded or loop structures in the E<sub>L</sub> ribozyme system. The inhibition of ribozyme activity at excess (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub>:RNA ratios was comparable to that observed in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Vay et al., 2021</xref>) and is attributed to a peptide length-dependent melting or misfolding of native nucleic acid tertiary structures at high concentrations of longer peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cakmak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nott et al., 2016</xref>). A previous study into the function of the R3C replicase ribozyme in RNA–peptide coacervates reported a similar trend: catalytic activity was inhibited at excess (Lys)<sub>n</sub>:RNA ratios for a range of peptides (n = 7, 8, 9, 10, 18, and 19–72) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iglesias-Artola et al., 2022</xref>). The present study extends the peptide concentration range in which the R3C ribozyme functions, with robust catalytic activity at ratios as high as 4:1 (Lys)<sub>5-24</sub>:RNA. A possible explanation is that commercially available (Lys)<sub>n</sub> deviates from the manufacturer’s stated size range, with the (Lys)<sub>5-24</sub> used here being predominantly comprised of oligomers between n = 3 to n = 9 in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Vay et al., 2021</xref>). These short fragments may interact only weakly with the RNA, effectively reducing the concentration of peptide oligomers that can form condensates. In general, it should be noted that the effect of phase separation on ribozyme activity in a given system is highly specific to the identity of the ribozyme and peptide, their relative concentrations, and environmental conditions such as buffer, magnesium concentration, and temperature.</p><p>The difference in growth behaviour between active and inactive droplets is a striking demonstration of how the presence of a catalytic species can modulate the physical properties and behaviour of a model protocellular system, in this case by reducing coalescence. The coarsening of liquid coacervate phases is not inevitable: growth can be also be suppressed by active chemical processes hosted within droplets that produce the polymer components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zwicker et al., 2015</xref>), although in our experiments the action of the ribozyme does not increase the concentration of RNA or peptide in the system. The formation of kinetically trapped states can also allow the persistence of static droplet populations over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ranganathan and Shakhnovich, 2020</xref>). However, increasing polymer lengths in a coacervate system results in stronger cooperative electrostatic interactions between polymer components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2018</xref>), and has been shown to affect physical parameters such as droplet water content, critical salt concentration, and condensed phase polymer concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spruijt et al., 2010</xref>), leading to denser droplets and a more depleted dilute phase. Simulations have shown that increasing RNA length modulates both the material and interfacial properties of RNA–peptide condensates, in particular increasing density and surface tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laghmach et al., 2022</xref>). RNA length also has been shown to modulate viscosity in biomolecular condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tejedor et al., 2021</xref>), which in turn determines the droplet fusion dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghosh et al., 2021b</xref>). Thus, increasing overall RNA length by R3C substrate concatenation may inhibit growth via coalescence by increasing condensate density and viscosity, and reduce wetting affects through the alteration of surface tension. Whilst RNA sequence and secondary structure have also been shown to influence the viscoelastic behaviour of RNA peptide condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alshareedah et al., 2021</xref>), the active and inactive ribozyme systems used in the present study differ by only few nucleotides.</p><p>Despite the spherical morphology of the RNA–peptide condensates reported here, the inhibition of growth and wetting may also be due to a phase transition to a gel state. The formation of non-liquid RNA–peptide condensates has been previously reported for poly-rA:rU-peptide mixtures, where RNA base pairing leads to the formation of a kinetically arrested gel-like solid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boeynaems et al., 2019</xref>), as well as in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Vay et al., 2021</xref>). These gel condensates melt to form spherical particles upon thermal denaturation and annealing, which disrupts the networked structures formed from complementary RNA strands and peptides. In our R3C system, complementary base-pairing interactions between substrate and ribozyme should also permit the formation of large, non-covalently assembled networked structures due to the repeating nature of the substrate. Ribozyme activity is expected to increase the stability of these structures as substrate ligation increases the free energy of association between ribozyme and substrate. We hypothesise that in the inactive system, and before significant concatenation occurs in the active system, RNA–RNA interactions are sufficiently weak to allow the formation of liquid coacervate droplets. In the active system, liquid droplets initially form because the timescale of coalescence is faster than that of RNA ligation. However, as ligation proceeds the stability of networked assemblies of ribozyme and substrate increases, resulting in a transition from a liquid to either a highly viscous liquid state or solid gel state that is both unable to grow and or wet the unpassivated surface on the timescale of the experiment. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that mixtures of pre-concatenated RNA and (Lys)<sub>n</sub> initially form non-spherical gel-like aggregates, which then relax to form spherical droplets over the course of 24 hr.</p><p>The reduction of mixing between populations of droplets containing orthogonally labelled RNA likely results from the changes in material properties and growth behaviour caused by RNA concatenation. The coalescence of the coacervate droplets observed in all inactive systems is likely to be the primary mechanism of mixing in this scenario. Indeed, greater droplet growth was observed in the two-population system than for single-population experiments, which may be due to the necessity of pipetting each droplet population into the sample environment sequentially, thus increasing mechanical agitation and contacts between droplets. All populations at the initial time point contain fusion droplets, which contain separate and unmixed areas of each fluorescent RNA. Notably, fusion droplets in all systems appear evenly mixed after 24 hr, suggesting that significant equilibration occurs before any transition to a highly viscous liquid or solid gel. Mixing may also occur by diffusive transfer of RNA between droplets. As the fluorescently labelled substrate is ligated onto the growing concatemer chain, the diffusion coefficient of the labelled material is expected to decrease over the course of the reaction as its effective length increases, which would in turn slow diffusive transfer in the active system.</p><p>Taken together, the results reported here describe a range of altered droplet behaviours stemming from ribozyme-driven changes in coacervate physical properties. These physical changes may impact other processes relevant to early compartmentalised replicators and protocells, such as resistance to molecular parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koonin et al., 2017</xref>) and metabolite exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smokers et al., 2022</xref>), and thus are exciting avenues for further study. The ability of a population of protocells to resist passive coarsening, surface wetting, and content exchange can already be considered a fitness advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakashima et al., 2021</xref>), and the emergence of fitness differences from varying protocellular compositions and phenotypes is a key step on the path towards Darwinian evolution with suitable selective pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamala and Szostak, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, in this system the phenotypic difference originates from the ribozyme-driven concatenation reaction, which increases the length of the anionic coacervate component. The sequence of the ribozyme in effect comprises the genotype of our protocellular system, with different variants (e.g. active or inactive sequences) producing different protocellular phenotypes. The realisation of a phenotype–genotype linkage is essential for true open-ended evolution, otherwise phenotypes with obvious fitness advantages have no possibility of being inherited by future generations. We envision that recent methodological developments in RNA sequencing from single coacervate microdroplets will enable future selection experiments on populations of protocells with varying RNA genotypes and varying degrees of fitness with respect to environmental pressures such as heat or salt concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wollny et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The reciprocal modulation of ribozyme activity and coacervate properties reported here furthers the argument for the early coevolution of RNA and peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frenkel-Pinter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tagami et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghosh et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le Vay and Mutschler, 2019</xref>). However, further development is required to move towards more realistic model systems. A key limitation is that the droplets presented in this work contain a large proportion or pure ribozyme and substrate, which would presumably be less abundant in a more plausible scenario. The R3C ligase is a highly optimised system developed by in vitro selection and offers little potential for further enhancement of catalytic activity, but similar material changes with less ribozyme might be achieved by optimising the substrate binding arms and conditions for multiturnover reaction, or tuning substrate length to produce greater overall changes with fewer ligations. We have previously demonstrated substrate strand release in Hairpin ribozyme-(Lys)<sub>n</sub> condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Vay et al., 2021</xref>), so it may be possible to engineer similar behaviour in the R3C system, perhaps at the cost of reaction rate. In addition, the simple lysine polypeptides used here are a very basic model system, but additional variation in droplet properties may be achieved in future by varying peptide sequence. Droplet populations formed from different peptides could exhibit varying degrees of ribozyme enhancement or fundamentally different physical properties that allow selection based on peptide identity as well as RNA sequence and activity. Although the magnitude of behavioural change was greater for coacervate populations formed with the longer peptide, clear phenotypic differences were nonetheless also present in the (Lys)<sub>5-24</sub> system. This short peptide, predominantly composed of n = 3–9 residue oligomers, is of a length that could be produced by prebiotically plausible processes such as wet–dry cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forsythe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rodriguez-Garcia et al., 2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Trizma base (Tris; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), sodium hexametaphosphate ((NaPO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>, 611.77 g/mol; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI), formamide (CH<sub>3</sub>NO, 45.04 g/mol; Sigma-Aldrich), ethylenediaminetetracetic acid disodium salt dihydrate (EDTA, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>2</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O, 372.24 g/mol; Sigma-Aldrich), magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 203.30 g/mol; (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 39.997 g/mol; VWR, Radnor, PA), sodium chloride (NaCl, 58.44 g/mol; Sigma-Aldrich), urea (CH<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O, 60.06 g/mol; Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%, 36.46 g/mol) (VWR), boric acid (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>, 61.83 g/mol; Merck), ammonium persulfate (APS, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, 228.20 g/mol) (VWR), acrylamide (19:1 bisacrylamide; Thermo Fisher Scientific), tetramethylethylendiamine (TEMED, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>16</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, 116.21 g/mol; Carl Roth), SYBR gold stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific), RNA oligomer length standard (low-range ssRNA ladder) (NEBm Ipswich, MA).</p><p>All peptides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification poly-L-lysine hydrobromide (4–15 kDa, 19–72 residues, monomer: 209 g/mol), poly-L-lysine hydrobromide (1–5 kDa, 5–24 residues, monomer: 209 g/mol).

DNA sequences containing a T7 promoter upstream of the RNA sequence of interest were ordered from IDT. The DNA templates were prepared by annealing a complementary oligo to the T7 promoter region by heating equimolar mixture of the oligos at 85°C then cooling on ice. The resulting partially double-stranded DNA was used as DNA template for transcriptions. Large-scale in vitro transcription (IVT) reactions were adopted to produce enough RNA for downstream applications. The transcription reaction volume varied from 400 µL to 4 mL and contained the following: 1 µM partially double-stranded DNA template, 30 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 30 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM DTT, 2 mM spermidine, 5 mM of each NTP, 1 U/mL inorganic pyrophosphatase, and 0.5 µM T7 RNA polymerase (purified from a recombinant source in-house).

Following concentration, the RNA was purified with the Monarch RNA cleanup kit (NEB) following the manufacturer’s instructions, eluted twice in water, and quantified on the NanoDrop OneC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The resulting ribozymes were gel purified using 12% urea PAGE, whereas the substrate was purified using 20% PAGE. The amount of RNA loaded per well was 5–8 µg mm<sup>–2</sup> of the surface area of the bottom of the well. After PAGE, the gel was wrapped in plastic foil and the band of interest was identified by UV shadowing (254 nm, &lt;30 s) on an autofluorescent background. The gel slice was excised, crushed, weighed, and soaked in 2 µL of 0.3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) per mg of gel at 4°C overnight. Following elution, the gel debris was removed using Costar Spin-X columns (Corning Inc, Corning, NY) with 0.45 µM cellulose acetate filters. Next, 20 µg RNA -grade Glycogen (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and 1.2 volumes of cold isopropanol were added to the solution.

The gel thickness was 2 mm and 1 mm for preparative and analytical gels, respectively. The quenched samples were loaded, and the gel was run for 90 min at 20 W constant power in 1× TBE running buffer. When necessary, the gel was removed from the glass plates and stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) nucleic acid staining dye for 10 min in 1× TBE and 1× SYBR Gold, then washed twice for 5 min in de-ionised water to decrease background fluorescence. Images were acquired using and Azure Sapphire RGB gel scanner (λ<sub>ex</sub> = 520 nm for SYBR Gold, 658 nm for Cy5) and analysed with the AzureSpot software (Azure Biosystems, Dublin, CA).

From these data, we selected specific peptide:RNA ratios for both peptides for further experimentation (0.75:1 (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub>):RNA and (3:1 (Lys)<sub>5-24</sub>:RNA). The criterion for this selection was the formation of liquid coacervate droplets (determined by turbidity measurements and microscopy) at a peptide:RNA ratio that did not supress ribozyme activity (determined by PAGE analysis of lysine titration).

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. (Please note that point 3 should have read: Paragraphs 3-5 of reviewer 2's author recommendations.)</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were generally quite positive about the work. They have made a number of suggestions that may be useful for future investigation in this area. Of these, some of these are essential as detailed below. We are not asking for any additional experiments, but please discuss the points raised by the reviewers.</p><p>1. Clarification of the title.</p><p>2. The results shown in figure 1b, 1d are discordant and this needs to be remedied by either choosing different images or (not as good) explaining in the text why these panels seem to be discordant.</p><p>3. Paragraphs 3-5 of reviewer 2's author recommendations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. As the products of the ligation reaction by the EL R3C ladder ribozyme are mixtures of RNAs with different lengths, the exact requirements (e.g., average/maximum length of the ligated RNAs + double strand formation) for the phenotypic changes are not clear. Is S2 or S3 enough? Are longer products (e.g., S6-S17) more important? Do the elongated RNAs need to remain hybridized with the ribozymes? Droplet formation experiments with S2 or S3 (synthesized chemically or by T7 RNAP) in the presence and absence of the inactive hybridizing ribozyme would clarify these points.</p><p>2. It is unclear if the droplet property changes observed in this study are advantageous for the contained ribozyme. Is the EL R3C ladder ribozyme still active in the more viscous/solid droplets containing the longer RNAs? A ribozyme activity test started from a substrate long enough to form more viscous/solid droplets might answer this question.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The public review reflects my general view of the paper: it is an impressive achievement to get a ribozyme to control coacervate properties. The authors propose to exploit this by using the droplets to implement selection. There are still questions about the system's suitability for such a task. Readers would benefit from a clearer path forward from the authors, including an experimental assessment of a couple of important points.</p><p>A direct test of coacervate suitability for such a task would be to carry out a model in vitro selection of ligases based on their activity and influence on coacervate properties, though the system may not yet be at a stage where this is possible. In the meantime some clarity on the following points would help assess the prospects of this:</p><p>1) Coacervate enhancement of ribozyme activity: The results in Figure 1d and Figure 1b seem discordant. At the 2 h timepoint in Figure 1d, the average product length seems much lower without Lys than with – but the equivalent lanes look the same in 1b with (as far as I can tell) identical conditions. Visual inspection of the gel in 1b also suggests a much higher average product length than calculated in 1d (though perhaps this is a mirage due to staining intensity) and seen in the supporting data. If I'm missing something in my interpretation, perhaps the authors could more clearly explain the differences. This is important for readers to grasp as it underpins the claim that coacervate formation enhances ribozyme activity. I'd recommend showing a gel from the supporting figure clearly showing a condition where ligation is better with Lys. It may also be helpful to quantify the average product length in SYBR Gold stained gels (correcting for the proportionality of RNA length to signal).</p><p>2) Ribozyme activity: the observed effects of ribozyme activity on droplet properties occur when ~1/4 of the coacervate comprises ribozyme. For selection, there would be much less active ribozyme present. Can small amounts of ribozyme still influence droplet behavior when at lower concentrations (e.g. a mix of active and inactive ribozymes)?</p><p>3) Droplet fusion: There is convincing resistance of droplets to fusion when both contain active ribozyme. But in a selection setting, where a small fraction of droplets have active ribozyme and the majority do not, the relevant question is whether the droplets with inactive ribozyme will fuse with droplets with active ribozyme, i.e. does ribozyme activity in a droplet make it resistant to fusion or remove its tendency to fuse?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1 – The sentence &quot;The increase in rate observed here is most likely due to the high concentration of ribozyme and substrate that occurs in coacervates directly formed from catalytic RNA and peptides (Ref. 15)&quot; addresses an interesting point: How do we know that the peptide-mediated increase in ribozyme activity is due to coacervate formation as opposed to, for example, an association of freely diffusing peptides with freely diffusing ribozymes? Given that this is not the central point of the paper I would not ask for (probably difficult) experiments but for 1-2 more sentences based on reference 15 that increase the reader's understanding of how the peptide likely mediates through coacervates the increased ribozyme activity.</p><p>2 – The manuscript is of high interest in the field of origins of life, and needs to discuss in more detail the important implications of coacervates as model systems for early life forms, especially with regard to the effects of ribozyme catalysis on the material exchange between coacervate droplets. Specifically, the coupling of genotype and phenotype, the danger from molecular parasites, and the inflow/outflow of metabolites are likely affected by these changes, and this should be discussed based on the rich literature. I suggest inserting an additional paragraph into the discussion or expanding the last paragraph on these three specific points.</p><p>3 – While the longer Lys(19-72) peptides do not support ribozyme catalysis (see the first part of the results) they are used as a model system for dye exchange (Figure 3). Please state in the corresponding text the caveat that these longer peptide systems are not model systems for protocells but serve to test the effects of peptide length on dye exchange. Please also discuss whether the less pronounced effect on the exchange rates in coacervates that support ribozyme catalysis would be sufficient for evolutionary importance with respect to protocell function (see (2) above).</p><p>4 – The discussion mentions that the Lys(5-24) peptides are actually not 5-24 amino acids long but 3 to 9 amino acids in length. To avoid confusing the reader, please correct the length throughout the manuscript, and mention in the materials and methods that &quot;commercially available (Lys)n deviates from the manufacturer's stated size range, with the (Lys)5-24 used here being predominantly comprised of oligomers between n = 3 to n = 9 in length15.&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83543.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were generally quite positive about the work.

Indeed, the requirements for altering material properties in these experiments are not precisely known. Follow-up studies performed in the manner suggested by the reviewer could elucidate these questions, by determining the physical properties of droplets formed from pre-reacted substrate concatemers with defined lengths or in the presence of a non- or weakly-hybridising ribozyme.</p><p>In designing our experiments, we relied on previous works (e.g. Spruijt <italic>et al.</italic> 2010) that investigated the effect of polymer length on coacervate physical properties to roughly determine initial and final RNA lengths that were likely to result in an observable change.</p><p>However, the exact conditions for achieving phenotypic change in a given system are highly specific and dependent on a broad parameter space that encompasses polymer length, RNA sequence, hybridisation state, overall polymer concentration, buffer pH, salt concentration and Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration amongst other factors. As a result, determining the exact requirements would be valuable for the further development of our model system, but would not provide general rules applicable to RNA-peptide coacervates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is unclear if the droplet property changes observed in this study are advantageous for the contained ribozyme. Is the EL R3C ladder ribozyme still active in the more viscous/solid droplets containing the longer RNAs? A ribozyme activity test started from a substrate long enough to form more viscous/solid droplets might answer this question.</p></disp-quote><p>The current ribozyme and substrate design did not allow us to directly address this question, as the ribozyme catalyses a pseudo-irreversible reaction that reaches an endpoint over the course of the experiment. As suggested, increasing the initial substrate length with an unstructured spacer region would be a good starting point to investigate this question.</p><p>In our previous work (Le Vay <italic>et al.</italic> 2021, https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202109267), we reported that highly viscous or gel-like phases can occur at specific ratios in mixtures of a fragmented hairpin ribozyme and poly(L-lysine), albeit at a much lower overall polymer length. The formation of these phases was associated with increased activity, and both ribozyme activity and strand exchange were maintained, suggesting that high viscosity is not a barrier to ribozyme function in specific cases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The public review reflects my general view of the paper: it is an impressive achievement to get a ribozyme to control coacervate properties.

It may also be helpful to quantify the average product length in SYBR Gold stained gels (correcting for the proportionality of RNA length to signal).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment of this work and for highlighting several possible improvements.</p><p>In response to point 1, we direct the reviewer to our response to Reviewer 1, and to the editorial team in the section “essential revisions”. In brief, the discordance stems from the use of stained gel images to illustrate the overall reaction at its endpoint in Figure 2b, but the use of a fluorescently 5’-labelled substrate strand to determine kinetics in 2d. The use of stained gels allows us to visualise all species, including the ribozyme, substrate and both linear and circular products. However, monitoring the reaction in this way complicates the determination of average substrate length due to problems of band overlap (e.g. ribozyme and S2 product) and the presence of large but low abundance circular products of unknown length, and makes visual assessment of differences in average substrate length at the endpoint of the reaction difficult.</p><p>We feel that it is important to present a stained gel which displays all reaction components and products, but have aimed to clarify the data by adding lane profiles for certain conditions, which the greater intensity of linear product bands in the presence of pL, adding a new figure supplement based on the fluorescently labelled gels from the source data of the kinetics experiment, and adding some clarification to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Ribozyme activity: the observed effects of ribozyme activity on droplet properties occur when ~1/4 of the coacervate comprises ribozyme. For selection, there would be much less active ribozyme present. Can small amounts of ribozyme still influence droplet behavior when at lower concentrations (e.g. a mix of active and inactive ribozymes)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point that we feel warrants further discussion here and in the manuscript. In a more realistic scenario, it is expected that the concentrations of both functional ribozyme and compatible substrate would be much lower, and that the remaining material would contain non-functional (or at least non-ligating) RNA strands and perhaps other charged polymers.</p><p>It is therefore necessary to improve the catalytic properties of the ribozyme in order to move towards a more realistic system. In Figure 1 – supplement 1, we show that increasing the amount of substrate relative to the ribozyme actually leads to a reduction in ribozyme activity. We therefore anticipate that optimising the ribozyme for multi-turnover reaction might be required to achieve significant phenotypic change in a system with small amounts of ribozyme but abundant substrate. In our previous work, we demonstrated that the Hairpin ribozyme is capable of strand exchange and therefore multiple substrate ligations in RNA-peptide condensates, perhaps due to the short length of the substrate binding strand. By altering the substrate binding arms of the R3C ribozyme, it might be possible to engineer similar behaviour, perhaps at the cost of reaction rate.</p><p>In more complex mixtures with a greater variety of RNA strands and therefore a less well-defined substrate pool, a ribozyme with less stringent substrate sequence requirements might be better suited to alter material properties. The <italic>sunY</italic> ribozyme, which requires only a 5’-G for substrate ligation, would be an interesting candidate for this.</p><p>We have modified the final paragraph of the discussion to account for some of these shortcomings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Droplet fusion: There is convincing resistance of droplets to fusion when both contain active ribozyme. But in a selection setting, where a small fraction of droplets have active ribozyme and the majority do not, the relevant question is whether the droplets with inactive ribozyme will fuse with droplets with active ribozyme, i.e. does ribozyme activity in a droplet make it resistant to fusion or remove its tendency to fuse?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a highly relevant but experimentally challenging question, which we are currently attempting to address as part of our ongoing projects. The orthogonally labelled substrates transfer between droplet populations by both fusion and diffusion, and as a result all droplets contain measurable amounts of both fluorophores shortly after mixing. This means we are currently unable to investigate the behaviour of each droplet population independently to determine if e.g. an active population resists fusion when mixed with an inactive population. Our preliminary results suggest that in mixtures of active and inactive droplets, the labelled RNA from the active population remains highly localised, whilst the labelled RNA from the inactive population diffuses evenly throughout both populations. Further work is required to investigate fusion in these systems, in particular to establish methods of orthogonally measuring droplet size in the two populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1 – The sentence &quot;The increase in rate observed here is most likely due to the high concentration of ribozyme and substrate that occurs in coacervates directly formed from catalytic RNA and peptides (Ref. 15)&quot; addresses an interesting point: How do we know that the peptide-mediated increase in ribozyme activity is due to coacervate formation as opposed to, for example, an association of freely diffusing peptides with freely diffusing ribozymes? Given that this is not the central point of the paper I would not ask for (probably difficult) experiments but for 1-2 more sentences based on reference 15 that increase the reader's understanding of how the peptide likely mediates through coacervates the increased ribozyme activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this point, and agree that the claim was not fully supported. In response to this and a similar point raised by Reviewer 1, we have performed additional experiments investigating the activity of the ribozyme at varying PEG, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and RNA concentrations. These experiments reveal that both high RNA and Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations are required for enhanced activity. We direct the reviewer to the earlier response to Reviewer 1, and to the new data presented in Figure 1 – supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – The manuscript is of high interest in the field of origins of life, and needs to discuss in more detail the important implications of coacervates as model systems for early life forms, especially with regard to the effects of ribozyme catalysis on the material exchange between coacervate droplets.

However, as the ribozyme system described in this work is not replicative, we would like to limit the discussion of these aspects to avoid lengthening the manuscript further. We have included a sentence in the discussion highlighting these areas as interesting avenues for further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 – While the longer Lys(19-72) peptides do not support ribozyme catalysis (see the first part of the results) they are used as a model system for dye exchange (Figure 3).

The longer lysine polymers do indeed inhibit ribozyme activity, but only at ratios when the lysine oligopeptides are in excess over RNA i.e. (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub>: RNA &gt; 1:1, as determined by the lysine titration PAGE in Figure 1b. In subsequent experiments, we selected a (Lys)<sub>19-72</sub>: RNA ratio of 0.75:1 at which the compartmentalised ribozymes are highly active and coacervates form in liquid state. We believe that under these conditions the droplets containing longer peptides are an interesting model system. In addition, all experiments are also performed with droplets formed from the shorter peptide and the difference in behaviour between these systems is discussed. This point has been clarified in the second paragraph of the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4 – The discussion mentions that the Lys(5-24) peptides are actually not 5-24 amino acids long but 3 to 9 amino acids in length. To avoid confusing the reader, please correct the length throughout the manuscript, and mention in the materials and methods that &quot;commercially available (Lys)n deviates from the manufacturer's stated size range, with the (Lys)5-24 used here being predominantly comprised of oligomers between n = 3 to n = 9 in length15.&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this miscommunication to light.
