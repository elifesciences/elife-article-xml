However, understanding this critical embryonic phase has relied upon inference from patient phenotypes and assumptions from in vitro stem cell models and non-human vertebrates. We report an integrated transcriptomic atlas of human organogenesis. By lineage-guided principal components analysis, we uncover novel relatedness of particular developmental genes across different organs and tissues and identified unique transcriptional codes which correctly predicted the cause of many congenital disorders. By inference, our model pinpoints co-enriched genes as new causes of developmental disorders such as cleft palate and congenital heart disease. The data revealed more than 6000 novel transcripts, over 90% of which fulfil criteria as long non-coding RNAs correlated with the protein-coding genome over megabase distances. Taken together, we have uncovered cryptic transcriptional programs used by the human embryo and established a new resource for the molecular understanding of human organogenesis and its associated disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15657.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15657.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15657.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Individual organs and tissues form in human embryos during the first two months of pregnancy. Any errors during this crucial stage of human development can result in miscarriage or serious birth defects. Yet remarkably little is known about how this process works. What is known has been inferred from studies of how other animals develop, human stem cells grown in a laboratory, and babies born with genetic conditions that cause developmental problems.</p><p>Genes control the way that organs and tissues form, and are switched on or off in complex patterns during development to ensure that particular cells develop into one type of organ and not another. When genes are switched on, their DNA is copied into molecules called RNA. Many RNA molecules are used as templates to make proteins, which then perform critical roles in cell processes. One way to find out which genes are activated during development is to identify which RNAs are made by cells in the embryo.</p><p>Here, Gerrard, Berry et al. used a technique called RNA-sequencing to identify the RNAs that human embryos make while their organs and tissues form. The RNA came from many different tissues including the heart, limbs and the roof of the mouth. Gerrard, Berry et al. developed a new computational model that used the identity of the RNAs to decode the precise patterns of gene activity in the tissues. The model correctly identified many genes that were already known to cause developmental problems when faulty, and identified numerous others that are now predicted to cause developmental defects in humans.</p><p>Gerrard, Berry et al. also discovered over 6,000 RNAs in the human embryos that are unlikely to code for proteins. These “non-coding” RNAs may have other roles in cells, such as switching off genes, and many of them appear to be specific to human embryos. Together, these findings have uncovered new patterns of gene activity that drive development in human embryos and provide a resource for studying how organs and tissues form. Future challenges are to understand what controls these patterns of gene activity, and how the patterns change over time.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15657.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15657.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>organogenesis</kwd><kwd>embryo</kwd><kwd>rna-seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT088566MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerrard</surname><given-names>Dave T</given-names></name><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>Andrew A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hanley</surname><given-names>Neil A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000308</institution-id><institution>British Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/J003352/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piper Hanley</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/L009986/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bobola</surname><given-names>Nicoletta</given-names></name><name><surname>Hanley</surname><given-names>Neil A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT097820MF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanley</surname><given-names>Neil A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000308</institution-id><institution>British Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14BX15NHBG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanley</surname><given-names>Neil A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Integrating human embryonic transcriptomes from 15 sites during organogenesis identifies novel expression signatures linked to congenital disorders and a new programme of non-coding gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Embryogenesis encompasses the progression from fertilized zygote to blastocyst and through gastrulation to establish the three germ layers of ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, from which all organs and tissues subsequently arise during organogenesis. Remarkably little is known about this latter phase of assembling organs and tissues in human due to the restricted availability of human embryonic tissue and its tiny size. Previous transcriptomics post-implantation have sampled either the whole embryo by expression microarray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fang et al., 2010</xref>), thus lacking organ-specific resolution and the vast majority of long non-coding (lnc) transcription; or included lnc expression by massively parallel short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) but focussed on single sites such as limb bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cotney et al., 2013</xref>) or pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cebola et al., 2015</xref>). RNA-seq from NIH Roadmap and other studies during or after the end of the first trimester of pregnancy falls after the embryonic period (which ends at 56–58 days post-conception (Carnegie Stage 23)) and commonly reflects near terminal differentiation within heterogeneous fetal organs and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jaffe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Roost et al., 2015</xref>). As a consequence of these combined deficiencies, we set about compiling global transcriptomic data during the critical phase of human organogenesis, sampling each germ layer and including sites of mixed origin that are subject to major developmental disorders such as cleft palate and limb abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15657.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Profiling the transcriptomes underlying organogenesis in human embryos.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Human embryo showing the 15 tissues and organs subjected to RNA-seq.

Global transcription rates across all organs and tissues were comparable over a high dynamic range; approximately 70% of protein-coding genes contained 100–10,000 mapped reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We assessed whether our human embryo datasets identified earlier developmental processes than currently available fetal data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium, 2015</xref>). There were three-fold the number of differentially expressed genes in the fetal datasets but equivalent enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms in the embryo, including many early developmental processes such as morphogenesis of an epithelial bud, anterior/posterior pattern specification and embryonic morphogenesis. These were in contrast to homeostatic processes enriched in the fetal dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B–C</xref>).</p><p>Sampling gene expression across multiple sites allowed us to set about deciphering the precise transcriptomic codes responsible for the development of the different human embryonic organs and tissues. While <italic>ZNF</italic> and <italic>ZSCAN</italic> family members were broadly expressed discrete site-specific expression was more apparent for individual members of other transcription factor families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) exemplified by the <italic>HOX</italic> gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). User-defined sets of up to five developmental transcription factors characteristic for a particular organ or tissue displayed very high levels of tissue specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, while principal components (PC) analysis (PCA) or clustering grouped biological replicates, relationships between different organs and tissues other than the distinctiveness of brain and liver were not resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) also allows unbiased clustering of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaujoux and Seoighe, 2010</xref>). By setting the parameters such that representative genes were only extracted once, we identified eleven non-overlapping ‘metagenes’ from the complete expression dataset with clear tissue-specific signals for thyroid, liver, RPE, brain, heart and adrenal gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>). We hypothesized that these new signals might allow benchmarking to assess the fidelity of in vitro differentiated stem cells, similar to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Roost et al., 2015</xref>). As an exemplar, we chose hepatocyte differentiation for which RNA-seq data are available including positive (primary adult hepatocytes) and negative (human embryonic fibroblasts) control data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Du et al., 2014</xref>). Clear enrichment for the stem cell-derived hepatocytes and the primary hepatocytes (but not the fibroblasts) was apparent in metagene 2, the cluster of 39 genes indicative of human embryonic liver. From this starting point, we wanted to move beyond the unique organ-specific signatures to study how patterns of gene expression co-varied across tissues. While relaxing NMF parameters would allow non-exclusive gene selection across metagenes, we also wanted to capture differences in gene expression between organs (e.g. aspects of what is not expressed as a contributing factor to an organ’s identity). Moreover, different embryonic organs are related according to developmental lineage. We reasoned that being able to apply a lineage structure would create natural assemblies of co-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Accordingly, we adapted a method from spatial ecology and phylogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jombart et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2010b</xref>) to constrain PCA by imposing a hierarchical developmental lineage and termed this approach LgPCA. We also included RNA-seq from undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium, 2015</xref>) to represent pre-gastrulation human biology. Of the total thirty-one principal components (PCs) arising from LgPCA the first fifteen now identified patterns of gene expression across groups of related tissues in addition to unique organ-specific signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) while PCs 16–31 sampled heterogeneity within individual organs and tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In keeping with this transition PCs 1–4 ordered samples reminiscent of very early developmental events: pluripotency (extreme positive loadings in PC1; ‘PC1 high’), early brain formation (extreme negative loadings in PC2; ‘PC2 low’), foregut endoderm (PC4 low) and intermediate mesoderm (PC4 high). PCs 5–15 resolved the individual organs and tissues; for instance low PC5 loadings discriminated liver from the other foregut endoderm derivatives. Heatmaps illustrated the composite or tissue-specific signals emanating from the genes with the most extreme PC loadings which also underlay appropriate developmental gene ontology (GO) terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1E–F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15657.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Lineage-guided PCA discovers unique transcriptional signatures regulating human organogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Interpreting gene expression profiles is dependent upon the underlying developmental lineage.

We undertook this in two different ways, both based on studying the 1000 genes with the most extreme loadings in PCs 1–15 that identified gene co-expression patterns across tissues and within individual organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>). We interrogated these gene sets for regulatory networks based on the enrichment of transcription factor motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Janky et al., 2014</xref>). Numerous well known master regulators were recovered alongside previously unappreciated factors for either broad tissue groups (e.g. foregut endoderm derivatives) or individual organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). As proof-of-principle, this also included proven regulators of human pluripotency, NANOG, OCT4 and MYC, at an extreme of PC1. Remarkably, in several instances approaching half of the 1000 genes with the most extreme PC loadings imputed co-regulation by a single transcription factor, such as HNF4A in the liver or SRF in the heart. Alongside NR5A1, the data predicted RUNX and BAD as novel regulators of human adrenal and gonadal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). As a second approach to study gene regulation, we extracted the transcription factors (typically <underline>&lt;</underline>5%) from amongst the 1000 most extreme genes in PCs 1–15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref>). We searched the Mouse Genome Informatics database (MGI) and in 309/594 instances there was a relevant mouse mutation phenotype supporting the notion that the transcription factors identified by LgPCA are key regulators of human organogenesis. At the lowest extreme of PC5 (liver) the twenty-two transcription factors contained all three of those required for reprogramming fibroblasts directly to hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests novel fate programming roles for transcription factors at the extremes of other PCs (including new potential regulators of pluripotency amongst the sixteen factors containing zinc fingers in PC1). In keeping with these regulatory roles, the extreme PC loadings in the LgPCA data also prioritized those transcription factors responsible for major congenital disorders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref>). Because LgPCA is not limited to individual organs this included a novel ability to predict multisystem abnormalities such as the combined heart and limb defects of Holt-Oram syndrome (OMIM 142900, <italic>TBX5</italic>, PC13 low) or the palate and limb abnormalities associated with mutations in <italic>TP63</italic> (OMIM 603543, PC3 high).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15657.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>LgPCA points to master regulators of human organogenesis and the causes of human congenital disorders.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Predicted regulation by iRegulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Janky et al., 2014</xref>) of the most extreme 1000 genes for different PCs identifies known and unexpected transcription factors regulating human organogenesis.

(<bold>b</bold>) Transcription factors at the extremes of individual PCs in the LgPCA are responsible for a diverse range of congenital disorders (red names in the ovals for heart and testis; full details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref>). To validate the utility of these data, we conservatively selected some of the earliest critical regions for these disorders (two ‘Proven’ examples on the left; all 53 listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1H</xref>). LgPCA frequently isolated the correct transcription factor from an average of 111 genes across &gt;10 Mb, shown for NKX2-5 in congenital heart disease and SOX9 in campomelic dysplasia. Beyond this validation LgPCA similarly predicts causative transcription factors (blue) for many unresolved congenital disorders such as developmental heart abnormalities in Chr1p36 deletion syndrome and sex reversal / disorders of sex differentiation (DSD) (all 13 examples in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1H</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15657.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15657.011</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15657-fig3-v1"/></fig></p><p>Mutations in genes encoding transcription factors are over-represented causes of congenital disorders, most likely due to their critical function during organogenesis and inadequacy when haploinsufficient.

To test this model we identified some of the earliest chromosomal mapping or patient deletion data for the known disease-associated transcription factors from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref>. 53 disorders were suitable for assessment with an average critical region of 13.7 Mb each containing an average of 111 protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1H</xref>). Strikingly, in 37 instances (73%) LgPCA uniquely selected the correct transcription factor and in 48 instances (91%) narrowed the field down to three or fewer transcription factors. When applied to 13 syndromes (mostly deletion disorders) where the causative gene remains unresolved clear predictions of causality emerge, for instance in cleft palate (<italic>DLX5, DLX6, LHX8</italic> and <italic>FOXF2</italic>) or cerebellar disorders (<italic>ZIC1</italic> and <italic>ZIC4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1H</xref>).

A dedicated programme operating during human organogenesis seemed likely as 81 out of the 1571 genes enriched in embryogenesis compared to the fetal datasets were annotated long intergenic non-coding (LINC) transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). To look beyond this we assembled strand-specific transcripts not recognized by current genome annotation [GENCODE 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harrow et al., 2012</xref>)] and systematically named them individually according to recommended criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mattick and Rinn, 2015</xref>). 6251 unique loci accounted for in excess of 9 Mb of novel polyadenylated transcription from the human genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1I</xref>). The vast majority of transcripts fulfilled criteria as lnc RNAs by assessment of coding potential (CPAT score &lt;0.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), length over 200 base pairs (bp) and an absence of reads spanning splice junctions to currently annotated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mattick and Rinn, 2015</xref>). These lncRNAs were classified as either bidirectional, antisense or overlapping, or by exclusion intergenic, according to orientation and position in relation to the annotated genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mattick and Rinn, 2015</xref>). Transcripts were most commonly 500–1,500 bp but could extend to over 600 Kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) and showed high tissue-specificity with the median Tau value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yanai et al., 2005</xref>) of 0.86, much higher than for protein-coding genes (0.63) but consistent with previously annotated non-coding genes (0.89). We investigated the association between this novel human embryonic transcriptome and the annotated genome. Reduced physical distance to expressed annotated genes markedly increased the likelihood of novel transcript co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), although the best correlations were by no means always with the closest gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f–g</xref>). The median distance to the closest annotated gene was 7.7 Kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) while on average the best correlation was at 188 Kb (random prediction was 476 Kb). Over half (3634) of the lnc transcripts were classified positionally as LINC RNAs. While LINC RNAs can harbour important regulatory function, how to forecast their relationship(s) with the protein-coding genome and prioritize the investigation of thousands of new transcripts is immensely challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goff and Rinn, 2015</xref>).

Subjecting transcription from many sites to a method of analysis that incorporated developmental lineage deciphered novel genetic signatures, predicted causality in many human developmental disorders and associated novel non-coding transcription with expression from the surrounding protein-coding genome. At present, the data arise from a relatively narrow window of embryonic development but set the stage for future longitudinal studies for individual organs over time. The tiny amounts and scarcity of human embryonic tissue also necessitated aspects of pooling across different Carnegie stages for some sites but it is striking that this had no impact on ascertaining organ and tissue-specific transcriptomic signatures by LgPCA. The integrated data are expected to be particularly valuable to stem cell researchers examining the fidelity of PSC differentiation in vitro or searching for transcription factors for direct reprogramming of chosen cell lineages. Finally, the discovery of a major new programme of non-coding transcription adds a fresh layer of detail on the spatiotemporal regulation of the human genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human material</title><p>Human embryonic material was collected under ethical approval, informed consent and according to the Codes of Practice of the Human Tissue Authority and staged by the Carnegie classification as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>).

Individually identified tissues and organs (details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) were immediately dissected. The adrenal gland, whole brain, heart, kidney, liver, entire limb buds, lung, stomach, testis, thyroid and anterior two-thirds of the tongue were readily identifiable as discrete organs and tissues. All visible adherent mesenchyme was removed from organs and tissues under a dissecting microscope. For the adrenal gland, this includes the capsule which allowed separation from the kidney. The ureter, emerging from the renal pelvis, was removed separately from the kidney. For the heart, a window of tissue was removed from the lateral wall of the left ventricle. A segment of the liver was dissected from each embryo that avoided the developing gall bladder. The trachea was removed from the lung at its entry point into the lung parenchyma. The stomach was identified between the gastro-oesophageal and pyloric junctions. The testis was dissected free from the attached mesonephros. While the thyroid was readily visualized as a discrete organ in the neck, it unavoidably contained the developing parathyroids and thus this tissue type was referred to throughout as ‘thyroid/PTH’. The palatal shelves were dissected on either side of the midline. The eye was dissected and the RPE peeled off mechanically from its posterior surface with validation possible under the dissecting microscope because the RPE is very darkly pigmented compared to the other ocular structures.

Briefly, total RNA (0.1–4 µg) was used as input material from which polyadenylated mRNA was purified using poly-T, oligo-attached, magnetic beads. The mRNA was then fragmented using divalent cations under elevated temperature and then reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA using random primers. Second strand cDNA was then synthesized using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H.

As in the description from Jombart and colleagues the resulting components represented ‘global’ structures (where similarity is high between related samples) and ‘local’ structures (where related samples are dissimilar) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jombart et al., 2010b</xref>). We used the LgPCA to extract all the global patterns from the data (PCs 1–15). These patterns were not apparent if lineage relationships were not included nor were they altered if any one tissue, such as palate, was altered within the broad lineage structure (data not shown). The global patterns in PCs 1–15 infer co-regulatory patterns of gene expression across human organogenesis. The ‘local’ patterns thereafter captured heterogeneity between tissue replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) (while PC7 separated the two PSC populations these RNA-seq datasets represent separate cell lines from NIH Roadmap). We used the Abouheif distance as implemented in adephylo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jombart et al., 2010a</xref>), which takes into account the topology of the specified tree but does not use branch lengths.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Gene set enrichment</title><p>For the comparison of the embryonic versus fetal datasets Gene Ontology term enrichment was performed on upregulated genes (FDR <underline>&lt;</underline> 0.05) using Fisher’s exact test with the elimination algorithm of the R package topGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexa and Rahnenfuhrer, 2010</xref>).

Transcriptomes were combined (‘cuffmerge’; -min-isoform-fraction = 0.1) and compared with the original GENCODE 18 reference (‘cuffcompare’). We filtered out known transcripts using the ‘Transfrag class codes’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffcompare/#transfrag-class-codes">http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffcompare/#transfrag-class-codes</ext-link>) to retain only wholly intronic (‘i’, of which there were none), unknown (‘u’), antisense (x) and overlapping (‘o’) transcripts. We discarded all other classes including pre-mRNA (class ‘e’), novel-isoforms spliced to known exons (class ‘j’), and 3’ run-ons within 2 kb of the end of the transcript annotation (class ‘p’). In addition, some remaining non-spliced transcripts may theoretically represent first or last exon (UTR) extensions; to delimit these, we calculated the distance on the same strand to the closest downstream transcription start site (to consider potential 5’ UTR extension) and upstream transcription termination site (to consider potential 3’ UTR extension). Names were assigned to these novel transcripts following suggested criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mattick and Rinn, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) with the sole adaptation that bidirectional (BI) transcripts were defined as having their TSS within 1 Kb of the TSS of the associated annotated gene. No transcripts mapped to the same strand within the introns of any annotated gene excluding the possibility of unspliced transcripts from annotated genes being erroneously defined as novel transcripts. All transcript sequences (annotated and unannotated) were scored for protein-coding potential using CPAT (based on human training data included with CPAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). A threshold of &gt;0.2 was used to define ‘Transcripts of Uncertain Coding Potential’ (TUCP). Where there were multiple transcripts from a single locus, the longest transcript was retained in assembling the final dataset of 6251 novel transcripts. Transcript level read counts for the embryonic samples and NIH Roadmap samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1J</xref>) were generated for the merged transcriptome using bedtools multicov (vers 2.21.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>).

To identify disease associations each gene was entered as a search term in OMIM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim</ext-link>) and in PubMed. Batch queries were undertaken at Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org">www.informatics.jax.org</ext-link>) with 'Mammalian phenotype' as the output. (<bold>H</bold>) LgPCA predictions of causal genes for critical regions in either solved or unsolved developmental disorders. Fifty-three developmental disorders (Column A, 'solved') with causally associated transcription factors identified in the appropriate transcriptomic signature of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref> were originally defined by critical regions (Column C with hyperlink). These critical regions were identified by searching OMIM and usually derived from mapping data on affected families or chromosomal deletions in affected patients. Larger critical regions were preferentially selected to test more meaningfully whether the LgPCA model could have pinpointed the causal gene based solely on transcriptomic signatures that involved an affected organ(s) or tissue(s) (Column B). The average critical region was 13.7 Mb (Column D) and contained an average of 111 protein-coding genes (Column E; identified from searching BIOMART on ENSEMBL). In 48/53 instances (91%), LgPCA narrowed the field down to three or fewer transcription factors and in 37 instances (73%) excluded all except the correct transcription factor. Therefore, the same approach was applied to 13 unsolved developmental disorders (mostly deletion syndromes) with predictions made in each case for any type of protein-coding gene (Column H) and transcription factor(s) (Column I). In many instances the transcription factor in Column I possesses an appropriate mutant mouse phenotype.

Intergenic transcripts are numbered sequentially within each chromosome. Exon lengths and starts (blocks) are recorded here in UCSC BED12 format. Correlations in expression profile were calculated for annotated genes with transcript transcriptional start sites situated within 1 Mb of the novel transcript TSS; the total number of genes in this window is listed. Columns AF-AT (organs and tissues) represent mean, quantile-normalised read counts across tissue replicates. Correlations (and distance) are shown for the closest, best correlated or best anti-correlated genes and were generated using only embryonic RNA-seq data.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. One of the three reviewers has agreed to reveal their identity: Majlinda Lako.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Given the nature of this contribution, we would like to consider it in the category of a Tools and Resources paper.</p><p>This paper provides transcriptional profiles from different tissues during early human embryogenesis and as such represents a significant and novel contribution. To date most of our knowledge on human embryogenesis is based on extrapolation from model animals. These new data will provide a resource to the community enabling more understanding of tissue differentiation and organogenesis. It will also help with identification of new disease genes and understanding developmental defects.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are some important issues raised by two of the reviewers with regard to the statistical analysis of the data. These concerns are provided in detail below and must be addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>2) The linkage of the transcriptional data to developmental disorders is not well validated. There is considerable mouse developmental and phenotype data available in databases that could be mined to enhance the value of your findings and help determine whether the genes identified are truly key regulators of tissue development.</p><p>3) The claim that novel transcripts are likely lncRNAs was questioned and needs to be analyzed more carefully.</p><p>Statistical issues:</p><p>There are concerns of the methodology that would require further clarification:</p><p>For the NMF, while the implementation of the methods is likely to be appropriate, there may be a potential flaw in the interpretation of what the analysis may achieved. Regarding &quot;non-overlapping&quot; metagenes, by default, genes can be represented in multiple metagenes, based on the Brunet algorithm in the NMF R package (also the default algorithm). The Methods state that this algorithm has been used, so following on from that, the assertion that &quot;non-overlapping metagenes&quot; could be extracted from the complete dataset and the &quot;potential of coordinated deployment of overlapping genes&quot; is ignored may be incorrect. Furthermore, the critique that &quot;NMF failed to discriminate transcriptional signatures for a number or organs or tissues, or discern the relationships between them… &quot; may also apply to the outcome of lgPCA. Therefore, this is not a compelling argument for discarding the NMF.</p><p>The analysis could have been taken further to examine the enrichment of all the metagenes, similarly to the one for liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>) for all the specific tissue metagenes (“clear tissue-specific signals for thyroid, liver, RPE, brain, heart and adrenal gland”), and a similar approach could be taken for the downstream functional analysis of lgPCA.</p><p>For lgPCA, while the interpretation of the results would be correct, there is confusion in the nomenclature of loading and scores, which are fundamental concepts in PCA. PC scores refer to the eigenvalues (magnitude of variance) which determine the separation between the samples (as can be gleaned from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). PC loadings are eigenvectors and describe the contribution of the variables (in this case genes) that causes the separation of the samples. Therefore, PC scores should rightly be PCA loadings (main text, third and fourth paragraphs). This confusion should be attended to. Additionally, it would be helpful to mention at least once in the main text that when referring to &quot;PC1 low&quot; for example, this is meant to be low/negative PC1 scores.</p><p>Both NMF and lgPCA are doing similar things, i.e. clustering samples based on gene expression to find which genes drive sample separation. The differences are that NMF can reveal the similarity between gene expression patterns for samples, which are clustered with the same metagenes, in this case kidney and testis to metagene 3, (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B). LgPCA can discern the differences in gene expression between certain samples (for example Brain and liver in PC2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). If it was intended to include the NMF analysis in this study, a point should be made as the rationale of which samples are to be clustered together and why, before the results may be compared to those from the lgPCA. Alternatively, the NMF analysis can be omitted since the lgPCA method is sufficient to accomplish the data analysis.</p><p>The analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> compares the authors' data with that presented in the fetal datasets from the NIH Roadmap. The authors claim substantial up-regulation of sets of genes in their dataset but this is not quantified statistically (instead an arbitrary cut-off of &gt;2-fold enrichment was employed). While there is relatively little data from which to perform a rigorous analysis it should be possible to use appropriate models (gaining power across genes such as GSEA) to find enriched categories in a more robust manner than presented here (i.e., this would allow appropriate correction for multiple testing).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15657.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) There are some important issues raised by two of the reviewers with regard to the statistical analysis of the data. These concerns are provided in detail below and must be addressed in the revised manuscript.</italic></p><p>Thank you. We have addressed these issues in turn in the relevant later section.</p><p><italic>2) The linkage of the transcriptional data to developmental disorders is not well validated. There is considerable mouse developmental and phenotype data available in databases that could be mined to enhance the value of your findings and help determine whether the genes identified are truly key regulators of tissue development.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is important. The signposting in the original submission was weak. We have addressed this by re-writing the main text to reference clearly <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref> (was F), which details 594 transcription factors at the extremes of principal components in the LgPCA. For each of these genes we mined the OMIM database for human developmental disorders (Column G of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref>). To link to mouse developmental biology we mined the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database for each of the 594 genes providing each MGI ID in Column I and consistent mouse phenotypic features (identifiable in 309 instances) in Column J. In addition, each gene was mined in Pubmed; where additional information from mouse models was particularly insightful over and above the MGI data PMIDs are given in Column K. These data reinforce the message that our identified transcription factors are indeed developmental regulators. In addition, it is relevant that the LgPCA led to consistent GO terms (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, ‘metanephros development’ for the embryonic kidney signature). These GO terms and the genes underlying them relate to regulatory roles discovered during mouse development.</p><p><italic>3) The claim that novel transcripts are likely lncRNAs was questioned and needs to be analyzed more carefully.</italic> </p><p>We have debated this fast-moving area amongst ourselves throughout the course of the study. We considered it best to draw on up-to-date criteria and used the commentary by Mattick &amp; Rinn in Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology last year.</p><p>An important point is scale: we have discovered a huge amount of unannotated transcription and catalogued it as systematically as possible. This approach and publicising its existence is important because its scope (&gt;6,000 transcripts) is beyond the capacity for functional investigation by any one lab. Thus, we view our job as to make the data open access for others to interrogate. This point was made by Mattick &amp; Rinn: ‘Although these transcripts may be collectively referred to as long ‘noncoding’ RNAs (i.e. lncRNAs), this is a necessarily vague catch all term that is useful only as a moniker until they are better characterized’. We recognise, agree with and have adopted this initial starting point of using the ‘catch all term’, lncRNA. In addition, we have gone to great length to build on their suggested nomenclature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1I</xref>) rather than pursue the easier option of simple ‘in-house’ numbering (prevalent in other manuscripts) which lacks reference to genomic structure and location and is less helpful to the community (‘Given the enormous numbers of long apparently noncoding transcripts, it is important to have a logical and flexible structure for cataloguing and parsing newly found transcripts, in a way that will foster rather than impede their functional and mechanistic exploration.’).</p><p>With this in mind: ‘The broad term lncRNA refers to a transcript &gt;200 nt in length that does not appear to contain a protein-coding sequence.’ The 200bp threshold is regarded as a practical lower limit for standard RNA-seq thus excluding smaller RNAs, such as tRNAs, snRNAs and MIRs. We assessed coding potential using CPAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; Wang et al., NAR, cited in the manuscript), a method recommended by Mattick &amp; Rinn. Our cut-off was &lt;0.2, stricter than the 0.364 limit (determined by two-graph user operator characteristic) from the CPAT User Guide to increase our confidence that these transcripts are truly lncRNAs. Of note, over 90% of our novel transcripts had this very low coding potential.</p><p>We recognize that histone modifications can be useful for increasing the confidence with which transcriptional start sites of lncRNAs can be ascribed. We have started these studies (e.g. H3K4me3 ChIP-seq) for a number of organs as a part of a separate analysis of genome regulation (e.g. organ-specific enhancer usage during human embryogenesis). While too preliminary for inclusion here and well beyond the 2-month requested turnaround for this revision, it is reassuring that our early data on H3K4me3 marks do indeed correlate with the start of our lncRNAs.</p><p>Taken together, we feel that ‘lncRNA’ is the best descriptor for our novel transcripts filtered for length &gt;200 bp and CPAT scores &lt;0.2.</p><p><italic>Statistical issues:</italic></p><p>We note that the end-point of the Referees’ discussion on the NMF data is that we could simply remove it (which is a very helpful option—thank you!). We would like to reserve that opportunity; however, for now, we would like to try and preserve the NMF subject to the clarifications below for the following reasons. In previous advice we were encouraged to include an alternative approach that specifically targets organ-specific signatures. This seems reasonable. In addition, we feel that our manuscript will interest a broad audience not immediately familiar with the wide range of possible computational analyses. Therefore, it seems fair and reasonable to publicise the potential of NMF alongside our own approach of LgPCA. Clearly, if our clarifications and revisions are not convincing, the NMF analysis can be removed.</p><p><italic>There are concerns of the methodology that would require further clarification:</italic> </p><p><italic>For the NMF, while the implementation of the methods is likely to be appropriate, there may be a potential flaw in the interpretation of what the analysis may achieved. Regarding &quot;non-overlapping&quot; metagenes, by default, genes can be represented in multiple metagenes, based on the Brunet algorithm in the NMF R package (also the default algorithm). The Methods state that this algorithm has been used, so following on from that, the assertion that &quot;non-overlapping metagenes&quot; could be extracted from the complete dataset and the &quot;potential of coordinated deployment of overlapping genes&quot; is ignored may be incorrect.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this point. Our original submission was not clear, some of the text needed moderation and we failed to reference <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>. We applied the algorithm specifically to decipher tissue-defining gene-sets. Therefore, we used only those genes with ‘basis contribution’ &gt;80% across metagenes meaning that each of the genes featured in only one metagene. This is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref> and now referenced properly as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>. In not describing this adequately, we gave the false perception that this was the limit of the NMF approach when, as the reviewers correctly highlight, we could have reduced the threshold to allow overlapping sets of genes. We have amended to text to discuss this point and clarify our rationale.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, the critique that &quot;NMF failed to discriminate transcriptional signatures for a number or organs or tissues, or discern the relationships between them… &quot; may also apply to the outcome of lgPCA. Therefore, this is not a compelling argument for discarding the NMF.</italic> </p><p>The original text was poorly chosen and we have tempered this section and the final paragraph. As a general aside, we feel that signatures were more comprehensively discerned in the LgPCA, in part by the opportunity to study profiles across PCs (e.g. adrenal gland across PC8 and PC9 as discussed in the text and as in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1F–G</xref>). Moreover, we wanted to explore a methodology that permitted a lineage to be imparted upon the global dataset to model human embryogenesis. We have tried to get these points across in revised text.</p><p><italic>The analysis could have been taken further to examine the enrichment of all the metagenes, similarly to the one for liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>) for all the specific tissue metagenes (“clear tissue-specific signals for thyroid, liver, RPE, brain, heart and adrenal gland”), and a similar approach could be taken for the downstream functional analysis of lgPCA.</italic> </p><p>The inclusion of this figure panel and these data was in response to a helpful suggestion from a stem cell expert who commented on the importance of our data in allowing researchers to benchmark in vitro differentiated PSCs. In the example shown, we have taken the NMF metagenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>) and tested for gene enrichment in data from Du et al. (2014, Cell Stem Cell) for human PSCs differentiated to hepatocytes with primary human adult hepatocytes (positive control) and human embryonic fibroblasts (negative control). The hepatocytes (both native and PSC-derived) from Du et al. showed appropriate signals in Metagene 2 (liver) but not the other metagenes. (It is interesting to note some signal for metagene 1 (thyroid – another anterior endoderm derivative) in the in vitro PSC differentiated hepatocyte-like cells.) This analysis required robust differentiation protocols and suitable RNA-seq data from differentiated PSCs; hence why we chose the exemplar of liver were data are available from Du and colleagues and hence why we feel it would be premature to extend the analyses to other NMF metagene or LgPCA organ signatures (lack of in vitro protocols/RNA-seq data).</p><p><italic>For lgPCA, while the interpretation of the results would be correct, there is confusion in the nomenclature of loading and scores, which are fundamental concepts in PCA. PC scores refer to the eigenvalues (magnitude of variance) which determine the separation between the samples (as can be gleaned from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). PC loadings are eigenvectors and describe the contribution of the variables (in this case genes) that causes the separation of the samples. Therefore, PC scores should rightly be PCA loadings (main text, third and fourth paragraphs). This confusion should be attended to.</italic></p><p>Thank you. We are very grateful for these important points. We have corrected this oversight.</p><p><italic>Additionally, it would be helpful to mention at least once in the main text that when referring to &quot;PC1 low&quot; for example, this is meant to be low/negative PC1 scores.</italic></p><p>We have added additional text.</p><p><italic>Both NMF and lgPCA are doing similar things, i.e. clustering samples based on gene expression to find which genes drive sample separation. The differences are that NMF can reveal the similarity between gene expression patterns for samples, which are clustered with the same metagenes, in this case kidney and testis to metagene 3, (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B). LgPCA can discern the differences in gene expression between certain samples (for example Brain and liver in PC2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Alternatively, the NMF analysis can be omitted since the lgPCA method is sufficient to accomplish the data analysis.</italic> </p><p>We have adapted the text. NMF can indeed generate metagenes across tissues (e.g. kidney and testis as pointed out) as can LgPCA (e.g. limbs and palate in PC3). As commented on, LgPCA can also discern differences in gene co-expression between organs (e.g. tongue and heart in PC15). To note, NMF does not start from a position of pre-determined sample clustering. Hoping to resolve this issue and recognising that the original text was unhelpful on NMF versus LgPCA, we have made revisions. As above, if these measures are inadequate, we can always remove the NMF.</p><p><italic>The analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> compares the authors' data with that presented in the fetal datasets from the NIH Roadmap.

We are grateful for the Referees noting the relative paucity of data for this analysis. Nevertheless, we feel that it is a useful early component of the paper to show that there are indeed differences between human embryonic datasets and those from later development from NIH Roadmap. We have undertaken alternative analyses based on statistical cut-offs and with methodology that facilitates multiple testing. These data are now included in the manuscript in place of the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
