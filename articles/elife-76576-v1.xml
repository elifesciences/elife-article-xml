life-threatening arrhythmias, but the mechanisms are unknown. We aimed to determine the role of ion channels controlling cardiac excitability in the mechanisms of arrhythmias in DMD patients.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>To test whether dystrophin mutations lead to defective cardiac Na<sub>V</sub>1.5–Kir2.1 channelosomes and arrhythmias, we generated iPSC-CMs from two hemizygous DMD males, a heterozygous female, and two unrelated control males. We conducted studies including confocal microscopy, protein expression analysis, patch-clamping, non-viral piggy-bac gene expression, optical mapping and contractility assays.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Two patients had abnormal ECGs with frequent runs of ventricular tachycardia. iPSC-CMs from all DMD patients showed abnormal action potential profiles, slowed conduction velocities, and reduced sodium (I<sub>Na</sub>) and inward rectifier potassium (I<sub>K1</sub>) currents. Membrane Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Kir2.1 protein levels were reduced in hemizygous DMD iPSC-CMs but not in heterozygous iPSC-CMs. Remarkably, transfecting just one component of the dystrophin protein complex (α1-syntrophin) in hemizygous iPSC-CMs from one patient restored channelosome function, I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>K1</sub> densities, and action potential profile in single cells. In addition, α1-syntrophin expression restored impulse conduction and contractility and prevented reentrant arrhythmias in hiPSC-CM monolayers.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We provide the first demonstration that iPSC-CMs reprogrammed from skin fibroblasts of DMD patients with cardiomyopathy have a dysfunction of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.5–Kir2.1 channelosome, with consequent reduction of cardiac excitability and conduction. Altogether, iPSC-CMs from patients with DMD cardiomyopathy have a Na<sub>V</sub>1.5–Kir2.1 channelosome dysfunction, which can be rescued by the scaffolding protein α1-syntrophin to restore excitability and prevent arrhythmias.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>Supported by National Institutes of Health R01 HL122352 grant; ‘la Caixa’ Banking Foundation (HR18-00304); Fundación La Marató TV3: <italic>Ayudas a la investigación en enfermedades raras</italic> 2020 (LA MARATO-2020); Instituto de Salud Carlos III/FEDER/FSE; Horizon 2020 - Research and Innovation Framework Programme GA-965286 to JJ; the CNIC is supported by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (MCIN) and the Pro CNIC Foundation), and is a Severo Ochoa Center of Excellence (grant CEX2020-001041-S funded by MICIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033).

This inheritable X-linked disease affects primarily adolescent males causing progressive skeletal muscle deterioration, with negative effects in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>). Muscular dystrophies are also characterized by cardiac muscle involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corrado et al., 2002</xref>), which usually starts with an abnormal ECG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finsterer et al., 2018</xref>). Eventually, most patients with DMD will develop cardiomyopathy by 20 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shirokova and Niggli, 2013</xref>). Many will be at a high risk for arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD), which contributes considerably to the morbidity and mortality of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yilmaz and Sechtem, 2012</xref>). However, diagnosis and prevention of arrhythmia are challenging in DMD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yilmaz et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms responsible for arrhythmias and SCD in patients with DMD cardiomyopathy are poorly understood. The dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) is involved in mechanoprotection of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petrof et al., 1993</xref>). The DAPC acts also as a putative cellular signaling complex that forms a scaffold for numerous signaling and membrane ion channel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Constantin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gavillet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Milstein et al., 2012</xref>). The absence of dystrophin in DMD has the potential to alter trafficking, localization, and function of DAPC-associated proteins in skeletal and cardiac muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lohan et al., 2005</xref>). For example, the expression and function of ion channels are defective in ventricular cardiomyocytes of the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gavillet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koenig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rubi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koenig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albesa et al., 2011</xref>). The absence of dystrophin in young <italic>mdx</italic> mice affects the function of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, leading to cardiac conduction defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gavillet et al., 2006</xref>). Inward rectifier potassium current <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> is reduced in the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rubi et al., 2017</xref>) but the consequences of the disruption have not been identified.</p><p>Results from our laboratory and others strongly suggest that Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Kir2.1 control cardiac excitability by mutually modulating each other’s surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Milstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albesa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petitprez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leonoudakis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matamoros et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ponce-Balbuena et al., 2018</xref>). At the lateral membrane, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Kir2.1 channels form macromolecular complexes (‘channelosomes’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pérez-Hernández et al., 2018</xref>) that include α1-syntrophin, which is a part of the DAPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gavillet et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that dystrophin gene mutations that truncate the Dp427 dystrophin isoform, disrupt Na<sub>V</sub>1.5–α1-syntrophin–Kir2.1 interactions, altering the function of the most important ion channels controlling cardiac excitability and conduction velocity (CV), which would place the DMD patient at risk of arrhythmogenesis and SCD.</p><p>Here, we have used matured ventricular-like iPSC-CMs derived from two genetically distinct hemizygous DMD males, a heterozygous DMD female and two unrelated healthy subjects (controls) to investigate the mechanisms underlying the arrhythmias associated with loss-of-function dystrophin mutations. We demonstrate that iPSC-CMs from patients with DMD cardiomyopathy have a dysfunction of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.5–Kir2.1 channelosome, which leads to reduced excitability, slow conduction and reduced contractility. Importantly, DMD iPSC-CMs recapitulate the complex patterns of reentrant arrhythmias seen in patients.

Together, these results strongly suggest that reduced excitability underlies the arrhythmogenic mechanism in DMD patients. While all patients developed severe cardiomyopathy, they also suffered frequent PVCs and ventricular tachycardia. In addition, the ECG of the heterozygous female DMD patient showed a significant left axis deviation caused by cardiac conduction defects in line with our results. In one of the male patients, ICD recordings revealed the arrhythmia deteriorating into ventricular fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hara et al., 2016</xref>). Our results in patient-specific iPSC-CMs indicate that such defects are a direct consequence of a Na<sub>V</sub>1.5–α1-syntrophin–Kir2.1 channelosome dysfunction produced by the disruption of the DAPC that characterizes the DMD cardiomyopathy. Remarkably, transfecting just one of the components of that complex (i.e., α1-syntrophin) in Male 1 iPSC-CMs led to channelosome recovery at the plasma membrane, with restoration of <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> densities, MDP, AP d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>, and amplitude. Moreover, in iPSC-CM monolayers from the same patient, α1-syntrophin transfection tended to restore rapid conduction, reduced APD duration and prevented reentrant arrhythmia inducibility. To our knowledge, this report is first in providing a comprehensive and rigorous mechanistic demonstration of the potential causes of cardiac conduction defects and arrhythmogenesis in human DMD, substantially extending findings from animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gavillet et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>ECG abnormalities can be detected in up to 60% of DMD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finsterer and Stöllberger, 2003</xref>), and among those, conduction defects, bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death are frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perloff, 1984</xref>). However, despite significant progress in the understanding of the mechanisms of the skeletal muscle dystrophy, exploration of the electrophysiological consequences of the dystrophic cardiomyopathy has been slower. Until now, it has been difficult to link functional changes in individual ion channels/proteins with corresponding clinical phenotypes in inheritable ion channel diseases and cardiomyopathies such as DMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Villa et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Both Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Kir2.1 interact with the DAPC via α1-syntrophin through their respective canonical C-terminal PDZ-binding domains. As shown previously, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 has an additional internal PDZ-like binding domain localized at the N-terminus that also interacts with α1-syntrophin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gavillet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matamoros et al., 2016</xref>). Changes in <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> might alter cardiac conduction and increase the probability of premature beats like those seen on the ECG from the DMD patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gavillet et al., 2006</xref>). We showed here that in addition to reduced <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>, iPSC-CMs from DMD patients also have reduced <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> and probably alterations in other proteins altogether causing proarrhythmic alteration in electrical impulse conduction, likely because of trafficking disruption of the α1-syntrophin-mediated macromolecular complex formed by the DACP with Kir2.1and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5. The important role of such an ion channel complex in controlling cardiac electrical function is highlighted by our demonstration that lack of the DAPC in the iPSC-CMs from the DMD patient reduces CV and that expression of α1-syntrophin rescues excitability, and normal action potential characteristics, thus preventing reentrant arrhythmias. In addition, the demonstration that α1-syntrophin also restores contractility in these patient-specific cells highlights the importance of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.5–α1-syntrophin–Kir2.1 channelosome in ensuring a rapid and well-coordinated coordinated coupling between excitation and contraction. Altogether, our results provide a straightforward arrhythmogenic mechanism in DMD-associated cardiomyopathy and offers a potential treatment.</p><p>Maturation of iPSC-CMs is essential for human disease modeling and preclinical drug studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">da Rocha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ronaldson-Bouchard et al., 2019</xref>). Culturing iPSC-CM monolayers on soft PDMS membranes coated with Matrigel promotes cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herron et al., 2016</xref>). Also, there are several reports indicating that the regulation of cell shape and substrate stiffness helps improve the contractile activity and maturation of iPSC-CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ribeiro et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, having cells with ventricular-like action potentials and structural and electrophysiological maturity that approximates the human adult ventricular cardiomyocyte is likely to be more useful in investigating the pathophysiology of DMD patients. Therefore, here we used a micropatterning platform based on Matrigel-coated PDMS membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herron et al., 2016</xref>) for modeling single-cell cardiac electrical activity. Our findings showed that culturing single ventricular-like iPSC-CMs on micropatterned Matrigel-coated PDMS confers a cylindrical shape yielding iPSC-CMs with structural and functional phenotypes close to those in human mature cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taggart et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grandi et al., 2011</xref>). Electrophysiological analyses in this scenario revealed abnormal action potential profiles in DMD iPSC-CMs, compatible with the clinical alterations observed in both Male 1 and female DMD patients. The strong reduction in <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> density yielded a significant slowing of d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>, considered to be an indirect measure of the available functional sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berecki et al., 2010</xref>). Reduction in <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> density was consistent with the relative loss of total Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 protein levels, and helped us explain the reduced CV in iPSC-CMs from DMD patients. Like other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petitprez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanford et al., 2005</xref>), we did not find any change in Cx43 protein levels.</p><p>QRS widening and QTc prolongation displayed on the ECGs from the DMD patients are likely related to the changes in functional expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Kir2.1 we have observed in their iPSC-CMs. Both QRS widening and QT dispersion are risk factors for arrhythmias in patients with DMD, and have been implicated in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Okin et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly some of the AP parameters of the hemizygous Male 2 iPSC-CMs, including d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>, AP amplitude, and overshoot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), were substantially more reduced than Male 1 and the heterozygous female iPSC-CMs. Such differences are possibly due to the specific mutation in the dystrophin gene. Thus, depending on the mutation in the dystrophin gene each male or female DMD patient might develop different types or levels of cardiac electrical dysfunction and life-threatening arrhythmias.</p><p><italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> reduction coincided with <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> reduction in both hemizygous DMD iPSC-CMs, supporting the idea that both channels require PDZ-mediated interaction with components of the DAPC to modulate reciprocally their proper expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gavillet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leonoudakis et al., 2004</xref>). It is likely that the reduced <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> in the DMD iPSC-CMs contributed to the reduced d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>, although the MDP in the iPSC-CMs from the two dystrophic patients was like control. In this regard, it is important to note that the relationship between MDP and <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> availability is highly nonlinear in such a way that a very small reduction in MDP is expected to result in substantial reduction in sodium current during the action potential upstroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shaw and Rudy, 1997</xref>). Regardless, the biotinylation experiments demonstrated that Kir2.1 levels at the membrane were significantly lower in both DMD iPSC-CMs with respect to the control. The elevated <italic>SCN5A</italic> and <italic>KCNJ2</italic> mRNA levels excluded the possibility that a decrease in gene expression was responsible for the protein loss, and therefore, to smaller <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> densities in the DMD iPSC-CMs. This somehow contrasts with reports in <italic>mdx</italic><sup>5cv</sup> mouse hearts, where the Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 mRNA levels remained unchanged with a strong reduction in the Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gavillet et al., 2006</xref>). As such, the reduction in the Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Kir2.1 protein levels could be related to ubiquitylation and proteasome degradation as suggested previously in studies in dystrophin-deficient <italic>mdx</italic><sup>5cv</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rougier et al., 2013</xref>). However, our results in DMD iPSC-CMs strongly suggest that disruption of the DAPC due to lack of dystrophin significantly impairs ion channel expression and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gavillet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koenig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albesa et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, we demonstrate that the decrease in ion channel current densities is the result of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Kir2.1 trafficking and membrane targeting defects directly derived from the absence of dystrophin. Such defects can be completely reverted by α1-syntrophin expression, as demonstrated by increases in <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub>, and restoration of MDP, action potential upstroke velocity and action potential amplitude, as well as APD abbreviation. On the other hand, the fact that both <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> are only partially reduced in the DMD iPSC-CMs suggests the presence of different pools of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Kir2.1 channels that do not depend on DAPC integrity. Altogether, our results support the idea that DMD cardiomyopathy results in ion channel dysfunction that predisposes the dystrophic ventricular myocardium to arrhythmia with potentially lethal consequences.</p><p>Previous reports indicate that although heterozygous DMD females have negligible skeletal muscle symptoms, they are not free of cardiac involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Florian et al., 2016</xref>). For example, the clinical expression of the X-linked DMD cardiomyopathy of heterozygous females increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Florian et al., 2016</xref>). The female patient represented in this study suffered from a relative severe phenotype, characterized by skeletal myopathy and cardiomyopathy, which could be explained by a malignant mutation disrupting the N-terminal of the dystrophin gene. One could assume that one gene of dystrophin should produce enough dystrophin to preserve function in multinucleated skeletal muscle of females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holloway et al., 2008</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> density in iPSC-CMs from the heterozygous female was even more reduced compared to hemizygous iPSC-CMs. Interestingly, the QRS duration was significantly prolonged on the ECG from the heterozygous female compared to the hemizygous patient (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), suggestive of a more dramatic loss-of-function effect on Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 in heterozygous females. Probably this is related to the heterogeneity seen in immunostaining studies where some heterozygous female cells express normal dystrophin levels while others show absence or very low expression likely due to random X-inactivation of the WT allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eisen et al., 2019</xref>). Because of random inactivation of one of the X chromosomes, heterozygous females should constitute a mosaic of two or more cell types dramatically differing in the extent of dystrophin expression. Thus, it would not be surprising that females with DMD are more prone to suffer arrhythmias because of spatial electrical inhomogeneity due to variable expression of the mutant allele. The heterogeneity in dystrophin expression has been also observed in canine <italic>carrier</italic> models of X-linked dystrophy, which exhibit a cardiac mosaic pattern, where dystrophin in each myocyte is either fully expressed or absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kane et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, the importance of abnormal cardiac measures in heterozygous females who harbor mutations in the dystrophin gene remains debatable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mccaffrey et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Even though <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> density was substantially reduced in the heterozygous iPSC-CMs, neither the total Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 protein levels nor the biotinylated Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 showed any changes. Probably, the variable expression of dystrophin in female individuals results in variable Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 protein levels, while Kir2.1 expression and function are modulated positively to help trafficking of the few pools of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 channels belonging to the remaining DAPC. Another possibility that might explain the reduced <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> in heterozygous iPSC-CMs is that the cells may lack a suitable compensatory response due to DAPC disorganization and malfunction. The chimeric nature of the dystrophin mutation in those cells likely makes it more difficult to support a compensatory mechanism than the complete absence of the DAPC complex as it occurs in dystrophic cells. Nonetheless, the very reduced <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> and slowed CV reported in the present study perfectly correlates with the clinical data from the heterozygous female patient. Prolonged QRS duration is evidence of slowed ventricular activation and inhomogeneous conduction and might be associated with rotor activity as observed in both <italic>female</italic> and Male 1 iPSC-CMs monolayers, which is considered a substrate for reentrant ventricular tachycardia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richards et al., 1991</xref>). This becomes important because although controversial, heterozygous females may have an age-related increased risk of cardiac conduction disease and sudden death; in female patients of X-linked Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy cardiac alterations typically occur late in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Madej-Pilarczyk, 2018</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>We have derived data from experiments conducted in iPSC-CMs from patients who carry independent dystrophin mutations and two unrelated controls, which may be a potential limitation of our study. The original study design included siblings for each DMD cell line. However, getting more experimental groups from the same family was not possible. Nevertheless, both DMD lines lack dystrophin, which gives credence to the idea that loss of dystrophin is important to the shared electrophysiological phenotype independently of the specific mutation. Further, we show new insight into how heterozygous DMD females might show a wide range of cardiac involvement, ranging from asymptomatic to severely impaired electrical cardiac function, particularly the highly reduced <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> leading to slowing of CV, which is reflected on the ECG from the female patient. Thus, together with the structural alterations, the electrophysiological changes may contribute to left ventricular dysfunction in female DMD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lang et al., 2015</xref>). However, the impact of the finding that the female carrier of the mutation presents a decrease in <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> is somehow mitigated by the fact that since she carries a different mutation, it is difficult to define how the reduction of the <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> in the female carrier compares with the reduction observed in the affected individuals.</p><p>iPSC-CMs show significant differences with adult ventricular cardiomyocytes and are still far from recapitulating chamber-specific and layer specific electrical phenotypes of the normal or dystrophic heart. In addition, we cannot generalize our results to patients with different dystrophic gene mutations, such as those underlying Becker muscular dystrophy, which lead to partially truncated dystrophins and may retain specific functional properties of full-length dystrophin. However, enrolling a Becker MD patient was not possible. Also, our syntrophin-mediated rescue experiments were limited to the Male 1 iPSC-CMs line. While caution should be exerted when attempting to extrapolate to the other two DMD cell lines, it is important that the functional defects in the Na<sub>V</sub>1.5–Kir2.1 channelosome were very similar in the iPSC-CMs from all three patients, which gives credence to our interpretation. Altogether, despite some inherent limitations, our findings provide important mechanistic details on DMD arrhythmogenesis and a crucial lead for investigators interested in developed therapeutic solutions for a deadly disease.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Stembiosys consulting fees and stock options</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>Stembiosys stock options</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, Formal analysis, Methodology, Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Resources, differentiation and maturation of iPSC-CMs used in SNTA1 rescue</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Generated all the data presented in Figure 8, Investigation, Methodology, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Informed consent, and consent to publish, was obtained.

Then, 20 µL of non-cardiomyocyte depletion cocktail (-Biotin conjugated) primary antibody was added, flicked 5 times to mix and incubated on ice for 5 min. After primary antibody incubation, 1 mL MACs Buffer was added, and cells were gently triturated followed by a 900 RPM spin for 5 min at 4°C. The excess primary antibody was aspirated and 80 µL of MACs Buffer was used to resuspend the pellet.

In the meantime, LS columns with 30 µm separation filters were placed onto a Quadro MACS Separator magnet, 15-mL conical tubes were appropriately labeled and positioned under each column, and 3 mL of MACs Buffer was run through each column to prime for addition of cell suspension. After secondary antibody incubation, cells were mixed with 1 mL of MACs Buffer. Then, the cell suspension was added to the separating filter on top of the flowing column, followed by 3 × 3 mL of cold MACs Buffer washes while continuously collecting the total flow through. The flow through or iPSC-CMs fraction was triturated and 1 mL of the total suspension was placed in a 1.5 μmL Eppendorf tube to count the iPSC-CMs using a Millipore Scepter with Sensor tips (60 µm), this 1 mL was added back to the iPSC-CMs suspension total. Next, the purified iPSC-CMs were centrifuged, the supernatant aspirated, and then resuspended in media for plating. Plating. The purified (98-99%) iPSC-CMs fractions were resuspended in EB20 media with 5 µM of ROCK inhibitor to 200–300k cells/200–300 µL volume and plated as monolayers on 22 mm × 22 mm cut Matrigel-coated (100 μg/mL diluted in DMEM/F12 media) PDMS.

To address the issue of lack of arrhythmia data, we determined whether by rescuing the defective Na<sub>V</sub>1.5-Kir2.1 channelosome, <italic>SNTA1</italic> gene expression also prevents arrhythmias. These data are presented as new Figure 8 demonstrating that SNTA1 improves conduction velocity toward control (Figure 8a and b), shortens the optical action potential duration. Most important, as demonstrated by the data presented in Figure 8e, as well as in the supplemental movies 2-5, lack of dystrophin in the Male 1 iPSC-CM monolayers significantly increases the inducibility of reentrant arrhythmias (rotors) yielding very complex and highly variable patterns of nonlinear wave propagation throughout the monolayer, recapitulating episodes of ventricular flutter and ventricular fibrillation recorded by ECG in this patient (Figure 1b).

The results were unexpected even to us, and we recognize that the small number of patients may be a limitation. However, as discussed in the manuscript, one possible explanation is that heterozygous females may have a mosaic of two or more cell types with dramatically different levels of dystrophin expression due to random inactivation of one of the X chromosomes. As such, females with DMD might be more prone to arrhythmias due to spatial electrical inhomogeneity caused by variable expression of the mutant allele. Variable dystrophin expression in females most likely results in variable Na<italic><sub>V</sub></italic>1.5 protein levels, whereas Kir2.1 expression and function are positively modulated to aid trafficking of the few pools of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 channels belonging to the remaining DAPC, or possibly another pool belonging to a different protein-complex. Nonetheless, the significantly reduced I<sub>Na</sub> and slowed CV we have observed in the cells from the heterozygous patients clearly correlate with her clinical data. Increasing the sample size was also a part of our initial plan, and it was clear that it would have a significant impact on the conclusions about the defects in cardiac electrical activity in female carriers. Unfortunately, obtaining samples from relatives or other female DMD carriers was no possible. Therefore, we have included this point in the Limitations section of the manuscript acknowledging that our hypothesis regarding X chromosome silencing should be validated in other heterozygote females and/or by deeper genomic analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript has an important mechanistic conclusion.

However now that it is included it should be pointed out the band is quite faint in Panel 2a and, given the amount of cTnT in that lane, the relative intensity is extremely low. Why is the Becker patient not included in Figure 2b?</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree. However, for this manuscript, we only included samples from human tissues to which we had access as a visual example of the reduction in dystrophin levels obtained from ventricular tissue of patients as a reference to compare with. As we acknowledge in the legend of Figure 2, the protein used to generate these data was generously provided by the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Clinic, University of Michigan. Although the original plan was to enroll a Becker MD patient, unfortunately this was not possible in the end. The dystrophin band corresponding to the left ventricle of this patient is faint because Baker MD patients do express partially truncated dystrophins, which may retain specific functional properties of full-length dystrophin. Thus, while cTnT is highly expressed in Becker MD tissues, dystrophin is not expressed at the same level in dystrophic ventricular tissue as in healthy patients, despite being more highly expressed than in DMD patients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. iPS-CMs from the female patient had the highest (dV/dt)max among the positive patients, yet the lowest CV (Figure 4b) and lowest Ina,peak (Figure 5b).

However, we would like to highlight that even though the tendency is real, dV/dt values are close (8±1 for Male 2; 11±1 for Male 1; and 12±2 for Female) and not statistically different among all three patients (please refer to Supplementary Table 1). On the other hand, slowing of CV is known to occur through a variety of mechanisms, including decreased sodium channel availability, and decreased gap junction coupling. We did not observe changes in Cx43 expression. However, it is important to note that the dV/dt<sub>max</sub> of each individual cell in a monolayer depends not only on the intrinsic dV/dt<sub>max</sub> but also on the resting potential, the dV/dt of, and the electrical load provided by neighboring cells through the gap junctions. As such the chimeric nature of the dystrophin mutation in the heterozygous female monolayers and the consequent heterogeneity of proteins expression (as commented above) may have resulted in a reduced overall conduction velocity despite the high dV/dt measured by patch clamping in the isolated iPSC-CMs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Despite the lowest Ina,peak, iPS-CMs from the female patient do not appear to have a reduction in IK1 (Figure 5). What are the implications of this result for the Nav1.5-Kir2.1 channelosome?</p></disp-quote><p>This excellent question is related the previous one. We know that different pools of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Kir2.1 channels exist that are completely independent of DAPC integrity (PMID: 30232268). As a result of the variable expression of dystrophin in female carriers, the levels of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5/Kir2.1 protein vary. In our case, it is likely that the expression and function of the unaffected Kir2.1 channels positively modulates trafficking of the few pools of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 channels belonging to the remaining somewhat functional DAPC. As a result, depending on the chimeric nature of the female carrier cells, the expression and function of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.5-Kir2.1 in regulating cardiac electrical activity will vary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It would be ideal if the elegant rescue experiments in Figures 6 and 7 could be repeated in iPS-CMs from the other two patients as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree. Unfortunately, we no longer have access to cells from those two patients as one has died, and the other is not available to provide additional somatic cells for iPSC-CM derivation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
