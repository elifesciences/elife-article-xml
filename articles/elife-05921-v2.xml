The mechanisms that regulate the number of sensory progenitors are not known. Here, we show that Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGF) 9 and 20, which are expressed in the non-sensory (<italic>Fgf9</italic>) and sensory (<italic>Fgf20</italic>) epithelium during otic development, regulate the number of cochlear progenitors. We further demonstrate that <italic>Fgf receptor</italic> (<italic>Fgfr</italic>) <italic>1</italic> signaling within the developing sensory epithelium is required for the differentiation of outer hair cells and SCs, while mesenchymal FGFRs regulate the size of the sensory progenitor population and the overall cochlear length. In addition, ectopic FGFR activation in mesenchyme was sufficient to increase sensory progenitor proliferation and cochlear length. These data define a feedback mechanism, originating from epithelial FGF ligands and mediated through periotic mesenchyme that controls the number of sensory progenitors and the length of the cochlea.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05921.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05921.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05921.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mammalian ears contain several structures that are involved in hearing. Within the inner ear is a spiral-shaped structure called the cochlea. This contains an array of cells called sensory hair cells that convert sound vibrations into electrical signals, which are then conveyed to the brain. Sounds of differing pitch are detected at different points along the cochlea, so its overall length helps to determine the range of sounds that an individual can hear.</p><p>In the embryo, sensory hair cells and their associated supporting cells develop from ‘cochlear progenitor’ cells. The final length of the cochlea is determined by the numbers of progenitor cells that commit to becoming either sensory hair cells or supporting cells. Two proteins called FGF9 and FGF20 are involved in the formation of the cochlea. FGF20 promotes the formation of the hair cells and supporting cells, but the precise roles of both proteins are not clear.</p><p>Here, Huh et al. studied FGF9 and FGF20 in the inner ear of mice at an early stage of development. The experiments show that these proteins work together to control the number of progenitor cells and the length of the cochlea. FGF20 is produced by the same tissue structure (called an ‘epithelium’) that gives rise to the hair cells and supporting cells. In contrast, FGF9 is produced in another epithelium tissue that produces the cells that line the fluid-filled tubes of the inner ear.</p><p>The experiments also show that both FGF9 and FGF20 act as signals to cells in an adjacent tissue called the mesenchyme, where they activate other proteins known as FGF receptors. These receptors, in turn, regulate an unknown molecule in the mesenchyme that influences the growth of progenitor cells and the length of the cochlea.</p><p>Sensory hair cells can be injured or lost by excessive sound exposure, some medications and as part of normal aging. These cells are not replaced, and so their loss is a major cause of permanent hearing loss. Understanding the signals that produce the progenitor cells will take us one step closer to being able to grow these cells in the laboratory for use in therapies to replace or repair damaged sensory hair cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05921.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05921.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cochlea</kwd><kwd>organ of Corti</kwd><kwd>FGF9</kwd><kwd>FGF20</kwd><kwd>sensory progenitor</kwd><kwd>mesenchyme</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000703</institution-id><institution>Action on Hearing Loss</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ornitz</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation (March of Dimes Births Defect Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ornitz</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99 DC012825</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huh</surname><given-names>Sung-Ho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002046</institution-id><institution>Hearing Health Foundation (HHF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huh</surname><given-names>Sung-Ho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000006</institution-id><institution>Office of Naval Research (ONR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N000141211025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warchol</surname><given-names>Mark E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Microscopy &amp;

The frequency spectrum of sound stimuli is tonotopically represented along the length of the mammalian cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fay and Popper, 2000</xref>). In mouse, the cochlea begins to grow from the ventral otic vesicle at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) and continues to grow and coil, forming approximately one and a half turns by birth. During its development, the length of the cochlea is limited by the number of progenitors that give rise to sensory HCs and SCs, and is further regulated through a process of convergent extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Segil, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Montcouquiol et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu and Kelley, 2012</xref>). In mouse, sensory progenitors exit the cell cycle by E14.5 and begin to differentiate into HCs and SCs. Thus, the size of the progenitor population at this stage of development is the ultimate determinant of the size of the adult cochlea. Progenitor number is determined by proliferation, the timing of differentiation, and in some cases by aberrant cell death. Previous studies indicate that sensory progenitor growth requires mesenchymal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phippard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Montcouquiol and Kelley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braunstein et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2009</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"/>), however, the identity and source of the factors that control this activity are not known.</p><p>Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) have several stage-specific functions during inner ear development. FGF3 and FGF10 signal from hindbrain and head mesenchyme, respectively, to the overlying ectoderm to induce formation of the otic placode and vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Urness et al., 2010</xref>). Later in development, FGF20 regulates differentiation of outer hair cells (OHC) and SCs, termed the lateral compartment of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huh et al., 2012</xref>). Phenotypic similarities with mice lacking <italic>Fgfr1</italic> in the entire otic epithelium suggest that FGF20 signals directly to FGFR1, serving as a permissive factor for differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pirvola et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayashi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huh et al., 2012</xref>). FGF9 signaling regulates structural components of the vestibular system, but alone has no effect on cochlear development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pirvola et al., 2004</xref>). During postmitotic stages, FGF8 signaling from the inner hair cell (IHC) to FGFR3 in SCs regulates pillar cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colvin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mueller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacques et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we identify another critical stage in inner ear development that requires FGF signaling. We show that <italic>Fgf9</italic>, expressed in the non-sensory epithelium, and <italic>Fgf20</italic>, expressed in the sensory epithelium, regulate the number of cochlear progenitors and the ultimate length of the cochlea through signaling to mesenchymal FGFRs. We find that in vivo FGF9/20 signaling to mesenchymal FGFR1 and FGFR2 is required for sensory progenitor proliferation and that mesenchymal FGFR signaling is sufficient to promote sensory progenitor proliferation and extend the length of the cochlear duct. In addition, we show that prosensory epithelial FGFR1 and FGF20 independently is required for differentiation of outer HCs and SCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Fgf9</italic> and <italic>Fgf20</italic> are expressed in the developing cochlea</title><p>In a prior study, we showed that <italic>Fgf20</italic> is required between E13.5–14.5 for differentiation of cochlear OHCs and SCs in the organ of Corti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huh et al., 2012</xref>).

In mice, sensory progenitors exit from the cell cycle beginning at the apical end of the cochlea at ∼E12.5 and ending at the base at ∼E14.5. In contrast, differentiation begins in the mid-base at ∼E14.5 and then extends to the base and apex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu and Kelley, 2012</xref>). Under physiological conditions, once progenitors exit the cell cycle, they do not reenter the cell cycle throughout the life of the organism. Previous studies suggested that during development both epithelial and mesenchymal signals are required to regulate cochlear progenitor proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Montcouquiol and Kelley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doetzlhofer et al., 2004</xref>). However, the mechanisms that control cochlear sensory progenitor proliferation are not known. In this study, we found that epithelial FGF9 and FGF20 signaling to mesenchymal FGFR1 and FGFR2 is required for normal levels of cochlear sensory progenitor proliferation and that inactivation of either the ligands or the mesenchymal receptors results in a shortened cochlea. We also demonstrated that activation of mesenchymal FGFR signaling is sufficient to increase sensory progenitor proliferation and extend cochlear length.</p><p><italic>Fgf9</italic> is expressed in non-sensory epithelia of the cochlea and loss of <italic>Fgf9</italic> results in defects in periotic mesenchymal cell proliferation, causing a hypoplastic otic capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pirvola et al., 2004</xref>).

Redundancy between these FGFs has also been demonstrated in kidney development, where both ligands are required for nephron progenitor maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barak et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, in both cases, the expression patterns of these two FGFs do not overlap, but nevertheless they appear to signal to a common target tissue, periotic mesenchyme in the developing inner ear and CAP mesenchyme in the developing kidney. For the evolution of the kidney and inner ear, it is possible that additive expression of these FGFs from distinct sources was required to take advantage of their unique receptor specificities or unique interactions with the extracellular matrix.</p><p>Tbx1 is a transcription factor that is expressed in both sensory epithelium and mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vitelli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raft et al., 2004</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Tbx1</italic> in mesenchymal cells resulted in defects in cochlear epithelial proliferation indicating a non-cell autonomous requirement for Tbx1 for cochlear epithelial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, the Pou domain containing transcription factor, Pou3f4, also known as Brn4, is expressed in mesenchymal cells in the developing inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phippard et al., 1999</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Pou3f4</italic> resulted in reduction of cochlear length and defects in derivatives of the otic mesenchyme including the spiral limbus, scala tympani, and strial fibrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phippard et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, decreasing gene dosages of <italic>Tbx1</italic> and <italic>Pou3f4</italic> resulted in a significant decrease in sensory epithelial proliferation and cochlear length indicating that Tbx1 and Pou3f4 genetically interact. The RA catabolizing genes <italic>Cyp26a1</italic> and <italic>Cyp26c1</italic>, both targets of Tbx1 and Pou3f4, were decreased in these mice, suggesting that increased RA signaling could directly or indirectly suppress sensory progenitor proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braunstein et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2009</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"/>). Analysis of <italic>Fgf9</italic> and <italic>Fgf20</italic> double mutant mice showed no change in the expression of Tbx1 and Pou3f4 in mesenchyme surrounding the otic vesicle, suggesting that mesenchymal FGF signaling does not directly affect transcription factors that regulate RA signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>Etv4</italic> and <italic>Etv5</italic> function as downstream targets of FGF signaling in other systems including the limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), and <italic>Etv4</italic> and <italic>Etv5</italic> expression were decreased in <italic>Fgf9</italic>/<italic>Fgf20</italic> mutant ears. Future studies will be needed to determine whether FGF signaling including ETV4 and ETV5 regulates RA signaling downstream of Tbx1/Pou3f4 or act in parallel to the Tbx1/Pou3f4/RA signaling pathway to regulate sensory progenitor proliferation. Whether the cellular target of RA signaling is in the periotic mesenchyme or the sensory progenitor epithelium also remains to be determined. It is also possible that the number of nearby mesenchymal cells may influence sensory progenitor proliferation. However, considering that loss of <italic>Fgf9</italic> resulted in decreased mesenchymal cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pirvola et al., 2004</xref>) but did not affect HC formation or cochlear length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), alternative mechanisms may need to be considered.</p><p>The reactivation of developmental signaling pathways may be important for regeneration. Recent publications showed that inhibition of Notch signaling could induce transdifferentiation of SCs to HCs in a damaged cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korrapati et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mizutari et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, Wnt/β-catenin signaling can induce SC proliferation in neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shi et al., 2012</xref>). One intermediate goal of regenerative biology for the inner ear would be to generate large numbers of sensory progenitor cells that could be differentiated into functional HCs and SCs and then be reintroduced into the damaged inner ear. The studies presented here suggest that in efforts to grow inner ear sensory progenitor cells in vitro, that FGF-induced mesenchyme may be necessary. The identification of mesenchymal factors that are regulated by FGF or RA could also be used to support the growth of sensory progenitor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of <italic>Fgf20</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> mutant mice</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see, all three reviewers found the work interesting and potentially important. However, they felt that the data, as they stand, do not provide full support for the proposed model, and that further work and clarification is required. As a minimum, this should include a full characterisation of the mesenchymal phenotype in each of the mutants, including the <italic>Fgf9</italic> and <italic>Fgf20</italic> single mutants for comparison. Improved quantitation of the sensory cell phenotype and levels of proliferation in epithelium and mesenchyme, ideally including a marker other than PHH3, will be important. Alternative interpretations of the mesenchymal phenotype should be considered and discussed. A fuller discussion of the phenotype caused by <italic>Fgfr1</italic> KO in the epithelium is also required, since this also affects cochlear length. The revised version must include citation, acknowledgement and discussion of previously published work that impacts on the current study. In particular, it will be worth examining the IHC phenotype carefully here.</p><p>The full reviews are appended below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting paper that builds on a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huh et al., 2012</xref>) demonstrating a role for <italic>Fgf2</italic>0 in differentiation of the lateral compartment of the cochlea. The new information here is that FGF signalling from epithelium to mesenchyme is both required and sufficient for sensory progenitor proliferation and extension of the cochlear duct. The data are clear and support the conclusions well. However, there is no identification of a potential mechanism for the mesenchymal signal back to the cochlear duct that regulates its growth. As a result, the advance that the study makes over previous work appears to be somewhat incremental.</p><p>A few details of the manuscript could be clarified:</p><p>The normal expression patterns of <italic>Fgfr</italic>1 and <italic>Fgfr2</italic> in the otic epithelium and periotic mesenchyme at the relevant stages should be presented or referred to early on in the manuscript.</p><p>Introduction: ‘…and that mesenchymal FGF signaling is sufficient to promote…’. This is ambiguous. Is this the same signalling from epithelium to mesenchyme as referred to in the previous sentence, or new signalling from mesenchyme to epithelium, also mediated by FGF?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Results: Make sure the text follows the order of the panels in the figure and vice versa—i.e. show <italic>Fgf20</italic> first in the figure.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: The sketch here does not appear to represent the expression patterns shown very well. The two FGF domains appear to abut each other directly, with a very sharp boundary at the junction between non-sensory (thinner) and sensory (thicker) epithelium. This is not shown in the sketch, which does not depict the full extent of the <italic>Fgf20</italic> domain and shows a substantial gap between the two domains.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: It would be helpful to show the <italic>Fgf20</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>; <italic>Fgf9</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> phenotype here, to illustrate the effects of the loss of <italic>Fgf20</italic> alone, even though previously published.</p><p>In the subsection headed “<italic>Fgf9</italic> and <italic>Fgf20</italic> regulate cochlear length and <italic>Fgf20</italic>, not <italic>Fgf9</italic>, is required for lateral compartment differentiation and patterning”, when you state “…the normal pattern of three rows of OHCs… (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>)”, there should be a reference to the later panels (C, D) here as well.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: Please mark on the positions of IHC and OHC on these panels. It looks to me as if there are two rows of IHC in the <italic>Fgf20</italic><sup><italic>βGal/βGal</italic></sup>, especially in the right hand panel. Please comment.</p><p>The density of each HC type is measured for several different genotypes. It should be clarified somewhere that where patterning of the organ of Corti is affected, the whole organ is fragmented and that cell measurements are (presumably) taken over patches where the sensory cells are still present. If density was measured along the whole length of the cochlea, presumably IHC density would also be affected.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>: Other areas marked by Jag1, but not highlighted, appear to show significant differences from controls, e.g. in the top left hand corner of the panel, the domain appears to be twice as big as in controls, whereas the stained area towards the bottom of the panel appears much reduced. Please comment.</p><p>The Discussion is rather brief, and does not really exploit the detail provided in the Results. In particular, the Discussion does not cover the potential differences in roles between <italic>Fgf9</italic> and <italic>Fgf20</italic>, and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and <italic>Fgfr2</italic>. My interpretation of the Results was that <italic>Fgf20</italic> primarily signals through <italic>Fgfr1</italic> in the cochlear epithelium to regulate patterning of lateral compartment of the organ of Corti, while <italic>Fgf9</italic> primarily signals through <italic>Fgfr2</italic> in the mesenchyme to regulate cochlear length, with some cross-activity and redundancy between the two FGF pathways. However, the Discussion merely focusses on the redundancy rather than any differences between the two. It would be interesting to relate any differences to the clear differences between the non-overlapping expression domains of each FGF in the developing cochlear duct, and to the expression domains of the FGFRs, which are not shown (see comment above).</p><p>In addition, there is no mention of how the mesenchyme may signal back to the epithelium to regulate cochlear growth. It is not made clear in the paragraph about RA signalling whether this is being proposed as the mechanism of mesenchymal to epithelial signalling, but the last sentence of the manuscript appears to indicate that this may be a second signalling pathway that is regulating mesenchymal cell behaviour. Do the authors have any speculation on how the mesenchyme may regulate cochlear duct growth? Are there any candidate factors?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>Fgfr1</italic> signalling has been implicated in the regulation of the pool of sensory progenitors that give rise to the hair cells and support cells of the mammalian cochlea and in the specification of outer hair cells during later organ of Corti patterning. In previous studies, Huh and colleagues described the role of <italic>Fgf20</italic> in the mediating the latter function. In the current study the authors analyse the role of <italic>Fgf9</italic> and <italic>Fgf20</italic> in the control of the sensory progenitor pool. Using Cre-drivers they suggest that the ligands signal via the mesenchyme and back on to the otic epitehlia.</p><p>One of my major criticisms of this paper is the failure to reconcile their data with data that is already published. A recent study of the <italic>Fgfr1</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ono et al., 2014</xref>) has not been considered and needs to be evaluated in the context of the authors work. For example, in the subsection “Epithelial <italic>Fgfr1</italic> but not <italic>Fgfr2</italic> is required for lateral compartment differentiation”, the sentence “however, no quantitative data regarding affected cell types or cochlear length was reported” (in <italic>Foxg1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutants) is untrue—the data is presented in Ono et al. Similarly, a paper showing the role of <italic>Fgf20</italic> in the maintenance of Sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors (Munnamalai et al., 2012) has not been cited or considered.</p><p>With this in mind, it is probably worth highlighting the points that are inconsistent:</p><p>a) In <italic>Fgf9/20</italic> knockouts, <italic>Fgf20</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup>;<italic>Fgfr1/2</italic> and <italic>Dermo1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup>;<italic>Fgfr1/2</italic> mutants the inner hair cells are unaffected. In Ono et al., early deletion (using Six1-Cre and <italic>Foxg1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup>) of <italic>Fgfr1</italic> affects IHC; Cochlear length is affected, quite significantly, in the early, epithelial deletions of <italic>Fgfr1</italic> presented by Ono et al. Huh, Warchol and Ornitz do not find any reduction in epithelial size; Proliferation of Sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors was unaffected in Ono's early deletions of <italic>Fgfr1</italic>.</p><p>Alternative interpretations of the mesenchymal requirement of FGFR signalling in the regulation of cochlear length need to be considered. One possibility is that the effect on cochlear length is secondary, not because of a direct action of <italic>Fgf9/20</italic> on <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> in the mesenchyme, but because there is simply less mesenchyme. I think that it is quite likely that a reduction of <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> in the peri-otic mesenchyme at such early stages leads to a reduction in the amount of mesenchyme. As Doetzlhofer et al., had shown, the mesenchyme is important for outgrowth. The authors need to analyse the periotic mesenchyme in these mutants.</p><p>The correlation of sensory progenitors with cochlea length is quite a laboured point. It is clear that even in the absence of Sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kiernan et al., 2005</xref>), the cochlea still extends. It is likely that progenitor proliferation plays at best a contributory role.</p><p>The cochlear of <italic>Fgf9</italic> nulls, as well as the <italic>Fgf20</italic> nulls and <italic>Fgf9/20</italic> double nulls should also be analysed. Are these the same as wild-types or is the <italic>Fgf9</italic> and <italic>Fgf20</italic> phenotype additive?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting study that attempts to show the relative importance of <italic>Fgf9</italic> and <italic>Fgf20</italic> on the development of the prosensory domain of the mouse cochlea. The control of cell number in the prosensory domain of the cochlea is an important and unresolved issue in the field, as there is no apparent cell death, and so the number of progenitors generated directly affects the size of the organ of Corti.</p><p>In the first part of the paper, the authors show a role for <italic>Fgf9</italic> on cochlear length; while <italic>Fgf20</italic> seems to be affecting the number of prosensory progenitors that are being generated, or the way they are being patterned. This role for <italic>Fgf20</italic> has been previously described by this group, and here they extend that work to show that <italic>Fgf9</italic> does not play a role in this aspect. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the paper suffers from not showing data from <italic>Fgf20</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice alone (presumably because this is contained in their earlier publication). I think evidence from this mouse should be included here as part of the current analysis, so that direct comparison is possible; also, its absence makes the description of the various phenotypes rather confusing, and the authors might want to spend some time thinking of a way to describe this part more clearly. In the end of this first section, the authors claim that there are synergistic effects between the two genes; but I am unclear about why they are making this interpretation, since the lack of any patterning defects in <italic>Fgf9</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>, seems to suggest that this FGF acts outside the prosensory domain to affect the length of the cochlear duct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The main point of the second section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), is that <italic>Fgf9</italic> plays a synergistic role with <italic>Fgf20</italic> in the proliferation of the cells of the prosensory domain that will make up the organ of Corti. This is an interesting observation, but seems to contradict the separate roles that the two genes play as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, namely prosensory (<italic>Fgf20</italic>) and non-prosensory (<italic>Fgf9</italic>). The data here are also a little difficult. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>, they are counting cells in histological sections rather than whole mounts? But it is difficult to know how much of the prosensory domain they actually measure, and did they count in exactly the same basal-apical position? This may have been difficult to do, since the (<italic>Fgf20</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup><italic>::Fgf9</italic><sup><italic>-/+</italic></sup>) does show a change in patterning (“less compact”). Thus, the modest counting difference that they observe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref> could be due to differences in cell distribution within the duct? Indeed, from this figure there does seem to be a trend in their data showing that <italic>Fgf20</italic> has an effect on its own, without <italic>Fgf9</italic>, even if their statistical test does not show a significant difference; and so <italic>Fgf9</italic> could be skewing the data by changing the shape of the duct? This leads me to be skeptical of their interpretation that the genes are acting together, instead of independently on two different elements of the observed phenotype.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: I don't think the conclusion that “together, these data show that FGFR1/2, expressed in mesenchymal cells, are required for proper cochlear length formation and for sensory progenitor proliferation, but not for cochlear pattern formation or differentiation” is completely supported in the case of proliferation, since they fail to isolate the two genes for the proliferation part of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), and only look at the double KO. How do we know that FGFR1 is not responsible, on its own, for the proliferation defect, an observation that would be consistent with the previous Pirvola study, I think?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: In which they show that activation of FGFR signalling is sufficient to affect prosensory proliferation, is very interesting, and complements the KO data.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>The authors state that their evidence shows that “in this study, we found that epithelial FGF9 and FGF20 signaling to mesenchymal FGFR1 and FGFR2 is required for normal levels of cochlear sensory progenitor proliferation and that inactivation of either the ligands or the mesenchymal receptors results in a shortened cochlea.”</p><p>Also, that “…the expression patterns of these two FGFs do not overlap, but nevertheless they appear to signal to a common target tissue, periotic mesenchyme in the developing inner ear…”</p><p>But how do we know that pro-sensory-derived FGF9 and FGF20 are signaling through mesenchymal FGFR1/2? Why couldn't they also be signaling through epithelial FGFRs? The fact that overstimulation of FGFR1/2 in mesenchyme changes the epithelial proliferation may suggest this is one route, but does not prove this, I don't think.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Cochlear progenitor number is controlled through mesenchymal FGF receptor signaling” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and Tanya Whitfield (Reviewing editor). The manuscript is much improved and most of the comments have been addressed. There are some discrepancies with previously published work, but these have now been acknowledged and discussed.</p><p>A few remaining issues still need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) As requested, morphological data for the single mutants have been added for comparison in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, but no additional <italic>Fgf9</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> single mutant analysis has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to show proliferation data for this genotype. Reference is also made to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pirvola et al., 2004</xref>, where the authors state that the cochlear duct is of normal length and architecture in <italic>Fgf9</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. However, that paper has no quantitative data concerning proliferation either, and cochlear patterning is not analyzed in detail. If quantitative proliferation data on the single <italic>Fgf9</italic> KO to compare to the double KO are available, they should be included. If they are not available, the claim that the epithelial proliferation phenotype in the double mutant reflects a synergy between the two Fgfs should perhaps be toned down.</p><p>2) None of the data shown appear to use simple pairwise comparisons. Each graph usually shows one (or more) control situation and several experimental situations (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>: one control and two experiments to which a statistical test is applied). If each experiment is compared with the same control, this is not a pairwise comparison, and ANOVA with multiple sample correction should be used. In any case, when an asterisk is used on the bar graphs, it should be clarified what is being compared with what, either with a description in the legend or by using a horizontal bar between the relevant control and the experimental case (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: are all samples being compared with the left hand (white) double heterozygote control?).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05921.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>As you will see, all three reviewers found the work interesting and potentially important.

This result is consistent with the observations of Ono et al.</p><p><italic>Alternative interpretations of the mesenchymal requirement of FGFR signalling in the regulation of cochlear length need to be considered.

I think that it is quite likely that a reduction of</italic> Fgfr1 <italic>and</italic> 2 <italic>in the peri-otic mesenchyme at such early stages leads to a reduction in the amount of mesenchyme. As Doetzlhofer et al., had shown, the mesenchyme is important for outgrowth. The authors need to analyse the periotic mesenchyme in these mutants</italic>.</p><p>Out data is consistent with the observations of Montcouquiol 2003 and Doetzlhofer 2004 showing that mesenchyme is important for epithelial progenitor growth, presumably through production of some trophic factor. Pirvola, 2004 showed that periotic mesenchyme proliferation was decreased in <italic>Fgf9</italic> mutant, resulting in a hypoplastic otic capsule. But this did not affect either cochlear length or progenitor proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pirvola et al. 2004</xref>). Therefore, decreased mesenchymal cell number is unlikely to be the direct cause of the epithelial phenotype. Rather, we propose that FGF signaling within mesenchyme affects some factor that signals reciprocally to epithelial progenitors. We have analyzed periotic mesenchyme for candidate signaling molecules and targets of FGFR signaling. We have shown that <italic>Etv4</italic> is decreased, but we have not yet found a mesenchymal-derived signaling molecule that could regulate epithelial proliferation.</p><p><italic>The correlation of sensory progenitors with cochlea length is quite a laboured point.

For cochlea to elongate, at least two mechanisms are required, 1) Cochlear length should depend on the total number of available differentiated hair cells (which depend on total numbers of progenitor cells); 2) Cochlear length should depend on the proper organization of sensory cells into one row of IHC and 3 rows of OHCs, governed by convergent extension. Many PCP mutants that have disrupted convergent extension show decreased cochlear length. We posit that <italic>Fgf9/20</italic> signaling to mesenchyme is required for progenitor proliferation, thus affecting cochlear length. In addition, FGF20 signaling to epithelial FGFR1 regulates sensory cell differentiation and this also affects cochlear length, but, in our mouse genetic background, this is a relatively small effect (10-25%).</p><p><italic>The cochlear of</italic> Fgf9 <italic>nulls, as well as the</italic> Fgf20 <italic>nulls and</italic> Fgf9/20 <italic>double nulls should also be analysed.

Our conclusion is that there is synergism in signaling to mesenchyme, but no synergism in signaling to epithelium.</p><p><italic>The main point of the second section (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>), is that</italic> Fgf9 <italic>plays a synergistic role with</italic> Fgf20 <italic>in the proliferation of the cells of the prosensory domain that will make up the organ of Corti.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the phenotype is observed at E18.5. We are hypothesizing, based on the data shown, that the FGF9/20 double knockout encompasses two phenotypes that are developmentally distinct and separable. 1) A patterning phenotype that is due to FGF20 signaling to epithelial FGFR1 as was described in our previous publication (Huh, 2012). This patterning phenotype is independent of FGF9. 2) A cochlear length phenotype that demonstrates synergism between FGF9 and FGF20. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> begins to define how these two phenotypes differ. The key data is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. This shows that Control or FGF20 knockout cochlea have normal numbers of sensory progenitor cells. In contrast the <italic>Fgf9/20</italic> double knockout has significantly reduced numbers of progenitor cells. From these data we conclude that FGF20 alone does not affect progenitor cell number, but rather functions later in development to regulate epithelial patterning (differentiation). In contrast FGF9/20 together regulate progenitor cell number. Therefore, these are really not contradictory results and actually define two distinct developmental processes.</p><p><italic>The data here are also a little difficult. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3G and H</italic></xref><italic>, they are counting cells in histological sections rather than whole mounts? But it is difficult to know how much of the prosensory domain they actually measure, and did they count in exactly the same basal-apical position? This may have been difficult to do, since the (</italic>Fgf20<sup>-/-</sup>::Fgf9<sup>-/+</sup>) <italic>does show a change in patterning (“less compact”). Thus, the modest counting difference that they observe in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3G and H</italic></xref> <italic>could be due to differences in cell distribution within the duct? Indeed, from this figure there does seem to be a trend in their data showing that</italic> Fgf20 <italic>has an effect on its own, without</italic> Fgf9<italic>, even if their statistical test does not show a significant difference; and so</italic> Fgf9 <italic>could be skewing the data by changing the shape of the duct? This leads me to be skeptical of their interpretation that the genes are acting together, instead of independently on two different elements of the observed phenotype</italic>.</p><p>We counted pHH3<sup>+</sup> cells within the Sox2<sup>+</sup> sensory progenitor domain throughout the entire cochlear duct, counting every second section from base to apex.
