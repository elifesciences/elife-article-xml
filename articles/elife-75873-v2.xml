Inflammation resolution is in part directed by the differential stability of mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. In particular, tristetraprolin (TTP)-directed mRNA deadenylation destabilizes AU-rich element (ARE)-containing mRNAs. However, this mechanism alone cannot explain the variety of mRNA expression kinetics that are required to uncouple degradation of pro-inflammatory mRNAs from the sustained expression of anti-inflammatory mRNAs. Here, we show that the RNA-binding protein CPEB4 acts in an opposing manner to TTP in macrophages: it helps to stabilize anti-inflammatory transcripts harboring cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) and AREs in their 3′-UTRs, and it is required for the resolution of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered inflammatory response. Coordination of CPEB4 and TTP activities is sequentially regulated through MAPK signaling. Accordingly, CPEB4 depletion in macrophages impairs inflammation resolution in an LPS-induced sepsis model. We propose that the counterbalancing actions of CPEB4 and TTP, as well as the distribution of CPEs and AREs in their target mRNAs, define transcript-specific decay patterns required for inflammation resolution. Thus, these two opposing mechanisms provide a fine-tuning control of inflammatory transcript destabilization while maintaining the expression of the negative feedback loops required for efficient inflammation resolution; disruption of this balance can lead to disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mRNA stability</kwd><kwd>RNA Binding Protein</kwd><kwd>CPEB</kwd><kwd>TTP</kwd><kwd>MAPK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2017-83561-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Méndez</surname><given-names>Raúl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007406</institution-id><institution>BBVA Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Méndez</surname><given-names>Raúl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010434</institution-id><institution>&quot;la Caixa&quot; Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Méndez</surname><given-names>Raúl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002704</institution-id><institution>Fundación Científica Asociación Española Contra el Cáncer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Méndez</surname><given-names>Raúl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Contrato Predoctoral Severo Ochoa</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suñer</surname><given-names>Clara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000654</institution-id><institution>Marie Curie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>COFOUND IRB PostPro 2.0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sibilio</surname><given-names>Annarita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008666</institution-id><institution>Fundació la Marató de TV3</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Méndez</surname><given-names>Raúl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Decay rate of mRNAs encoding inflammatory regulators is controlled by the balance between AU-rich element-mediated deadenylation and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-mediated polyadenylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As part of the innate immune system, macrophages sense infectious pathogens and orchestrate inflammatory and antimicrobial immune responses. These immune reactions require tight temporal regulation of multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, connected by negative feedback loops, which ultimately ensure inflammation resolution. Thus, these gene expression programs are dynamic and coordinately regulated, and alterations of these can cause pathological inflammation and disease, including autoimmune disorders and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carpenter et al., 2014</xref>). While changes in the rate of gene transcription are important for an initial inflammatory response, the duration and strength of the response are determined mainly by the rate of mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rabani et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>AU-rich elements (AREs) are key <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements that regulate mRNA deadenylation and the stability of transcripts involved in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spasic et al., 2012</xref>). The role of the ARE-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP) has been widely characterized in macrophages that have been stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carpenter et al., 2014</xref>), which is the main membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria. During late response to LPS, TTP-mediated mRNA decay limits the expression of inflammatory genes, thereby establishing a post-transcriptional negative feedback loop that promotes inflammation resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spasic et al., 2012</xref>). However, during early response to LPS, TTP activity is counterbalanced by another ARE-binding protein, Hu-antigen R (HuR), which stabilizes its mRNA targets by competing with TTP for ARE occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tiedje et al., 2012</xref>). The competitive binding equilibrium between TTP and HuR is post-translationally regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, whose activation is induced by LPS through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur and Ley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O’Neil et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Of note, ARE-mediated deadenylation and mRNA decay alone cannot explain the variety of temporal expression patterns and destabilization kinetics needed for inflammation resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sedlyarov et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, additional mechanisms are likely required to define the temporal expression patterns of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes. In early development, the cytoplasmic regulation of poly(A) tail length is not unidirectional but rather a dynamic equilibrium between deadenylation and polyadenylation by ARE-binding proteins and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins (CPEBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belloc and Méndez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nousch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Piqué et al., 2008</xref>). CPEBs bind the cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) present in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of some mRNAs and promote the translation of these mRNAs by favoring elongation of their poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivshina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weill et al., 2012</xref>). The activities exerted by CPEBs are quantitatively defined by the number and position of CPEs present in their target transcripts, thus determining the polyadenylation kinetics and the transcript-specific temporal patterns of translation.</p><p>The global contribution of CPEBs to the regulation of mRNA expression during inflammatory processes has not been addressed. In this work, we show that myeloid CPEB4 is needed for the resolution of the LPS-triggered inflammatory response. We further show that the levels and activities of CPEB4 and TTP are sequentially regulated by LPS-induced MAPK signaling. In turn, the combination of CPEs and AREs in their target mRNAs generates transcript-specific decay rates. We propose that these two opposing mechanisms allow destabilization of inflammatory transcripts while maintaining the expression of the negative feedback loops required for efficient inflammation resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inflammation resolution is impaired in <italic>Cpeb4</italic><sup>–/–</sup> macrophages</title><p>To determine a potential contribution of CPEBs to the regulation of inflammatory responses, we interrogated the expression of <italic>Cpeb</italic>-encoding mRNAs during the course of a systemic inflammatory response in sepsis patients.

Since the peak of <italic>Cpeb4</italic> mRNA followed similar kinetics to pro-inflammatory ARE-containing mRNAs, such as <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Il1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we searched the 3′-UTR of <italic>Cpeb4</italic> for AREs; we found 17 repeats of the AUUUA pentanucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). ARE-containing transcripts are stabilized through HuR binding during the early phase of the LPS response and destabilized at later times by TTP binding. The switch between these two ARE-binding proteins is regulated by the LPS-activated p38α MAPK, which is encoded by <italic>Mapk14</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tiedje et al., 2012</xref>). Next, we analyzed BMDMs from myeloid-specific <italic>Mapk14</italic> KO mice (<italic>Mapk14<sup>lox/lox</sup>Lyz2<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, hereafter referred to as p38αMKO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Youssif et al., 2018</xref>) and found that <italic>Cpeb4</italic> mRNA expression levels were indeed reduced in LPS-treated p38αMKO macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Cpeb4</italic> expression is controlled by the p38α-HuR-TTP axis. This observation was confirmed by treating WT BMDMs with the p38α inhibitor PH797804 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To test whether p38α regulates <italic>Cpeb4</italic> expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, we first inhibited transcription in LPS-treated WT and p38αMKO BMDMs; we found that <italic>Cpeb4</italic> mRNA levels decayed significantly faster in the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then assessed whether the stabilization of <italic>Cpeb4</italic> mRNA by p38α was mediated through the differential binding of HuR and TTP. We observed that HuR binding to <italic>Cpeb4</italic> mRNA was strongly enriched after LPS treatment in WT BMDMs but to a lesser extent in p38αMKO BMDMs, as seen in RNA-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that this induced binding occurred in a p38α<bold>-</bold>dependent manner. Similar results were observed in <italic>Tnf</italic> mRNA as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We then analyzed recently published datasets from TTP immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) followed by genome-wide analysis of its associated mRNAs in LPS-stimulated BMDMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sedlyarov et al., 2016</xref>). We observed binding of TTP to the <italic>Cpeb4</italic> 3′-UTR at 6 hr after LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>) when the TTP protein levels were high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), as well as reduced decay rates of both <italic>Cpeb4</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic> mRNAs in macrophages from mice with a myeloid cell-specific TTP deletion (hereafter, TTPMKO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). To further analyze the contribution of p38α signaling to <italic>Cpeb4</italic> mRNA stability, we used human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells expressing the p38α MAPK activator MKK6 under the control of the TET-ON promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Trempolec et al., 2017</xref>). MKK6-induced p38α activation was sufficient to increase <italic>Cpeb4</italic> mRNA levels in these cells, and this effect was reversed by treatment with p38α chemical inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) as well as by shRNA-mediated depletion of HuR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).

Gene Ontology analysis of CPEB4 targets indicated an enrichment of mRNAs encoding for components of the LPS-induced MAPK pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These targets included mRNAs that participate in anti-inflammatory feedback loops that negatively regulate the LPS response, consistent with the phenotype observed in <italic>Cpeb4</italic><sup>–/–</sup> BMDMs. Thus, <italic>Dusp1</italic>, <italic>Il1rn, Socs1, Socs3, Zfp36</italic> (which encodes TTP), and <italic>Tnfaip3</italic> mRNAs specifically co-immunoprecipitated with CPEB4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

The functional importance of the CPEB4 association was confirmed by the observation that both the <italic>Socs1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and SOCS1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) levels were reduced in LPS-treated <italic>Cpeb4</italic><sup>–/–</sup> BMDMs compared to WT BMDMs. Likewise, the levels of the <italic>Dusp1</italic>, <italic>Il1rn, Socs3, Tnfaip3,</italic> and <italic>Zfp36</italic> mRNAs were reduced in LPS-treated <italic>Cpeb4</italic><sup>–/–</sup> BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To confirm that this effect was mediated by the presence of CPEs in the mRNA 3′-UTRs, we studied the stability of reporter mRNAs with or without CPEs in LPS-stimulated RAW264 macrophages. Indeed, after 3 hr of LPS treatment, the stability of a reporter with CPEs increased compared to the same mRNAs but with CPEs inactivated by point mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).

To test this model, we classified the mRNAs that were targeted by both TTP and CPEB4 according to the log<sub>2</sub> ratio between the number of AREs and CPEs in their 3′-UTRs (ARE:CPE score; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In an expression kinetics analysis following LPS stimulation, we found that the ratio between late time points (6–9 hr), during which transcripts are differentially destabilized, was more pronounced for ARE-d than for CPE-d mRNAs; in contrast, no differences were observed at early time points (1–3 hr) or at late time points if the same mRNAs were classified only as a function of their number of AREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

Notably, the downregulated mRNAs had a lower ARE:CPE score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>).

As a transfection control, we used Renilla luciferase with a control 3′-UTR (without CPEs or AREs). The parental Firefly luciferase reporter included five AREs and three CPEs, which were inactivated by point mutations to generate the following combinations of ARE:CPE numbers: 5:3, 2:3, 0:3, 5:0, 2:0, and 0:0 (null) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Compared with the reporter without CPEs or AREs (null), the presence of CPEs correlated with higher mRNA levels at late times after LPS stimulation, and these levels were progressively reduced by the addition of AREs (increasing ARE:CPE score) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>).

First, their activities are coordinately regulated by MAPK signaling pathways. Upon LPS stimulation, p38α MAPK signaling regulates TTP phosphorylation, causing a shift in the competitive binding from an equilibrium between HuR and TTP towards a HuR preference, which stabilizes <italic>Cpeb4</italic> mRNA and promotes CPEB4 expression during the late phase of the LPS response. Thereafter, ERK1/2 MAPK signaling, which is also activated by LPS, controls the progressive accumulation of the active hyperphosphorylated form of CPEB4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guillén-Boixet et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, CPEB4 regulates its own mRNA, generating a positive feedback loop that contributes to the increased CPEB4 levels and activity at the late phase of the LPS response. Additionally, CPEB4 binds to the mRNA encoding TTP (<italic>Zfp36</italic>), adding a negative feedback loop that restores TTP activity during the late LPS response. These results highlight the complexity of the superimposed layer of coordination between the MAPKs signaling pathways in regulating levels and activities of both CPEB4 and TTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Dynamic equilibrium between tristetraprolin (TTP)- and CPEB4-mediated regulation of mRNAs during inflammation resolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates the MAPK signaling cascades downstream of TLR4. p38α controls TTP phosphorylation, causing a shift in the competitive binding equilibrium between Hu-antigen R (HuR) and tristetraprolin (TTP) towards HuR, which stabilizes AU-rich element (ARE)-containing mRNAs.

In these transcripts, the equilibrium between CPEs and AREs provides transcript-specific behavior that contributes to uncoupling the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators (which need to be rapidly silenced) from anti-inflammatory mediators (whose synthesis needs to be sustained longer). Accordingly, ARE-d mRNAs are enriched for transcripts that encode pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are expressed during the early phase of the LPS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spasic et al., 2012</xref>).

Accordingly, we found that CPEB4 was overexpressed in patients with sepsis, while myeloid-specific Cpeb4MKO mice with LPS-induced septic shock had lower survival rates and a more exacerbated inflammation than WT mice. Other components of this circuit can also regulate analogous inflammatory phenotypes. Thus, TTP KO mice have exacerbated LPS-induced shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kafasla et al., 2014</xref>), HuR KO mice display inflammatory phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kafasla et al., 2014</xref>), and p38α deletion in macrophages reduces the LPS response and renders mice more resistant to endotoxic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that CPEB4’s main function is to recruit the polyadenylation machinery and promote the elongation of the poly(A) tail of its targets mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weill et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the role of CPEB4 in macrophage mRNA stabilization during inflammation suggests that the length of the poly(A) tail is not regulated by an unidirectional process (ARE-mediated deadenylation), but rather as the result of a dynamic equilibrium between cytoplasmic deadenylation and polyadenylation.

Converting the Socs1 mRNA to show an LPS-response similar to Ptgs2 by mutating CPEs in the Socs1 3'UTR would strengthen the conclusion regarding the hypothesis of the relative number of AREs vs CPEs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a thorough manuscript with an impressive scope of experiments that the authors should be very proud of.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>(a) Line 95. The authors write: &quot;Cpeb4(deltaM) animals also presented splenomegaly (Figure 1C) and increased splenic levels of the cytokines Il6, Tnf, and Il1a (Figure 1D).&quot; Il6 and Tnf appear to have robust and reproducible effects, but the Il1a effect appears non-significant.</p><p>(b) Line 115. The authors write: &quot;…the levels of anti-inflammatory transcripts, such as Il10 mRNA, were reduced in the Cpeb4 -/- BMDMs (Figure 2H)&quot;. Is this really a robust and measurable effect? Error bars on these measurements appear to be overlapping at all timepoints.</p><p>(c) Line 135. The authors write: &quot;We observed HuR binding to Cpeb4 mRNA was strongly enriched after LPS treatment in WT BMDMs but not in p38a(deltaM) BMDMs…(Figures 3D, S3C).&quot; On the contrary, from Figure 3D, it looks to me like there is actually quite strong Cpeb4 enrichment in HuR IPs upon LPS treatment for both WT and p38a(deltaM) BMDMs; untreated WT Cpbe4 looks to be ~0.015 and treated WT ~1.0 (~60-fold enrichment), whereas untreated p38a(deltaM) is very small, well less than 0.005 presumably, and treated p38a(deltaM) is ~0.4 (~80-fold enrichment). Regardless of the exact numbers, there appears to be robust enrichment of Cpeb4 mRNA in both the WT and p38a(deltaM) macrophages upon LPS-treatment.</p><p>(d) Line 142. The authors write: &quot;…significantly reduced decay rates of both Cpeb4 and Tnf mRNAs in macrophages from mice with myeloid cell-specific TTP deletion&quot; However, from Figure 3F, it looks like there is a large effect for Tnf but actually a much smaller one for Cpeb4. Are both of these decay rates significantly reduced? What are the errors and significance on the RNA decay rates shown in Figure 3F?</p><p>(e) I like the luciferase-based reporter assays in Figures 4J and 5K used to demonstrate that the number of CPEs directly influences mRNA stability here; in both cases, definitively linking this to CPEB4 binding (as opposed to other CPEBs or an unknown RBP, for example), would be significantly strengthened by looking for the absence of this affect in a Cpeb4 -/- background. Have the authors considered undertaking these control experiments?</p><p>(f) The last sentence of the manuscript suggests that mRNA stabilization during inflammation results from a dynamic equilibrium between cytoplasmic deadenylation and polyadenylation. This statement is I assume based on the characterized/known function of CPEs and CPEB4 on polyA tails, but there's no data in the current manuscript on polyA tail length changes in response to CPEB4 binding during inflammation in macrophages. Has this been previously characterized in a similar context? Is it a certainty that the CPEB4-dependent effects on mRNA stability measured in this manuscript result from changes in polyA tail length?</p><p>I think my comments, concerns, and questions listed above are self-explanatory, so I don't have anything additional to add along those lines. This is a dense paper, and I am not a technical expert in every area covered, so forgive me if I missed anything!</p><p>The one additional comment I have is on whether <italic>eLife</italic> is the right home for this manuscript:</p><p>This paper builds from previous work from the authors and other labs that show how CPEB4 and TTP binding to internal elements (CPEs and AREs) can perturb RNA stability in a transcript-specific manner; this is similar to the biochemistry of many other well-characterized RNA element-binding proteins and their effects on stability, which has been described for many different proteins, transcripts, and biochemical pathways. This work provides a new example for how two RNA-element binding proteins, CPEB4 and TTP, regulate mRNA stability by binding their target elements in mRNAs during inflammation. While this is no doubt interesting and important during inflammation, because there are many similar effects that have been reported for different RNA-binding proteins impacting RNA stability in many different contexts, I'm skeptical the findings are of broad interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>; I see this story as one of more specific interest to those in the RNA decay and/or inflammation communities.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75873.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Thus, CPEB4-associated mRNAs accounted for up to 9% and 13% of the transcriptome in untreated and LPS-treated BMDMs. When we considered TTP targets, CPEB4-bound mRNAs represented 53% of the dataset.

We have now included the sample information and alignment statistics obtained with STAR. A supplementary figure with the PCA representation is included in the same file. While first and second components, explaining 74% of the data variance, separate the five time points, the third and fourth components (10% of the variance) distinguish between the KO and WT samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Statistics for RNAseq seems to be done independently per time point. How were the resulting p-values adjusted?</p></disp-quote><p>The p-values were adjusted gene/geneset-wise independently for each time point, and we have now made this clear in the Methods section.</p><p>Although we agree that p-values could also be corrected across the different time points to prevent false positives, after discussing this thoroughly, we decided against it for two reasons.</p><p>The first consideration is related to the philosophy and purpose of these types of experiments; we understand that techniques such as microarrays or RNAseq that screen the biological system of interest in the whole genome were designed as tools for hypothesis generation and for evidence support but were never meant for validation purposes. For instance, in our experiments, they served to complement evidence from other independent studies and were mostly used to select candidate genes from particular pathways. The selected genes could then be validated in independent data with the statistical power being less compromised by multiple testing corrections. With the current p-value adjustment, we control the false discovery rate genome-wide* for every time point even though we know that a great part of the genome might remain unaltered under the condition of interest. We understand that, in every gene singled out from the whole in our experiment, we are already being quite conservative by adjusting with the tests for the rest of the genome.</p><p>The second consideration is that, a priori, as we already anticipated quite different behaviors for Cpeb4-KO activity depending on the LPS exposure time, we expected the changes to occur at the end of the time course. Therefore, we did not want to compromise the statistical power at later time points from genome-wide differential expression comparisons at initial time points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems that all p-values from all time-points should be adjusted together. Would it nor be of interest to use models that fit data across multiple time points?</p></disp-quote><p>This is something we attempted when analyzing the RNAseq data but eventually discarded.</p><p>We considered the longitudinal model proposed by Fischer et al., [1], which is implemented in the <italic>impulseDE2</italic> R package. For a sufficient number of time points, this method proved more powerful in finding differential expression genes than models that use time as a discrete variable. They claimed that to avoid over-fitting, there should be at least as many time points as number of degrees of freedom used in the model, which is a total of six by ImpulseDE2. Indeed, Spies et al., [2] performed a comparative analysis for time-course differential expression methods and found that classical differential expression with deseq2/edgeR with naïve pairwise comparisons outperformed approaches based on time-courses such as impulseDE2 when the time point size was inferior to 8.</p><p>Nevertheless, we believed that the impulseDE2 time-course model could still be useful for monotonous increasing/decreasing behaviors over time. Therefore, we attempted to fit impulseDE2 models in our data but observed patterns that were difficult to interpret. Below we show two genes that were identified as significant by impulseDE2, in which curve fits were really hard to justify under visual inspection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. Is formaldehyde required for RIP with CPEB4?</p></disp-quote><p>In the past, we compared RIP with and without formaldehyde. There is not a big difference in the result, although with formaldehyde the IP allows for more stringent conditions, which helps when the starting material is limiting and/or prone to RNA degradation. That is why we used it in this case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. When using DAVID, what version of the GO database was used?</p></disp-quote><p>DAVID 6.8 version was used. It is now specified in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. Why was the February 2014 3'UTR sequences used rather than a more up-to-date version?</p></disp-quote><p>The RIP was done several years ago, but more importantly we wanted to compare it to other RIPs that were analyzed using the February 2014 3'UTR sequences. Although it is true that a few specific candidates may be missing because of the old version, the global picture will not change overall. Thus, we considered it better to perform comparable analyses at the expense of having some false negatives. In general, the RIPs are analyzed under stringent conditions in order to avoid false positives at the expense of including false negatives. Thus, the contribution of the dataset version is very minor to the final number of false negatives.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18. SEM are used as error bars when plotting data while SD seems more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed this issue with the Biostatistics Unit of our institute. They argue that both SEM and SD are correct. We have now emphasized the meaning and correct interpretation of the SEM measure, bearing in mind its mathematical relationship with SD, i.e., SEM = SD/√n. We also wanted to clarify that the sample dispersion measure (here SEM) is used in the paper only for visualization purposes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19. Converting the Socs1 mRNA to show an LPS-response similar to Ptgs2 by mutating CPEs in the Socs1 3'UTR would strengthen the conclusion regarding the hypothesis of the relative number of AREs vs CPEs.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the point raised by the reviewer. If the aim of the work had been to define in detail the behavior of a specific mRNA, we would have performed fine-mapping as suggested. But to define a general rule concerning the relative number of CPEs/AREs, we considered it better to use “synthetic” 3’ UTRs as short as possible and where the elements were in identical backgrounds (Length, AU-content, additional Cis-acting elements, secondary structure, etc.) and inactivated by point mutations (rather than large deletions or inclusions). For example, Ptgs2 3’UTR is 2500 bp long and contains 14 AREs and 8 CPEs. Including these large fragments in Socs1 would also change other relevant parameters, such as 3’ UTR length, as mentioned above, as well as the relative number of CPEs/AREs, and thus make the interpretation more difficult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a thorough manuscript with an impressive scope of experiments that the authors should be very proud of!</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her comments and specific points.

The authors write: &quot;Cpeb4(deltaM) animals also presented splenomegaly (Figure 1C) and increased splenic levels of the cytokines Il6, Tnf, and Il1a (Figure 1D).&quot; Il6 and Tnf appear to have robust and reproducible effects, but the Il1a effect appears non-significant.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, as indicated by the pv &lt; 0.1, it was only a trend (not significant). We thought it may be of interest to the reader to show this trend, it is now shown as ns (not significant).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Line 115. The authors write: &quot;…the levels of anti-inflammatory transcripts, such as Il10 mRNA, were reduced in the Cpeb4 -/- BMDMs (Figure 2H)&quot;. Is this really a robust and measurable effect? Error bars on these measurements appear to be overlapping at all timepoints.</p></disp-quote><p>This result is the compilation of six experiments (biological replicates). Because the absolute extent of Il10 mRNA induction in each experiment has a high variability, the link between each KO/WT pair is lost and variability is high when compiling the six experiments. However, the difference at the 6 h time point is statistically significant given that in each experiment the difference between the WT and the KO was consistent (we include four representative experiments <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>; Panel A). When we represent individual pairs, at a single time point maintaining the link for each KO/WT pair, the effect of depleting CPEB4 is also clear. Each of these plots loses some information. Originally, we chose the method that contained most information, although visually it is less clear. We would be happy to add or replace the figure by any of the other.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-75873-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) Line 135. The authors write: &quot;We observed HuR binding to Cpeb4 mRNA was strongly enriched after LPS treatment in WT BMDMs but not in p38a(deltaM) BMDMs…(Figures 3D, S3C).&quot; On the contrary, from Figure 3D, it looks to me like there is actually quite strong Cpeb4 enrichment in HuR IPs upon LPS treatment for both WT and p38a(deltaM) BMDMs; untreated WT Cpbe4 looks to be ~0.015 and treated WT ~1.0 (~60-fold enrichment), whereas untreated p38a(deltaM) is very small, well less than 0.005 presumably, and treated p38a(deltaM) is ~0.4 (~80-fold enrichment). Regardless of the exact numbers, there appears to be robust enrichment of Cpeb4 mRNA in both the WT and p38a(deltaM) macrophages upon LPS-treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue.

The authors write: &quot;…significantly reduced decay rates of both Cpeb4 and Tnf mRNAs in macrophages from mice with myeloid cell-specific TTP deletion&quot; However, from Figure 3F, it looks like there is a large effect for Tnf but actually a much smaller one for Cpeb4. Are both of these decay rates significantly reduced? What are the errors and significance on the RNA decay rates shown in Figure 3F?</p></disp-quote><p>Data from Figure 3F was obtained from the available dataset from Sedlyarov and colleagues (https://ttp-atlas.univie.ac.at/wsgi/).

Have the authors considered undertaking these control experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, which we discussed at length in the laboratory when designing the experiment. As shown throughout the study, macrophages develop an aberrant LPS response. Specifically, we show that CPEB4 targets mRNAs are enriched in several proteins of the MAPK pathway, including TTP mRNA (<italic>Zfp36</italic>). Thus, unlike mutations in the cis-acting elements, depletion of CPEB4 has additional effects (such as altered TTP levels) that limit the possibility of drawing clear conclusions about the balance between cis-acting elements. Given that (1) CPEB4 is the only family member that shows alterations in septic patients and in LPS-treated macrophages; (2) (infructuous) previous attempts by our group and others have not identified additional (Non-CPEB) CPE-binding proteins; (3) the CPEB4 KO phenotypes show an aberrant inflammation resolution, we believe it is not far-fetched to attribute the effect of the CPEs to CPEB4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(f) The last sentence of the manuscript suggests that mRNA stabilization during inflammation results from a dynamic equilibrium between cytoplasmic deadenylation and polyadenylation. This statement is I assume based on the characterized/known function of CPEs and CPEB4 on polyA tails, but there's no data in the current manuscript on polyA tail length changes in response to CPEB4 binding during inflammation in macrophages. Has this been previously characterized in a similar context? Is it a certainty that the CPEB4-dependent effects on mRNA stability measured in this manuscript result from changes in polyA tail length?</p></disp-quote><p>This final sentence intended to be an integration of the results of this work with existing literature, where the only described function of CPEB4 is the modulation of the poly(A) tail length. The key point we wanted to raise is that previous studies have considered ARE-mediated deadenylation and destabilization as a binary “end-point” event. In the light of our results, we wish to postulate that the extent of deadenylation (and subsequent destabilization) can be modulated (in extent and time), or even reverted, by the balance between CPEs and AREs. We have clarified this concept.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think my comments, concerns, and questions listed above are self-explanatory, so I don't have anything additional to add along those lines.
