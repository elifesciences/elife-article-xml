To further understand the identity of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons, we used a combination of optogenetic viral transgenic approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects mystacial pad activity, with minimal effects on breathing. These effects are altered by the type of anesthetic employed and also between anesthetized and conscious states. The population of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons we transduced consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved with the regulation of autonomic activity. We show that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons, based on their axonal projections, is a useful strategy to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors. This is of fundamental importance, given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors have been associated with the development and progression of diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>While breathing seems to come easy, it is a complex process in which many muscles coordinate to allow air to flow into the lungs. These muscles also control the flow of air we breathe out to allow us to talk, sing, eat, or drink. The brain circuits that control these muscles, can also influence other parts of the brain.</p><p>The preBötzinger Complex, which is a key region of brainstem circuits that generate and control breathing, contains neurons that also project widely, connecting to other regions of the brain. This helps to modulate the sense of smell, emotional state, heart rate, and even blood pressure. Understanding how the preBötzinger Complex is organized can untangle how breathing can influence these other processes.</p><p>Melo et al. wanted to learn whether they could manipulate the activity of a subgroup of preBötzinger Complex neurons that project into the facial nucleus – a region of the brain that controls the muscles of the face when we breathe – without affecting breathing. If this can be done, it might also be possible to affect blood pressure by manipulating selective preBötzinger neurons, and thus the development of hypertension, without having any impact  on breathing.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, Melo et al. used rats in which the activation of preBötzinger Complex neurons that project into the facial nucleus was blocked. This decreased the activity of the muscles around the nose with hardly any effect on breathing. Melo et al. also found that the state of consciousness of the rat (anesthetized or conscious) could affect how preBötzinger Complex neurons control these muscles.</p><p>Melo et al. also observed that preBötzinger Complex neurons projecting into the facial nucleus had projections into many other regions in the brainstem.

More broadly, most brain regions contain complex and heterogeneous groups of neurons and the strategy validated by Melo et. al. could be applied to unravel other brain-function relationships.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pre-Bötzinger complex</kwd><kwd>facial nucleus</kwd><kwd>optognetics</kwd><kwd>breathing</kwd><kwd>nasofacial activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001782</institution-id><institution>Early Career Research - University of Melbourne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>503275</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Melo</surname><given-names>Mariana R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Early Career Reasearch Transition Grant of Hypertension Australia Ltd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>830365</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Melo</surname><given-names>Mariana R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP231003058</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1156727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The pre-Bötzinger complex, known as the kernel for the breathing generation, consists of separate subpopulations of neurons that project to specific nuclei to coordinate respiratory rhythmicity with different physiological behaviors, such as nasofacial activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breathing is a complex behavior requiring the coordination of multiple motor patterns in the face, upper airways, thorax, and abdomen to enable gas exchange between the external and internal environment and maintenance of blood gas homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>). Strict coordination of breathing with the activity of facial and upper airway muscles underlies the rhythmic orofacial behaviors, such as sniffing, sucking, licking, whisking, vocalization, and swallowing, which are fundamental for ingestive and exploratory behavior, and social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deschênes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deschênes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huff et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takatoh et al., 2022</xref>).

Similarly, coordination of this motor activity with autonomic nervous system activity produces phasic fluctuations of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) that are essential for optimizing cardiac efficiency and organ blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fisher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menuet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Callaghan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shanks et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The network of neurons coordinating breathing is distributed throughout the brainstem, with a major group responsible for generating inspiration located in the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) within the ventrolateral medulla oblongata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 1991</xref>). In rodents, the preBötC consists of a heterogeneous population of ~3000 neurons with distinct, but intermingled, excitatory and inhibitory subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashhad and Feldman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>). Anatomical studies showed that preBötC sends parallel excitatory and inhibitory projections to target nuclei throughout the brain, including to regions responsible for respiratory motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang and Feldman, 2018</xref>).</p><p>As indicated by their extensive projections, preBötC neurons modulate many circuits in addition to those required for breathing activity. For example, preBötC neurons project monosynaptically to key medullary centers for autonomic regulation, and modulate cardiorespiratory coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dempsey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menuet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>). Photoinhibition of preBötC neurons produces the expected apnea, but also causes a significant reduction of sympathetic vasomotor activity, reduces respiratory modulation of BP, and increases cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity to decrease HR and respiratory-sinus arrhythmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menuet et al., 2020</xref>). Neurons in the preBötC also modulate orofacial behaviors. Activation of the developing brain homeobox1 (Dbx1)-expressing preBötC neurons alters the networks responsible for the coordination of upper airways and swallowing, to decrease the probability of swallowing during inspiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huff et al., 2022</xref>). The preBötC also contributes to motor patterns that are necessary for exploratory behaviors, such as sniffing and whisking. In this case, a group of inhibitory preBötC neurons provide monosynaptic inputs onto the vibrissal premotor neurons in the intermediate reticular nucleus (vIRt) to facilitate synchronous whisking. In addition, preBötC contains facial premotor neurons that modulate nasal dilation and mystacial pad (MP) muscle activity to couple whisking to the breathing rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deschênes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takatoh et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Understanding and identifying the preBötC subgroups that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors is of fundamental importance, given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors has been associated with the development and progression of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">El-Omar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huff et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simms et al., 2009</xref>). Although several studies have attempted to understand the physiological function/s of each preBötC neuronal subpopulation, disturbances in breathing, that occur when preBötC neurons are either inhibited or activated, impact our understanding of whether the observed changes are due to the direct effects of preBötC neurons or alterations resulting from changes in the respiratory rhythm and blood gases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huff et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menuet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yackle et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, whilst substantial gains have been made in understanding the expression of selective molecular markers in subgroups of preBötC neurons, it is rarely possible to reliably assign particular neurochemical signatures to unique functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashhad and Feldman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yackle et al., 2017</xref>). For example, while Dbx1<sup>+</sup>somatostatin (SST)<sup>+</sup> predominantly affect the breathing pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashhad and Feldman, 2020</xref>), some Dbx1<sup>+</sup>SST<sup>+</sup> which also express the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) and, in some cases, cadherin-9 (Cdh9+), promote generalized behavioral arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yackle et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To further understand the organization of the preBötC, in this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the preBötC region is composed of segregated subgroups of output neurons, potentially driven by a separate group of rhythmogenic neurons, that modulate specific behaviors, such as orofacial muscle activity. If correct, we predict that selective photoinhibition of preBötC neurons projecting to the facial nucleus (7n) should modulate orofacial behavior with minimal impact on respiratory motor activity. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a combinatorial viral transgenic approach with one virus providing cre-recombinase (Cre)-dependent expression of an optically activated chloride channel, GtACR2, and another retrograde axonal delivery of Cre. We showed that selective transduction and photoinhibition of preBötC facial premotor neurons affects the MP activity while minimally affecting breathing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of different subpopulations of preBötC neurons based on their anatomical projection</title><p>To evaluate whether distinct subgroups of preBötC neurons could be distinguished based on their axonal projections, retrograde adeno-associated viruses (AAVrg), expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP), or the red fluorophore, mCherry, were injected into 7n and the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) (n=3), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

This was co-injected with a Cre-expressing virus, AAVDJ8-Cre-TdTomato, in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n=12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), to transduce the preBötC neurons in the region ventral and caudal to the tip of compact nucleus ambiguus. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Cre recombination was effective and resulted in GtACR2-MuGFP expression in the preBötC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Control injections of AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP alone into preBötC did not produce any transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).

This included immediate interruption of breathing and long-lasting apnea.

The preBötC is the kernel for breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 1991</xref>), but also acts as a master oscillator controlling cardiovascular and orofacial activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deschênes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huff et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takatoh et al., 2022</xref>), and our study aimed to determine whether these functions involved independent subgroups of preBötC neurons. We validated our approach by co-injections of a Cre virus and the Cre-dependent anion channel virus - non-selective preBötC transduction. In agreement with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menuet et al., 2020</xref>), non-selective photoinhibition of preBötC neurons induced apnea, bradycardia, and biphasic effects on BP. We also observed loss of inspiratory modulation of mystacial pad activity, with increased tonic activity, except in rats anesthetized with ketamine/medetomidine where there was no ongoing mystacial pad activity. By contrast, selective photoinhibition of preBötC→7n neurons had minimal effect on breathing or cardiovascular activity, but altered mystacial pad activity with the effect altered by the type of anesthetic or state. The preBötC→7n neurons showed a restricted anatomical distribution within the preBötC but sent substantial collateral projections to several areas in the brainstem involved with the cardiorespiratory regulation. We conclude that these collaterals are functionally active and responsible for the small effects of photoinhibition of preBötC→7n neurons on BP, HR, and respiratory frequency. Both selective preBötC→7n neuron transduction and non-selective preBötC transduction resulted in transgene expression in both inhibitory and glutamatergic neurons.</p><p>The observation that photoinhibition of preBötC→7n neurons significantly affects mystacial pad activity, without affecting breathing, BP, or HR, clearly demonstrates that modulation of preBötC subgroups of neurons based on their axonal projections is a useful strategy. It allows an understanding of the anatomical distribution and neurochemical phenotype of subgroups of preBötC neurons. It also enables assessment of the physiological relevance of these subgroups without interference and potentially the development of secondary physiological changes that occur with profound interruption of breathing. The compartmentalization of the preBötC into segregated subgroups of neurons based on their connections impacts our comprehension of mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors. This is of fundamental importance, given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors have been associated with the development and progression of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">El-Omar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huff et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simms et al., 2009</xref>). For example, exaggerated respiratory-sympathetic modulation seems to be an important mechanism for the development and progression of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moraes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simms et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tatasciore et al., 2007</xref>). Reduced inspiratory modulation of HR is associated with the severity of diverse pathological conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, depression, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">El-Omar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thayer et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, loss of the synchronization between breathing and orofacial and oropharyngeal behaviors, such as swallowing, has significant clinical implications, as it increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia associated with dysphagia, which can lead to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beard et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heemskerk and Roos, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huff et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition of preBötC→7n only transiently affects the mystacial pad activity despite the sustained laser light delivery. These results are similar to our previous study, which showed that non-selective photoinhibition of preBötC neurons transiently affected inspiration and sympathetic nerve activity, while the bradycardia, induced by vagal activation, was retained for the length of light delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menuet et al., 2020</xref>). We do not know the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and further investigation is needed. We can only speculate that intrinsic biophysical properties, such as maintenance of the chloride gradient, may differ between distinct neuronal populations, enabling some neurons to escape prolonged photoinhibition.</p><p>Nasofacial and orofacial activity are sensitive to anesthesia and animal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deschênes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deschênes et al., 2015</xref>). Naris dilation and whisker motion are silent when animals are deeply anesthetized with ketamine/medetomidine but resume in synchrony with the inspiratory phase of the respiratory cycle, as rats recover from anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deschênes et al., 2015</xref>). We also observed that mystacial pad activity is minimal and non-rhythmic under surgical anesthesia with ketamine/medetomidine, but resumes, with inspiratory modulation, as the animal recovers consciousness. In contrast, strong inspiratory-related mystacial pad activity occurs when surgical anesthesia is provided by urethane. In both cases, surgical anesthesia was defined by loss of the pedal withdrawal and corneal reflexes. The mechanisms by which deep ketamine and urethane anesthesia differentially affect respiratory-related motor activity are unknown. Under light ketamine anesthesia, GABAergic cells of vIRt displayed phase-locked firing patterns for protraction or retraction phases of whisking, while only retraction unit activity was recorded under light urethane anesthesia, suggesting that only inhibitory vIRt cells, whose activity is correlated with vibrissa retraction, are active in urethane-anesthetized rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deschênes et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Likewise, the effect of photoinhibition of preBötC→7n neurons on mystacial pad activity is both state- and anesthetic-dependent. Under urethane anesthesia, selective photoinhibition of preBötC→7n neurons silenced mystacial pad activity, while photoinhibition during different phases of recovery from ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia interrupted the inspiratory-related and increased the overall tonic mystacial pad activity. The reason for this substantial state-dependent effect of the preBötC→7n on mystacial pad activity remains unclear, but it has been reported in other systems. Injection of L-glutamate in the NTS induces a substantial pressor response in awake normotensive rats but a depressor response in the same rats anesthetized with urethane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Machado and Bonagamba, 1992</xref>). Photoinhibition of the C1-RVLM neurons in awake rats produces a very small depressor response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wenker et al., 2017</xref>) when compared to that observed in anesthetized animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marina et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, electrical stimulation of the central amygdala induces a significant pressor response in conscious rats but a depressor response under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiou et al., 2009</xref>). Changes in the activity of several fast ionotropic transmitter systems, including glycine, GABA, acetylcholine, and glutamate, have been reported in urethane anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accorsi-Mendonça et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hara and Harris, 2002</xref>). While speculative, we hypothesize that under urethane, the glutamatergic preBötC→7n neurons play a major role in regulating the respiration-related mystacial pad activity, while the inhibitory neurons are more active in the conscious state.</p><p>Under urethane anesthesia, and during the early recovery phase following ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia, inspiratory-related mystacial pad activity was clearly evident. In the conscious state, heterogeneous respiratory-related mystacial pad activity was observed. The electrodes we used to record mystacial pad activity were inserted near the rostral tip of the snout, which is known to be the site of origin of the <italic>nasolabialis profundus</italic>. However, due to the large number of distinct muscles that compose the mystacial pad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haidarliu et al., 2010</xref>), the difficulty of dissecting the rodent snout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haidarliu et al., 2012</xref>), the substantial size of the electrode’s suture pads, and the fact that the <italic>nasolabialis profundus</italic> electromyogenic activity was not recorded prior to the electrode implantation, it is possible that the mystacial pad activity we recorded reflects the activity of multiple inspiratory- and expiratory-related muscles. Nonetheless, given that <italic>nasolabialis profundus</italic> is active during basal respiration, while extrinsic muscles are silent, and preferentially contract during sniffing and whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Britto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deschênes et al., 2015</xref>), we conclude that the inspiratory component of the mystacial pad activity predominantly reflects the <italic>nasolabialis profundus</italic> muscle contraction during urethane anesthesia and the early recovery phase following ketamine/medetomidine. The absence of respiratory-related activity of the mystacial pad in some conscious rats was unexpected, but could be the result of sniffing and/or whisking behavior, as indicated by the high respiratory frequency.</p><p>Non-selective inhibition of preBötC induced apnea and immediate interruption of the inspiratory-related mystacial pad activity, which increased in amplitude and became tonic. The inspiratory-related mystacial pad activity recovered when breathing resumed. This coordinated activity between breathing and orofacial/nasofacial activity has been described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deschênes et al., 2015</xref>). It was demonstrated that both naris dilation and vibrissae retraction are abolished during apnea induced by the application of ammonia to the snout, and their activity synchronously recovers with the resumption of breathing. Nonetheless, the neural mechanisms that underly these responses are still unclear. Non-selective photoinhibition of preBötC neurons may lead to inhibition of preBötC→7n, and at the same time, to inhibition of preBötC inhibitory neurons that project to parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons of the vIRt neurons (vIRt<sub>PV</sub>). The vIRt<sub>PV</sub> was recently identified as the whisking oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takatoh et al., 2022</xref>), and direct projections from preBötC have been shown to reset the vIRt<sub>PV</sub> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deschênes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Golomb et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takatoh et al., 2022</xref>). The vIRt<sub>PV</sub> neurons also receive local presynaptic inputs from non-PV-glutamatergic neurons, which are not required for whisking, and from non-PV-GABAergic neurons, whose role in whisking is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takatoh et al., 2022</xref>). The post-mortem analysis showed that the non-selective approach transduced some vIRt<sub>PV</sub> and non-PV-vIRt neurons, while the selective transduction only sparsely transduced the non-PV-vIRt neurons. Based on this observation, it is likely that the vIRt<sub>PV</sub> activity could have been directly affected by the laser delivery, producing desynchronization of facial motoneurons activity and suppression of the rhythmic whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takatoh et al., 2022</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Photoinhibition of preBötC neurons modulated expiratory abdominal muscle activity</title><p>Beyond affecting inspiratory and MP activity, non-selective inhibition of preBötC also increased and produced tonic activity of the abdominal muscle that lasted for the apnea duration. The active expiratory activity of the abdominal muscles is strictly controlled by quiescent and synaptically inhibited late-expiratory neurons located in the lateral parafacial nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Magalhães et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>). Our results support the evidence that preBötC is a potential source of inhibitory input to lateral parafacial. This interaction could be essential for the generation of active expiration in situations with increased respiratory demand, such as hypercapnia/acidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, in addition to regulating expiratory activity, it has been shown that the lateral parafacial nucleus may also play a role in coordinating nasofacial and orofacial behavior during high chemical drive via direct projections to 7n (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Britto et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, indirect projections from preBötC to 7n via lateral parafacial nucleus may also be involved with the responses on the mystacial pad activity induced by the non-selective inhibition of preBötC.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Facial projecting preBötC neurons have functionally relevant collateral projections</title><p>While there was a clear difference in the effect of selective preBötC→7n photoinhibition on breathing, compared to non-selective preBötC photoinhibition, selective photoinhibition did have small effects on breathing, particularly under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia and its recovery phases. With the selective approach, we observed a much smaller population of transduced neurons with a more restricted anatomical location. We did not see any transgene expression in the parvalbumin-expressing neurons of rVRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alheid et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Both selective and non-selective approaches resulted in the MuGFP expression in a similar proportion of inhibitory and glutamatergic neurons. Interestingly, SST, reelin, and NK1R neurons were transduced. These are known as biomarkers for respiratory preBötC neurons. These results raised the question of whether preBötC→7n neurons are part of preBötC respiratory network or if they are a distinct neuronal group. While our data are not sufficient to adequately address this question, our working hypothesis is that the facial nucleus projecting preBötC neurons are transmitting respiratory rhythm, rather than being responsible for generating it. We conclude that the small effect of photoinhibiting these neurons on inspiratory activity is due to collaterals. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the neurons projecting to the facial nucleus are a small subgroup of the rhythm-generating neurons with collaterals to the facial nucleus. In such a case, the effects on mystacial pad activity could be indirectly caused by the slowing of breathing. This hypothesis could be addressed by inhibiting the axons of preBötC→7n neurons within the facial nucleus. Although we have contemplated directing the optical fibers to the facial nucleus to evaluate this, we are cautious about using GtACR2 to inhibit axonal terminals, given the evidence of increased synaptic activity and neurotransmitter release in response to light-induced activation of GtACR2 at the axon terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Messier et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We observed that the transduced axons of preBötC→7n neurons projected widely into multiple brainstem nuclei, including RVLM, nA, NTS, BötC, rVRG, and vIRt. Collateral projections from excitatory and inhibitory preBötC neurons to premotor and motoneurons have been described before and appear to be essential for the coordination of inspiratory and expiratory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koizumi et al., 2013</xref>). It was suggested that divergent axonal projections from the commissural excitatory preBötC into the HN and rVRG may be essential for initiating the inspiratory activity. On the other hand, feedforward inhibition via collateral projections from inhibitory preBötC into these same regions may contribute to the dynamic shaping of the respiratory pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koizumi et al., 2013</xref>). While the functional role of many of these collateral projections has not been established yet, we hypothesize that the small effect of selective photoinhibition reflects their ongoing, functionally relevant activity. It is possible that the strict synchronization between premotor and motor neurons is not confined to respiratory motor activity, but is crucial for the coordination of respiratory, cardiovascular, and orofacial/nasofacial activity necessary for the execution of complex behaviors, such as exercise, response to stress, or pain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>The preBötC, initially defined as the kernel for generating inspiratory rhythm, appears to act as a master oscillator regulating other physiological functions, such as orofacial behaviors and autonomic nervous activity. Our study suggests that groups of these neurons play principal roles in these specific functions. However, the widespread collateralization we observed along with effects of photoinhibition of the preBötC→7n on disparate motor activities raises the possibility that preBötC neurons may coordinate multiple outputs. Whether this is a function of most neurons projecting to more than one target, or a small number of neurons projecting to many targets, remains to be determined.</p><p>As has been described previously using transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang and Feldman, 2018</xref>), we also observed that different subpopulations of preBötC→7n express either markers of an excitatory phenotype or an inhibitory phenotype. The idea that one output nucleus provides both excitatory and inhibitory projection to a target is intriguing. Our methods could not determine whether these different neurochemical groups might project to the same target neuron, or whether the pathways are parallel and separate. It is possible that the different groups are active under different states and enable altered coupling to the respiratory cycle. For example, we speculate that under urethane anesthesia, when mystacial pad EMG is active, glutamatergic preBötC→7n neurons play a major role in regulating the respiration-related mystacial pad activity and their photoinhibition resulted in a decrease in activity. In contrast, inhibitory preBötC→7n neurons would be more active in the conscious state, and their inhibition resulted in an increase in activity.</p><p>Exaggerated inspiratory modulation of sympathetic activity is associated with the development of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simms et al., 2009</xref>), which can increase BP variability. Interestingly, independent of the BP level, BP variability seems to be an important contributor to organ damage, such as renal dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiovascular disease, and poor clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Messerli et al., 2019</xref>). The central network underlying this autonomic dysfunction remains to be elucidated. Our previous studies suggest that respiratory input from preBötC to the catecholaminergic C1 neurons of RVLM may be involved with the increased inspiratory-sympathetic modulation in hypertensive rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>). In this way, methodologies that only affect inputs from preBötC to C1 neurons, such as the approach used in the present study, could shine the light on the mechanisms involved in the development of hypertension and possibly contribute to the development of targeted therapeutics used to prevent hypertension development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that the preBötC might consist of separate subpopulations of neurons that project to specific nuclei to coordinate respiratory rhythmicity with different physiological behaviors, such as nasofacial activity. We showed that even when selecting just neurons projecting to a specific target, both excitatory and inhibitory neurons were transduced. Selective photoinhibition of these neurons enabled observation of the effect on nasofacial motor activity in the absence of substantial changes in respiratory, or other autonomic, activities. However, small effects on these other functions, such as diaphragm muscle activity, remain. We observed collateral axonal projections of preBötC→7n neurons to several brainstem nuclei, including the rVRG, and conclude that these are functional, active projections. This unmasks the possibility that these neurons may play a role in the complex synchronization between respiratory, cardiovascular, orofacial, and potentially other, physiological functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Surgery was initiated once a deep surgical level of anesthesia was obtained, as evidenced by loss of the pedal withdrawal and corneal reflexes. Throughout the protocol, body temperature was maintained at 37.5°C with a heating pad (TC-1000 Temperature controller, CWE Inc) that was covered with an autoclaved non-absorbent pad. Rats were then placed in a stereotaxic frame with the nose ventro-flexed (incisor bar –15 mm; RWD Life Science). Extracellular recordings of multiunit activity were used to functionally map the preBötC, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menuet et al., 2020</xref>). For all injections, the pipette was 20° angled in the caudal-rostral axis, the tip pointing forward.

Briefly, an electrode was positioned so that this gently touched the mandibular branch of the facial nerve. An electrical current (2.0±0.5 mA) was applied in order to stimulate the nerve. A picospritzer (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) was used to microinject AAVrg (40 nl per injection site over 5 min) into the RVLM immediately caudal to the facial nucleus.

These injections were made in two rostrocaudal levels separated by 300 µm; the most rostral being at the caudal edge of the facial nucleus. A picospritzer was also used to microinject AAVrg (40 nl per injection site over 5 min) into the facial nucleus. The injections were made bilaterally and targeted the lateral and dorsal-lateral borders of the facial nucleus (1.9 lateral to the midline, +1.4 and +1.1 rostral, and –2.9±0.2 mm ventral to the <italic>calamus scriptorius</italic>). At the end of the surgery, the neck muscles and the cheek skin were sutured with sterile absorbable polyglycolic acid 4/0 (Surgicryl) sutures using simple interrupted stitches. Subcutaneous injection of non-steroidal analgesic (meloxicam 1 mg/kg, s.c., Metacam, Lyppard) and 1 ml of warmed Hartmann’s solution for fluid replacement was performed just before the intraperitoneal administration of atipamezole (1 mg/kg, i.m., Antisedan, Pfizer Animal Health, West Ryde, Australia) to reverse the effect of anesthesia. Postoperative analgesia with meloxicam and buprenorphine (0.025 mg/kg, s.c., Schering-Plough, USA) was maintained during the next 48 hr, and rats were monitored for any signs of surgical complications and weighed every day for 14 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optogenetic experiments in urethane-anesthetized rats</title><p>Following the 3–4 weeks of recovery from stereotaxic surgery, anesthesia was induced by inhalation of isoflurane (Rhodia Australia Pty.

Once anesthetized, rats were transferred to the surgical bench, where anesthesia was maintained with 2–2.5% isoflurane, delivered in oxygen using a SomnoSuite low-flow anesthesia delivery system (Kent Scientific). Body temperature was maintained at 37.5°C with a TC-1000 heat pad (CWE Inc). A pulse oximeter probe was placed on a paw, and the body temperature was monitored using a rectal probe attached to the SomnoSuite anesthesia equipment. For dEMG recordings, a lateral abdominal incision was made, and two nylon-insulated stainless-steel wire electrodes (0.25 mm insulated diameter) ending with suture pads (0.7 × 1.0 × 3.2 mm<sup>3</sup>, Plastics One, VA, USA) placed in the costal diaphragm, 3–4 mm apart. For abdominal EMG recordings, a lateral transverse incision was made in the abdomen region, and two silver wire electrodes (0.635 mm insulated diameter, A-M Systems) were implanted in the oblique abdominal muscles, 4–5 mm apart. For mystacial pad EMG, an incision was made along the midline of the nose, and two silver wires (0.38 mm insulated diameter, A-M Systems) were implanted into the mystacial pad near the rostral area of the snout - approximately between rows C and D and columns 5–7, 3–4 mm apart. The femoral artery and vein of the left leg were cannulated for measurement of arterial pressure and drug administration, respectively (PE10 tubing [ID 0.28× OD 0.61 mm] connected to PE50 [0.17×1.45 mm]). Isoflurane anesthesia was gradually replaced by 1.2 g/kg intravenous urethane, following which rats were tracheotomized, and oxygen (100%) was directed over the tracheotomy cannula. The arterial catheter was connected to a Statham Gould (P23 Db) pressure transducer, and the dEMG, AbdEMG and mystacial pad EMG electrode wires were coupled to an amplifier (10 Hz to 5 kHz band-pass filter, 5 kHz sampling rate, Model 1700 Differential AC amplifier, A-M systems, Sequim, WA, USA). Arterial pressure and electromyography were recorded using Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design). Rats were transferred to a stereotaxic frame (incisor bar +3 mm; RWD Life Science). To perform the optogenetic experiments, the optical fibers (200 μm diameter, 0.22 NA, Ø1.25 mm, RWD Life Science) were secured to a manipulator on the stereotaxic frame and lowered through the dorsal surface of the skull through burr holes made bilaterally in the occipital bone centered approximately 1 mm rostral to the occipital suture, 1.8±0.2 mm lateral from the midline. Output intensity from the optical fibers was determined using a PM100D Meter (Thorlabs, NJ, USA). The strongest physiological responses to <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2 stimulation (50 Hz, 5 ms pulse, 15–20 mW) were found at 7.5±0.5 mm ventral to the surface of the skull.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optogenetic experiments in conscious rats</title><p>Following the 3–4 weeks of recovery from the virus injection, animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (75 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg).

Surgery was initiated once a deep surgical level of anesthesia was obtained, as evidenced by loss of the pedal withdrawal and corneal reflexes. Throughout the protocol, body temperature was maintained at 37.5°C with a heating pad (TC-1000 Temperature Controller, CWE Inc) covered with an autoclaved non-absorbent pad. Then, the rats underwent the implantation of a six‐channel pedestal with a back-mount (Type 363 components, PlasticsOne, USA) that contains percutaneous electrodes (2× cardiac electrocardiograms [ECG], 2× dEMG and 2× mystacial pad EMG) and remained externalized for tethering. The electrodes have socket-pin connections at the pedestal and stainless-steel suture pads (~0.5 mm<sup>2</sup>) for electrical recording (PlasticsOne, USA). For implantation of the sterilized multi-lead electrode pedestal, a transverse incision was made on the dorsal surface, approximately 1 cm below the rat’s shoulder blades, and a subcutaneous tunnel opened between the two incisions. The two ECG and dEMG electrodes were placed according to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Callaghan et al., 2020</xref>).

The skin incision was closed with sterile absorbable polyglycolic acid 4/0 (Surgicryl) sutures and the multi-lead electrode pedestal was sutured with sterile non-absorbable surgical sutures (4–0 Supramid) into place between the scapulae. All electrodes were tunneled to the pedestal and connected to it. At this point, the multi-lead electrode pedestal was connected to an amplifier (10 Hz to 5 KHz band-pass filter, 5 kHz sampling rate, Model 1700 Differential AC amplifier, A-M systems, Sequim, WA, USA). The signal was recorded and integrated using Spike2 version 9.0 software (Cambridge Electronic Design).</p><p>Following the implantation of the electrodes, rats were transferred to a stereotaxic frame (incisor bar +3 mm; RWD Life Science). To perform the optogenetic experiments, the optical fibers (200 μm diameter, 0.22 NA, Ø1.25 mm, RWD Life Science) were secured to a manipulator on the stereotaxic frame and lowered through the dorsal surface of the skull through burr bilateral holes made in the occipital bone centered approximately 1 mm rostral to the occipital suture, 1.8±0.2 mm lateral from the midline. Output intensity from the optical fibers was determined using a PM100D Meter (Thorlabs, NJ, USA). Physiological responses to GtACR2 stimulation were investigated at 0.5 mm increments moving ventrally from the surface of the skull. The strongest physiological responses to <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2 stimulation (50 Hz, 5 ms pulse, 15–20 mW) were typically observed at 7.5±0.5 mm ventral, and it was where the optical fibers were fixed with dental cement (Pattern Resin LS, GC America INC, IL, USA).</p><p>The rat was transferred to a recording cage, and the effects of preBötC photoinhibition on dEMG, ECG, and mystacial pad EMG were evaluated under three different states: when the animals were still under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia, during the very early stage of regaining consciousness, a few minutes after the anesthesia was reversed with atipamezole and 1–2 hr after the atipamezole injection when the animal had recovered from anesthesia, was completely awake and freely behaving.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>At the end of the urethane-anesthetized and conscious experiments, animals were perfused transcardially with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1 ml/g of b.w.) followed by 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS using a peristaltic pump (Masterflex L/S Drive System, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). The brains were removed, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 12 hr at 4°C, and then immersed in 20% sucrose at 4°C until processing. Brainstems were frozen at –20°C, and four series of coronal sections (40 µm thickness) were cryostat sectioned. Sections were placed directly into cryoprotectant in a 24-well plate and stored at −20°C until processing. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menuet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ngo et al., 2020</xref>).

The following secondary antibodies were used: Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-chicken (Cat#: 703545155), Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Cat#: 711165152), Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-goat (Cat#: 705165003), Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Cat#: 715175151), and Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-goat (Cat#: 705175003), and biotin-SP-conjugated donkey anti-goat (Cat#: 705065147). Streptavidin-Marina blue (1:200, Cat#: S11221) was purchased from Invitrogen-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Scoresby, VIC, Australia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In situ hybridization - RNAscope</title><p>Brains from SD rats with the selective and non-selective expression of GtACR2-MuGFP were used to perform this analysis. Briefly, brains were freshly extracted (n=3 per group) and frozen in isopentane and dry ice, then stored at –80°C. Brainstems were cryostat sectioned (16 µm), collected, and mounted onto Superfrost-Plus slides (Thermo Scientific). Frozen sections were fixed in 4% PFA for 16 min at 4°C, rinsed twice in DEPC-treated 1× PBS for 1 min each, then dehydrated in 50%, 70%, and 100% ethanol solutions for 5 min each. Dehydrated sections were then stored in 100% ethanol overnight at –20°C. The following day, slides were air-dried at room temperature (RT), and hydrophobic barriers were created using ImmEdge hydrophobic PAP pen (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Sections were incubated with Protease IV (ACD, CA, USA; Cat #322336) for 20 min at RT, rinsed twice with DEPC-treated 1× PBS for 1 min each before incubating with the probe mixture for 2 hr at 40°C. The probe mixture consisted of probes against VGAT (SLC32A1-ACD;Cat #ADV424541-C2), VGluT2 (Slc17a6, ACD; Cat #317011-C3), SST (Sst- ACD; Cat#ADV412181-C3), reelin (Reln-ACD; Cat ADV1048921- C1), and C1 diluent (ACD, Cat #ADV300041). Signal amplification was achieved in accordance with the RNAscope multiplex fluorescence v1 kit manufacturer’s instructions (ACD, Cat #320851).</p><p>Immediately following the RNAScope protocol, the immunofluorescence protocol for MuGFP was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassi et al., 2022</xref>), nuclei stained with 4',6-Diamidine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), and coverslipped using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Imaging</title><p>Imaging was performed at the Biological and Optical Microscopy Platform, University of Melbourne as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassi et al., 2022</xref>). Lower power images were taken using epifluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axio Imager D1 microscope with a Zeiss AxioCam MR3 camera and EC Plan-NeoFuar 10×/0.3 air objective, Carl-Zeiss, North Ryde, NSW, Australia). High-resolution images were captured on Zeiss LSM880 confocal laser scanning microscope with Airyscan detectors (32 GaAsP PMT array) at 20× using a Plan-Apochromat 20×/0.8 M27 objective (Carl-Zeiss, North Ryde, NSW, Australia) and ZEN 2.3 (black edition) imaging software. Z-stack images were taken with 0.4 µm z-intervals, and at least 50% overlap between optical slices obtaining 40–50 images over 15–30 µm thickness. Tile scan was performed with 10% overlap between neighboring tiles to image the entire distribution of labeled axonal fibers in the section. High-resolution images were also captured with high magnification using a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 Oil DIC M27 objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Mapping of reporter expression</title><p>While GtACR2-MuGFP expression was examined across all animals, the maps of the distribution were generated from seven and five representative animals of non-selective and selective expression of GtACR2-MuGFP, respectively. The animal was included in the data analysis only whether muGPF expression was confined within preBötC. To build the maps of distribution, the images containing GtACR2-MuGFP expression were selected and transformed in binary images according to a previously determined protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassi et al., 2022</xref>). The traced bitmap image was overlayed on the corresponding coronal preBötC schematic diagram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Palkovits, 1983</xref>) using the original fluorescence image as a guide. The total number of MuGFP immunofluorescent cells was determined either manually or using a macro every 160 µm. The quantification of co-localization among GtACR2-MuGFP, VGAT, and VGlut2 expression was made manually each ~200 µm. The neuron was considered as positive only if it contained at least eight dots of transcripts for the mRNA co-localized with a nucleus labeled with DAPI. The percentage of double (MuGFP/VGlut2 or MuGFP/VGAT) labeled neurons was calculated in relation to the total number of MuGFP cells that were quantified bilaterally.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Analysis of the muscle activities was performed on rectified and smoothed signals (time constant of 50 ms). dEMG activity was evaluated by its burst amplitude (DIA, V) and frequency (fR, breaths/min). The DIA amplitude, fR, BP, and HR values were extracted from Spike2 at the sample rate of 1 Hz and were graphically represented as absolute values. These values were taken in three different periods: during baseline (15 s before the beginning of photoinhibition), during the 15–30 s of photoinhibition and during the recovery period (15 s post-photoinhibition). SpikeSorting analysis (Spike2 software, Cambridge Electronic Design) was also employed to evaluate to compare the temporal activity of MP during baseline and during photoinhibition. The quantification of the synchronization between MP activity and diaphragm activity during the selective photoinhibition of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons was also performed by analyzing the event-triggered average of MP activity (triggered by the rapid rise of dEMG that occurs at the beginning of inspiration) over 5–8 respiratory cycles during baseline and during the initial period of photoinhibition. The magnitude of inspiratory-related modulation of MP activity in the 150–200 ms before and after the onset of inspiration was plotted in graphs.</p><p>The function ‘modulus’ of Spike2 was used to extract the areas under the curve of the raw signal of dEMG, AbdEMG, and mystacial pad EMG activities. The area under the curve values and the changes in SAP, HR, and fR were extracted from three different periods: during baseline (5 respiratory cycles before the beginning of the photoinhibition), during the photoinhibition, and during the recovery (5 respiratory cycles after the end of the photoinhibition). The photoinhibition period was further divided into two periods: P1 (extracted during the 5 first respiratory cycles from the beginning of photoinhibition or, in the case where apnea was present, was collected the same extension as the 5 respiratory cycles during baseline) and P2 (5 respiratory cycles after the breathing resumption).</p><p>All sets of data were submitted to the normality test (SigmaPlot v11, CA, USA). In cases where the set of data failed to pass the normality test, the data was assessed by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test with multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni-Dunn method (GraphPad Prism9, La Jolla, CA, USA). If the data passed the normality test, two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc. Statistical analysis of the period P1 was performed using either the unpaired t-test, if the set of the data passed the normality test or the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test.</p><p>All data are described as the mean (95% confidence interval) and were graphically represented as mean ± 95% CI using GraphPad (GraphPad Prism9, La Jolla, CA, USA). Differences were considered significant at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia's &quot;Guidelines to promote the well-being of animals used for scientific purposes: The assessment and alleviation of pain and distress in research animals (2008)&quot; and &quot;Australian code for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes&quot; and were approved by the University of Melbourne Animal Research Ethics and Biosafety Committees (ethics ID#21396).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-85398-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting file; Source Data files have been provided for Figures 2, 3, 8, Figures 8 -supplement 1 and 3, and Figure 9.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the facilities and technical assistance of the Biological Optical Microscopy Platform (University of Melbourne) for the confocal microscopy images.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Accorsi-Mendonça</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Leão</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name><surname>Aguiar</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name><name><surname>Varanda</surname><given-names>WA</given-names></name><name><surname>Machado</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2007">2007</year><article-title>Urethane inhibits the GABAergic neurotransmission in the nucleus of the solitary tract of rat brain stem slices</article-title><source>American Journal of Physiology.

preBötzinger complex (preBötC), the brainstem region that generates the respiratory rhythm and coordinates breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors in mammals. The authors present convincing evidence supporting their conclusion that within the preBötC region, there is a subgroup of output neurons that has axonal projections to the facial motor nucleus and provides respiratory-related modulation of nasofacial muscle activity, based on technically elegant, state-of-the-art combinatorial dual viral transgenic and optogenetic approaches in rats. This work will be of interest to neuroscientists and physiologists working on the neural control of breathing and other motor systems.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85398.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Jeffrey C</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01s5ya894</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Jeffrey C</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01s5ya894</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Thoby-Brisson</surname><given-names>Muriel</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/057qpr032</institution-id><institution>CNRS Université de Bordeaux</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.12.28.522095">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.28.522095v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jeffrey C Smith as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Muriel Thoby-Brisson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As indicated by the reviewers, the authors should use traditional markers as a counterstain of the preBötC region to confirm the anatomical location. How can the authors be sure that they have transduced all preBötC neurons in the region ventral and caudal to the NAc, given that preBötC neurons are not definitively defined? Also please note that the coronal section shown in Figure supplement 1B appears to be caudal to the medullary levels containing the preBötC, and hence does not appear to illustrate distinct CTB retrogradely labeled preBötC subpopulations. Additional data addressing the above should be included.</p><p>2) The authors should quantify the expression of mCherry within GFP positive neurons as a control for the specificity of the CN7 projecting neurons by ruling out Cre-independent viral expression, as indicated by Reviewer #3.

It remains unclear to me why the authors consider their neurons of interest (identified based on their axonal projections) as elements of the preBötzinger network. It might just be a problem of semantics: With the term preBötC, are we talking about a region or a network? Are we talking about a function (breathing) or an anatomical location? For instance are the neurons labelled here Dbx1-derived, as is the case for preBötC neurons involved in breathing (Bouvier et al., 2010; Gray et al., 2010)? Are they, for example, somatostatin or NK1R positive? In the present version of the manuscript, it seems that the identification of neurons as being part of the preBötC is only based on their anatomical location. Could the authors provide additional arguments in favor (or not) for these neurons to express any known features of the respiratory preBötC neurons? Or do the authors consider that the neurons of interest are located in the same region as respiratory preBötC neurons but constitute a completely different type of neurons? This should be clarified and addressed in the discussion. More generally, it actually becomes a point that should be addressed in the field, as several labs are identifying small networks in the brainstem that control distinct motor functions all more or less coordinated with breathing behavior. So are we investigating one large network composed of several intermingled small networks or are they really distinct neuronal groups? What is now the definition of the preBötC?</p><p>2. The authors provide evidence that the neurons of interest are a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory phenotypes. The photo-inhibition targets indistinctly either type. It is obvious to expect opposite effects when inhibiting inhibitory neurons versus excitatory neurons. So how do the authors explain the overall effects? Which sub-population (excitatory or inhibitory) is mainly involved in this effect? Are inhibitory and excitatory neurons involved in controlling the same orofacial muscles? Are they sending collaterals to the same brainstem nuclei? This point deserves to be developed further in the discussion (within the text line 435, page 19).</p><p>And of course, this raises the question of what would happen if the labelled neurons would be photo-activated instead of photo-inhibited. Answering this question would imply performing an additional set of experiments with different viral construction, and I don't think this could reasonably be asked of the authors, but they could at least discuss this point.</p><p>3. Sites of projection: it is surprising that the projections of preBötC neurons with the non-specific transduction do not invade more globally the hypoglossal nucleus (Figure 5). In contrast, the labelling appears strongly restricted to a very limited number of hypoglossal motoneurons. Is this just due to the choice of the image or is it really representative? Even more surprising when we compare the same image with the one obtained with selective transduction (Figure 6). Here the labelling invades a large portion of the XII nucleus. It is difficult to understand how fewer neurons could send more projections to the same target. Also, can you explain why the selective transduction does not result in the specific labelling of lateral and dorsal lateral border of the facial nucleus, as expected due to the approach used??</p><p>4. Personal curiosity: Do the authors have indications about the pattern of discharge of preBötC→7n neurons?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>If these can be addressed, the manuscript will be more decisive.</p><p>Does inhibition of a similar number of preBötC neurons impact breathing?</p><p>While silencing many preBötC versus the subset that projects to the facial nucleus impact breathing to different magnitudes, none-the-less, both manipulations slow/stop breathing (most obvious in Figure 8). The magnitude of this effect changes upon the use of anesthesia and the type and depth. An alternative interpretation from the authors of this experiment is that inhibition of a random small number of preBötC neurons (matching the number that projects to the facial nucleus) would similarly slow breathing. The experiments conducted cannot rule this out and such a finding would re-sculpt the main message of the manuscript.</p><p>Does inhibitions of preBötC neurons that do not project to the mystacial pad prevent respiratory modulation of the nares?</p><p>The preBötC neurons labeled by retrograde tracing from the facial nucleus are presumed to directly control the breathing modulation of the nares. While this is a simple conclusion, the experiments cannot exclude that the partial slowing of breathing is indirectly changing the movement of the nares. For example, alternative premotor populations, like the nIRT or nRF (Kurnikova 2019), that receive preBötC input are those that also modulate the activity of the muscles in the nares. In such a case, the axonal targeting of CN7 would have a small effect on the modulation of the mystacial pad. This might be addressed by inhibiting the axons of these preBötC neurons within the facial nucleus.</p><p>Cross correlation of mystacial activity with breathing.</p><p>The authors conclude that the respiratory activity of the mystacial pad is lost by inhibition of the CN7 projecting preBötC neurons. While the activity of the mystacial pad muscle changes (mostly to tonic states), the relationship between breathing and the change in mystacial activity in Figures 2, 3, 7, and 8 is not directly quantified. One possible measurement to show a loss of synchrony would be the cross-correlation between breathing and mystacial muscle activity, as in Kurnikova 2017.</p><p>Other points to address</p><p>– Figure 1C: It would be helpful to use a molecular marker to denote the preBötC (like sst/Nk1R/oprm1) to demonstrate that the labeled neurons are within the anatomical location of the preBötC. In panel C, many labeled cells appear ventral to the preBötC intermingled with other medullary groups that express TH. A similar analysis of the retrogradely labeled neurons in Figure 4F would demonstrate preBötC localization.</p><p>– Figure 2 and 3: Quantification of the expression of mCherry within GFP positive neurons. This is expected to be 100% and serves as a control for claiming specificity for the CN7 projecting neurons by ruling out cre-independent viral expression.</p><p>– Figure 2 D/K vs. 3 D/K: Explanation for why mystacial pad activity increases when the entire preBötC is inhibited but the pad activity decreases when the CN7 projecting neurons are silenced. Also, as in Figure 2, the remaining figures show the mystacial pad activity increasing in a similar direction between both experimental cohorts.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85398.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As indicated by the reviewers, the authors should use traditional markers as a counterstain of the preBötC region to confirm the anatomical location.

This statement has been modified in the revised version of the manuscript. To better characterize, anatomically and phenotypically, the neuronal population of preBötC transduced by viral injections, we also have included in the manuscript new data (Figures 4 and 5) showing the co-localization between muGFP and reeling, somatostatin, NK1R, which are typical markers used to define preBötC neurons (pages 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should quantify the expression of mCherry within GFP positive neurons as a control for the specificity of the CN7 projecting neurons by ruling out Cre-independent viral expression, as indicated by Reviewer #3.

We found that 48.5% (95% CI: 12.77 to 84.23%) of muGFP neurons also expressed mCherry. We recognize that the percentage of co-localization seems to be lower than expected. However, considering that the Cre-loxP system requires only a single molecule of Cre-recombinase enzyme (Van Duyne, 2015), it is plausible that low levels of Cre, that were not detected by immunohistochemistry, had resulted in the expression of muGFP. We believe that the results shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 are more important to rule out the Cre-independent viral expression, showing that the control injections of AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP into preBötC did not produce any expression of muGFP in the absence of expression of Cre (pages 9-10, lines 212-217).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are cells non-selectively and selectively transduced by the vector combination in the vLRt (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and D and Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D), raising the possibility that some of the perturbations of MP activity might be attributable to photoinhibition of these cells, which is worth comment in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this point.

The simplest explanation is that it is due to technical limitations and the strict criteria employed for quantifying expression. A neuron was only considered positive for VGAT or Vglut2 if it contained at least eight transcript dots for the mRNA, and that these were co-localized with a nucleus labeled with DAPI. During the quantification process, it was common to observe MuGFP-positive neurons that expressed four or fewer dots of transcript for VGAT or VGlut2 mRNA or neurons that were not co-localized with DAPI. These neurons were not included in either of the groups MuGFP + VGlut2 or MuGFP +</p><p>VGAT.

We have observed that photoinhibition of preBötC transiently inhibits breathing, blood pressure (Menuet et al., 2020), and now MP activity. In contrast, the bradycardic effect of photoinhibition, induced by vagal activation, is retained for the length of laser delivery. In unpublished data of extracellular recordings of preBötC neurons, a similar phenomenon is observed, with continuous inhibition of some, but only transient inhibition of other neurons. We are attempting to understand this mechanism. One hypothesis is that the maintenance of the chloride gradient is different between different neuronal populations. Clearly, we are interested in whether this difference provides insight into the different neuronal groups and plan to explore this further.

We evaluated the synchronization between MP activity and diaphragm activity by analyzing the event-triggered average (ETA) of MP activity (triggered by the rapid rise of dEMG that occurs at the beginning of inspiration). The comparison was made over 5-8 respiratory cycles during baseline and during the initial period of photoinhibition. We haven’t applied this analysis for the nonselective transduction of preBötC neurons, as photoinhibition of preBötC neurons induced apnea, thus the ETA analysis could not be done. The description of these results (pages 8-9, 11-13), as well as their corresponding new figures (Figure 3E, Figure 8 —figure supplement 3), are included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Selective inhibition of preBötC neurons projecting to 7n in urethane anesthetized rats</p><p>In urethane-anesthetized rats, we found that photoinhibition of preBötC→7neurons resulted in the loss of respiratory modulation of MP activity (3.9 mV [95% CI: 1 to 6.8 mV] vs. baseline 26.6 mV [95% CI: 9.4 to 43.8 mV], p=0.02), whilst producing a minimal reduction of dEMG (23.8 mV [95% CI: 9.9 to 37.5 mV] vs. 29.1 mV [95% CI: 11.2 to 47 mV], p=0.04) (Figure 3E) (pages 8-9, lines 187-193).</p><p>Selective inhibition of preBötC neurons projecting to 7n in conscious rats</p><p>We also quantified the respiratory-related activity of MP in rats under three different conditions: ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia, during the very early stage of regaining consciousness, a few min after the anesthesia was reversed with atipamezole, and 1-2 h after the atipamezole injection, when the animal had recovered from anesthesia and was completely awake and freely behaving. The results show that both activity and respiratory modulation of MP are dependent on the rat’s state/behaviour.</p><p>– Surgical ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia</p><p>Under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia, the MP activity is minimal and nonrespiratory modulated (Figure 8—figure supplement 3A). Photoinhibition of preBötC→7n did not produce any changes in MP activity (page 11, lines 254-257).</p><p>– Early recovery phase.</p><p>During the very early stage of regaining consciousness, the inspiratory modulation of the mystacial pad activity resumed in all animals. Despite this, two different responses were observed on MP respiratory-related activity during photoinhibition of preBötC→7n. We observed that in one sub-cohort (n=3), photoinhibition flattened the inspiratory modulation of MP (1 mV [95% CI: 0.09 to 1.9 mV] vs. baseline: 6.8 mV [95% CI: 6.4 to 7.8 mV], p=0.01) even though it did not affect the dEMG amplitude (40.3 mV [95% CI: 25 to 58 mV] vs. baseline: 32.3 mV [95% CI: 20.2 to 52.8 mV], p=0.25). Interestingly, an increase in respiratory-related MP activity was observed in the second sub-cohort (n=2)two rats tested in this experiment (rat 1: 9.6 mV vs. baseline: 3.3 mV; rat 2: 17.6 mV vs. baseline: 8 mV). Again, dEMG was not affected by photoinhibition (rat 1: 51 mV vs. baseline: 56 mV; rat 2: 43.9 mV vs. baseline: 41.7 mV) (page 12, lines 271-276).</p><p>– Conscious phase.</p><p>Variable responses on the respiratory modulation of MP to photoinhibition of preBötC→7n were observed in conscious rats. We found out that, in 3 out of 5 rats, the ETA analysis did not show respiratory modulation of MP activity at either baseline or during photoinhibition. Given the high respiratory frequency, we speculate photoinhibition was performed during sniffing/whisking behaviour. Intriguingly, we also found that the same two rats that presented inspiratory-related MP activity during the early recovery phase from ket/med anesthesia, had expiratory-related activity when they were fully conscious. Moreover, while the selective photoinhibition of preBötC→7n increased the magnitude of the expiratory activity of MP in one of these rats, it decreased in the other one. These distinct responses are shown in Figure 8 – supplement 2C. It is important to note that despite these different effects in the respiratory modulation of MP, the overall activity of MP, measured as AUC, increased in all rats tested in this experimental protocol (Figure 8T, Figure 9T) (pages 12-13, lines 278-286).</p><p>Our results show that selective photoinhibition of preBötC→7n significantly changes the MP activity without affecting the inspiratory rhythm generation regardless of the rat’s state. We don’t know the reasons why the responses were heterogeneous among the rats. It is possible that the MP activity recorded in animals regaining consciousness or when they were fully conscious reflected the activity of multiple inspiratory and expiratory-related muscles, given the difficulty of dissecting the rodent snout (Haidarliu et al., 2012), the large number of distinct muscles that compose the mystacial pad (Haidarliu et al., 2010) and the substantial size of the electrode's suture pads. Another possibility is that the responses induced by photoinhibition could be related to the animal’s behaviour, such as resting, sniffing, and whisking. Unfortunately, in our experiment, photoinhibition was indiscriminately applied during any behaviour (pages 16-17, lines 370-386).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors should discuss the issues regarding alternative interpretations of the data raised by Reviewer #3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the issues regarding alternative interpretations of the data raised by Reviewer #3 in the responses to their questions 1 and 2, and have included this in the revised version of the manuscript (page 19, lines 428-443).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors should address all other questions/issues raised in the major concerns of Reviewers #2 and 3.

So are we investigating one large network composed of several intermingled small networks or are they really distinct neuronal groups? What is now the definition of the preBötC?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insight and constructive comments. This is an interesting comment and the reviewer’s concerns regarding the definition of the preBötC resonate with us. Our interpretation of the large body of work from other laboratories is that the preBötC is a complex, as opposed to a nucleus, that occupies an anatomical location. Within that location are neurons that generate inspiratory rhythm. These neurons have a particular neurochemistry (Dbx-1; VGluT2; SST; NK1R) but none of these markers are exclusive identifiers. Neurons with these neurochemistries project from the preBötC to other brain regions and are presumably involved in functions other than inspiratory rhythm generation.</p><p>We have transduced neurons in the preBötC on the basis of anatomical coordinates, relative to obex, and the strong inspiratory activity recorded at the site of injection with the injection pipette. In our initial study (Menuet et al., 2020), we demonstrated that these injections transduced neurons caudal to the parvalbumin-expressing neurons of the Bötzinger nucleus, ventral to the subcompact formation of the nucleus ambiguus and predominantly dorsal to, but intermingled with, the catecholaminergic neurons of the ventrolateral medulla. We also observed that the caudal extent of the transduction had some overlap with the very rostral extent of the parvalbumin-expressing neurons of the rVRG. The distribution of transduced neurons in this study is near identical.</p><p>We did not provide evidence in this study of the neurochemical phenotype of the transduced neurons, other than primary ionotropic neurotransmitter, as we did not consider any particular marker definitive. However, in response to the reviewer’s request, we have now included evidence that different groups of transduced neurons express reelin, SST, or NK1R, thus marking them a neurons traditionally ascribed to the preBötC (new Figure 5EG). We also show that some non-selectively transduced preBötC neurons also express NK1R, SST, reelin, or both (new figure 4E-G).</p><p>We do not consider that our data is sufficient to adequately address the question of the exact nature of the neurons we have studied, relative to rhythm-generating neurons. As indicated by Reviewer 3, there are several potential explanations for our data. Our working hypothesis is that the facial nucleus projecting preBötC neurons are transmitting respiratory rhythm, rather than being responsible for generating it. The small effect of photoinhibiting these neurons on inspiratory activity is due to collaterals. However, it is possible, as suggested by Reviewer 3, that the neurons projecting to the facial nucleus are a sub-group of the rhythm-generating neurons with a collateral to the facial nucleus – collateral being a potentially confusing term. Without being over-speculative, we have attempted to briefly address this issue in the Discussion (page 19, lines 428-443), but know that a different experimental dataset is required to directly answer the Reviewer’s interesting question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors provide evidence that the neurons of interest are a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory phenotypes. The photo-inhibition targets indistinctly either type. It is obvious to expect opposite effects when inhibiting inhibitory neurons versus excitatory neurons. So how do the authors explain the overall effects? Which sub-population (excitatory or inhibitory) is mainly involved in this effect? Are inhibitory and excitatory neurons involved in controlling the same orofacial muscles? Are they sending collaterals to the same brainstem nuclei? This point deserves to be developed further in the discussion (within the text line 435, page 19).</p><p>And of course, this raises the question of what would happen if the labelled neurons would be photo-activated instead of photo-inhibited. Answering this question would imply performing an additional set of experiments with different viral construction, and I don't think this could reasonably be asked of the authors, but they could at least discuss this point.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises another very interesting question which we can only partially address with our data. Previous studies, e.g. Yang and Feldman, J Comp Neurol 526: 13891402 (2018) (Yang and Feldman, 2018) have clearly demonstrated that the preBötC sends parallel inhibitory and excitatory projections widely throughout the neuraxis. Our data confirm this in relation to projections to the facial nucleus. An interesting study would be to examine the effect of photoinhibiting one sub-group, either excitatory or inhibitory, however, that is not within our genetic targeting tool-kit at this stage. Our working hypothesis is that the influence of the preBötC on orofacial motor activity will be statedependent, with a predominance of excitatory or inhibitory influence under different conditions. Whilst potentially interesting, we are not sure that photoactivation would provide a particularly informative result as the coordinated, coincident activation of all neurons of a particular phenotype is unlikely to be physiological. For this reason, we favour photoinhibition and predict that definitive answers will arise from more selective transduction and inhibition under different conditions. Without being over-speculative, we have attempted to briefly address this issue in the Discussion (pages 20-21, lines 467-477).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Sites of projection: it is surprising that the projections of preBötC neurons with the non-specific transduction do not invade more globally the hypoglossal nucleus (Figure 5). In contrast, the labelling appears strongly restricted to a very limited number of hypoglossal motoneurons. Is this just due to the choice of the image or is it really representative? Even more surprising when we compare the same image with the one obtained with selective transduction (Figure 6). Here the labelling invades a large portion of the XII nucleus. It is difficult to understand how fewer neurons could send more projections to the same target. Also, can you explain why the selective transduction does not result in the specific labelling of lateral and dorsal lateral border of the facial nucleus, as expected due to the approach used??</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noting this. We made a technical error in adjusting the image for publication and in the process of reducing the background fluorescence, reduced detectability of some axonal projections. We have re-adjusted the same image to correctly depict the level of axon terminal input. In both cases, the axonal projections from preBötC invades the whole hypoglossal nucleus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Personal curiosity: Do the authors have indications about the pattern of discharge of preBötC→7n neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question, but we do not have further data in relation to that at this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>If these can be addressed, the manuscript will be more decisive.</p><p>Does inhibition of a similar number of preBötC neurons impact breathing?</p><p>While silencing many preBötC versus the subset that projects to the facial nucleus impact breathing to different magnitudes, none-the-less, both manipulations slow/stop breathing (most obvious in Figure 8). The magnitude of this effect changes upon the use of anesthesia and the type and depth. An alternative interpretation from the authors of this experiment is that inhibition of a random small number of preBötC neurons (matching the number that projects to the facial nucleus) would similarly slow breathing. The experiments conducted cannot rule this out and such a finding would re-sculpt the main message of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept the reviewer’s comment and potential alternative interpretation of the data. The hypothesis would be that sub-groups of rhythm-generating/transmitting preBötC neurons have collaterals to another specific region. Selective transduction, and photoinhibition, of all of these sub-groups would result in total inhibition of inspiratory rhythm generation. We have added a short section to the Discussion to address this issue (page 19, lines 428-443).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does inhibitions of preBötC neurons that do not project to the mystacial pad prevent respiratory modulation of the nares?</p><p>The preBötC neurons labeled by retrograde tracing from the facial nucleus are presumed to directly control the breathing modulation of the nares. While this is a simple conclusion, the experiments cannot exclude that the partial slowing of breathing is indirectly changing the movement of the nares. For example, alternative premotor populations, like the nIRT or nRF (Kurnikova 2019), that receive preBötC input are those that also modulate the activity of the muscles in the nares. In such a case, the axonal targeting of CN7 would have a small effect on the modulation of the mystacial pad. This might be addressed by inhibiting the axons of these preBötC neurons within the facial nucleus.</p></disp-quote><p>Again we thank the reviewer for their insight and helpful alternative explanations for our data. We contemplated placing the optical fibres in the facial nucleus to see what effect this might have. Our data, including unpublished extracellular recordings of preBötC neurons, demonstrate inhibition when light is directed to the somata. However, through the observations of others, mostly unpublished, we are cautious about using GtACR2 to ‘inhibit’ axonal terminals. Possibly due to differences in chloride gradients in different neuronal compartments, others have reported increased synaptic activity in response to light-induced activation of GtACR2 (Messier et al., 2018). The reviewer’s suggestion might be better tested using the more recently described light-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels, or the Gi coupled eOPN3. We have added a short section to the Discussion to address the issue raised by the Reviewer’s comment (page 19, lines 428-443).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cross correlation of mystacial activity with breathing.</p><p>The authors conclude that the respiratory activity of the mystacial pad is lost by inhibition of the CN7 projecting preBötC neurons. While the activity of the mystacial pad muscle changes (mostly to tonic states), the relationship between breathing and the change in mystacial activity in Figures 2, 3, 7, and 8 is not directly quantified. One possible measurement to show a loss of synchrony would be the cross-correlation between breathing and mystacial muscle activity, as in Kurnikova 2017.</p></disp-quote><p>In consideration of the reviewer’s helpful suggestion, we have quantified the relationship between breathing and mystacial pad activity during the selective photoinhibition of 7n projecting preBötC neurons. We evaluated the synchronization between MP activity and diaphragm activity by analyzing the event-triggered average (ETA) of MP activity (triggered by the rapid rise of dEMG that occurs at the beginning of inspiration). The comparison was made over 5-8 respiratory cycles during baseline and during the initial period of photoinhibition. We haven’t applied this analysis for the nonselective transduction of preBötC neurons, as photoinhibition of preBötC neurons induced apnea, thus the ETA analysis could not be done. The description of these results (pages 8-9, 11-13), as well as their corresponding new figures (Figure 3E, Figure 8 —figure supplement 3), are included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Selective inhibition of preBötC neurons projecting to 7n in urethane anesthetized rats</p><p>In urethane-anesthetized rats, we found that photoinhibition of preBötC→7neurons resulted in the loss of respiratory modulation of MP activity (3.9 mV [95% CI: 1 to 6.8 mV] vs. baseline 26.6 mV [95% CI: 9.4 to 43.8 mV], p=0.02), whilst producing a minimal reduction of dEMG (23.8 mV [95% CI: 9.9 to 37.5 mV] vs. 29.1 mV [95% CI: 11.2 to 47 mV], p=0.04) (Figure 3E) (pages 8-9, lines 187-193).</p><p>Selective inhibition of preBötC neurons projecting to 7n in conscious rats</p><p>We also quantified the respiratory-related activity of MP in rats under three different conditions: ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia, during the very early stage of regaining consciousness, a few min after the anesthesia was reversed with atipamezole, and 1-2 h after the atipamezole injection, when the animal had recovered from anesthesia and was completely awake and freely behaving. The results show that both activity and respiratory modulation of MP are dependent on the rat’s state/behaviour.</p><p>– Surgical ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia</p><p>Under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia, the MP activity is minimal and nonrespiratory modulated (Figure 8—figure supplement 3A). Photoinhibition of preBötC→7n did not produce any changes in MP activity (page 11, lines 254-257).</p><p>– Early recovery phase.</p><p>During the very early stage of regaining consciousness, the inspiratory modulation of the mystacial pad activity resumed in all animals. Despite this, two different responses were observed on MP respiratory-related activity during photoinhibition of preBötC→7n. We observed that in one sub-cohort (n=3), photoinhibition flattened the inspiratory modulation of MP (1 mV [95% CI: 0.09 to 1.9 mV] vs. baseline: 6.8 mV [95% CI: 6.4 to 7.8 mV], p=0.01) even though it did not affect the dEMG amplitude (40.3 mV [95% CI: 25 to 58 mV] vs. baseline: 32.3 mV [95% CI: 20.2 to 52.8 mV], p=0.25). Interestingly, an increase in respiratory-related MP activity was observed in the second sub-cohort (n=2)two rats tested in this experiment (rat 1: 9.6 mV vs. baseline: 3.3 mV; rat 2: 17.6 mV vs. baseline: 8 mV). Again, dEMG was not affected by photoinhibition (rat 1: 51 mV vs. baseline: 56 mV; rat 2: 43.9 mV vs. baseline: 41.7 mV) (page 12, lines 271-276).</p><p>– Conscious phase.</p><p>Variable responses on the respiratory modulation of MP to photoinhibition of preBötC→7n were observed in conscious rats. We found out that, in 3 out of 5 rats, the ETA analysis did not show respiratory modulation of MP activity at either baseline or during photoinhibition. Given the high respiratory frequency, we speculate photoinhibition was performed during sniffing/whisking behaviour. Intriguingly, we also found that the same two rats that presented inspiratory-related MP activity during the early recovery phase from ket/med anesthesia, had expiratory-related activity when they were fully conscious. Moreover, while the selective photoinhibition of preBötC→7n increased the magnitude of the expiratory activity of MP in one of these rats, it decreased in the other one. These distinct responses are shown in Figure 8 – supplement 2C. It is important to note that despite these different effects in the respiratory modulation of MP, the overall activity of MP, measured as AUC, increased in all rats tested in this experimental protocol (Figure 8T, Figure 9T) (pages 12-13, lines 278-286).</p><p>Our results show that selective photoinhibition of preBötC→7n significantly changes the MP activity without affecting the inspiratory rhythm generation regardless of the rat’s state. We don’t know the reasons why the responses were heterogeneous among the rats. It is possible that the MP activity recorded in animals regaining consciousness or when they were fully conscious reflected the activity of multiple inspiratory and expiratory-related muscles, given the difficulty of dissecting the rodent snout (Haidarliu et al., 2012), the large number of distinct muscles that compose the mystacial pad (Haidarliu et al., 2010) and the substantial size of the electrode's suture pads. Another possibility is that the responses induced by photoinhibition could be related to the animal’s behaviour, such as resting, sniffing, and whisking. Unfortunately, in our experiment, photoinhibition was indiscriminately applied during any behaviour (pages 16-17, lines 370-386).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points to address</p><p>– Figure 1C: It would be helpful to use a molecular marker to denote the preBötC (like sst/Nk1R/oprm1) to demonstrate that the labeled neurons are within the anatomical location of the preBötC. In panel C, many labeled cells appear ventral to the preBötC intermingled with other medullary groups that express TH. A similar analysis of the retrogradely labeled neurons in Figure 4F would demonstrate preBötC localization.</p></disp-quote><p>In consideration of the reviewer's suggestion, we have now characterized, anatomically and phenotypically, the neuronal population of preBötC transduced by viral injections. These results are shown in the new Figure 5 of the revised version of the manuscript. Briefly, the new data show the expression of muGFP in different groups of neurons expressing reelin, somatostatin, or NK1R – typical markers used to define preBötC neurons (Figure 5E-G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2 and 3: Quantification of the expression of mCherry within GFP positive neurons. This is expected to be 100% and serves as a control for claiming specificity for the CN7 projecting neurons by ruling out cre-independent viral expression.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we quantified the expression of mCherry within muGFP-positive neurons. We found that 48.5% (95% CI: 12.77 to 84.23%) of muGFP neurons also expressed mCherry. We recognize that the percentage of co-localization seems to be lower than expected. However, considering that the Cre-loxP system requires only a single molecule of Cre-recombinase enzyme (Van Duyne, 2015), it is plausible that low levels of Cre, that were not detected by immunohistochemistry, had resulted in the expression of muGFP. We believe that the results shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 are more important to rule out the Cre-independent viral expression, showing that the control injections of AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP into preBötC did not produce any expression of muGFP in the absence of expression of Cre (pages 9-10, lines 212-217).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2 D/K vs. 3 D/K: Explanation for why mystacial pad activity increases when the entire preBötC is inhibited but the pad activity decreases when the CN7 projecting neurons are silenced. Also, as in Figure 2, the remaining figures show the mystacial pad activity increasing in a similar direction between both experimental cohorts.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important question. We don’t know why silencing preBotC→7n decreases mystacial pad activity in urethane-anesthetized rats, while the opposite response is seen when the entire preBötC is inhibited. One possible explanation might related to the population of neurons transduced – whilst a similar proportion of inhibitory and excitatory, as well as SST+, reelin+, and NK1R+ neurons were transduced by both approaches, the selective approach resulted in a much smaller population of transduced neurons with a more restricted anatomical location. Another explanation might be statedependent activation of different neuronal populations. Interestingly, mystacial pad activity increases with the photoinhibition of preBötC→7n neurons in conscious rats. Unfortunately, the experiments necessary to unravel the mechanisms that might underlie state-dependent effects are beyond this study. However, based on previous studies that reported opposite effects with interventions made in anesthetised versus conscious animals (Machado and Bonagamba, 1992; Wenker et al., 2017; Marina et al., 2011; Chiou et al., 2000), a possible explanation for our results is that under urethane, the glutamatergic preBötC→7n neurons play a major role in regulating the respiration-related mystacial pad activity, whilst the inhibitory neurons are more active in the conscious state.</p><p>References</p><p>Chitravanshi VC, Sapru HN. 1999.
