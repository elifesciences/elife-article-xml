To accomplish this task, axons of developing neurons rely on guidance provided by a variety of extracellular cues expressed in the surrounding environment and distal targets. Indeed, as developing axons extend into the periphery, they encounter a plethora of target-derived signals that they must interpret properly in order to accomplish proper axonal guidance, maturation, survival, target innervation, and synapse formation.</p><p>Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is an important regulator of sensory neuron development. BMPs are members of the TGFβ superfamily of secreted growth factors and are required for a wide range of developmental functions including gastrulation, mesoderm formation, neural patterning, left-right asymmetry, skeletal and limb development, kidney formation, and heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhao, 2003</xref>). In addition to patterning, BMPs also function as axon guidance molecules. BMP7 in the spinal cord roof plate repels axons of developing commissural neurons thus orienting their growth toward the floor plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augsburger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butler and Dodd, 2003</xref>). Moreover, BMP4 is a target-derived cue that augments development of somatosensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). BMP4 is expressed in the developing craniofacial region and signals retrogradely to coordinate differential gene expression and patterning along the dorsoventral axis of the trigeminal ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hodge et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, BMP4 appears to have a trophic effect on TG and DRG neurons as altering the level of BMP4 expression in the skin leads to changes in the peripheral innervation and number of sensory neurons found in both the TG and DRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guha et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, BMP4 signaling contributes to sensory neuron maturation and target innervation; however, the mechanisms by which BMP4 acts on developing sensory neurons to promote axonal growth remain to be elucidated.</p><p>We performed a forward genetic screen in the mouse to identify novel regulators of PNS development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Merte et al., 2010</xref>). One of the lines that emerged from this screen has a mutation in the gene <italic>Megf8</italic>; loss of Megf8 function leads to defasciculation of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve as well as defects in development of the heart, limb, skeleton, and left-right asymmetry. Given these phenotypes, we hypothesized that Megf8 interacts with the BMP4 signaling pathway. Indeed, loss of BMP signaling in trigeminal neurons leads to ophthalmic nerve defects that resemble those observed in <italic>Megf8</italic> loss-of-function mouse lines. Furthermore, TG axon growth is robustly inhibited by BMP4, and this inhibition is dependent on Megf8 expression. Taken together, these results show that Megf8 is a novel mediator of BMP signaling and is required for guidance of developing TG axons by target-derived BMP4.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A forward genetic screen identifies line 687, which exhibits defasciculation of trigeminal ganglion axons</title><p>We performed ENU mutagenesis and a recessive three-generation forward genetic screen in the mouse to identify novel growth and guidance cues for developing PNS axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Merte et al., 2010</xref>). One of the mutant mouse lines, Line 687, exhibits severe defasciculation of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. In Line 687 mutants, the two major branches of the ophthalmic nerve initially form properly as tightly bound fascicles; however, as the axons extend into the target field, they prematurely defasciculate within the face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Furthermore, loss of <italic>Megf8</italic> leads to a disruption of left-right patterning. Approximately one third of <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos demonstrate a complete left-right inversion of heart looping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) or embryonic turning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Taken together with prior results, these findings indicate that Megf8 is required for development of left-right asymmetry.</p><p>In addition to its role in development of the limb, skeleton, and left-right asymmetry, Megf8 is also required for normal heart development. In addition to the inversion of heart looping observed in some <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>L1775P/L1775P</italic></sup> embryos, loss of Megf8 function leads to a complete, or nearly complete, absence of the mitral and tricuspid valves, swollen atria, transposition of the outflow tract, pulmonary stenosis, and atrial and ventricular septal defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). These phenotypes were seen in all embryos at E14.5 or later, and they lead to severe peripheral edema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and embryonic lethality by age E16.5. Analysis at earlier stages revealed apparently normal endocardial cushion mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), which implies that the terminal pathologies result from improper remodeling events after E12.5. Conditional mutation of the <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>Flox</italic></sup> allele using the <italic>Mesp1-Cre</italic> line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Saga et al., 1999</xref>), which is active in all mesoderm of the heart, did not cause any heart phenotypes (data not shown), implying that early heart and embryo laterality defects might be responsible for the constellation of later heart defects. These findings are consistent with a second mouse line harboring a <italic>Megf8</italic> point mutation (<italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>C193R</italic></sup>) that was identified in an independent forward genetic screen and which was shown to have polydactyly and defects in left-right patterning and heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Because <italic>Megf8</italic> is expressed strongly throughout the nervous system, we next investigated the function of Megf8 in the developing PNS, in addition to its role in the TG. In <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos, spinal nerves are shorter at E11.5 than in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,D</xref>), and by E13.5 the radial and ulnar nerves have not fully extended into the limbs, appearing shorter and less branched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,E</xref>). At E13.5 the limbs appear immature in <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos relative to wild type littermates, which may contribute to the radial and ulnar nerve phenotypes. <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos also display defects in the developing vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. At E11.5 these nerves are slightly defasciculated and several wayward axons branch away from the main fiber bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,F</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these findings demonstrate that Megf8 is required for proper axonal extension in several areas of the PNS, including the TG, DRG, and vagus/glossopharyngeal nerves (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Given the broad expression of <italic>Megf8</italic> in a wide range of tissues during development, we next asked whether these defects, and in particular the TG defect, are due to a cell autonomous function of Megf8 in sensory neurons. To address this question, we crossed the conditional <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>Flox</italic></sup> line with the transgenic <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic> line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Danielian et al., 1998</xref>) in which cre recombinase is expressed in neural crest-derived cells, including sensory neurons. <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic>-mediated conditional deletion of <italic>Megf8</italic> leads to defasciculation of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, phenocopying <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>L1775P/L1775P</italic></sup> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Although all <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Megf8</italic><sup><italic>Flox/Flox</italic></sup> embryos showed defasciculation of the ophthalmic branch, the severity of the phenotype was more variable than in <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>L1775P/L1775P</italic></sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), and in a few embryos the ophthalmic branch defasciculated completely around the eye and failed to project into the periphery (data not shown). These findings suggest that Megf8 mediates guidance of developing TG axons in a cell autonomous manner. <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Megf8</italic><sup><italic>Flox/Flox</italic></sup> embryos do not exhibit a defect in radial/ulnar nerve development, however, suggesting that Megf8’s role in spinal nerve axon guidance is non-cell autonomous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of note, <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Megf8</italic><sup><italic>Flox/Flox</italic></sup> embryos do not exhibit the limb immaturity seen in <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos. Thus, one possibility is that the radial/ulnar nerve phenotype observed in <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos is secondary to an overall delay in limb development. An alternative explanation is that Megf8 may be required in spinal motor neurons, and that a loss of motor neuron axon guidance in <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos causes a subsequent disruption in DRG sensory axon guidance; this indirect effect of Megf8 on DRG sensory neuron axon guidance would not be evident in <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Megf8</italic><sup><italic>Flox/Flox</italic></sup> embryos.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01160.013</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Summary of <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> phenotypes and implicated BMPs</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01160.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01160.013</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Phenotype</th><th><italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup></th><th colspan="2">BMP implicated</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Trigeminal nerve (V1) defasciculation</td><td>100% (10/10)</td><td>n.d.</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Trigeminal patterning</td><td>n.d.</td><td>BMP4</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hodge et al., 2007</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>Polydactyly</td><td>100% (9/9)</td><td>BMP4, BMP7</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dudley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunn et al., 1997</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>Reversed heart looping</td><td>33% (7/21)</td><td>BMP4</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fujiwara et al., 2002</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>Reversed embryonic turning (E11.5)</td><td>33% (5/15)</td><td>BMP4</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fujiwara et al., 2002</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>Edema (E13.5+)</td><td>100% (6/6)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>DRG spinal nerves undergrown (E11.5)</td><td>100% (10/10)</td><td>BMP4</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guha et al., 2004</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>Radial/ulnar nerves undergrown (E13.5)</td><td>100% (2/2)</td><td>BMP4</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guha et al., 2004</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>Vagus defasciculation</td><td>90% (9/10)</td><td>n.d.</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Exencephaly</td><td>36% (16/45)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Disrupted <italic>BMP4</italic> expression around V1</td><td>100% (4/4)</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Phenotypes, stages of observation and penetrances of <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mutants are listed.

The spectrum of phenotypes seen in <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos is strikingly similar to that observed when BMP signaling is disrupted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). BMPs are members of the TGF-β superfamily of extracellular ligands and have been implicated in a wide range of developmental functions. We noted that loss of BMP4, and to a lesser extent BMP2 and BMP7, results in similar defects as those observed in the <italic>Megf8</italic> mutants. <italic>Bmp4</italic> and <italic>Bmp7</italic> loss-of-function mouse lines exhibit pre-axial polydactyly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dudley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Luo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunn et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Selever et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Bmp4</italic> null embryos also display disrupted left-right patterning and loss of normal rightward heart looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fujiwara et al., 2002</xref>). Loss of BMP4, or its receptor BMPR2, results in a wide range of heart defects, including atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, atrioventricular septal defects, and abnormal positioning or septation of the outflow tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jiao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beppu et al., 2009</xref>); several of these cardiac phenotypes are exacerbated by a concomitant loss of BMP2 or BMP7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rivera-Feliciano and Tabin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldman et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, BMP4 signaling is required for dorsoventral patterning of the TG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hodge et al., 2007</xref>), and modifying BMP4 expression in the skin leads to changes in the peripheral innervation and survival of sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guha et al., 2004</xref>). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that loss of either BMP4 or Megf8 leads to a similar spectrum of defects in the limb, left-right asymmetry, and heart, and that both BMP4 and Megf8 are required for normal development of the TG. Based on these functional similarities, we hypothesized that Megf8 interacts with, or is a component of, the BMP4 signaling pathway, and that this interaction is required for axon guidance and peripheral target innervation by TG sensory neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title><italic>Bmp4</italic> is expressed in peripheral targets in a manner that defines a permissive field for trigeminal nerve axonal projections</title><p>To address the hypothesis that Megf8 and BMP4 cooperate to regulate growth and guidance of TG axons, we began by assessing the spatial relationship between <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression and developing TG axons. To do so, we utilized a <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup><italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mouse line in which a <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter cassette was inserted into the <italic>Bmp4</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lawson et al., 1999</xref>). Using whole-mount β-galactosidase and neurofilament co-staining, we were able to examine the expression pattern of <italic>Bmp4</italic> relative to developing TG axons. At E10.5, <italic>Bmp4</italic> is expressed strongly in the eye and also in the dorsal portion of the face above the eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These two areas of BMP4 expression flank a narrow corridor through which the developing ophthalmic nerve projects; this expression pattern suggests that BMP4 may act as a repulsive guidance cue for developing TG axons. One day later, at E11.5, the TG axons have extended into their peripheral targets and have bifurcated into frontal and nasociliary nerves. At this stage, <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression is striking; as the ophthalmic branch extends beyond the eye, the nasociliary nerve branches in a region devoid of <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression and then immediately projects nasally as a tightly bundled fascicle through an area of strong <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression while the axons of the frontal branch extend rostrally. Remarkably, the pattern of <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression is disrupted in <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos. In the absence of Megf8, <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression is lost at the point of defasciculation of the ophthalmic branch into the frontal and nasociliary branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) suggesting that axonal innervation of the target region is necessary for proper expression of <italic>Bmp4</italic> and that the absence of this BMP signaling leads to defasciculation of the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic nerve. An alternative explanation is that Megf8 is required in cells of the craniofacial target tissues to regulate <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression.

Like the <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>L1775P/L1775P</italic></sup> embryos, loss of BMP4 function leads to pre-axial polydactyly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunn et al., 1997</xref>), loss of left-right patterning including reversed heart looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fujiwara et al., 2002</xref>), and severe heart defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jiao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). BMP4 signaling has recently been implicated in PNS development, where it is required by neurons in the TG for specifying positional identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hodge et al., 2007</xref>) and in both the TG and DRG for peripheral target innervation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guha et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Given these phenotypic similarities, we hypothesized that Megf8 is a component of the BMP4 signaling pathway and specifically regulates the response of TG neurons to target-derived BMP4. We assessed <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression during E10.5–E11.5, which is the period when TG axons extend into their peripheral target fields and found that <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression appears to define the permissible field for ophthalmic nerve target innervation suggesting that BMP4 may function as a repulsive guidance cue. Consistent with these findings, conditional deletion of the BMP receptor, <italic>Bmpr2</italic>, in sensory neurons using <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Bmpr2</italic><sup><italic>Flox/−</italic></sup> mice results in defasciculation of the ophthalmic nerve and phenocopies the <italic>Megf8</italic> mutant lines. Thus, axons of TG ophthalmic sensory neurons require both <italic>Megf8</italic> and BMP signaling to correctly navigate towards their target field. Remarkably, in each of the <italic>Megf8</italic> and <italic>Bmpr2</italic> loss-of-function lines, the TG maxillary and mandibular branches are largely unaffected despite widespread expression of Megf8 and BMPR2 within the TG ganglion, which demonstrates that Megf8 and BMPR2 function selectively in neurons of the TG ophthalmic branch to mediate axon guidance. We suggest that Megf8 is a mediator or a key component of the BMPR2 signaling pathways that control growth and guidance of ophthalmic nerve axons.</p><p>The expression pattern of <italic>Bmp4</italic> relative to the developing ophthalmic nerve suggests that BMP4 acts as an inhibitory cue to prevent developing TG axons from innervating inappropriate targets. This hypothesized role for BMP4 is supported by our in vitro findings, in which BMP4 treatment of TG explant cultures resulted in robust inhibition of axon outgrowth. This inhibition was partially lost in <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> explants, indicating that TG neurons require <italic>Megf8</italic> expression to mediate their maximal response to the inhibitory effects of BMP4. These findings suggest that Megf8 is necessary for BMP4 signaling in sensory neurons and that this signaling provides an important inhibitory cue to guide developing TG axons. In addition, our finding that <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression is disrupted in <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos at the site of defasciculation of the TG ophthalmic branch suggests a possible non-cell autonomous role for Megf8 in regulating <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression, wherein <italic>BMP4</italic> expression is dependent on signaling from incoming TG axons, which is disrupted by defasciculation in the <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryo. Alternatively, BMP4 may be directly regulated by Megf8 expressed in cells of the craniofacial region. Given that <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression is preserved in all other areas of the <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos as well as our in vitro findings that show Megf8 is required in TG neurons to mediate the inhibitory effects of exogenous BMP4, we think it is unlikely that Megf8 predominantly regulates BMP4 signaling through modifying <italic>BMP4</italic> expression. Future studies will address the Megf8 mechanism of action in developing neurons and, in particular, whether it is a mediator of expression or axonal localization of BMPR2, BMP4 binding to BMPR2, or BMP4–BMPR2 signaling in axons.</p><p>Taken together, our findings support a model in which Megf8 is a mediator of BMP4 signaling in TG axons. <italic>Megf8</italic> is expressed in TG sensory neurons where it acts cell autonomously to promote signaling in response to target-derived BMP4. Megf8-mediated BMP4 signaling, which is inhibitory for TG axons, likely enables these axons to remain fasciculated en route to their appropriate targets in the face. Disruption of this signaling, either through loss of Megf8 or other components of the BMP4 pathway, leads to a corresponding loss of inhibition and premature defasciculation of the nerve. Thus, BMP4 signaling is required for TG axon guidance and Megf8 is a novel component of BMP4 signaling in TG sensory neurons. Given the numerous phenotypic similarities between <italic>Megf8</italic> and <italic>Bmp</italic> loss-of-function mouse lines, including defects in the limb, heart, and left-right patterning, we propose that Megf8 mediates signaling by BMP4 and, perhaps, other TGFβ family members throughout the embryo during development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Whole-mount neurofilament staining</title><p>Isolated embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at 4°C.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marianne Bronner (Reviewing editor); Samantha Butler and Bill Snider (peer reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a straightforward and nicely done study. By screening for peripheral nerve defects after ENU mutagenesis, the authors have identified a mutation in the <italic>Megf8</italic> gene. Mutation of the human homologue (Carpenter syndrome) is associated with dramatic developmental abnormalities. Here, the authors describe the cloning of <italic>Megf8</italic> as well as the careful and thorough characterization of its loss-of-function. Megf8 appears to be a novel receptor with critical roles in axon guidance, the establishment of left-right asymmetry and limb, skeletal, and heart development. Because the mouse and human phenotypes bear similarity to loss of BMP4 signaling, the authors performed a comprehensive analysis of the requirement for Megf8 in development in comparison to the requirement for <italic>Bmp4</italic>.</p><p>As a result of their findings, the authors propose an important mechanistic link between Megf8 and BMP signaling: that Megf8 is required to interpret BMP4 as a repellent. <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression surrounds the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and apparently keeps the nerve fasciculated. In the absence of either Megf8 or BmprII, this branch is severely defasciculated. Moreover, loss of Megf8 results in the loss of <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression flanking the ophthalmic branch, in the region where the most profound defasciculation defects are observed. Taken together, these studies identify a novel putative regulator of BMP signaling and raise important questions about the non-autonomous control of <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression by Megf8.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) This paper provides a mechanistic explanation for the defasciculation defect observed in <italic>Megf8</italic> mutants, but does not explain the foreshortening of many nerves, including their focus in this paper: the ophthalmic branch (Figure4H)? If removing the response to a repellent, wouldn't one predict that the axons might grow longer, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>?</p><p>2) The phenotype observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> is very interesting, suggesting that Megf8 is required to stabilize or maintain <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression. Is this phenotype also fully penetrant (add to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>?)? Could the authors provide some quantification of <italic>Megf8</italic> mutants to more clearly assess the extent to which <italic>Bmp4</italic> activity staining is lost in the region surrounding the ophthalmic nerve compared to controls? Importantly, the authors barely discuss this very striking result in the Discussion! Doesn't it suggest that the loss of Megf8 has a non-autonomous negative effect on <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression? If so, how mechanistically do they think a membrane bound receptor is suppressing <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression?</p><p>3) Is the interaction between <italic>Megf8</italic> and BMP4 the likely mechanistic explanation for the other phenotypes? In which case, why is <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression not lost in other affected organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)?</p><p>4) The authors are careful to assay only the response of the ophthalmic branch of the TG nerve to BMP4 stimulation in vitro. Did they try a similar in vitro assay with the maxillary and mandibular branches? It would be interesting to know whether these branches are impervious to BMP4 in vitro as suggested by the results in vivo.</p><p>5) Similarly, presumably other classes of neurons are affected, as there are also abnormalities of spinal roots although the spinal root abnormalities were not analyzed in detail.</p><p>6) Although the link to BMP signaling is intriguing, the current evidence is rather indirect and based primarily on their one in vitro experiment. A simple way to provide strong evidence for a direct effect on BMP signaling in vivo would be to assess Phospho-Smad staining levels in mutant versus wild type trigeminal ganglia. The authors should attempt this experiment.</p><p>7) In the Discussion, it is critical that the authors add further comment on how they think Megf8 regulates BMP4 signaling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01160.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) This paper provides a mechanistic explanation for the defasciculation defect observed in</italic> Megf8 <italic>mutants, but does not explain the foreshortening of many nerves, including their focus in this paper: the ophthalmic branch (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4H</italic></xref><italic>)?

One possibility is that the foreshortening is secondary to the defasciculation. In other words, individual ophthalmic axons grow to the same length (or longer) in <italic>Megf8</italic> mutants, but because the axons aberrantly extend into surrounding tissues the overall path of the nerve appears shorter. The other possibility is that in addition to its role in mediating BMP4 inhibitory cues, Megf8 also facilitates the growth of ophthalmic axons into the periphery and thus these axons are undergrown in <italic>Megf8</italic> mutants. This second possibility is consistent with the phenotype observed in the spinal nerves, which are undergrown in <italic>Megf8</italic> null embryos when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,D</xref>). In addition, the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve is slightly undergrown in <italic>Megf8</italic> mutants compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> legend). Taken together, these results suggest a role for Megf8 in promoting axon growth of TG and DRG sensory neurons. However, our data do not determine whether this occurs through modification of BMP4 signaling.</p><p><italic>2) The phenotype observed in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref> <italic>is very interesting, suggesting that Megf8 is required to stabilize or maintain Bmp4 expression.

Interestingly, <italic>Bmp4-lacZ</italic> expression is normal in all other parts of the embryo. This can be appreciated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>, which shows the <italic>Bmp4-lacZ</italic> expression pattern throughout <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> embryos and includes images of the whole embryo, DRG, and limb.</p><p>We have provided commentary on the changes in the <italic>Bmp4-lacZ</italic> expression pattern in the <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryo and the implications of these changes in the revised manuscript. Our findings suggest that the loss of BMP4 expression at the site of defasciculation of the TG ophthalmic branch could result from two possible mechanisms. Either BMP4 expression is dependent on signaling from incoming TG axons (which is disrupted by defasciculation in the <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryo) or Megf8 expressed in the craniofacial target region regulates BMP4 expression. This is an interesting point, as we know from our ISH results that <italic>Megf8</italic> is expressed in TG neurons as well as in the developing craniofacial area. Because neural crest cells contribute to this developing craniofacial area, the <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic>; <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup> embryo unfortunately does not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities.</p><p><italic>3) Is the interaction between</italic> Megf8 <italic>and BMP4 the likely mechanistic explanation for the other phenotypes? In which case, why is</italic> Bmp4 <italic>expression not lost in other affected organs (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>?</p><p>Indeed, given the phenotypic similarities between <italic>Megf8</italic> mutant and <italic>BMP4</italic> loss of function lines, we hypothesize that the functional interaction between Megf8 and BMP4 is the mechanistic explanation for the other phenotypes observed in <italic>Megf8</italic> mutants, including polydactyly, disruption of left-right patterning, and heart defects. As we have shown, <italic>BMP4</italic> expression in <italic>Megf8</italic> null embryos is only disrupted around the TG ophthalmic branch; it is intact in all other areas of the embryo including the DRG, heart, and limbs. These findings suggest that Megf8 modifies BMP4 signaling by acting on the BMP4 ligand/receptor complex or downstream components of the signaling pathway, not through modifying expression of <italic>BMP4</italic> itself. Indeed, this is consistent with our in vitro findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), in which we found that in the presence of exogenous BMP4 ligand, <italic>Megf8</italic> null axons respond poorly to BMP4 as an inhibitory cue. If Megf8’s role in BMP4 signaling is primarily to modify <italic>BMP4</italic> expression, one would expect that <italic>Megf8</italic> null axons would still be inhibited by exogenous BMP4 ligand, unlike our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. In fact, we were surprised to find that BMP4 expression is disrupted around the TG ophthalmic nerve. We suggest that this finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) in conjunction with our in vitro analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) indicates that Megf8 modifies BMP4 signaling in TG ophthalmic axons in two ways: 1) Megf8 expressed in the axon is required to mediate the BMP4 inhibitory cue and 2) loss of Meg8 in the axon, loss of Megf8 in the surrounding craniofacial tissue, or loss of normal TG axon extension (secondary to loss of Megf8) disrupts BMP4 expression. This is discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) The authors are careful to assay only the response of the ophthalmic branch of the TG nerve to BMP4 stimulation</italic> in vitro<italic>. Did they try a similar</italic> in vitro <italic>assay with the maxillary and mandibular branches? It would be interesting to know whether these branches are impervious to BMP4</italic> in vitro <italic>as suggested by the results</italic> in vivo.</p><p>Our initial explant experiments included the entire ganglion and we did see robust inhibition of axon outgrowth by BMP4 (as well as loss of this inhibition in the <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> explants). However, we decided to focus on the dorsal half of the TG, which contains the ophthalmic lobe and part of the maxillary lobe, so as to enrich for ophthalmic neurons. Given the large amount of maxillary neurons present (roughly 50% of the explant), our results suggest that BMP4 can inhibit maxillary axon outgrowth, although it is unclear if BMP4 inhibits maxillary neurons to the same extent as ophthalmic neurons. We did not attempt a separate analysis of the maxillary and mandibular branches.</p><p><italic>5) Similarly, presumably other classes of neurons are affected, as there are also abnormalities of spinal roots although the spinal root abnormalities were not analyzed in detail</italic>.</p><p><italic>Megf8</italic> null embryos show undergrowth of DRG spinal nerves as well as defasciculation of the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. In addition, Megf8 is broadly expressed throughout the developing neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which suggests that it may play a role in different neuronal populations in the CNS and PNS. However, we have not yet asked whether BMP signaling is disrupted in other classes of neurons. In future experiments it will be important to assess the role of Megf8 in other axon guidance events controlled by BMP signaling, including the ventral axonal trajectory of neurons whose cell bodies reside within the dorsal spinal cord.</p><p><italic>6) Although the link to BMP signaling is intriguing, the current evidence is rather indirect and based primarily on their one</italic> in vitro <italic>experiment. A simple way to provide strong evidence for a direct effect on BMP signaling</italic> in vivo <italic>would be to assess Phospho-Smad staining levels in mutant versus wild type trigeminal ganglia. The authors should attempt this experiment</italic>.</p><p>Phospho-SMAD immunohistochemistry on wild type and <italic>Megf8</italic> null TG was attempted but, unfortunately, we encountered a widespread pattern of very strong staining in virtually all cell types and tissues in the preparations, and very high background. Thus, we were unable to ascertain whether phospho-SMAD expression is intact or diminished in <italic>Megf8</italic> null embryos (which would imply that Megf8 modifies BMP4 signaling via a non-SMAD dependent mechanism), or if we could not observe a difference that was present because of issues of specificity or because this assay would not allow us to detect subtle changes in phospho-SMAD levels. We are therefore not confident that P-SMAD staining provides a specific and reliable quantitative assay for comparing <italic>Megf8</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> TG to wild type littermates and have not pursued this direction.</p><p><italic>7) In the Discussion, it is critical that the authors add further comment on how they think Megf8 regulates BMP4 signaling</italic>.</p><p>We have included discussion of mechanisms by which Megf8 regulates BMP signaling in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
