Other commonly reported features include constipation and hyperventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bedeschi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goodspeed et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zollino et al., 2019</xref>). While PTHS is a lifelong disorder, there are currently no treatments for PTHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zollino et al., 2019</xref>). PTHS is caused by monoallelic mutation or deletion of <italic>transcription factor 4</italic> (<italic>TCF4</italic>), which is a member of the class I basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amiel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zweier et al., 2007</xref>). PTHS-causing mutations typically impair the function of the bHLH domain, which is responsible for dimerizing with other bHLH proteins and for binding to Ephrussi box DNA elements to regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dennis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sepp et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, targeting genes dysregulated by <italic>TCF4</italic> haploinsufficiency could potentially serve as a therapeutic intervention. However, hundreds to thousands of genes lie downstream of TCF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doostparast Torshizi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forrest et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xia et al., 2018</xref>), making it nearly impossible to find transcriptional modifiers to correct their expression levels. While targeting TCF4-impacted genes presents a fundamental conceptual challenge as a therapeutic approach, directly overcoming the core genetic defect underlying PTHS may offer a more effective treatment strategy.</p><p>In principle, PTHS phenotypes could be prevented or corrected by normalizing <italic>TCF4</italic> expression, with the degree of efficacy likely impacted by the age and specificity of the intervention. Convergent lines of evidence support the idea that the disorder can be treated, at least to a degree, throughout life. For example, studies in animal models of other single-gene neurodevelopmental disorders, including Rett and Angelman syndromes, have shown that normalizing expression of the disease-causing gene in postnatal life could provide therapeutic benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Silva-Santos et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the same might be true for PTHS. While synaptic defects have been observed in mouse models of PTHS, there is no evidence for disease-related neurodegeneration in PTHS individuals or mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rannals et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thaxton et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the observed synaptic defects could be reversible. In support of this idea, subtle upregulation of <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression by knocking down <italic>Hdac2</italic> has been shown to partially rescue learning and memory in adult PTHS model mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kennedy et al., 2016</xref>). Collectively, these observations indicate that PTHS might benefit from genetic normalization approaches to compensate for loss-of-function of TCF4 such as gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), and small molecules.</p><p>A critical question that must be addressed prior to developing genetic normalization approaches for PTHS is whether behavioral phenotypes can be rescued if <italic>TCF4</italic> expression is restored during postnatal development. This question is particularly intriguing given observations that <italic>TCF4/Tcf4</italic> expression in the human/mouse brain peaks perinatally, before subsequently declining to basal levels that are sustained throughout adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Phan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rannals et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we leveraged a mouse model to establish the extent to which conditional reinstatement of <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression could rescue behavioral phenotypes in a mouse model of PTHS. We first validated our approach by demonstrating that embryonic pan-cellular reinstatement of <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression could fully prevent PTHS-associated phenotypes, while embryonic <italic>Tcf4</italic> reinstatement selectively in excitatory or inhibitory neurons led to rescue of only a subset of behavioral phenotypes. We then modeled viral gene therapy to show that postnatal reinstatement of <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression in neurons can fully or partially rescue behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes in a mouse model of PTHS. Our results provide evidence that postnatal genetic normalization strategies offer an effective therapeutic intervention for PTHS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pan-cellular embryonic reinstatement of <italic>Tcf4</italic> fully rescues behavioral phenotypes in a PTHS mouse model</title><p>We generated a conditional <italic>Tcf4</italic> reinstatement mouse model of PTHS (<italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic>) in which a transcriptional STOP cassette and GFP reporter, flanked by loxP sites, were inserted upstream of the basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) DNA binding domain in exon 18 of <italic>Tcf4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To produce embryonic, pan-cellular reinstatement of <italic>Tcf4</italic>, we crossed <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mice to transgenic mice expressing Cre under the Actb promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jägle et al., 2007</xref>). As predicted from our design, the levels of full-length <italic>Tcf4</italic>/TCF4 were reduced by approximately half in <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mouse brain compared to <italic>Tcf4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (wildtype control) mouse brain and fully normalized by crossing <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> to <italic>Actb-Cre<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>Tcf4<sup>+/+</sup></italic>: 1.0 ± 0.09, n = 7; <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic>: 0.61 ± 0.07, n = 7; <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup>::Actb-Cre</italic>: 1.04 ± 0.09, n = 5, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>Tcf4<sup>+/+</sup></italic>: 1.0 ± 0.07, n = 7; <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic>: 0.58 ± 0.05, n = 7; <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup>::Actb-Cre</italic>: 1.07 ± 0.07, n = 5). We stained for the GFP reporter in sagittal brain sections from <italic>Tcf4<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic>, and <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup>::Actb-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). GFP signal, a proxy for presence of the STOP cassette, was detected throughout the <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mouse brain. By contrast, this signal was absent from <italic>Tcf4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup>::Actb-Cre</italic> brain sections, indicating efficient excision of the GFP-STOP cassette and concomitant reinstatement of biallelic <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression in the <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup>::Actb-Cre</italic> model mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To demonstrate the consequences of pan-cellular embryonic <italic>Tcf4</italic> reinstatement in PTHS model mice, we studied a variety of physiological functions and behaviors in control (<italic>Tcf4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tcf4<sup>+/+</sup>::Actb-Cre</italic>), PTHS model (<italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic>), and reinstatement model (<italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup>::Actb-Cre</italic>) mice. Male and female <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mice had reduced body and brain weights, whereas <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup>::Actb-Cre</italic> mice had similar body and brain weights to their littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). Reduced brain weight in <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mice represents a phenotype with high face validity for human microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dupuis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pulvers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that embryonic reinstatement of <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression could prevent microcephaly in PTHS model mice. To study whether long-term memory deficits could be prevented, we examined object location memory by measuring interaction time of identical objects, with one object located in the familiar position and the other in a novel position. <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> interactions with objects located in the familiar and novel positions were of similar duration, suggesting the inability to remember the previously-presented location of the object and suggestive of long-term memory deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup>::Actb-Cre</italic> and control mice both interacted to a significantly greater extent with the object located in the novel position, suggesting recovery of normal long-term memory function subsequent to embryonic, pan-cellular <italic>Tcf4</italic> reinstatement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We then assessed locomotor and exploration activity by the open field test and found that <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mice showed increased activity and total distance travelled compared to <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup>::Actb-Cre</italic> mice, which exhibited control levels of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We also examined nest building, an innate, goal-directed behavior achieved by pulling, carrying, fraying, push digging, sorting, and fluffing of nest material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deacon, 2006</xref>). <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mice exhibited poor performance in the nest building task over the 4-day testing period, using roughly half the nest material used by control mice. This phenotype was completely rescued in the <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup>::Actb-Cre</italic> model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To assess anxiety-like behavior, we evaluated mice in the elevated plus maze task. We observed <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mice to spend similar amounts of time in the closed and open arms, indicating an apparent low-anxiety phenotype. This behavioral feature also appeared to be normalized in <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup>::Actb-Cre</italic> mice, spending proportionally more time in the closed arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Collectively, our results confirm that <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mice exhibit physiological and behavioral phenotypes like those observed in other mouse models of PTHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kennedy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thaxton et al., 2018</xref>), demonstrating the efficacy of the transcriptional STOP cassette in blocking TCF4 function. Moreover, these data show that <italic>Tcf4</italic> reinstatement upon embryonic Cre-mediated excision of the STOP cassette can fully prevent the emergence of physiological and behavioral deficits associated with <italic>Tcf4</italic> haploinsufficiency.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Embryonic, pan-cellular reinstatement of <italic>Tcf4</italic> fully rescues behavioral deficits in a mouse model of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting a conditional Pitt-Hopkins syndrome mouse model in which expression of the bHLH region of <italic>Tcf4</italic> is prevented by the insertion of a loxP-P2A-GFP-STOP-loxP cassette into intron 17 of <italic>Tcf4</italic> (<italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic>).

A previous anatomical study shows that TCF4 is present in excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, single-cell transcriptomic studies in the neonatal and adult mouse brain indicate that <italic>Tcf4</italic> transcript levels are higher in excitatory and inhibitory neurons than most other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Loo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>).

In this proof-of-concept study, genetic reinstatement of <italic>Tcf4</italic> in a subset of neurons during early postnatal development corrected multiple behavioral phenotypes in PTHS model mice, including hyperactivity, reduced anxiety-like behavior, memory deficit, and abnormal innate behavior. Furthermore, early postnatal <italic>Tcf4</italic> reinstatement corrected altered local field potential activity and, at the molecular level, TCF4-regulated gene expression changes. Our results suggest that postnatal genetic therapies to compensate for loss-of-function of TCF4 can offer an effective treatment for PTHS.</p><p>One of the key parameters for genetic normalization strategies is the age at time of intervention. We likely accomplished moderately widespread <italic>Tcf4</italic> normalization throughout the brain by P10-P17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which is roughly equivalent to the first 2 years of human life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Individuals with PTHS have global developmental delay, often presenting itself in the first year of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zollino et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, our study indicates that genetic normalization approaches could provide a viable early life treatment opportunity. Future investigation is needed to address the extent to which juvenile and adult <italic>Tcf4</italic> reinstatement can correct behavioral phenotypes, as this could provide clinical insights into whether later-onset interventions might also provide therapeutic benefits.</p><p>While it is important to define the developmental therapeutic window, eventual ASO- or AAV-mediated genetic therapies will also need to produce an appropriate biodistribution to be efficacious. Previous studies have shown that <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression levels are particularly high in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, our proof-of-concept study employed a strategy to reinstate <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression more prominently in the forebrain than in subcortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Notably, intrathecal delivery of ASOs produces a biodistribution favoring the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mazur et al., 2019</xref>), remarkably similar to the endogenous <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). Given our ability to recover behavioral phenotypes, future efforts to test the feasibility of ASOs or gene therapies should target <italic>Tcf4</italic> reinstatement in the forebrain to provide therapeutic benefit.</p><p>Another important consideration for eventual genetic therapies is which cell types should be targeted to rescue behavioral phenotypes. The therapeutic potential of genetic rescue in specific cell types had not been evaluated due to the lack of conditional models for <italic>Tcf4</italic> reinstatement. Our conditional restoration model provides a powerful tool in that we can establish the cellular and behavioral impacts of cell-type-specific <italic>Tcf4</italic> restoration, which will ultimately inform therapeutic development for PTHS. Because <italic>Tcf4</italic> is expressed at particularly high levels in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jung et al., 2018</xref>) and throughout the postnatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we initially aimed to embryonically reinstate TCF4 function in these broad neuronal classes to establish their relative contribution to behavioral rescue. Reactivating <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression in excitatory pyramidal neurons, dentate gyrus mossy cells, and granule cells within the dorsal telencephalon, starting from ~E11.5, improved memory, anxiety phenotype, and innate behavior, while reactivating <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression in almost all GABAergic neurons throughout the brain at ~E13.5 partially rescued memory and innate behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goebbels et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Notably, the hyperactivity phenotype was not rescued by reinstating <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression from either of the neuronal classes alone, suggesting that hyperactivity phenotype could be dependent on both excitatory and inhibitory neurons having a normal complement of <italic>Tcf4</italic> to function properly. Given that memory, anxiety-like behavior, and innate behavior were fully rescued when <italic>Tcf4</italic> was re-activated only from excitatory neurons, it is reasonable to argue that these phenotypes might mainly depend on having normal TCF4 levels in excitatory neurons. In order to provide a complete understanding of the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in behavioral outputs, the effect of cell-type-specific deletion of <italic>Tcf4</italic> on behavioral phenotypes needs to be further evaluated.</p><p>Due to the established role for TCF4 in regulating the maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Phan et al., 2020</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that normalizing <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression in oligodendrocytes might be important for recovery of behavioral phenotypes. However, when <italic>Tcf4</italic> was reactivated in oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and a subpopulation of astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), hyperactivity and spatial memory deficits were not recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, our findings emphasize that TCF4 loss in neurons contributes to PTHS-associated behavioral phenotypes, and therapeutic strategies should thus target the normalization of <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression in neurons. Accordingly, we demonstrated, at the proof-of-concept level, that mosaic, neuronal reinstatement of normal TCF4 levels can produce phenotypic rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). However, it is possible that greater phenotypic rescue could have been achieved with additional reinstatement of <italic>Tcf4</italic> in oligodendrocytes and perhaps other cell classes. Finally, it is important to recognize that TCF4 protein is found outside of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sepp et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that increasing TCF4 levels in other regions of the body might provide therapeutic benefit, particularly for phenotypes such as constipation that might have a peripheral contribution.</p><p>A <italic>TCF4</italic> normalization treatment strategy has an advantage in that it addresses the core genetic defect in PTHS, and therefore should restore transcriptional targets of TCF4. <italic>Tcf4</italic> haploinsufficiency in mice alters the expression of genes that are involved in synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability, such as <italic>Grin2a</italic> and <italic>Glra3</italic>, and neuronal development, such as <italic>Mal</italic> and <italic>Lpar1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kennedy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Phan et al., 2020</xref>). Our data show that upregulating <italic>Tcf4</italic> levels postnatally can correct the expression of these TCF4-regulated genes in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The effect of <italic>Tcf4</italic> normalization on downstream genes might help guide future preclinical studies. For example, therapeutic agent choice and their dosing could be optimized by testing behavioral recovery and by measuring expression of TCF4-regulated genes, such as those validated in this study.</p><p>Our study has several important limitations. First, we normalized <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression only in neurons. <italic>Tcf4</italic> is expressed in nearly all neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). Ideally, <italic>Tcf4</italic> should be reinstated in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells to accomplish maximum therapeutic outcomes. Our preliminary data indicated that injecting AAV containing a broadly active promoter, CAG, reinstated <italic>Tcf4</italic> in all cell types, but induced abnormal glial activation, which is reminiscent of toxicity previously reported with CAG vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xiong et al., 2019</xref>), and severe weight loss (data not shown). To avoid toxicity in our experimental paradigm while still achieving efficient transduction, we employed the neuron-selective promoter (hSyn) in our viral construct. Nonetheless, our data provide compelling evidence that reinstating <italic>Tcf4</italic> only in neurons is sufficient to reverse behavioral and LFP phenotypes in PTHS model mice. Second, our study does not inform therapeutic threshold that must be achieved by genetic normalization approaches. TCF4 is a dosage-sensitive protein: too little expression causes neurodevelopmental disorders, and too much expression may be linked to schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brennand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brzózka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Forrest et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Quednow et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sepp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wirgenes et al., 2012</xref>). Our conditional model allowed us to establish the best-case treatment scenario by reinstating <italic>Tcf4</italic> to wild-type levels. Future proof-of-concept preclinical studies to upregulate <italic>Tcf4</italic> through ASOs or gene therapy approaches in PTHS model mice must take considerable care to recapitulate optimal levels of <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression. Third, our study does not provide insights into which isoforms are most appropriate to deliver to the brain through AAV-mediated gene therapy. The <italic>TCF4</italic> gene produces at least 18 isoforms, which may have cell type- and developmental-specific expression patterns in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sepp et al., 2011</xref>). Characterizing endogenous isoform expression in the human brain will be critical to guide design of a viral vector that produces appropriate <italic>TCF4</italic> isoform expression.</p><p>To our knowledge, the present study is the first investigation to show that normalizing <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression during early postnatal development can improve behavioral outcomes in a mouse model of PTHS. Furthermore, our studies provide insights into target cell types and biodistribution that must be achieved for therapeutic recovery in mice, which guides the rational design of genetic normalization approaches such as AAV-mediated gene therapy, ASOs, or small molecules. In sum, our findings suggest parameters for which genetic therapies can provide substantial therapeutic benefit for individuals with PTHS.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>, additional measurement of nest material was recorded 72 hr after collecting data for 4 consecutive days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Surgery and in vivo LFP recording</title><p>Mice were anaesthetized by inhalation of 1–1.5% isoflurane (Piramal) in pure O<sub>2</sub> during surgery, with 0.25% bupivacaine injected under the scalp for local analgesia and meloxicam (10 mg/kg) subcutaneously administered. Stainless steel bipolar recording electrodes (P1 Technologies) were implanted in the hippocampus (coordinates from bregma: AP = –1.82 mm; ML = 1.5 mm; and DV = –1.2 mm), and ground electrodes were fastened to a stainless-steel screw positioned on the skull above the cerebellum. Dental cement was applied to secure electrode positions. Mice recovered for at least 7 days prior to LFP recording. A tethered system with a commutator (P1 Technologies) was used for recordings, while mice freely moved in their home cages. LFP recordings were amplified (1000 x) using single-channel amplifiers (Grass Technologies), sampled at a rate of 1000 Hz, and filtered at 0.3 Hz high-pass and 100 Hz low-pass filters. All electrical data were digitized with a CED Micro1401 digital acquisition unit (Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>LFP analysis</title><p>Data acquired in Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd.) were read into Python and further processed with a butter bandpass filter from 1 to 100 Hz to focus on frequencies of our interest. Frequency bands were defined as delta 1–4 Hz, theta 5–8 Hz, beta 13–30 Hz, and gamma 30–50 Hz. Spectral power was analyzed using the Welch’s Method, where the power spectral density is estimated by dividing the data into overlapping segments. Sample size (‘n’) represents the number of mice. For each mouse, we selected the longest continuous period with no movement artifacts for analysis. We averaged processed data obtained across three days. We wrote custom Python scripts to analyze LFP data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) before transcranial perfusion with 25 ml of PBS immediately followed by phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4). Brains were postfixed overnight at 4 °C before 24 hr incubations in PBS with 30% sucrose. Brains were sectioned coronally or sagittally at 40 mm using a freezing sliding microtome (Thermo Scientific). Sections were stored at –20 °C in a cryo-preservative solution (45% PBS, 30% ethylene glycol, and 25% glycerol by volume).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For immunofluorescent staining, sections were rinsed several times with PBS and PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBST). Then sections were blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBST (NGST) for 1 hr at room temperature (RT). Sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in NGST at 4 °C for 24 or 48 hr. After primary antibody incubation, sections were rinsed several times with PBST and then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hr at RT. DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was added during the secondary antibody incubation at a concentration of 700 ng/ml. All primary and secondary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry are listed in the key resource table.</p><p>For chromogenic staining, sections were rinsed with PBS and then incubated with endogenous peroxidases for 5 min in 1.0% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in MeOH, followed by PBS rinsing. Sections were washed with PBST several times. Sections were blocked with 5% NGST for 1 hr. Blocked sections were incubated in rabbit anti-GFP in NGST for 24 hr at 4 °C. After sections were incubated in primary antibodies, they were rinsed several times in PBST and then incubated for 1 hr in a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody in NGST. Sections were rinsed in PBST prior to tertiary amplification for 1 hr with the ABC elite avidin-biotin-peroxidase system. To visualize immune complexes amplified by avidin-biotin-peroxidase, sections were incubated for 3 min at RT in 3’3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogenic substrate (0.02% DAB and 0.01% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in PBST).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>Brains were extracted and frozen in dry ice.

Total RNAs were extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit, and reverse transcribed via qScript cDNA SuperMix. The resulting cDNAs constituted the input, and qPCR was performed in a QuantStudio Real-Time PCR system using SYBR green master mix. The specificity of the amplification products was verified by melting curve analysis. All qPCRs were conducted in technical triplicates, and the results were averaged for each sample, normalized to <italic>Actin</italic> expression, and analyzed using the comparative CT method (∆∆CT). The triplicates are valid only when the standard deviation is smaller than 0.25.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Western blot</title><p>Embryonic day 14.5 brains were sonicated on ice using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, and protease inhibitor cocktail). Tissue homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay. A total of 20 µg of each sample was separated in 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes in ice-cold transfer buffer (25 mM Tris-base, 192 mM glycine, and 20% MeOH). Membranes were blocked in Odyssey Blocking Buffer for 1 hr and then blotted with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then subsequently, with secondary antibodies for 1 hr at RT. Chemiluminescence reaction was performed using Clarity Western ECL Substrate, which was imaged by an Amersham Imager 680 (GE Healthcare).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers were both enthusiastic about the paper, pending modifications.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1: In EPM tests, time spent in center zone should be provided to support the anxiety-like behavior. In open-field tests, time spent in center zone should be also provided.</p><p>2) Figure 4: Neonatal ICV injections of Cre did not restore the defects of brain size, but improved the behavioral abnormalities. Wasn't microcephaly responsible for intellectual disability of PHS patients? These should be clearly explained.</p><p>3) Figure 6F: This mRNA measurement should be validated by measuring protein levels by quantitative immunoblotting experiments.</p><p>4) Consider use of appropriate empty virus control rather than vehicle control for experiments (see below) or document the limitations of the experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 1: Actin-Cre is supposed to be ubiquitously acting beyond brains. Validation of behavioral phenotypes by employing brain-specific Cre driver line(s) should be made to ensure the phenotypes.</p><p>2. Figure 1: In EPM tests, time spent in center zone should be provided to support the anxiety-like behavior. In open-field tests, time spent in center zone should be also provided.</p><p>3. Figure 2: Behavioral experiments using NEX-Cre and GAD2-Cre should be presented.</p><p>4.

The authors first perform an early gene rescue using a reversible flox-STOP-flox, heterozygous knockdown model. Crossing this model with the early onset Actin-cre transgenic mouse line results in 4 genotypes: 1. TCF4f/+::cre-, TCF4+/+::cre-, 3. TCF4f/+::cre+, 4. TCF4+/+::cre+. The TCF4f/+::cre- mice demonstrate behavioral abnormalities that are rescued in TCF4f/+::cre+ mice with TCF4 gene restored to baseline. Appropriate TCF4+/+ controls are included. Using promoters that express in either excitatory glutamatergic neurons or in inhibitory GABAergic neurons, the authors next demonstrate that while either rescue can lead to reversal of some subsets of behavioral differences, neither cell-type specific rescue results in rescue of all behavioral differences.</p><p>To determine if genetic reversal at a later developmental timepoint would be feasible, the authors make use of intracerebroventricular injections of an AAV9 expressing cre under control of a synapsin promoter. Injecting AAV-cre virus into neonatal pups at postnatal day 1, the authors demonstrate partial rescue. Behavioral experiments performed between P60 and P110 demonstrated that the mutant TCF4f/+ mice treated with vehicle demonstrated abnormal behaviors, while the AAV-cre-treated TCF4f/+ mice rescued multiple behaviors. In addition to behavioral differences, the authors recorded local field potentials in the hippocampus; AAV-cre at P1 ICV partially rescued some of these differences in the LFP.</p><p>Unfortunately, the early postnatal viral rescue experiments were not as thoroughly controlled as the earlier actin-cre genetic rescue experiments. Rather than use an AAV vector expressing a fluorescent marker protein (GFP) or a scrambled cre, they used only vehicle as a control. This leaves open the unlikely possibility that their virus injection led to rescue of phenotypes simply due to infection of brain cells with the AAV virus itself rather than the cre-mediated gene recombination.. One would have liked to have seen the appropriate negative controls with postnatal virus injections. Another possibility is that some other effect of cre recombinase expression other than genetic effects on their lox-STOP-lox insertion into TCF4 could be responsible for their observed postnatal rescue; this seems very unlikely given their appropriately controlled rescue with the Actin-cre early genetic strategy that was thoroughly controlled for cre effects.</p><p>Postmortem studies on the brains of the AAV-cre rescued mice demonstrated cre expression in most, but not all cells of the cortex and hippocampus (particularly the dentate gyrus).

Even incomplete TCF4 expression rescue in a subset of neurons appears to be sufficient in a heterozygous mouse genetic model. The authors suggest that TCF4 normalization may benefit from a relatively &quot;wide therapeutic window&quot;. Unfortunately, it is not entirely clear what the authors mean by this. They did not measure the level of TCF4 expression in the individual cells in which cre was expressed. It could be that those cells expressed TCF4 back to WT levels rather than a smaller increase in TCF4 levels.

Wasn't microcephaly responsible for intellectual disability of PHS patients? These should be clearly explained.</p><p>The extent to which microcephaly contributes to intellectual disability in Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) individuals remains unclear. According to a report of commonly observed dysmorphic and neurobehavioral features in PTHS (Goodspeed et al., 2018), 59% of individuals with PTHS have microcephaly, whereas 100% of them exhibit intellectual disability. Thus, there can be a dissociation between microcephaly and behavioral performance in individuals with PTHS. The basis of microcephaly in PTHS is not yet fully understood, although based on prior work we might expect that alterations in myelination, white matter tract integrity, neuronal migration, and/or corticogenesis might contribute to the observed microcephaly (Peters et al., 2011; Phan et al., 2020; Sherman et al., 2012; Wollnik, 2010). Years of work are needed to determine the basis of the observed microcephaly and to establish the extent to which the microcephaly contributes to various PTHS phenotypes.</p><p>Without knowing much about the basis for the observed microcephaly, it is difficult to explain why neuronal <italic>Tcf4</italic> reinstatement failed to restore brain size but could restore behavioral phenotypes. One possibility is that reinstating <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression in oligodendrocytes as well as neurons might be needed to recover microcephaly, although we now show that <italic>Tcf4</italic> reinstatement in oligodendrocytes by itself is not sufficient to improve behavioral phenotypes (Figure 2—figure supplement 3C). A non-mutually exclusive possibility is that microcephaly might only be prevented if there is more widespread reinstatement of <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression across the brain and/or if the reinstatement occurs earlier in life than we tested in the current study. We now discuss these different possibilities in the revision (lines 237-240), and note here that, similar to our study, other preclinical gene therapy studies have shown that behavioral recovery can occur in the absence of significant recovery from microcephaly (Judson et al., 2021).</p><p>3) Figure 6F: This mRNA measurement should be validated by measuring protein levels by quantitative immunoblotting experiments.</p><p>Quantitative PCR mRNA quantification, in situ and immunocytochemical analyses, and behavioral recovery—each demonstrated in the initial submission—provide compelling evidence that PHP.eB/Cre viral delivery reinstates TCF4 expression in a subset of neurons. Nevertheless, we certainly appreciate the Reviewer’s suggestion to validate the TCF4 reinstatement directly at the protein level, and thus attempted to directly trace evidence of this mosaic TCF4 reinstatement via quantitative immunoblotting as requested. However, as we anticipated, this proved to be technically challenging for multiple reasons. First, while TCF4 levels are high and easily detectable during perinatal periods (e.g. Figure 1C), TCF4 levels are dramatically downregulated during early postnatal life (Phan et al., 2020; Rannals et al., 2016). Thus, endogenous TCF4 protein levels can become more difficult to detect in the brain as mice mature [see, for example, (Phan et al., 2020), Extended Data Figure 1D, which compared TCF4 levels in adult wildtype and <italic>Tcf4</italic> heterozygous mice]. Second, the inherent difficulty of detecting TCF4 is compounded by the mosaic nature of the reinstatement that we achieved in our experiments—maximally, a 50% increase in TCF4 protein distributed among a subset of virally transduced cells. Third, there are multiple TCF4 isoforms—18 (or possibly more) in human (Sepp, Kannike, Eesmaa, Urb, and Timmusk, 2011) and at least 6 isoforms of mouse TCF4 [personal communications, Tõnis Timmusk, and see (Nurm et al., 2021)]—making it very difficult to discern the truncated, mutant TCF4 protein bands from functional, non-truncated TCF4 protein bands on the Western blot gel.</p><p>Fortunately, decreasing GFP protein levels serve as a reliable proxy for TCF4 reinstatement. In <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mice, GFP is generated when any isoform of transgenic <italic>Tcf4</italic> is expressed. Due to high-efficiency P2A cleavage, GFP accumulates as a singular protein species within brain cells that can detected with sensitive GFP antibodies. Subsequent to Cre-mediated recombination, the P2A-GFP cassette is excised, and expression of functional TCF4 protein is reinstated. Thus, loss of GFP expression provides a straightforward, albeit indirect readout of TCF4 reinstatement as modeled in our experiments. Accordingly, in <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mice treated with PHP.eB/Cre, we observed a reduction in GFP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) that was commensurate with increases in <italic>Tcf4</italic> mRNA levels (Figure 3G).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Representative Western blot and quantification for GFP and GAPDH loading control protein from P17 mouse brain lysates.</title><p>Quantification represents data from Vehicle- and PHP.eB/Cre-treated Tcf4Stop/+ mice.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72290-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Collectively, our findings lend to an optimistic therapeutic outlook for gene addition strategies in PTHS, in which even mosaic TCF4 reinstatement may provide significant benefits for patients. Other neurodevelopmental disorders, including Rett syndrome, may be similarly amenable to treatment by mosaic gene reinstatement, as evidenced by preclinical studies (Gadalla et al., 2013).</p><p>4) Consider use of appropriate empty virus control rather than vehicle control for experiments (see below) or document the limitations of the experiments.</p><p>To address the possibility that viral infection itself might affect behavioral phenotypes, we injected AAV9/PHP.eB-hSyn-eGFP into <italic>Tcf4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> neonates to assess their behavioral outcomes. We found that abnormal behavioral phenotypes persisted in PTHS model mice treated with PHP.eB/GFP (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), suggesting that restoring <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression upon Cre-mediated excision of the STOP cassette drives behavioral rescue in PTHS model mice. We discuss these new data in lines 242 to 248 of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p></disp-quote><p>1. Figure 1: Actin-Cre is supposed to be ubiquitously acting beyond brains. Validation of behavioral phenotypes by employing brain-specific Cre driver line(s) should be made to ensure the phenotypes.</p><p>We previously showed that CNS-specific heterozygous deletion of <italic>Tcf4</italic> (<italic>Tcf4<sup>flox/+</sup>::Nestin-Cre</italic> mice) produced similar phenotypes as pan-cellular heterozygous deletion of <italic>Tcf4</italic> (<italic>Tcf4<sup>flox/+</sup>::Actin-Cre</italic> mice) in terms of microcephaly, hyperactivity, reduced anxiety, and abnormal spatial learning (Thaxton et al., 2018). Those data suggested that reduction of TCF4 protein in the CNS is sufficient to produce Pitt-Hopkins syndrome-like phenotypes.</p><p>Here, we further demonstrated the importance of brain-specific TCF4 re-expression using two different approaches. First, we crossed conditional <italic>Tcf4</italic> reinstatement model mice with inhibitory neuron-specific (<italic>Gad2-Cre</italic>) and excitatory neuron-specific (<italic>Nex-Cre</italic>) Cre-driver mice, each of which showed selective behavioral recovery (Figure 2). Second, we were able to improve behavioral and physiological phenotypes in <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mice by delivering a viral vector encoding Cre under a neuron-specific promoter (i.e., human synapsin, Figures 4-5), thus providing additional evidence for a CNS role of TCF4.</p><p>Our previous and current findings together support the importance of CNS expression for most, if not all, measured phenotypes. However, we do not rule out a role for loss of TCF4 expression in the manifestation of key PTHS phenotypes beyond the brain, including gastrointestinal complications (Grubisic, Kennedy, Sweatt, and Parpura, 2015), as we now point out in the revised Discussion (lines 381-384).</p><p>2. Figure 1: In EPM tests, time spent in center zone should be provided to support the anxiety-like behavior. In open-field tests, time spent in center zone should be also provided.</p><p>We now provide the requested data and have incorporated them into Figure 1. We show increased % of time spent in the center zone of the open field for <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mice compared to their controls (Figure 1E). This result is consistent with our observation that <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mice spent more time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze (Figure 1G), and overall, that they exhibit a decrease in anxiety-like behavior. We did not have the statistical power to resolve differences between the <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup>::Actin-Cre</italic> mice and either the controls or <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mice in the center zone of the open field (Figure 1E).</p><p>We also examined center time in the elevated plus maze (Figure 1G), but did not observe any group differences.</p><p>3.

However, interpretation of behavior data using GAD2-Cre (covering diverse types of GABAergic neurons) should be carefully made. Further discussion/interpretation should be provided.</p><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s comment. Although TCF4 is expressed in multiple inhibitory interneurons subtypes, including parvalbumin, somatostatin, and VIP-expressing neurons (Kim, Berens, Ochandarena, and Philpot, 2020), we observed partial or no improvement in hyperactivity, memory, anxiety phenotype, and innate behavior when <italic>Tcf4</italic> was re-expressed broadly across those inhibitory neuronal types (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 3B). Given that we observed improvement in memory, anxiety phenotype, and innate behavior from <italic>Tcf4</italic> reinstatement in excitatory neurons (Figure 2), we can speculate that those behavioral phenotypes might be mainly dependent on the proper function of excitatory neurons.</p><p>We now discuss results from <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup>::Gad2-Cre</italic> mice more cautiously in the Discussion (lines 359-369). We acknowledge that Gad2 is expressed broadly across inhibitory cell types, and future studies are needed to understand which inhibitory subclasses contribute to behaviors such as nest building. We also discuss possible experiments that can be performed in the future to better understand the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in behavioral outputs, highlighting the effect of cell type-specific deletion of <italic>Tcf4</italic> on behavioral phenotypes (lines 367-369).</p><p>As TCF4 loss in the oligodendrocytes was shown to contribute to PHS pathophysiology (Phan et al., 2020), it is very puzzling whether effects of Tcf4 loss in neurons are responsible for the PHS pathogenesis.</p><p>We are also intrigued by the role of oligodendrocytes in PTHS pathogenesis and were thus compelled to further explore this relationship in our present study. In new experiments, we reinstated <italic>Tcf4</italic> in oligodendrocytes by crossing <italic>Tcf4<sup>STOP/+</sup></italic> mice with <italic>Olig2-Cre<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, but found that this failed to improve behavioral performance in either the open field or object location memory tasks (Figure 2—figure supplement 3C). These data suggest that reinstatement of <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression in oligodendrocytes is not sufficient to recover behavioral phenotypes in PTHS model mice. However, we cannot rule out that TCF4 reinstatement in oligodendrocytes as well as in neurons might be required for full phenotypic recovery, or that there may be a selective role of TCF4 in oligodendrocytes in other, unmeasured phenotypes. We now briefly discuss these points in the modified Results/Discussion (lines 174-182 and 370-381).</p><p>5. Figure 2B: The conclusions are not convincing because the bar graphs appear to be very similar in cases for using NEX-Cre and GAD2-Cre mice.

As the Reviewer suggested, we added a pre-determined number of additional mice to these behavioral data, which has strengthened our conclusions (Figure 2).</p><p>6.

Figure 5: Why did the authors examine only hippocampal LFPs? As Tcf4 is also expressed in cortex, cortical LFPs should be also measured. In addition, there is a clear decreased trend in β and γ waves. Was anything known about brain wave abnormalities in PHS patients?</p><p>We decided to examine hippocampal local field potentials for several reasons. First, TCF4 is expressed at particularly high levels in the hippocampus (Jung et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2020). Second, hippocampal synaptic plasticity is disrupted in multiple models of PTHS (Kennedy et al., 2016; Thaxton et al., 2018), suggesting this is an important site of neural dysfunction. Third, hippocampus-dependent behavioral deficits are central features of PTHS mouse models (Kennedy et al., 2016; Thaxton et al., 2018). Finally, because our viral delivery approach consistently transduced neurons in the hippocampus (Figure 3E), we recognized it as an important region in which to monitor for both dysfunction and recovery.</p><p>Relatively small-sample studies have described abnormalities in slow wave EEG activity in individuals with PTHS (Amiel et al., 2007; Takano, Lyons, Moyes, Jones, and Schwartz, 2010), and others have noted there is “<italic>no specific EEG pattern….but interestingly the background activity showed diffuse or focal slowing in about half of the patients</italic>” (Matricardi et al., 2022). There is clearly a need for a highly quantitative and appropriately statistically powered study to assess specific EEG deficits and their trajectory across development in PTHS individuals compared to appropriate controls. Likewise, much larger studies than ours, including developmental trajectories, are needed to fully understand EEG abnormalities in PTHS model mice so that these can be more accurately compared to findings in the patient population, but such comparisons seem currently unwarranted or, at least, should be made with caution. The reviewer correctly notes a trend for reduced β and γ EEG rhythms in PTHS model mice, and indeed total EEG power is also reduced. We acknowledge these trends in the revised manuscript, as well as the need for much more extensive EEG analyses in both PTHS model mice and the patient population (lines 267-269).</p><p>8.
