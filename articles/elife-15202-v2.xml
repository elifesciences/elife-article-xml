Channels can gate in sub-millisecond timescales, show complex manifolds of conformational states, and often show state-dependent pharmacology. Mechanistic studies of ion channels typically involve sophisticated voltage-clamp protocols applied through manual or automated electrophysiology. Here, we develop all-optical electrophysiology techniques to study activity-dependent modulation of ion channels, in a format compatible with high-throughput screening. Using optical electrophysiology, we recapitulate many voltage-clamp protocols and apply to Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, a channel implicated in pain. Optical measurements reveal that a sustained depolarization strongly potentiates the inhibitory effect of PF-04856264, a Na<sub>v</sub>1.7-specific blocker. In a pilot screen, we stratify a library of 320 FDA-approved compounds by binding mechanism and kinetics, and find close concordance with patch clamp measurements. Optical electrophysiology provides a favorable tradeoff between throughput and information content for studies of Na<sub>V</sub> channels, and possibly other voltage-gated channels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15202.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15202.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15202.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ion channels are specialized proteins that span the cell membrane. When activated, these channels allow ions to pass through them, which can produce electrical spikes that carry information in nerve cells and regulate the beating of the heart. Researchers interested in understanding how ion channels behave often use a technique called patch clamp electrophysiology to measure the electrical current across the cell membrane. The technique can be used to probe if a specific drug can block an ion channel, but it is not well suited to screening lots of potential drugs because it is slow and expensive.</p><p>A group of ion channels known as voltage-gated sodium channels play an important role in generating the electrical spikes in nerve cells. One subtype called Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 is involved in sensing pain and drugs that block Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 might be useable as painkillers, but only if they are specific to this channel. This is because there are many similar sodium channels that are important in other processes in the body.</p><p>Zhang et al. have now developed a new light-based technique to measure how ion channels behave. The technique uses light to activate the channel and a fluorescent protein to report on the membrane’s voltage. Zhang et al. used the new technique to probe how sodium channels, in particular Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, interact with drugs. Mammalian cells grown in the lab were engineered to produce Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, a light-activated ion channel (called CheRiff), and a fluorescent reporter protein. A flash of blue light delivered to the cells activated CheRiff, which in turn activated Na<sub>V</sub>1.7. At the same time, the fluorescence of the reporter protein was used as a read-out of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7’s activity.</p><p>Zhang et al. showed that they could reproduce many conventional electrophysiology measurements using their new light-based approach. Optical measurements were then used to screen 320 drugs to see whether they could block Na<sub>V</sub>1.7. The results of the screen corresponded closely with measurements made using conventional electrophysiology. These results demonstrate that the new optical technique is both fast and precise enough to be used in drug discovery. Further studies could now ask if this optical technique can also be used to study other ion channels, such as potassium channels and calcium channels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15202.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15202.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>high throughput screening</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Hongkang</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Adam E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1-R01-EB012498</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Adam E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Optogenetic tools enable sophisticated measurements of a voltage-gated sodium channel implicated in pain, as well as high-throughput screening of candidate channel blockers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To gain detailed mechanistic insight into ion channel function and pharmacology, one often studies single channels, heterologously expressed, under voltage-clamp protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yan and Aldrich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis and Raman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosmans et al., 2008</xref>). Carefully designed sequences of voltage steps prepare channels in select conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cordero-Morales et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Distinct sub-states often have widely divergent affinities and kinetics of interaction with drugs. Knowledge of this state-dependent behavior is critical in developing models of channel function and in predicting how drugs will function in vivo. State-dependent dynamical measurements are typically the domain of manual or automated patch clamp. Functionally equivalent optical assays would open the prospect of high throughput screens with sophisticated state-dependent selection criteria; and might enable measurements in cell types or environments (e.g. in a tissue or whole animal) that are challenging to access with conventional methods.</p><p>Tools for optical electrophysiology—simultaneous optical perturbation and optical readout of membrane potential—have been making inroads into neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emiliani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">St-Pierre et al., 2014</xref>), with a primary emphasis on spatially resolved measurements in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Packer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rickgauer et al., 2014</xref>) or in complex cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hochbaum et al., 2014</xref>). Voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) have been applied in a wide range of physiological assays in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pa</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">rsons</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">et</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">a</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">l.,</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">1991</xref>) and in vivo, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen and Salzberg, 1978</xref>) but existing red-shifted VSDs are still excited by the wavelengths used to stimulate optogenetic actuators, leading to optical crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsuda et al., 2013</xref>), or are not commercially available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). A combination of a blue-shifted channelrhodopsin (CheRiff) and a red-shifted voltage indicator protein (QuasAr2) recently achieved spectrally orthogonal optical stimulation and readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hochbaum et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Optical electrophysiology measurements are typically semi-quantitative, at best, while ion channel assays require accurate perturbations to voltage and measurements of current. The optical techniques face several challenges: expression levels of optogenetic actuators and reporters vary from cell to cell; channelrhodopsins function as a conductance, not a voltage clamp; and fluorescence can only be used to measure membrane voltage, not current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen and Salzberg, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 1974</xref>). Thus it is not obvious whether one can apply optical electrophysiology as a functional surrogate for standard voltage-clamp protocols.</p><p>Here we address this challenge by developing optical assays of the state-dependent electrophysiology and pharmacology of voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>V</sub>) channels. We begin with electrophysiologically inert HEK cells. We then stably express four transgenic constructs: an inward rectifier potassium channel and a voltage-gated sodium channel imbue the HEK cells with the ability to produce regenerative electrical spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kirkton and Bursac, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2013</xref>). A channelrhodopsin variant, CheRiff, triggers these spikes upon exposure to flashes of blue light. An Archaerhodopsin variant, QuasAr2, enables fluorescent readout of membrane voltage via red excitation and near-infrared fluorescence. The QuasAr2 reporter has a ~1 ms response time and a linear response between −100 to +100 mV, providing a direct correlation of fluorescence and voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hochbaum et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Brief flashes of blue light trigger sodium channel-mediated action potentials, which manifest as flashes of near infrared fluorescence. Steady state illumination with blue light induces steady state changes in voltage, and thereby changes in the distribution of Na<sub>V</sub> channels among substates. We develop stimulus and data analysis protocols that are robust to sources of cellular variation, and we compare our results to measurements by manual patch clamp. While whole-cell voltage clamp remains the gold standard for absolute accuracy, optical electrophysiology provides a favorable tradeoff between accuracy and throughput.</p><p>Na<sub>V</sub> channels mediate the rising phase of the action potential and play significant physiological functions in excitable tissues. There are nine subtypes of Na<sub>V</sub> channels in the human genome. Na<sub>V</sub> channel dysfunction has been implicated in many human diseases. For example, loss-of-function mutations in Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 can cause Dravet syndrome and in Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 can cause Brugada syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Catterall, 2012</xref>). The Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 sodium channel plays an important role in mediating pain sensation. Homozygous loss of function leads to congenital insensitivity to pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox et al., 2006</xref>), gain of function mutations lead to spontaneous severe pain, called erythermalgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2004</xref>), and nucleotide polymorphisms modify sensitivity to pain in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reimann et al., 2010</xref>). While recent results have suggested that the connection of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 to pain may involve other signaling pathways as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Minett et al., 2015</xref>), there remains strong interest in finding selective blockers of this channel. Recent structural work has mapped an isoform-specific binding site for Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-specific blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahuja et al., 2015</xref>), opening the possibility to develop new blockers via structure-guided design. Here we apply the Optopatch spiking HEK cell platform to study Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, and we demonstrate its applicability to Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 also.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction and characterization of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 Optopatch Spiking (Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-OS) HEK cells</title><p>We engineered a monoclonal HEK293 cell line stably expressing human Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 and the Optopatch constructs (see Materials and methods). Both QuasAr2-mOrange2 and CheRiff-eGFP showed good membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We used manual whole-cell patch clamp measurements to characterize the performance of each component. Under whole-cell voltage clamp (V<sub>m</sub> = −60 mV) CheRiff was activated by 488 nm light with an EPD50 (effective power density for 50% activation) of 20 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and a saturating steady-state photocurrent density of 13.0 ± 1.2 pA/pF (mean ± s.e.m., <italic>n</italic> = 5 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A,B</xref>).

We thus used manual patch clamp measurements to determine the relation between voltage spike height measured in current clamp, and peak Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 current density measured in voltage clamp. We used the state-dependent binding of amitriptyline to induce varying degrees of channel block, and then either applied a current pulse and measured the voltage response, or a voltage step and measured the current response (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref> shows that the voltage spike amplitude was smoothly and monotonically related to the Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 current density.

The baseline QuasAr2 fluorescence dropped by 12% in this interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>) and the spike amplitude dropped from 3.5 ± 0.04% ΔF/F to 2.3 ± 0.06% ΔF/F (mean ± SD, <italic>n</italic> = 6 spikes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>).

Voltage clamp protocols have been developed to prepare specific states to probe these mechanisms. Most voltage-clamp protocols comprise a prepulse, an optional recovery interval, and a test pulse. The voltage during each interval can be selected to populate different states. We sought to recreate these protocols by programming the duration and intensity of the blue light pulses.</p><p>First we varied the duration of the 488 nm optical prepulse from 20 ms to 500 ms, to probe state-dependent binding. The intensity was 50 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, which correspond to a depolarization to ~-30 mV. The cells were then given 200 ms recovery with no optical stimulus. The recovery interval was selected to allow drug-unbound channels to reprime. The test pulse (30 ms, 50 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) probed residual excitability. We used the amplitude of the fluorescence spike during the test pulse as a proxy for the degree of remaining Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 current. Simultaneous fluorescence and manual patch clamp measurements showed close correspondence of the optical and electrical signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). After adjusting the fluorescence data for scale and offset relative to the voltage recording (as in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kralj et al., 2012</xref>), the residual variations in fluorescence had an amplitude equivalent to 2.8 mV in a 200 Hz bandwidth.</p><p>We then applied the measurements using optical stimulation and recording alone, without patch clamp. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, showed strong state-dependent binding with degree of channel block dependent on prepulse duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The IC50 values of amitriptyline varied from 11.7 ± 1.6 μM at 20 ms prepulse to 1.6 ± 0.1 μM at 500 ms prepulse (standard error of fit to Hill equation, <italic>n</italic> = 3–5 wells per data-point, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This state-dependent block is consistent with previous patch clamp results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, TTX showed very modest state dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The optically recorded IC50 values of TTX were 126 ± 13 nM at 20 ms prepulse and 62 ± 5.8 nM at 500 ms prepulse (standard error of fit to Hill equation, <italic>n</italic> = 4–6 wells per data-point, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), consistent with prior findings that TTX has a slightly increased affinity for the inactivated channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patton and Goldin, 1991</xref>).Some sodium channel blockers can slow channel repriming after inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bean et al., 1983</xref>). We examined this effect by varying the recovery period. Cells were exposed to a prepulse with fixed duration of 500 ms, a variable recovery period from 40 ms to 5120 ms, and a test pulse of 30 ms. Cells treated with DMSO vehicle showed nearly complete recovery within 40 ms. Carbamazepine, a commonly used drug for the treatment of seizure and neurological pain, blocked recovery at 40 ms, but not at 80 ms. Amitriptyline had an even more dramatic effect, slowing the half-recovery time to 280 ± 36 ms, when tested at 3 μM (mean ± s.e.m., <italic>n</italic> = 9 wells per data-point). This result implies that amitriptyline has slow dissociation from the channel at resting membrane potential of -97 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).</p><p>Traditional voltage clamp protocols are flexible and precise in both time and voltage, while optical control of voltage is only semi-quantitative. Nonetheless, we explored stimulus intensity-dependent protocols, using the relation between steady state depolarization and illumination intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) as a guide. We developed a protocol to probe separately voltage dependent activation and fast inactivation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7. Cells were exposed to a prepulse of 1 s duration with variable intensity from 1.7 to 14 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to depolarizations of 84 to −47 mV. The blue light intensity was then stepwise increased to 14 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, with no intervening recovery period. We quantified the amplitude of the fluorescence spike at the onset of the prepulse and the test pulse. The former probed channel activation, and the latter probed fast inactivation.</p><p>In conventional voltage clamp measurements, the region of overlap between activation and inactivation is called the 'window current' and is important in governing cellular excitability. Mutations that increase the window current have been associated with pain disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fertleman et al., 2006</xref>) and cardiac arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wehrens et al., 2003</xref>).

Consistent with observations from traditional electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fertleman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>), carbamazepine reduced the overlap between activation and inactivation by leftward shifting the fast inactivation curve without altering the activation curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>).

We identified compounds for which <italic>σ</italic> was greater than 5 standard deviations from the average of negative controls. The hit rate was 12.2% by this measure, consistent with the notion that voltage gated sodium channels are promiscuous binders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The 'hit' compounds showed diversity in their spike patterns. For amitriptyline, doxepin, and trifluoperazine, spike amplitude decayed monotonically throughout the pulse sequence. For other compounds, e.g. isradipine and iloperidone, spike amplitude alternated between even and odd stimuli, a pattern we called 'alternans' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We hypothesized that the alternans compounds had a more transient inhibitory effect on channel repriming, compared to the amitriptyline-like compounds.</p><p>To test this hypothesis and to relate the parameters measured by the screen to more conventional electrophysiological parameters, we performed voltage clamp recordings in the presence of several hits from the screen. A 200 ms prepulse and a 100 ms test pulse were separated by a recovery interval varying from 1 ms to 256 ms. We measured the ratio of the peak inward sodium currents at the test and pre-pulse. Control cells showed half-maximal recovery in 4.5 ms. Cells treated with isradipine or iloperidone (alternans compounds), showed half-maximal recovery in 20 ms. Cells treated with amitriptyline or trifluoperazine (strong blockers) showed less than 50% recovery in 256 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Thus compounds that clustered nearby in the optically measured (<italic>σ, Γ</italic>) graph, also showed similar effects by conventional patch clamp measurements.</p><p>For a compound to be a safe analgesic, it should not interact significantly with other Na<sub>V</sub> channels, particularly the cardiac Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 channel. We created a Na<sub>V</sub>1.5-OS HEK cell line analogous to the Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-OS HEK cell line described above, and re-tested some hits from the screen against Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unsurprisingly, on a (<italic>σ, Γ</italic>) plot, all hits arranged in a similar pattern for Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, indicating no subtype selectivity (Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-selective compounds are exceedingly rare). In contrast, both PF-04856264 (1 μM) and TTX (1 μM) clustered with the negative controls when tested on Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, consistent with the known fact that neither of these compounds blocks Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 at the concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCormack et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>Kir2.1 is not considered as a promiscuous drug binder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowes et al., 2012</xref>) and we are not aware of any compounds that block the conductance of channelrhodopsin or interfere with the voltage-dependent fluorescence of QuasAr2. Nonetheless, it is a formal possibility that false-positive readings could arise from compounds that modulate these other components. We developed a simple optical test for off-target effects and applied it to a panel of seven compounds selected for diverse mechanisms of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 block. First, we added TTX (1 μM) to block Na<sub>V</sub>1.7. We then applied steps of blue light (500 ms, 3.2 – 56 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) and monitored the QuasAr2 fluorescence, which reported optically induced depolarizations without regenerative spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We then performed the same measurement in the presence of TTX + test compound. Any drug interaction with Kir2.1, CheRiff, or QuasAr2 would alter the fluorescence response. Six of the seven tested compounds had minimal effect (within 7% of TTX, <italic>n</italic> = 9–10 wells per compound). Carbamazepine induced a slight decrease in fluorescence signal (20% smaller than TTX alone, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>We further verified the optical tests using manual patch clamp measurements. None of the eight tested compounds (seven drugs and TTX) affected CheRiff photocurrents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Seven of the compounds had no effect on QuasAr2 fluorescence or voltage sensitivity relative to buffer control. Carbamazepine reduced QuasAr2 voltage sensitivity by 17%, consistent with the all-optical assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>). This off-target effect of carbamazepine had no effect on our optical assays of activity-dependent block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), because fluorescence spike heights were normalized to the height of the highest spike. A slight decrease in overall fluorescence signal is cancelled in this analysis.</p><p>Finally, we explored whether the OS-HEK cells could be used to screen for modulators of other channel classes. K<sub>V</sub>4.3 is an A-type fast-activating voltage-gated potassium channel, active in the heart and central nervous system. Conventional ionic flux based optical approaches to screening for modulators of K<sub>V</sub>4.3 are extremely challenging because the channel is inactivated at the resting potential of HEK cells. We stably expressed K<sub>V</sub>4.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Optopatch constructs in HEK cells. Voltage-clamp experiments revealed robust expression of K<sub>V</sub>4.3, with a maximum current density of 218 pA/pF at +40 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). K<sub>V</sub>4.3 has very fast activation kinetics with a time constant τ<sub>act</sub> = 0.69 ms at +40 mV. The inactivation of K<sub>V</sub>4.3 can be best described as a double exponential decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2009</xref>), with τ<sub>fast</sub> = 51 ms and τ<sub>slow</sub> = 352 ms at +40 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We then transiently expressed K<sub>ir</sub>2.1 to prime Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and K<sub>V</sub>4.3 and called these cells Na<sub>V</sub>1.5-K<sub>V</sub>4.3-OS cells.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15202.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Optopatch assay of K<sub>V</sub>4.3 function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Voltage clamp recording of K<sub>V</sub>4.3 current in Na<sub>V</sub>1.5-K<sub>V</sub>4.3 Optopatch HEK cells.

We then tested the effect of heteropoda toxin 2 (HpTx2), a potent and specific blocker of channels in the K<sub>V</sub>4 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zarayskiy et al., 2005</xref>). HpTx2 increased the action potential amplitude, consistent with its inhibition on the fast inactivated K<sub>V</sub>4.3 peak current; HpTx2 also increased the plateau potential amplitude when compared at the end of the 100 ms light pulse, which can be explained by its inhibitory effect on the slow inactivated K<sub>V</sub>4.3 current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). HpTx2 showed dose-dependent blockade, with an IC50 of 252 nM, consistent with literature results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brahmajothi et al., 1999</xref>). However, the high rate at which test compounds blocked the Na<sub>V</sub> channel precluded use of these cells in high-throughput screening applications. Screening would require use of a Na<sub>V</sub> channel or a Na<sub>V</sub> channel mutant which is resistant to most drugs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite variable expression levels of optogenetic actuator and voltage indicator, we have shown that Optopatch assays can probe state-dependent pharmacology of Na<sub>V</sub> channel modulators, and can accurately report binding affinities and kinetics. Key to achieving this accuracy were (1) performing measurements averaged over large numbers of cells, and (2) developing stimulus and analysis protocols that were insensitive to modest variations in expression levels of the optogenetic components.</p><p>Optical flux-based assays have been widely used in ion channel screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). However, these assays typically only probe steady-state channel behavior. Flux-based assays are widely used, however, because they offer high throughput and high reproducibility. Recent advances in automated electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunlop et al., 2008</xref>) enable control of membrane voltage in heterologous expression systems. Automated electrophysiology offers the advantage of direct control of voltage and measurement of current. However these techniques have lower throughput and higher cost than optical assays, only work on certain cell types, and can be challenging to optimize. Patch clamp measurements also involve a perturbation to the integrity of the cell membrane, which can lead to changes in cytoplasmic composition and artifacts from mechanosensitive channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morton and Main, 2013</xref>). The Optopatch assays developed here provide detailed and quantitative mechanistic information; are compatible with high-throughput screening; and are non-invasive.</p><p>What are the limitations on throughput of optical electrophysiology screens? Here we performed serial measurements, one well at a time. At a measurement time of ~3 s/well, a 384-well plate was scanned in ~20 min. There are no fundamental principles that prevent scaling to more densely packed wells (e.g. 1534 well plates), or to parallelizing the measurements. While optopatch measurements require high intensity red illumination, high SNR can be obtained at lower intensities than the 400 W/cm<sup>2</sup> we used here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Specialized instrumentation has been developed for sensitive fluorescence recording from multi-well plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hempel et al., 2011</xref>), and with such instrumentation one could achieve throughputs compatible with primary screening. Given greater parallelism of measurement, one could also implement more complex stimulus protocols such as we developed here, while maintaining adequate throughput.</p><p>Illumination intensities for imaging Arch-based GEVIs are typically 10 to 100-fold greater than are used for imaging GFP-based GEVIs. Thus it is natural to worry about phototoxicity from the red laser. A recent study explored phototoxicity in cultured mammalian U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wäldchen et al., 2015</xref>). Illumination at 200 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, λ = 488 nm for 240 s led to 100% of the cells being either dead or 'frozen'; while illumination at 5900 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, λ = 640 nm for 240 s led to undetectable cell death. Our observation of good cell viability at 400 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, λ = 640 nm is consistent with these literature results.</p><p>In principle, the screening approaches described here could be adapted to work with a red-shifted voltage-sensitive dye. Fluorescence signals would be more homogeneous than with a genetically expressed indicator; one could more readily switch between cell lines; and there is a possibility that the imaging could be performed at lower illumination intensity, on conventional equipment. However, existing red-shifted dyes, e.g. PGH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Salama et al., 2005</xref>) and Di-2-ANBDQPQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>) still retain considerable excitation at the blue wavelengths used for channelrhodopsin activation, and these dyes are not at present commercially available.</p><p>Finally, we consider the diversity of channels for which Optopatch-style screens may be feasible. Here we demonstrated assays for Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, and K<sub>V</sub>4.3. We previously demonstrated spiking HEK cells expressing Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2013</xref>) and Hsu <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated spiking CHO cells expressing Na<sub>V</sub>1.2. HEK cell lines expressing Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 through Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 are commercially available, and a method for heterologous expression of chimeric Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 was recently demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goral et al., 2015</xref>). Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels can also mediate regenerative spiking and thus are also plausible targets for the assay. Fast and repetitive optogenetic activation of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 by channelrhodopsin2 has been achieved in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prigge et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, the state dependent inhibition of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 has been studied by channelrhodopsin stimulation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agus et al., 2015</xref>). In principle, optogenetic activation could be applicable to other types of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels. Delayed rectifier potassium channels such as hERG and K<sub>V</sub>7 may also be amenable to optical interrogation if co-expressed with an inactivation deficient Na<sub>V</sub> channel. Modulation of the potassium current would manifest as a change in the action potential duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujii et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genetic engineering of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5-OS, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5-K<sub>V</sub>4.3-OS and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-OS cells</title><p>The pIRESpuro3-Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and pcDNA3-K<sub>V</sub>4.3 plasmids were obtained from ChemCORE at Johns Hopkins University.

The pH was adjusted to 7.3 with NaOH and the osmolality was adjusted to 305–310 mOsm with sucrose. Filamented glass micropipettes (WPI) were pulled to a resistance of 4–7 MΩ and filled with internal solution containing 140 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 3 mM Mg-ATP, pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH. To record CheRiff and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 current, Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-Optopatch HEK cells were replated onto 0.02 mg/mL poly-d-lysine coated glass-bottom dishes (In Vitro Scientific) at a density of ~10,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. The patch clamp recording was performed 4–8 hr after re-plating when most cells had firmly attached to the glass and were still dispersed as single cells. The whole cell voltage clamp recordings were acquired using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered at 5 kHz with the internal Bessel filter and digitized with a National Instruments PCIE-6323 acquisition board at 10 kHz. The series resistance and membrane capacitance were compensated, and whole cell membrane capacitance was obtained by direct reading from the amplifier. CheRiff mediated current was triggered by Illumination from a blue laser (488 nm, 50 mW, Omicron PhoxX) that was sent through an acousto-optic modulator (AOM; Gooch and Housego 48058–2.5-.55-5W) for rapid control over its intensity. The Kir2.1 current was recorded from Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-OS HEK cells by using the same configuration with 1 μM of TTX in the bath solution to block Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 current. The K<sub>V</sub>4.3 current was recorded from Na<sub>V</sub>1.5-Optopatch-K<sub>V</sub>4.3 cells with 30 μM of TTX in the bath solution to block Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 current.</p><p>To correlate Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 current density with voltage spike amplitude we performed alternate single-cell current clamp and voltage-clamp measurements in the presence of 3 μM amitriptyline. We used cells not expressing K<sub>ir</sub>2.1 to avoid confound from K<sub>ir</sub> currents. Paired current- and voltage-clamp protocols were always performed on the same cell. For both protocols, an extended prepulse depolarization induced amitriptyline binding and complete channel block. A recovery interval at −100 mV of variable duration led to partial channel recovery. A test depolarizing pulse of either current or voltage then probed the response of the recovered channels.</p><p>In the current clamp protocol, holding current, <italic>i<sub>h</sub></italic>, was adjusted between −100 to −50 pA to attain a steady-state voltage of approximately −100 mV. The cell was then stimulated with a depolarizing current pulse of magnitude −0.5 <italic>i<sub>h </sub></italic>for 500 ms. This current brought the steady-state voltage to ~0 mV. The current was then brought back to <italic>i<sub>h</sub></italic> for a recovery period of variable duration from 40–5120 ms. Finally, the cell was stimulated with a test current pulse of magnitude -0.5 <italic>i<sub>h </sub></italic>for 20 ms to induce a voltage spike whose amplitude we recorded. Then the cell was switched to voltage-clamp mode. The holding potential was −100 mV. To match precisely the degree of channel block in the current-clamp and voltage-clamp protocols, the voltage prepulse and recovery waveforms were copied directly from the voltage recorded during the immediately preceding current-clamp protocol. The test pulse comprised a 20 ms step depolarization to −20 mV. The inward Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 current at each test pulse was then measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Simultaneous electrophysiology and Optopatch recording in HEK cells</title><p>The Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-Optopatch monoclonal cell line was transfected with pIREShyg-Kir2.1 plasmid using lipofectamine 2000 following standard protocols. The resulting Nav1.7-OS HEK cells were recorded 48 hr after transfection. The day before recording, cells were replated onto 35 mm glass-bottom dishes (In Vitro Scientific) at a density of ~10,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. At the time when recording was performed, the cells formed small clusters comprising 3–4 cells. The whole cell current clamp recording was performed on these small clusters under the I-Clamp Normal configuration of the Axopatch 200B amplifier. The liquid junction potential was measured and corrected by the standard Neher method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neher, 1992</xref>).</p><p>Patch clamp and fluorescence imaging data were synchronized by clocking the camera with analog output from National Instruments PCIE-6323 acquisition board while using the same clock for driving patch clamp inputs and outputs. The imaging experiments were conducted on a home-built inverted fluorescence microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hochbaum et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, QuasAr2 was excited by combined illumination from two red lasers (640 nm, 140 mW, Coherent Obis 637–140 LX and 640 nm, 100 mW, Coherent CUBE 640-100C) via a polarizing beam splitter. The red beam was expanded and focused onto the back focal plane of a 60× oil-immersion objective (60x APO, NA 1.49, Olympus). CheRiff was activated by Illumination from a blue laser (488 nm, 50 mW, Omicron PhoxX), which was modulated by an acousto-optic modulator receiving control signals from a National Instruments PCIE-6323 acquisition board. During a typical Optopatch experiment, both blue and red lasers were reflected into the sample plane by a quad-band dichroic mirror (Di01-R405/488/561/635-25x36, Semrock). The red laser intensity was maintained at 400 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, while the blue laser intensity was modulated via the AOM and ranged from 1–100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. A 710/100-nm bandpass filter (Chroma, HHQ710/100) was used for QuasAr2 imaging, and a variable-zoom camera lens (Sigma 18–200 mm f/3.5–6.3 II DC) was used to image the sample onto an EMCCD camera (Andor iXon Ultra 897), with 512× 512pixels. The variable zoom enabled imaging at a range of magnifications while maintaining the high light-collection efficiency of the oil-immersion objectives. Data were acquired with a ROI of 128 × 128 pixels at 4 × 4–pixel binning to achieve a frame rate of 200 frames/s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optopatch measurements on pharmacology of Nav1.7-OS HEK cells</title><p>The Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-Optopatch monoclonal cell line was transfected with pIREShyg-Kir2.1 plasmid using lipofectamine 2000.

At 24 hr after transfection, cells were replated onto the multiwell plate at a density of ~20,000 cells/well in 50 μL of culture medium. The imaging experiments were performed at 48 hr after transfection when the cells formed a confluent monolayer. The cells were washed with Tyrode’s solution once and then each well is filled with 30 μL of Tyrode’s solution. For drug additions, 6 μL drug solution at 6x target concentration was added to each well. Cells incubated in drug for 20 min at room temperature before imaging.</p><p>Experiments were conducted on an inverted epi-fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX-71) equipped with an automated scanning stage (Ludl electronics MAC 6000). Briefly, illumination from a red laser (635 nm, 500 mW, Dragon Lasers MRL-635-500 mW) was expanded and focused onto the back focal plane of a 20× air objective (NA 0.75, Olympus -UPlanSApo 20x/0.75). Illumination from a blue laser (473 nm, 50 mW, Dragon Lasers MBL-473-50mW) was sent through an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF; Gooch and Housego 48058) for rapid intensity modulation. The red illumination intensity at the sample was 400 W/cm<sup>2</sup>. QuasAr2 fluorescence was filtered by a 710/100-nm bandpass filter (Chroma, HHQ710/100) and collected by an EMCCD camera (Andor iXon Ultra 897). Data were acquired with a full camera chip of 512 × 512 pixels at 16 × 16–pixel binning to achieve a frame rate of 100 frames/s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>High throughput screening on Nav1.7-OS HEK cells by Optopatch measurements</title><p>Cells were plated in a 384 well plate as above. After the cells formed a confluent monolayer (48 hr after transfection) the cells were washed with Tyrode’s solution once and then each well was filled with 20 μL of Tyrode’s solution. A compound library consisting of 320 FDA-approved drugs was purchased from Broad Institute at 10 mM stock concentration in DMSO and then diluted to 30 μM in Tyrode’s solution. 10 μL of the diluted compounds were added to the cell plate (Well A3-P22) to achieve a final concentration of 10 μM. Wells A2-H2 and A23-H23 were treated with 0.1% DMSO vehicle and used as negative controls. Wells I2-P2 and I23-P23 were treated with 10 μM amitriptyline and used as positive controls.

For data acquired at high magnification (60×), a rectangular ROI surrounding the cells of interest was manually selected. Background fluorescence was determined by measuring the mean intensity of a nearby cell free region and was subtracted from the cell fluorescence. For data acquired from cell monolayers under low magnification (20×), a rectangular ROI (400 × 208 pixels) covering the region with most intense laser illumination was selected. This ROI corresponds to a 320 μm × 166 μm area on the sample plane, containing approximately 150 cells. The mean intensity within this ROI was calculated for all frames of the tiff stack. To calculate ΔF/F0, background fluorescence was determined by measuring the intensity from a well plated with parental HEK cells without QuasAr2 expression. After background subtraction, the data were further analyzed to extract spike parameters. Briefly, intensity traces were corrected for photobleaching by dividing the raw intensity by a median filtered copy of the intensity. Spike amplitude was defined as the difference between the maximum point of an action potential and the baseline. The use dependence index was defined as the fractional reduction of the spike amplitude averaged from the second to the eighth stimulus, compared to the initial stimulus.</p><p>Dose-response curves were fitted with the Hill equation y=START+(END-START)/[1+(IC50/S)<sup>n</sup>], where START and END are the values of the parameter at minimum and maximum drug concentration, IC50 is the drug concentration at 50% maximum effect, S is the drug concentration, and n is a measure of cooperativity.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Optical electrophysiology for probing ion channel function and pharmacology&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. One of the two reviewers has agreed to reveal his identity: Brian Salzberg.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes the development of an all-optical electrophysiology technique for studying activity-dependent modulation of ion channels (in this case, Na<sub>V</sub>1.7), in a format compatible with high throughput screening. The authors employ expressed CheRiff as an optical activator, and QuasAr2 as an optical voltage reporter, in genetically engineered HEK cells. Their work demonstrates that optical electrophysiology provides, as they put it, &quot;a favorable tradeoff between accuracy and throughput.&quot;</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers were favorable about the idea and many elements of the approach, they shared some concerns about the manuscript, which fall in to two categories: first, scientifically, no major new discoveries are clearly evident and second, technologically, some issues that are inadequately addressed. With respect to the first category, if the focus is indeed on the tool aspect, it might be possible to consider the manuscript for the Tools and Resources section of <italic>eLife</italic>, where the technique is more relevant than the discovery. But, in that case, the points in the second category become all the more important. The essential points to address therefore become the following:</p><p>The very high intensity light necessary to activate the optogenetic reporter and consequent questions of tissue damage and value over existing methods, expanded upon by the reviewers in point 1a and 1b below; 2) The apparent dependence of the technique on the regenerative capacities of V-gated Na channels, which might limit its general applicability, expanded upon by the reviewers in point 2 below, and 3) The issue of interference with other pharmacological agents, expanded upon by the reviewers in point 3 below.</p><p>1) The major criticism is over the use of QuasAr2 as the optical reporter. The light intensity used to excite QuasAr2 is about two orders of magnitude higher than (already high) intensities used normally for optogenetics. One wonders whether fluorescence excitation at an intensity of 400 W/cm2 is truly useful, or, for that matter, necessary. This illumination intensity is provided by not one, but two lasers, exciting the cells in parallel, because the quantum yield of the fluorescent protein is relatively low.</p><p>A) The bleaching and phototoxicity produced by such high illumination should be quantified. The authors should also provide some data on the heating effects of illuminating the preparation for extended times with 400 W/cm2 in the near infrared.</p><p>B) Also, why can't an organic voltage sensitive dye, applied in the bath, and requiring orders of magnitude lower illumination intensity be used as the optical reporter? There exist dozens of voltage sensitive dyes that can provide the speed (greater than that of QuasAr2), and the sensitivity to circumvent the illumination problem.</p><p>2) The authors claim their capacity to probe in a semi-quantitative way the activation, inactivation and state-dependent pharmacological blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. However, the quantitative aspect of the measurements is questionable. The whole study is based on the occurrence of sodium-dependent regenerative depolarizations (spikes) produced by Na<sub>V</sub> channels. The figures displaying single-cell recordings of these spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) show that they occur in an all-or-none fashion, as expected from a dynamical system with Na<sub>V</sub> channels. Therefore, the appearance of partial blockade reported in the figures are obtained by averaging many cell, some of which are still able to generate spikes and others not. As a consequence, the range of modulation over which the technique is sensitive will depend heavily on the variability of Na<sub>V</sub> expression. If all the cells were expressing the same density of Na<sub>V</sub>, one would expect response curves being step functions, as all the cells would cross the threshold for regenerative spiking at the same level of channel modulation. This aspect must be quantified extensively by monitoring the dependence of the spike on channel density and by measuring the distribution of Na<sub>V</sub> channel expression in the polyclonal cell mixture, relative to the density threshold for regenerative spiking. Finally, the maximal plateau potential evoked by optogenetic stimulation looks dangerously close to spike threshold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>. This aspect must be quantified extensively. Additionally, while establishing a proof of principle for all-optical screening using this new optogenetic toolset, the paper falls short of comparing quantitatively all-optical measurements with electrophysiological measurements. Furthermore, the applicability to a wide range of voltage-gated channels, other than sodium channels, is not clearly demonstrated, given the dependence of the current assay on regenerative spiking.</p><p>3) The authors point rightly (Discussion, fourth paragraph) that interference of tested pharmacological compounds with the optogenetic reporters and actuators may produce false positive and false negative results, but that it is unlikely to happen. The burden of proof should not be left on potential users of their technique. The interference with the optogenetic tools of a wide subsets of the compounds used in this study, from different chemical families, should be tested using systematic patch-clamp recordings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15202.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>While the reviewers were favorable about the idea and many elements of the approach, they shared some concerns about the manuscript, which fall in to two categories: first, scientifically, no major new discoveries are clearly evident and second, technologically, some issues that are inadequately addressed.

We then studied the dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio on the red laser intensity. The new data and analysis establish that, while the red laser intensities seem high from the perspective of blue light excitation, the different spectral properties of cells in the red part of the spectrum place these experiments well within the biologically safe range.</p><p>We also added to the Discussion a description (third paragraph) of a recent study from the Markus Sauer lab which explored photochemical toxicity in cultured mammalian U2OS cells.<sup>1</sup> Remarkably, illumination at 200 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, λ = 488 nm for 240 s led to 100% of the cells being either dead or “frozen”; while illumination at 5,900 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, λ = 640 nm for 240 s led to undetectable cell death. In our report we used illumination at 15-fold lower intensity and 6-fold shorter duration than the maximum 640 nm dose in the paper from Sauer et al. (Waldchen, S., Lehmann, J., Klein, T., van de Linde, S. &amp; Sauer, M. Light-induced cell damage in live-cell super-resolution microscopy. Sci. Rep. 5, 15348 (2015); please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> of this paper), which was proofed safe.</p><p><italic>This illumination intensity is provided by not one, but two lasers, exciting the cells in parallel, because the quantum yield of the fluorescent protein is relatively low.</italic></p><p>Some of our setups have two red lasers combined (a holdover from prior experiments), and some have only one. The screening experiments were performed on a setup with only a single red laser (described at the end of the subsection “Simultaneous electrophysiology and Optopatch recording in HEK cells”). The experiments can be performed with a single off-the-shelf diode laser that costs &lt; $1,000.</p><p><italic>A) The bleaching and phototoxicity produced by such high illumination should be quantified.

There exist dozens of voltage sensitive dyes that can provide the speed (greater than that of QuasAr2), and the sensitivity to circumvent the illumination problem.</italic></p><p>This critique does not offer a specific alternative voltage-sensitive dye (VSD), so we are left to guess what the reviewers have in mind. There are many interesting VSDs. We are not aware of any readily available bath-applicable VSDs that are sufficiently far red-shifted to avoid optical crosstalk with channelrhodopsin excitation. A recent effort at simultaneous optogenetic actuation and VSD imaging from the late David Yue illustrated the challenges of this approach:</p><p>Park, Sarah A., et al. &quot;Optical mapping of optogenetically shaped cardiac action potentials.&quot; Scientific reports 4 (2014).</p><p>That paper used the red-shifted VSD PGH1. However, this dye retained sufficient excitation under blue illumination that voltage imaging was impossible during the epochs of optogenetic stimulation; and the SNR of the VSD measurements was much lower than what we report here.</p><p>Another recent effort is described in work from the George Augustine group:</p><p>Tsuda, Sachiko, et al. &quot;Probing the function of neuronal populations: combining micromirror-based optogenetic photostimulation with voltage-sensitive dye imaging.&quot; Neuroscience research 75.1 (2013): 76-81.</p><p>This work used a red-shifted VSD, Di-2-ANBDQPQ, that also retains considerable absorption at the blue wavelengths used for channelrhodopsin excitation.</p><p>To our knowledge, neither PGH1 nor Di-2-ANBDQPQ is commercially available. We are not aware of any dyes that have the necessary spectral properties.</p><p>We added a paragraph to the Discussion (fourth paragraph) explaining that measurements with VSDs may offer advantages if the right dyes become available.</p><p><italic>2) The authors claim their capacity to probe in a semi-quantitative way the activation, inactivation and state-dependent pharmacological blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. However, the quantitative aspect of the measurements is questionable. The whole study is based on the occurrence of sodium-dependent regenerative depolarizations (spikes) produced by Na</italic><sub>V</sub> <italic>channels. The figures displaying single-cell recordings of these spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) show that they occur in an all-or-none fashion, as expected from a dynamical system with Na</italic><sub>V</sub> <italic>channels. Therefore, the appearance of partial blockade reported in the figures are obtained by averaging many cell, some of which are still able to generate spikes and others not.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raise the important point that we did not quantitatively establish the relation between Na<sub>V</sub> current, as would be measured by a conventional voltage-clamp assay, and voltage spike amplitude as measured in our assay. The fact that spike amplitude showed a step-like dependence on channelrhodopsin activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) does <italic>not</italic> necessarily imply a similar step-like dependence on Na<sub>V</sub> conductance.</p><p>To address this critique we performed conventional patch clamp measurements in single HEK cells, alternately in current clamp and voltage clamp. We used the state-dependent Na<sub>V</sub> block of amitriptyline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>) to induce varying degrees of Na<sub>V</sub> block, and then measured either the spike height in current clamp, or peak Na<sub>V</sub> current in voltage clamp. The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the relation of spike height to Na<sub>V</sub> current (subsection “Construction and characterization of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 Optopatch Spiking (Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-OS) HEK cells”, fifth paragraph). Even at the single-cell level, modulation of the Na<sub>V</sub> current led to smooth and monotonic variation in the spike height. This result is essential for relating our results to conventional voltage-clamp experiments, and we thank the reviewers for spurring us to do this.</p><p>We performed additional Optopatch experiments at high magnification, repeating the amitriptyline measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>) with single-cell resolution. The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> shows that optically recorded spike height in each individual cell is a continuous function of Na<sub>V</sub> capacity, and that there is little cell-to-cell variability in this parameter.</p><p><italic>As a consequence, the range of modulation over which the technique is sensitive will depend heavily on the variability of Na</italic><sub>V</sub> <italic>expression. If all the cells were expressing the same density of Na</italic><sub>V</sub><italic>, one would expect response curves being step functions, as all the cells would cross the threshold for regenerative spiking at the same level of channel modulation. This aspect must be quantified extensively by monitoring the dependence of the spike on channel density and by measuring the distribution of Na</italic><sub>V</sub> <italic>channel expression in the polyclonal cell mixture, relative to the density threshold for regenerative spiking.</italic> </p><p>The cells are <italic>monoclonal</italic> in Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, CheRiff, and QuasAr. To quantify the cell-to-cell variability in Na<sub>V</sub> current, we performed manual patch clamp measurements on 11 cells. We now include statistics on the mean and standard deviation in maximum Na<sub>V</sub> current (subsection “Construction and characterization of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 Optopatch Spiking (Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-OS) HEK cells”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>Finally, the maximal plateau potential evoked by optogenetic stimulation looks dangerously close to spike threshold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>. This aspect must be quantified extensively.</italic></p><p>We think the axes in this graph may have been confusing because we had only included a scale-bar, not a complete axis on the inset. We reformatted the display to show clearly that the maximum plateau potential, -26 mV, is well above the spike threshold, -48 mV. We have never encountered a difficulty in optically triggering cells to spike when the cells have adequate Na<sub>V</sub> capacity.</p><p><italic>Additionally, while establishing a proof of principle for all-optical screening using this new optogenetic toolset, the paper falls short of comparing quantitatively all-optical measurements with electrophysiological measurements.</italic></p><p>We now include a quantitative calibration of spike height to Na<sub>v</sub> current density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D, E</xref> contain manual patch clamp validation of the hits from our optical screen.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, the applicability to a wide range of voltage-gated channels, other than sodium channels, is not clearly demonstrated, given the dependence of the current assay on regenerative spiking.</italic></p><p>Indeed, this technique will not work for all ion channels. We demonstrated function for Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) and K<sub>v</sub> 4.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In the Discussion we now describe possible application to Ca<sub>V</sub> channels and delayed rectifier potassium channels, hERG and K<sub>V</sub>7 (last paragraph). We believe that Na<sub>V</sub> channels are a sufficiently important class of targets that assays devoted to them will have an important impact. We changed the Introduction to emphasize that our focus is in Na<sub>v</sub> channels (last paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) The authors point rightly (Discussion, fourth paragraph) that interference of tested pharmacological compounds with the optogenetic reporters and actuators may produce false positive and false negative results, but that it is unlikely to happen. The burden of proof should not be left on potential users of their technique. The interference with the optogenetic tools of a wide subsets of the compounds used in this study, from different chemical families, should be tested using systematic patch-clamp recordings.</italic></p><p>We developed an optical assay to determine whether compounds used in the study had off-target effects on Kir2.1, CheRiff, or QuasAr2 (subsection “High throughput screening of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 inhibitors”, eighth paragraph, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2A</xref> and 2B describes this assay and the result. Seven of the eight tested compounds showed less than 7% change compared to TTX alone, while carbamazepine slightly decreased QuasAr2 signal amplitude.</p><p>We also performed systematic patch clamp recordings to validate the optical assay and to characterize the effects of a set of eight test compounds on our optogenetic reporter and actuator (subsection “High throughput screening of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 inhibitors”, ninth paragraph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C-F</xref>). None of the compounds affected CheRiff photocurrents. Seven of the eight compounds had no effect on QuasAr2 voltage sensitivity, while carbamazepine slightly decreased QuasAr2 voltage sensitivity, consistent with the optical assay for off-target effects. The small off-target effect of carbamazepine had no effect on our optical assays of activity-dependent block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), because the analysis is insensitive to an overall scaling of the signal amplitude.</p><p>We believe that the development of an all-optical assay for off-target effects is an important addition to the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
