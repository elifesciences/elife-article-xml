skeleton grow by endochondral ossification, under the control of growth plates. Mechanisms of endochondral ossification are conserved across growth plates, which increases covariation in size and shape among bones, and in turn may lead to correlated changes in skeletal traits not under direct selection. We used micro-CT and geometric morphometrics to characterize shape changes in the cranium of the Longshanks mouse, which was selectively bred for longer tibiae. We show that Longshanks skulls became longer, flatter, and narrower in a stepwise process. Moreover, we show that these morphological changes likely resulted from developmental changes in the growth plates of the Longshanks cranial base, mirroring changes observed in its tibia. Thus, indirect and non-adaptive morphological changes can occur due to developmental overlap among distant skeletal elements, with important implications for interpreting the evolutionary history of vertebrate skeletal form.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>geometric morphometrics</kwd><kwd>correlated evolution</kwd><kwd>Longshanks mouse</kwd><kwd>cranial shape</kwd><kwd>endochondral ossification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant 4181932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rolian</surname><given-names>Campbell</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008459</institution-id><institution>University of Calgary</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty of Veterinary Medicine</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rolian</surname><given-names>Campbell</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Canada Graduate Scholarship - Masters</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Unger</surname><given-names>Colton Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Artificial selection for increased tibia length in mice made their skulls longer, narrower, and flatter, suggesting that even distant skeletal regions can evolve as correlated responses to selection acting locally.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organismal development is a major determinant of phenotypic variation, and therefore is fundamentally related to how organisms evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hendrikse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hallgrímsson and Lieberman, 2008</xref>). Organisms are comprised of interrelated anatomical elements whose morphology is patterned by shared genetic pathways (i.e. pleiotropic genes) and often by the same developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hallgrímsson and Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murren, 2012</xref>). Shared genetic and/or developmental processes lead to morphological integration, that is, the tendency of sets of traits to covary more strongly internally than with traits in other sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheverud, 1996</xref>). In turn, integrated individual anatomical structures contribute to the modular organization of biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wagner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hallgrímsson et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>If two anatomical structures are integrated due to underlying genetic phenomena, such as pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium, then those traits are more likely to respond to selection in a concerted manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armbruster and Schwaegerle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheverud, 1996</xref>). As a result of integration, correlated responses to selection can result in phenotypic changes in some traits that are merely a consequence of covariation with other traits under selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gould and Lewontin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wagner, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Price and Langen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Parsons et al., 2015</xref>). Understanding how developmental processes lead to correlated responses to selection is pivotal to distinguishing adaptive changes from those that are non-adaptive, or potentially even maladaptive, in analyses of phylogeny, ancestral relationships and evolutionary change within lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gould and Lewontin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Riska, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">von Cramon-Taubadel, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The bones of the terrestrial vertebrate cranial floor (basicranium) and the postcranial skeleton represent an interesting case of integration because they are physically distant, yet both develop by the process of endochondral ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Beer, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">White and Wallis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mackie et al., 2008</xref>). Endochondral ossification proceeds through the formation, expansion, and mineralization of a cartilaginous template, known as an anlage, that is patterned in utero and undergoes post-natal longitudinal expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kronenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mackie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lefebvre and Bhattaram, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roselló-Díez and Joyner, 2015</xref>). In the limbs, ossification initiates by the formation of primary and secondary ossification centers and continues into post-natal development via specialized growth plates situated at the ends of the long bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kronenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mackie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lefebvre and Bhattaram, 2010</xref>). The postcranial growth plate, once formed, is comprised of three histologically distinct zones containing cartilage-producing cells (chondrocytes) in different physiological states: resting, proliferative, and hypertrophic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roselló-Díez and Joyner, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The basicranium is comprised of three bones: the basioccipital, the basisphenoid, and the presphenoid, which make up the floor of the caudal portion of the skull in mammals and are formed by growth in the spheno-occipital and intersphenoidal synchondroses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). Synchondroses are structurally analogous to growth plates, however, synchondroses grow bidirectionally and have duplicated proliferative and hypertrophic zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). Basicranial growth is thought to be a key determinant of overall skull shape. The basicranium is the first cranial skeletal element to develop and is controlled intrinsically by endochondral ossification-like mechanisms, whereas the face and calvarium are influenced by, and grow in response to, hormonal regulation of surrounding tissue and brain growth, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Scott, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Waters and Kaye, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastir and Rosas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Richtsmeier et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, the basicranium supports the brain and contains critical foramina for the passage of vasculature and cranial nerves and is therefore central to proper craniofacial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lieberman et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Several mouse models with mutations in key genetic regulators of endochondral ossification manifest convergent phenotypic changes in the limb skeleton and the basicranium, with similar underlying perturbations to the structure of their respective growth plates, for example <italic>Evc1/2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pacheco et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Pthrp,</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amizuka et al., 1994</xref>), <italic>Fgfr2/3</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yin et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Day et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nagayama et al., 2008</xref>). These models provide support for the idea that even distant anatomical structures such as the skull and limbs are to some degree morphologically integrated, through the action of pleiotropic genes. Whether this shared developmental architecture can also lead to correlated evolutionary change in these structures over time, however, is not known. Here, we used the Longshanks mouse to study correlated short-term evolution of cranial and post-cranial skeletal elements. The Longshanks mouse was established through artificial selection for increased tibia length relative to body mass, using an outbred CD1 stock. By generation 20, mean tibia length in two independently selected Longshanks lines had increased by 13–15% in comparison to random-bred Controls from the same genetic background with no change in average body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marchini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castro et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Investigation of the cellular mechanisms governing limb development in Longshanks revealed structural alterations in the postnatal epiphyseal growth plate of the tibia. Specifically, the Longshanks selection regime resulted in larger tibial growth plates with larger resting and proliferative zones, without changes in cell division rate or timing of growth plate fusion compared to Controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marchini and Rolian, 2018</xref>). Previous analyses also suggested the tibia selection regime resulted in mice that are skeletally larger in relation to body mass, with correlated skeletal responses at the systemic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sparrow et al., 2017</xref>), along with potentially maladaptive changes in skeletal microarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Farooq et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cosman et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The Longshanks experiment offers a unique opportunity to study correlated evolution in skeletal traits that were not directly under selection, in a model with known evolutionary history, under controlled laboratory settings. Given the underlying developmental relationship between the long bones and cranial base, we investigated whether selection for increased tibia length indirectly altered the shape of the Longshanks cranium. We tested the general hypothesis that selection for increased tibia length produced indirect responses in the cranium of Longshanks through changes to the shared process of endochondral ossification. Specifically, we predicted that Longshanks crania will have a series of craniofacial morphological changes corresponding to altered synchondrosis size/architecture. To test this hypothesis, we compared the 3D shape of adult Longshanks crania from both Longshanks lines to Controls across three evenly spaced generations in the selection experiment. We also used a combination of morphometric analysis and histology to investigate cranial development in Longshanks neonates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Longshanks adults</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Body mass and cranium size allometry is altered in Longshanks adults</title><p>F01 mice (founders) that had not been subjected to selection did not differ in average weight or tibia length between lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Moreover, random-bred F09 Controls and F20 Controls did not differ from F01 founders in terms of tibia length in ANCOVA accounting for body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In contrast, LS1 and LS2 at F09 have an average of 7.3% longer tibiae compared to F09 Controls, while LS1 and LS2 at F20 have 16.4% longer tibiae on average when compared to F20 Controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Average body mass in our sample was stable between lines across all three generations and did not differ significantly in all but two pairwise comparisons between groups (ANOVA, F = 3.312) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In contrast, at generation F20, LS1 and LS2 mice had significantly larger cranium centroid sizes than Controls (ANOVA, F = 312.7, Tukey’s HSD, F20 LS1vsF20 CTL p&lt;0.05, F20 LS2vsF20 CTL p&lt;0.05), although the latter did not differ from F01 or F09 Controls (Tukey’s HSD, F01 CTLvsF09 CTL p=0.929, F09 CTLvsF20 CTL p=0.803, F01 CTLvsF20 CTL p=1.000).</p><p>Given that the long bones of the Longshanks post-cranial skeleton are larger than Controls at any given body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sparrow et al., 2017</xref>), we asked if the allometric scaling relationship between Longshanks crania and overall body mass had changed in response to 20 generations of selection. Body mass was significantly correlated with cranium centroid size in our adult sample (Pearson, <italic>r</italic> = 0.697, p&lt;0.001). ANCOVA comparing mean cranium centroid size among lines using body mass as the covariate indicates that there was a significant difference in centroid size between Controls and Longshanks at F20; however, LS1 and LS2 did not differ from each other (F = 14.97, Tukey’s HSD, LS1vsLS2 p=0.947, LS1vsCTL p&lt;0.001, LS2vsCTL p&lt;0.001). Hence, Longshanks selected lines have skeletally larger crania after 20 generations of selection independent of body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>The Longshanks cranium is longer, narrower, and flatter</title><p>Next, we asked if the fact that tibia length and cranium centroid size increases in F20 LS1 and LS2 is associated with shape differences in their cranium compared to F09 and F01 mice. We performed a principal component analysis on the residuals of a multivariate regression of shape on sex in order to control for potential sex effects on cranial shape in our sample. Comparison of principal component (PC) score means between groups demonstrates that despite overlap in skull shape, LS1 and LS2 have shifted substantially into positive PC1 space, reflecting crania that are longer and narrower with reduction in vault height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons from a Procrustes ANCOVA comparing adult cranium shape by group, independent of sex effects, showed that all groups within line by generation, or within generation by line, differ in mean shape, except F01 LS2 and Controls (F = 10.679, F01 LS2vsF01 CTL p=0.203). When comparing the Euclidean distance among group sex-adjusted PC score means, however, F20 LS1 and LS2 mice are on average over twice as far from unselected mice in morphospace (i.e. all F01 founders, F09 and F20 controls) than the latter are from each other (mean Euclidean distances 0.023 vs 0.010, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Scatter plots of the first two principal components (PC) of Procrustes shape variables in adult Longshanks and Controls throughout the selection process.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Plot of sex-adjusted Procrustes shape variables (left), and vectors of shape change at each cranium landmark (magnified two times for visualization) showing shape transformations along PC1 from negative to positive scores (right).

Thus, while Longshanks F20 LS1 and LS2 have larger crania at any given body mass compared to Controls, the allometric pattern within the cranium itself was not altered by selection for increased tibia length.</p><p>The difference in intercept between the fitted PC1 scores and log centroid size of LS1 and LS2 in relation to Controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) suggest that while the increase in size of F20 selected crania contributes to the shape differences along PC1, it is not the only cause of shape variation. We therefore asked if differences in shape between the Longshanks and Control cohorts persist when the effect of size is removed from our sample by using multivariate regression residuals of shape on size. The principal component analysis of shape independent of size and sex shows a marked reduction in group separation along PC1; however, F20 LS1 and LS2 still typically score more positively in PC1, corresponding to crania that are relatively longer, narrower, and have reduction in vault height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons from a Procrustes ANCOVA comparing adult cranium shape by group independent of size and sex effects showed that all groups within line by generation, or within generation by line, differ in mean shape (F = 8.205, p&lt;0.001) except F01 LS2 and Controls (F01 LS2vsF01 CTL p=0.173). As with sex-adjusted data, F20 Longshanks mice are substantially farther in morphospace from unselected groups than the latter are from each other (mean Euclidean distances 0.017 vs 0.010, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-4"><title>Tibia length and cranial shape means evolve under selection, but are uncorrelated within generations</title><p>After identifying underlying differences in cranial shape between F20 Longshanks and Controls irrespective of sex and size effects, we asked how this residual cranial shape variation was related to variation in tibia length, the principal selection target.

More importantly, within cohorts, tibia length and cranium shape are not significantly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). While the population means for residual cranium shape and tibia length were changing over time in Longshanks selected lines, selected individuals with relatively longer tibiae did not necessarily also have derived cranial shapes.

This suggests that a cellular change in the dorsal aspect of the intersphenoidal synchondrosis could be driving cranial base flattening in the Longshanks juvenile skull, and hence potentially into adulthood given the broadly similar shape changes observed at both stages. To qualitatively validate the cellular changes inferred from our 2D geometric morphometric analysis, we collected and imaged cranial base sections near the sagittal midline. Since these developmental shape differences are still subtle, we selected two representative extreme specimens that had large differences in ossified tibia length, cranial base shape and cranium shape, yet comparable cranium centroid sizes so that size would not confound our analysis. In agreement with our morphometric data, the spheno-occipital synchondrosis does not differ qualitatively between these extreme specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, the intersphenoidal synchondrosis is markedly larger in our Longshanks specimen compared to the Control, with larger resting and proliferative zones that recapitulate the cellular differences characterized in the Longshanks epiphysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marchini and Rolian, 2018</xref>).

In parallel, the cranium of adult Longshanks decreased in width between the zygomatic arches and reduced in vault height at the bregma and lambda (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A similar cranium pattern was present in Longshanks neonates at P07, but with an ontogenically reduced craniofacial phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).

However, in this study, we are more interested in patterns of shape change rather than magnitudes of change. Over 20 generations, the main target of selection, the tibia, increased in length by just 15%. As such, we expected that secondary cranial shape changes, while potentially significant in terms of long-term evolution, would be subtle. Moreover, selection in the tibia appears to have increased the variation in cranium measures, such as centroid size and cranial shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). While the F20 LS1 and LS2 samples have new extreme cranium shapes not seen in earlier generations (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>), their effects on the mean shape are dampened substantially by the fact that many F20 mice still have crania that resemble F01 random-bred mice.</p><p>The net adult cranium phenotypic change in Longshanks manifested as a sequence of two distinct evolutionary shape changes. The cranium of both selected lines consistently reduced in vault height in the first 9 generations of tibia selection, and subsequently elongated and narrowed in the next 11 generations of selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In comparison, the Control line shows minor cranial shape changes around the zygomatic and occipital regions, which are likely due to stochastic intergenerational variation in the Control line (i.e. drift), and/or to sampling artifacts, such as low sample size and family diversity in F09 Controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Similar evolutionary cranial shape changes have also been described in natural populations. Parmenter and colleagues noted that Gough Island mice, which differ significantly in body size compared to mainland relatives, have crania that are longer and narrower without differences in vault height, similar to the intergenerational changes in cranial shape between generations F09 and F20 in Longshanks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parmenter et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanisms underlying these stepwise changes are unknown, in part due to a lack of F09 developmental data. However, the transition in cranium response could be related to temporal differences in allele frequency shifts up to, and subsequent to, generation F09, and/or to the nature in which cranial bones physically interact (e.g. the degree of perturbation that must accumulate in one cranium region before adjacent structures are significantly affected).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Longshanks adult (F01, F09, F20) and neonate (F32) sample composition.</title><p>Target sample sizes of n = 40/group represent a compromise between sampling effort (e.g. scanning capacity) and the ability to detect small-to-moderate effect sizes at a power of 0.8 in the case of univariate analyses (Cohen’s d = 0.25).

In other words, selected individuals with relatively longer tibiae did not necessarily have derived cranial shapes. This suggests that residual cranial shape did not increase the chances of being selected as a breeder in our experiment, and therefore the observed change in residual cranial shape over time in Longshanks is most likely a correlated evolutionary response to tibia selection, mediated by underlying genetic correlations due to pleiotropy and/or linkage disequilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lande, 1984</xref>).</p><p>Correlated evolutionary responses have been documented in experimental populations primarily in terms of physiological and behavioral processes, such as starvation response, developmental duration, and voluntary wheel running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gammie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davidowitz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hardy et al., 2018</xref>).

Moreover, 2D geometric morphometrics at the midline and histology demonstrated that Longshanks neonates have a larger intersphenoidal synchondrosis with larger resting and proliferative zones, especially in its dorsal aspect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>), much like differences observed in the tibial proximal epiphysis of 2-week-old Longshanks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marchini and Rolian, 2018</xref>). In contrast, the spheno-occipital synchondrosis did not show any substantive size or shape differences among groups. Taken together, these results suggest that the intersphenoidal synchondrosis responded to selection on the tibia independently of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis and may have contributed to the Longshanks cranial phenotype.</p><p>It is important to note that our ontogenetic analysis captured a single developmental stage, hence the apparent uncoupling of the synchondroses may be because the spheno-occipital synchondrosis has developmentally important differences between Longshanks and Controls, but at a different time in development. For example, the spheno-occipital synchondrosis mineralizes faster than the intersphenoidal synchondrosis after P10 in CD-1 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wealthall and Herring, 2006</xref>). Regardless, differential timing of spheno-occipital synchondrosis and intersphenoidal synchondrosis fusion are widespread across clades, suggesting these growth centers are partly under independent control. In humans, the intersphenoidal synchondrosis begins fusing at birth, whereas the spheno-occipital synchondrosis does not fuse until adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Madeline and Elster, 1995</xref>). In domestic dogs, premature fusion of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis is a prominent feature of brachycephalic dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). The partial developmental independence of the synchondroses is supported by knock-out studies of skeletogenic factors in rodents which have noted concerted changes in the postcranial epiphyses and synchondroses, but with differential responses in the respective synchondroses (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vora, 2017</xref>]). For example, in mice, Indian hedgehog (Ihh<sup>-/-</sup>) knockout results in significantly more ectopic hypertrophic chondrocytes in the intersphenoidal synchondrosis than in the spheno-occipital synchondrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Young et al., 2006</xref>). The intrinsic differences between the two synchondroses may ultimately be associated with their distinct embryonic origins: the pre-sphenoid and basi-sphenoid bones originate from neural crest cells that commit to endochondral ossification, whereas the basi-occiptal bone forms from mesenchymal condensations of prechordal mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McBratney-Owen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Richtsmeier and Flaherty, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The exact ontogenetic mechanism by which the observed cranial base changes may lead to shape change across the entire cranium in Longshanks remains to be elucidated.

At this time, the genomic basis for these correlated skeletal changes remains unknown.

Several genes in or near these loci, such as <italic>Nkx3-2</italic> and <italic>Chst11</italic>, have known cranium and limb pleiotropic effects in knock-out mice and human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lettice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tribioli and Lufkin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akazawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klüppel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Provot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chopra et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is not clear whether these contributed to the overall F20 correlated cranium response, especially since allelic changes in non-coding regions are predicted to have smaller pleiotropic effects, if any, when compared to genomic changes in coding regions, which were rare at F17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carroll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stern and Orgogozo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rice and Rebeiz, 2019</xref>). Moreover, when cross-referenced against annotated mouse knockout phenotypes (Mouse Genome Informatics [MGI], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org">http://www.informatics.jax.org</ext-link>), these genomic regions contain genes with singular effects on the cranium skeleton (e.g. <italic>Tapt1 and Nfic</italic>), hence it is also possible that the correlated response was driven in part by genetic linkage between limb- and cranium-specific genes swept along by selection. Interestingly, our query of MGI also shows that over 15 of the genes near the altered F17 loci influence brain development and morphology, and therefore could indirectly influence the F20 net cranium shape due to brain-skull physical interactions. More work will be necessary to shed light on the underlying genetic correlates of the Longshanks cranium phenotype, especially functional genomic and molecular analyses of the cranial base at multiple developmental stages.</p><p>The Longshanks experiment provides a robust example of correlated evolutionary changes in the vertebrate skeleton. These findings are made possible in part because the experimental design allowed us to assess skeletal change in a controlled environment, and without confounding variables (e.g. fluctuations in climate and/or food availability, presence of predators). At the same time, laboratory conditions in which a single selection pressure can be applied to the skeleton likely differ from the more complex multivariate selective pressures operating in nature. The simplified environment and strong directional selection pressures in experimental evolution studies may target alleles with detrimental pleiotropic effects more frequently than in natural settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kawecki et al., 2012</xref>). For example, in natural populations, correlated responses in the cranium to selection acting on the limb skeleton could be buffered by counteracting selection pressures, related to diet, olfaction, hearing and/or mate choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Samuels, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maestri et al., 2016</xref>). This simplified evolutionary process is a strength of selection experiments. Indeed, by applying strong directional selection on a single trait, selection experiments can ‘overwhelm’ complex multivariate responses to selection operating in nature, including stabilizing selection on other structures, and in doing so reveal previously unknown pleiotropic developmental mechanisms that have the potential to drive correlated evolution among distinct anatomical structures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we characterized secondary skeletal responses to tibia selection that likely arose due to shared underlying developmental mechanisms between the cranium and tibia, specifically endochondral ossification. The limb and cranium are often considered separate modules in morphological analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Young and Hallgrímsson, 2005</xref>). Our results highlight the importance of considering evolution of the vertebrate skeleton in its entirety. Our study shows how indirect, and potentially non-adaptive, skeletal changes can occur due to developmental overlap among physically and functionally distant body parts. These findings have implications for how we reconstruct skeletal evolutionary histories of extant and extinct mammalian lineages by providing empirical evidence that skeletal traits may arise solely as side effects of selection acting elsewhere.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Longshanks 1</td><td valign="top">Campbell Rolian</td><td valign="top">LS1</td><td valign="top">Stock: HSD:ICR</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Longshanks 2</td><td valign="top">Campbell Rolian</td><td valign="top">LS2</td><td valign="top">Stock: HSD:ICR</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Control</td><td valign="top">Campbell Rolian</td><td valign="top">CTL</td><td valign="top">Stock: HSD:ICR</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top"><italic>R</italic>, <italic>R</italic> packages <italic>geomorph</italic>, <italic>Morpho, RRPP</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">R Development Core Team, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schlager, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collyer and Adams, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2020</xref></td><td valign="top">n/a</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Amira</td><td valign="top">Visage Imaging, Berlin, Germany</td><td valign="top">Version 5.4.2</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Python and Bash (Medical Imaging NetCDF library)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Percival et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Devine et al., 2020</xref></td><td valign="top">Python 3.6 <break/>Bash-5.1 <break/>MINC 2.0</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit-v2">https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit-v2</ext-link> <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jaydevine/Landmarking">https://github.com/jaydevine/Landmarking</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Haematoxylin (for Weigert’s)</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">H3136</td><td valign="top">Histological stain</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Iron (III) chloride (for Weigert’s)</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">157740</td><td valign="top">Histological stain</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Fast Green (FCF)</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">F7252</td><td valign="top">Histological stain</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Safranin-O</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">S2255</td><td valign="top">Histological stain</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Gill’s Haematoxylin</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">GHS332</td><td valign="top">Histological stain</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Eosin Y</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">588X</td><td valign="top">Histological stain</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal samples</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Health Sciences Animal Care Committee at the University of Calgary (AC13-0077) and (AC17-0026) and performed in accordance with best practices outlined by the Canadian Council on Animal Care.

Each group was as sex and family balanced as possible to account for differences due to sexual dimorphism and/or family diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Karp et al., 2017</xref>). To investigate the developmental basis of the Longshanks cranium, we generated postnatal day seven (P07) neonates (N = 104) from F31 Longshanks mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The three lines have not actively undergone artificial selection since generation F22 and are maintained as experimental populations.

We used a Skyscan 1173 v1.6 µCT scanner (Bruker, Kontich, Belgium) to acquire whole-body scans of the adults and separate scans of the neonate cranium and tibiae. We obtained adult samples from frozen archived carcasses at each generation, while F32 neonates were scanned the day they were euthanized. In addition, we scanned the corresponding right hindlimb of each neonate that underwent cranium scanning. Adult scans were acquired at 70–80 kV and 60–75 µA with 44.73 µm isotropic voxels and no filter, while neonates were scanned at a resolution of 17.04 µm isotropic voxels with otherwise identical parameters.

Fixed cranium tissues were then transferred to a decalcifying solution (Cal-Ex II, Fisher Chemical) for 72 hr with daily solution changes. After decalcification, a rectangular portion of the cranial base containing both basicranial synchondroses was dehydrated, embedded it in paraffin, and sectioned in the sagittal plane at 12 µm. Sections were deparaffinized in Slide Brite (Jones Scientific Products, Inc) and subsequently stained. The slides of a specimen were stained in an alternating fashion with two stains: (1) Wiegert’s Iron Haematoxylin (Sigma), 0.05% Fast-Green (FCF) (Sigma), counterstained in 0.1% Safranin-o solution (Sigma); or (2) Gill’s Haematoxylin #3 (Sigma), rinsed in 70% ethanol, and counterstained with 1% alcoholic Eosin Y (Sigma).

Automated landmarking improves data standardization and can be used to quickly process very large sample sizes while reducing intraobserver errors, such as landmark placement drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fruciano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Devine et al., 2020</xref>). Automated landmarking involves volumetric registration using a global affine alignment of the skull volumes, followed by a dense non-linear deformation between each cranium and a reference atlas. Here, the atlas is an average volume, with a standardized landmark configuration, that best minimizes intensity differences from the rest of the sample. We used 68 3D landmarks for the adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary fle 4</xref>) and 50 3D landmarks for the neonates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><p>We computed the affine transformations with a multi-resolution framework, where the µCT volumes are translated, scaled, rotated, and sheared at progressively higher resolutions until their affine alignment with the atlas is maximized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lerch et al., 2010</xref>). We computed the non-linear transformations with the multi-resolution SyN (Symmetric Normalization) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avants et al., 2011</xref>), which involves symmetrically flowing an image pair into one another along a velocity field. We then recovered, concatenated, and inverted the transformations, and finally propagated the atlas landmarks along this path to the original image space for analysis. All image processing was performed with the open-source MINC (Medical Imaging NetCDF) toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit-v2">https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit-v2</ext-link>).</p><p>In addition to investigating overall neonate cranium shape, we characterized cranial base shape with two-dimensional (2D) landmarks at the sagittal midline. We used a 12 landmark set highlighting the vertices of the developing basicranial bones which provides information about the shape of the sagittal cross-section of the basicranial synchondroses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Landmarks at the midline were placed in Amira v.5.4.2 (Visage Imaging, Berlin, Germany) by one observer (CMU) blind to the identity of the specimens. Adult tibiae lengths were quantified in Amira by calculating the distance, in mm, between two landmarks that we placed on the distal tip of the lateral malleolus and most lateral point on the proximal epiphysis, two anatomical points that were demonstrated to have high homology and repeatability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cosman et al., 2016</xref>). Because neonate tibia length is not fully visible in the scans due to small or absent secondary ossification centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moss, 1977</xref>), neonate tibia measurements were obtained from the distance, in mm, between landmarks placed on the distal and proximal ends of the ossified tibial diaphysis on the rostral edge along the sagittal midline of the tibia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Geometric morphometrics</title><p>Analyses were performed on the R/Rstudio computational platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">R Development Core Team, 2020</xref>). We investigated shape cranial differences by superimposing the adult and neonate landmark configurations into age-specific morphospaces via Generalized Procrustes Analysis. To study the influence of selection on cranial shape, we first corrected for confounding variables known to alter adult and neonatal morphology.</p><p>In the adult sample, we controlled for the effects of sex and size. Upon regressing shape on sex, we observed that sex accounted for a small but significant amount of variation (2.2%), although there were no sex-specific differences in cranial responses to selection (data not shown). Using sex-adjusted residuals, we investigated allometry in the Longshanks cranium to parse out how much of the cranial selection response, if any, could be attributed to changes in skeletal size. While Procrustes superimposition removes scale, it does not account for differences in biological shape that are associated with size that is allometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klingenberg, 2016</xref>). Because Longshanks mice are skeletally larger in relation to body mass in the post-cranium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sparrow et al., 2017</xref>), we employed a pooled within-group analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of cranium centroid size on body mass to determine whether the same trend exists in the Longshanks cranium. Mean centroid size after accounting for body mass was significantly different among lines at F20 (F = 14.97, p&lt;0.001), with Longshanks LS1 and LS2 lines having larger crania than Controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) (Tukey’s post-hoc test, LS1vsLS2 p=0.947, LS1vsCTL p&lt;0.001, LS2vsCTL p&lt;0.001). There was no difference in mean centroid size, after controlling for covariation with body mass, among founder (F01) samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) (LS1vsLS2 p=0.896, LS1vsCTL p=0.999, LS2vsCTL p=0.999).</p><p>For the neonate sample, we controlled for the effects of litter size but not sex, due to uncertainties in assigning sex anatomically in neonates. After regressing cranial size and tibia length on litter size, we observed a strong negative correlation (Pearson, <italic>r</italic> = −0.72, p&lt;0.001). LS2, which had litter sizes that were ~ 2 pups larger than LS1 and ~ 4 pups larger than controls on average, exhibited significantly smaller centroid sizes than LS1 and Controls (ANOVA, F = 19.51, Tukey’s HSD, LS1vsLS2 p&lt;0.001, LS1vsCTL = 0.764, LS2vsCTL p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Carlos Infante (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the manuscript presents a robust and interesting morphometric dataset. However, both reviewers also agree that the data are over-interpreted and that the primary conclusions of the manuscript are not well supported. Unfortunately, a significant amount of additional research seems to be required to establish the genetic or molecular mechanisms underlying the coordinated changes in limb and skull morphology; more research than could be completed in the normal time frame for <italic>eLife</italic> revisions. Therefore, the conclusion reached by the reviewers and the editors in discussion is that the manuscript is not appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> in its current format.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a well-written and detailed manuscript that I recommend for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors describe correlated changes between limb length and skull shape in a line of laboratory mice that have undergone generations of artificial selection for limb length (Longshanks mice) using both 2D and 3D morphometric analyses. The key findings are the demonstration of unexpected effects on non-target tissues (skull shape) of this artificial selection, and the identification of cellular changes in the off-target tissue underlying the effect. The discussion cautions that the interpretation of morphological evolution of the vertebrate skeleton in terms of distinct, isolated modules may ignore unexpected connections based on underlying genetic and developmental mechanisms.</p><p>1. The study relies on morphometric analyses and some histology on the SOS and ISS in neonate crania to establish a mechanism for the correlated changes in the shape of the ISS. This argument would be strengthened with some additional data on what is happening at the cellular level of the ISS and the growth plate of the tibia to support that the same molecular mechanism is being deployed to produce the changes in cellular organization seen in the ISS. But I understand that these are beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>2. I have a concern about the interpretation of the results in the broader context of the evolution of skeletal adaptations. I agree that unexpected correlated changes could result from the selection on a particular feature, but I also could imagine that other selective pressures could prevent could prevent correlated changes. A laboratory strain of mice may not have the full selective environment of a natural population, and perhaps changes in limb length would proceed through alternative developmental and genetic mechanisms. Maybe the associated limb/cranium changes are a path of least resistance only available in a laboratory strain?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Unger et al., identifies correlated evolution of the skull and tibia in Longshanks mice. The authors find that the response to artificial selection on tibia length directly or indirectly facilitated the evolution of skull shape in two separate selection lines. Most interesting, although both lines experienced different patterns of allelic response and tibial evolution, they both depict similar patterns of skull shape change over the course of 20 generations of selection. They find that in the first 9 generations, cranial vault height is changing. From generation 10 and onward, cranial width is reduced in parallel with elongation of the snout. The authors come to the conclusion that correlated evolution of the skull and tibia may be due to pleiotropy and discuss potential candidates.</p><p>This is a well written and easy to read manuscript, with a robust and interesting morphometric dataset. I particularly like the use of heat maps overlaid on the skull to depict shape change. These figures are far more readable than typical splines, warps, and vector diagrams used in most morphometric studies. In all, the morphological data presented produce a convincing argument for indirect correlated evolution via pleiotropy.</p><p>My concerns largely deal with the figures and interpretations presented in the discussion.</p><p>1. After some fine tuning, I think that Supplemental Figure 8 should be Figure 1 in the manuscript and not hidden away in the supplement. Correlated trait evolution is the crux of the argument of this manuscript, and this figure depicts that quite elegantly. Sometimes the most basic figures are best at getting the message across. To make the visual more compelling, I suggest making each plot specific to LS1, LS2, and Ctl. In each panel, plot generation F01, F09, and F20 so readers can see the gradual shifting to the upper right corner of the plot as skull size increases with tibia size in LS1/2. This shift will be noticeably absent in Ctl.</p><p>2. My greatest concern is that the authors mechanistically attribute major loci associated with tibia length evolution not just to the evolution of the skull, but also the shift in the skull response to selection that occurs between generations 9 and 10 (lines 403-412). For example, previous studies on the Longshank mice by (Castro et al., 2019) looked at genome-wide differences between F0 and F17, in which they identified NKX-3.2 as a major effect locus that had almost swept to fixation in both LS1 and LS2 at generation 17. The authors note that &quot;complete ablation of nkx-3.2 results in cranial base truncation and premature synchondrosis fusion in mice.&quot; From this they suggest that selection for nkx-3.2 downregulation in the tibia may have caused indirect cranial changes in the skull via pleiotropic effects. In lines 413-421 the authors suggest the switch in the response of the skull may reflect selection on genes affecting all cranial growth plates and their response to systemic factors.</p><p>This is an over-interpretation of the correlated evolution. Although the manuscript demonstrates a correlation between tibia length and skull size/shape variation, this does not mean that a major contributor to tibia evolution will also be a major contributor to cranial evolution. Both phenotypes are likely polygenic traits, and any subset of genes responsible for tibial elongation might disproportionately contribute to skull size/shape. More importantly, the genomic dataset is the limiting factor in this interpretation. Only two generations were sampled in the (Castro et al., 2019) study, F0 and F17. We don't know what the pattern of allelic response between F0-F9 looked like. It is certainly possible that nkx-3.2 started to sweep towards fixation at F9 explaining the shift in skull shape, but without the generational data this is impossible to know. It is difficult to therefore extend any findings in the study by (Castro et al., 2019) to the current dataset without generating a more complete genomic dataset as has been done in other artificial selection studies (Burke et al., 2014; Hardy et al., 2017; McKenna, 2020). I am not suggesting this be done for this manuscript. I think this is a powerful stand-alone morphometric study. I suggest reworking this section of the discussion to more broadly discuss the potential similarities and differences that might exist between the skull and tibia: does genetic modularity influence variational states of the skull and tibia, thereby influencing which genes responding to selection on tibia length also impact skull size/shape? It's appropriate to use nkx3.2 as a toned down example. Do bones within the skull have different variational states and can this explain the shift in response to selection, e.g. one bone responds early and another responds late?</p><p>3. My last concern lies within the Discussion section (470-491) and includes Figure 6. Although I agree that change in the size of any bone in the skull may exert physical effects on all other bones, the data for this are simply not present in the study making its discussion all conjecture. I think this would make for a fabulous follow-up experimental study, but it is not currently supported by the data in the manuscript. I suggest replacing this section with a discussion of the novelty of this manuscript: that is, a direct observation of correlated evolution of morphological structures. Scouring the literature of experimental evolution studies, one can find numerous examples of correlated evolution of physiological processes (Burke et al., 2014; Davidowitz et al., 2016; Hardy et al., 2017; McKenna, 2020), but few have demonstrated correlated evolution of anatomical structures that require integration of different cellular parameters (excluding butterfly eyespots that are on the same appendage (Allen et al., 2008; Beldade et al., 2002) or allometric relations of an appendage to overall body size (Frankino et al., 2019; Tobler and Nijhout, 2010)). I think such a discussion would illustrate the utility of the Longshanks experiment in its ability to identify how skeletal elements are semi-discrete: some genes are pleiotropic and others are modularly tuned, and from this we get the amazing malleability of the skeleton that has produced the size and shape variation present in mammals.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Selection for increased tibia length in mice alters skull shape through parallel changes in developmental mechanisms&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Both reviewers were supportive overall, with a relatively small number of clarifying revision requests indicated in their recommendations for authors, all of which we consider essential for you to make. In particular, I agree with the comment from reviewer 1 in terms of the overuse of acronyms/abbreviations; other than for extremely common and recognizable ones, e.g. SNP, readability is greatly improved by writing these out.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 :</italic></p><p>The authors tested whether selection for increased tibia length produced indirect responses in the cranium though shared endocranial ossification processes in experimental lines of mice. They compared 3D shape data of two selected mice lines adult crania to the control lines across three generations of the selection experiment, which ran for 20 generations. Neonates were also collected from the three lines, to test if the shape changes in the skull were visible in early ontogeny and investigate its developmental basis. The authors controlled for the effects of sex and size in adults and litter size in neonates. Shape changes were compared using Procrustes ANCOVA, and visualized using PCA and deformation heatmaps. Results showed that the selected mice had larger crania independent of body mass, and a different shape, and this process appears to have occurred in a step-wise fashion throughout the selection experiment. They also showed that these changes appeared in the neonates as well, suggesting that the changes seen in the adults were due to developmental shifts.</p><p>I found the manuscript easy to read and had very few comments, possibly because it has already been through review previously. The authors have done a good job addressing a complex topic and walking us through how and why each part of the analysis was done – the manuscript has a good flow. Nice looking figures too.</p><p>1. I think it would make sense for the authors to very briefly (a sentence or 2) address why they suggest why the basicranium and tibia are unrelated. Though I am not up on my mouse anatomy, I can easily see changes in for example tibia length, affecting muscle insertion points on the shoulder/neck area, which might also lead to correlated changes in muscles in this area then attached to the cranium – resulting in functional integration, of a sort. Reading the response to reviewer letter, this may have been taken out due to a reviewer concern, but I think something on this topic should be briefly included.</p><p>2. Endochondral ossification – the authors should clarify why they suggest that a similar process through which the basicranium and long-bones develop would result in correlated evolution. This may have been in an earlier draft of the manuscript that was previously reviewed and removed, but I am a new reviewer and this is the first version I have seen. Citations supporting their reasoning would of course be welcome, I just think this should be made clear in the introduction – around Lines 62/65. Some of this may be a case of simply moving some sentences from then discussion to the introduction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67612.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

The reviewers who assessed our manuscript were largely supportive, but, to paraphrase, felt that our discussion on the generalizability (Reviewer 1), on the genomic basis of the correlated change, and on the contribution to cranial shape changes of physical interactions during skull development (Reviewer 2), was too speculative. The consensus among editors and reviewers was that we over‐interpreted our morphometric and ontogenetic data, and that additional genetic/molecular data would be required to support our two main conclusions.</p><p>We agree that aspects of our discussion were overly speculative, and ultimately detracted from the evidence of our robust morphometric and ontogenetic data in support of our conclusions. Accordingly, we have overhauled our discussion to address the reviewers’ concerns. We have reorganized the discussion to highlight more clearly and sequentially the phenotypic, ontogenetic, and genomic implications of our study. First, we summarize and discuss the observed correlated phenotypic changes in Longshanks (lines 396‐456) and situate them within the broader literature on correlated evolution of morphological traits, as suggested by Reviewer 2 (comment #3). Next, we have consolidated our discussion of the developmental implications of our study, including aligning better the Longshanks phenotype with data from transgenic models (lines 486505), and removing the epigenetic model of physical interactions relating cranial base developmental differences to the Longshanks adult cranial phenotype, as requested by Reviewer 2 (comment #3).</p><p>Third, in response to Reviewer 2 (comment #2), we have consolidated and significantly revised our discussion of the potential genomic basis of the correlated change in a separate section entitled “Potential Genetic Basis of Shape Change” (lines 510‐536). We discuss what our previously published paper on the genomic response to selection in Longshanks (Castro et al., 2019) does, and does not, tell us about genomic correlates of shape change in the tibia and cranium. We highlight strong and parallel allele frequency changes in non‐coding DNA in two large genomic regions spanning several topology‐associated domains (TADs) and containing putative cis‐regulatory elements (lines 514‐523). We stress that, as non‐coding regions, these loci may not be responsible for the parallel change observed in the skull (lines 523‐526). In addition, using data from the Mouse Genome Informatics consortium (MGI), we highlight additional genes near these TADs that singularly affect skull and/or brain growth, thus providing potential alternative pathways underlying cranial shape changes, in this case more likely through linkage than through pleiotropy (lines 527‐534). We believe this new section provides more balanced speculation, informed by our previous genomic data and by MGI, yet without attributing the correlated changes to any one candidate gene or regulatory element.</p><p>Lastly, in response to Reviewer 1 (comment 2), we include a separate limitations section (lines 539‐560) that specifically addresses the generalizability of our findings. We stress that the conditions in our lab‐based selection experiment likely do not reflect the multivariate selection regimes that organisms are more likely subject to in nature. Hence, our findings, despite providing strong evidence of correlated morphological change, may reflect a ‘line of least evolutionary resistance’ that manifests only in controlled environments, i.e., when there is no countervailing selection acting on cranial shape. To the best of our ability, we have also addressed the reviewers’ other concerns, including modifying and moving our figure highlighting the absence of phenotypic correlations between tibia length and residual cranial shape to the main text, in support of the finding that the cranial shape change is partially an indirect response to tibia selection.</p><p>We believe these revisions have greatly improved our manuscript, and we thank the editors and reviewers for their suggestions. We remain convinced that, with these revisions, our conclusions are robust and well supported by our data. We are only beginning to study candidate molecular mechanisms that drive increased growth of the Longshanks tibia. Without this information, we believe it would be risky to undertake functional analyses (e.g., knock‐out/in studies, growth plate in situs) with the goal of uncovering the genetic and molecular basis of the correlated change in the tibia and skull. We may undertake these studies in future, but they are outside the scope of this study, and are not necessary to support our interpretations.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 :</p><p>1. I think it would make sense for the authors to very briefly (a sentence or 2) address why they suggest why the basicranium and tibia are unrelated. Though I am not up on my mouse anatomy, I can easily see changes in for example tibia length, affecting muscle insertion points on the shoulder/neck area, which might also lead to correlated changes in muscles in this area then attached to the cranium – resulting in functional integration, of a sort. Reading the response to reviewer letter, this may have been taken out due to a reviewer concern, but I think something on this topic should be briefly included.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. While we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that changes in the cranium were related to functional integration with the tibia under selection, for example related to locomotion, we think this is not a likely explanation for the observed shape changes, for two reasons. First, although the Longshanks mouse does exhibit statistically significant changes in its gait in both the forelimb and hindlimb (Sparrow et al., 2017 <italic>PeerJ</italic> 5:e3008), the changes in limb joint angles (in the hind limb) were on the order of 3-5%, likely too small to exert any effect on muscle architecture and/or insertion points in other skeletal regions. Second, as a hind limb bone, the tibia has no direct musculotendinous connection with the pectoral girdle, cranial vertebrae, or cranium. With the exception of the biceps femoris, the most proximal muscles that insert onto the tibia originate on the pelvis (rectus femoris, hamstrings) or on the femur (vastus group), and insert on its proximal aspect. It is unlikely that changes to any of these muscles brought on by selection on tibia length would occasion changes in the axial skeleton that would be transferred from the pelvic region to the cranium across more than twenty articulations. We have added a brief clarification of this lack of anatomical connection between the two structures (lines 473 and 528).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Endochondral ossification – the authors should clarify why they suggest that a similar process through which the basicranium and long-bones develop would result in correlated evolution. This may have been in an earlier draft of the manuscript that was previously reviewed and removed, but I am a new reviewer and this is the first version I have seen. Citations supporting their reasoning would of course be welcome, I just think this should be made clear in the introduction – around Lines 62/65. Some of this may be a case of simply moving some sentences from then discussion to the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now addressed this suggestion on lines 89-97, as a rationale for the study. We argue that there is evidence from the developmental literature that numerous transgenic/KO mouse models show convergent phenotypic changes due to similar perturbations to the basicranium and limb bone growth plates. This suggests these structures are developmentally integrated via the action of pleiotropic genes, which we hypothesize could lead to their correlated evolution.</p></body></sub-article></article>
