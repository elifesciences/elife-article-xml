and fatality can cause a deadly worldwide pandemic in a matter of weeks (Plato et al., 2021). Apart from vaccines and post-infection treatment options, strategies for preparedness will be vital in responding to the current and future pandemics. Therefore, there is wide interest in approaches that allow predictions of increase in infections (‘surges’) before they occur. We describe here real-time genomic surveillance particularly based on mutation analysis, of viral proteins as a methodology for a priori determination of surge in number of infection cases. The full results are available for SARS-CoV-2 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pandemics.okstate.edu/covid19/">http://pandemics.okstate.edu/covid19/</ext-link>, and are updated daily as new virus sequences become available.

Concrete evidence for a direct relationship between specific mutations and increase in rates of infection (and fatality) requires extensive laboratory studies that need significant time. The availability of unprecedented number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences is making possible identification of number and types of mutations, which in turn can provide vital knowledge in real time, crucial for decision making by health professionals for medical interventions. We are investigating several different approaches (synonymous, non-synonymous, and non-synonymous/synonymous ratio for the nucleotide sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>] and conservative or radical substitutions for the amino acid sequences) for using number and types of mutations as a means to predict surge in infections as well as to monitor the changes in critical viral proteins. Recently, such analysis has been reported for single SARS-CoV-2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Kistler et al., 2022</xref>). Our approach, however, is based on the whole viral genome analysis and moreover it is performed continually in real time.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences data and the number of COVID19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Platto et al., 2021</xref>) sequences are continually obtained from the sources described below.

Briefly, we used esearch and efetch commands to obtain these GenBank records. Search string ‘SARS-CoV-2’, refined to ‘SARS-CoV-2 [ORGN]’, was used to download the identified records in the GenBank text format. After workflow optimization, post May 2022, the search process used NCBI’s newer datasets and dataformat command-line tools to identify sequences of interest while continuing to use the efetch tool to download records in the GenBank text format. Collectively as of November 21, 2022, a total of 6,468,196 records were searched and a total of 3,126,129 sequences matching the search criterion and passing the quality control steps were used for the results presented here .</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Quality control</title><p>Incomplete and ambiguous SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences and records containing incomplete collection dates were filtered out using the designed pipeline.

In the final phase of the pipeline, the accession numbers for each viral isolate with the nucleotide sequences, the associated protein sequences, the collection dates, and the country of collection were stored in SQLite relational database where they were indexed with unique identifiers to allow the retrieval and analysis of any part of the parsed data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Frequency of data updates</title><p>As of July 2022, the described sources are monitored daily for updates.

At present, over 6.4 million SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected all over the world are available from GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sars-cov-2/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sars-cov-2/</ext-link>), which were used for analysis of 26 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the structural (spike, envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid) proteins, non-structural proteins (NSPs), and ORFs. Note, our analysis was performed with the first reported (‘Wuhan’) SARS-CoV-2 sequence as a reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). In other words, the computed mutations are calculated in comparison to this reference sequence. The reason for an increase in mutations ahead of a surge is the search for adaptation against the acquired immunity (or gain in function) in either a single protein or a combination of proteins. The case of the Omicron variant indicates the development of the most drastic changes in several different proteins, which coincided with the largest increase in rate of infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Non-synonymous mutations (K<sub>a</sub>) in several proteins show significant increase before the increase in rate of infections (or surges), therefore, allowing a means for surge prediction.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 proteins increase before COVID19 surges.</title><p>Non-synonymous mutations over the course of the COVID19 outbreak were identified by analysis of 6.4 million sequences.

In particular, the commonly used non-synonymous to synonymous mutations ratio, K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>s</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and the rate of mutations (derivative of observed number of mutations with respect to time) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) were also investigated in detail for suitability as a signal for surge prediction. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>s</sub> did not provide a reliable surge prediction signal. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> shows rate of mutations (calculated as a numerical derivative). For the case of Omicron surge, the proteins did show increased rate of mutations, however, for all other cases a clear signal was absent. Furthermore, the rate of mutations approach presented two additional challenges. First, a number of instances were observed where the rate of mutations increased but did not show increase in reported infections (false positive signal). Second, the nature of incoming genomic data is generally noisy (due to smaller number of samples and weighting of different mutations shows large variations) and changes quickly, therefore, the ongoing most recent rate of mutations is very noisy as well. It was concluded that at this stage, rate (derivative) of mutations is not a reliable signal for surge prediction. In the future, this could be revisited with more stable reporting of genomic sequences with shorter sample collection to sequence publication timeframes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> presents side-by-side comparison of the metrics investigated. Overall, it appears that collective non-synonymous mutations (K<sub>a</sub>) provides the most reliable signal for surge prediction.

Viral sequences show significant changes in synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein (188,166 unique sequences observed so far), with large increases ahead of the surge in reported human infections, most noticeably with the surges associated with the Gamma/Delta and the Omicron variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It is important to note that the mutations show increase 10–14 days before the increase in human infections. It is also interesting to note that the synonymous mutations (data available on the website) show decrease post surges. The decrease in mutations prior to the Omicron BA.2 surge corresponds to reversal mutations (returning to reference sequence). However, at present the non-synonymous and synonymous mutations post the Omicron variant remain elevated, more so than any period during the COVID19 outbreak.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Proteins showing significant mutations</title><p>In addition to the spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Lu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, 11,338 unique sequences observed so far) and envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, 1314 unique sequences observed so far) proteins have also shown significant mutations, starting just before the Omicron variant (November 2021 onward). For the case of membrane protein, there was a significant increase that started in the Gamma/Delta variants (June 2021 onward) and further increased just before the BA.5 surge. The spike, membrane, and envelope proteins are all located on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially interact with the components of the immune system. The large increase in mutations in all these external proteins assumes importance in post-vaccination period (discussed further below).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Other proteins</title><p>For comparison, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows mutations from RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP, 60,575 unique sequences observed so far), which has been targeted for development of antiviral drug therapies. Till present, RDRP has shown comparatively lower magnitude of non-synonymous mutations. Note that gray dots are individual mutations, the mean (black line) is weighted by number of sequences for each day by the mutations. Significant increases in mutations are also observed in NSPs 1, 4, 6, 13, 15, ORFs 6, 7a, and 7b (data available on the project website). Overall, this analysis allows us to monitor ongoing mutations in different proteins; when rapid rise is observed over a short period of time, we issue surveillance watches and warnings (reserved for most extreme cases) for new possible variants with combination of proteins showing new mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Vaccination and mutational frequencies</title><p>Widespread vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (December 2020 onward) coincides with significant increase in mutation rates of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Spike, membrane, and envelope proteins have shown rapid mutations especially in the Omicron variant (gray dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This is possibly due to viral adaptations under the selective pressure exerted by the vaccine, as a significant number of mutations were observed in 2021, especially for the spike protein (gray dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> indicate spike protein has mutated much more than any other protein). The long-term effectiveness of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines remains unknown. After the initial regimen of two doses, the administration of additional booster (third and fourth) doses has decreased due to improvement in COVID19 fatality rates as well as political reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Sabahelzain et al., 2021</xref>). This situation raises concerns. Other proteins have shown reversal mutations (higher similarity with the reference sequence) after periods of significant increase in mutations, however, post vaccination the significant mutations observed in the spike, envelope, and membrane protein related to the Omicron variant remain at extremely elevated levels. As Omicron, BA.2, BA.5, and subsequent variants are showing increased rates of transmission, gain or improvement of function in other proteins could lead to emergence of newer variants of concern. Over long term this needs to be addressed by vaccines with longer periods of effectiveness and post-infection treatment options including antiviral drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Surge prediction</title><p>The methodology presented here allows monitoring the potential increase in reported number of human infections. To date, spike protein has shown the most direct correlation in the rate of non-synonymous mutations and the rates of human infection. In particular, in the case of Omicron variant and also the Gamma variant, spike protein showed rapid increase in mutations about 10–14 days ahead of time. Furthermore, membrane protein showed rapid mutations before surge related to BA.5. Therefore, such increase in mutations serves as an indication of upcoming surges. For example, we issued a surge watch on the website on June 29, 2022, which was converted to a warning on July 14. This was confirmed by increase in infection cases worldwide throughout July (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Further, we issued an additional warning on September 7, 2022, which was confirmed by surge in several European countries, including France, United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>The role of different (or dominant) SARS-CoV-2 variants in major surges is unclear at this time and needs further research. Different variants have been prevalent in different geographic regions at different times over the course of COVID19 outbreak, therefore, it is difficult to assign the surges to individual variants. In particular, Gamma and Delta variants were both prevalent in different countries in 2021. We are working on enabling this analysis by geographic locations and the results will be available through the website. However, at present our analysis is able to make predictions about collective surges before they occur, as illustrated by the case of BA.5.</p><p>In the future, a number of factors could affect the performance of the presented approach. In particular, as the pandemic situation has improved in the second half of 2022, the number of tests being performed and the sequences being deposited into public repositories have decreased. Furthermore, it is widely being discussed that the population is showing increased immunity against the virus due to vaccination and naturally acquired immunity. The presented approach is dependent on availability of sequences, therefore, we hope that scientific community will continue to urge the medical community and public health agencies to commit resources to sequencing the samples from COVID19 positive patients on a regular basis. Nonetheless, even with availability of smaller number of sequences, our approach is weighted by mutations and percentage of sequences showing non-synonymous mutations. Therefore, whenever new mutations show up in large percentages, our approach will still be able to work. On the other hand, viruses continue to evolve and if the population acquires large-scale immunity leading to drastic reduction in number of infections, our surveillance approach would still allow preparation in cases of significant viral genome changes (such as going from SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2) whenever they occur and lead to the possibility of another major outbreak.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The methodology and the website described here provide real-time mutational changes of 26 SARS-CoV-2 proteins and ORFs. The changes in non-synonymous mutations correlate with the increase in reported cases of infections. Apart from identifying mutations of concern for in-depth scientific studies, the website is intended to keep the medical community informed about potential upcoming surges. Warnings of increase in mutations and expected surges are displayed on the website (and also available through email alerts). It should be noted that this real-time analysis is dependent on the various health labs and medical facilities for swiftly depositing the viral genome sequences into the public databases such as the GenBank. The shorter the lag time in depositing the sequences by the wider community, more accurate and effective the prediction capabilities of our approach and the website will be.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Founder and owner of Arium BioLabs LLC</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-82980-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All sequences used in this work are available from GenBank.

The manuscript itself doesn't make any firm conclusions as to which protein or set of proteins is the most predictive. The claim of 14 days is hard to verify from the data provided in Figure 1 and is likely restricted to the detection of the Omicron variant. Furthermore, the method does not do a good job of predicting the variants evolving from the Omicron variant, suggesting that the baseline comparison needs to be refreshed. Given that the authors' focus is on infectivity, perhaps a more targeted focus at receptor binding domains of the spike protein may provide a more robust method, similarly providing comparisons based on major locations of the world (e.g. US, Europe, South Africa, India) might provide cleaner data as it could detect the local emergence of strains. The authors should also discuss the usefulness of such an approach in light of increased population immunity and decline in testing, which will negate the advantage of sequencing over case detection.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82980.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Update the manuscript to include recent prediction/performance data on the Omicron variants.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the manuscript with the most up to date data available.

The manuscript itself doesn't make any firm conclusions as to which protein or set of proteins is the most predictive. The claim of 14 days is hard to verify from the data provided in Figure 1 and is likely restricted to the detection of the Omicron variant. Furthermore, the method does not do a good job of predicting the variants evolving from the Omicron variant, suggesting that the baseline comparison needs to be refreshed. Given that the authors' focus is on infectivity, perhaps a more targeted focus at receptor binding domains of the spike protein may provide a more robust method, similarly providing comparisons based on major locations of the world (e.g. US, Europe, South Africa, India) might provide cleaner data as it could detect the local emergence of strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for very insightful feed-back. Like the reviewer we are extremely focused on rigor, validation and reproducibility of our approach. The reviewer mentions a number of interesting points. Our responses (in sequential order) are provided below:</p><p>1. Regarding the approach being too preliminary, as mentioned in response to the other reviewer, our approach has been successful as prediction issued in September (while this manuscript was in review) was validated by surge in number of cases in several European countries. We would very much like to immediately validate this approach more thoroughly, however, unlike the lab studies which could be addressed by additional experiments, we are dependent on the incoming data with the evolution of this pandemic. Our warnings from June and September have been validated and we are confident that this approach and website will help the medical and research community. We will continue to refine the approach.</p><p>2. Conclusion about which set of proteins: Based on the data so far, we do not believe that a single protein or few proteins will cause new surges (as discussed in the manuscript). Analysis reveals that any protein with new mutations could cause surges. Therefore, our website presents data on all SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We are concerned regarding making conclusions based on a limited set of proteins, as this could be detrimental to the cause and possibly miss the surges driven by other proteins.</p><p>3. 14-days: Please see the plots in response to Reviewer 1. We issued a warning on September 7<sup>th</sup> and the cases started rising in the middle to late September. We believe additional surges would provide us more confidence.</p><p>4. Limited to Omicron variant: We believe the reason for this is that a lot more sequences became available. It is not a limitation of the approach but rather a limitation due to the availability of data.</p><p>5. Predicting the evolution of variants: This is a very interesting point. If we understood this comment correctly, reviewer is asking if we could predict the emergence of new variants. Even though it is very much possible but prediction of new variants (through mutational adaptations) was not the focus of the current study. But we will keep this suggestion in mind for ongoing studies. However, if the comment was regarding making surge predictions for Omicron sub-variants, new data has now been included in the revised manuscript. We thank the review for this suggestion.</p><p>6. Baseline comparison needs to be refreshed: If we understood correctly, the suggestion is to change the reference sequence from the Wuhan sequence to another appropriate sequence. We have been wondering about this ourselves (as noted in the original manuscript). However, the question is which one? The answer is not clear to us immediately as there are multiple variants prevalent across the world. We are keeping an eye on literature and if there is an obvious candidate, we will in future shift to a new reference sequence. In the meantime, we are also exploring the use of different reference sequences for different countries.</p><p>7. Receptor binding domains: As mentioned above, the approach is meant to be general and not tied to a particular protein. We are afraid that focusing on a single protein or a domain will miss out on the future breakouts. We continue to list more interesting mutations on all SARS-CoV-2 proteins in our warnings. If data suggests that one single protein or a domain is highly indicative of the surges in the future, we will publish an update.</p><p>8. Different locations and countries: This is a great point! As per reviewer’s suggestion we have enabled the infrastructure on our website. We have listed the charts associated with the US on the website (under the section More Charts in the top navigation menu). However, we found that the GenBank does not have sufficient number of sequences from other countries to provide the resolution needed. Therefore, we are working on enabling the real time analysis of the GISAID data. However, we found that the sequences in GISAID vary extremely widely in quality. Since we are aiming for high quality and reproducible studies (as both reviewers also suggest), we do not feel comfortable at this stage in including the results for different countries in the main manuscript. But reviewer’s point is a great one and we have built the infrastructure for geographic break-down analysis and the results will be continually added to the project website once quality control is considered satisfactory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also discuss the usefulness of such an approach in light of increased population immunity and decline in testing, which will negate the advantage of sequencing over case detection.</p></disp-quote><p>Done. This is another interesting point. We have added a new paragraph in the manuscript at the end of Results section. Briefly, as widely discussed in the community, the immunity (across the population) is being developed. However, new variants keep on emerging. Therefore, it is important to monitor new mutations in all proteins. The decrease in testing is not optimal. We are hopeful, our results will encourage medical community and public policy makers to continue testing. In the meantime, we believe the ratio of sequences showing new mutations compared to no mutations for the same day (or the same week) will continue to be useful, even though the overall sequences being reported may go down.</p><p>Once again we thank the reviewer for all the insights and great suggestions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
