Also, it remains unclear which metabolic mechanisms become indispensable for persister cell survival. To address these questions, we directed our efforts towards persister cells in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> that emerge during the late stationary phase. These cells have been recognized for their exceptional resilience and are commonly believed to be in a dormant state. Our results indicate that the global metabolic regulator Crp/cAMP redirects the metabolism of these antibiotic-tolerant cells from anabolism to oxidative phosphorylation. Although our data demonstrates that persisters exhibit a reduced metabolic rate compared to rapidly growing exponential-phase cells, their survival still relies on energy metabolism. Extensive genomic-level analyses of metabolomics, proteomics, and single-gene deletions consistently highlight the critical role of energy metabolism, specifically the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, electron transport chain (ETC), and ATP synthase, in sustaining persister levels within cell populations. Altogether, this study provides much-needed clarification regarding the role of energy metabolism in antibiotic tolerance and highlights the importance of using a multipronged approach at the genomic level to obtain a broader picture of the metabolic state of persister cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>persisters</kwd><kwd>energy metabolism</kwd><kwd>Crp/cAMP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2044375</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orman</surname><given-names>Mehmet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI143643</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orman</surname><given-names>Mehmet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CRP/cAMP plays a crucial role in the metabolic shift of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> persisters from an anabolic state to oxidative phosphorylation, which is essential for their survival during antibiotic treatment.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial persisters within cell cultures constitute a small subpopulation of cells exhibiting a transient antibiotic-tolerant state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>). While persisters have traditionally been characterized as non-growing and dormant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lewis, 2010</xref>), recent studies challenge these conventional hallmarks, revealing the heterogeneity of persister cells in terms of growth, metabolism, and other cellular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arnoldini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hossain et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mok et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orman and Brynildsen, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wakamoto et al., 2013</xref>). Despite potential discrepancies in research outcomes in the field, we think that these variations arise from the intricate and diverse survival mechanisms employed by bacterial cells in response to adverse conditions, such as antibiotic treatments. Furthermore, the interplay of stochastic and deterministic factors associated with these mechanisms adds another layer of complexity, with outcomes highly contingent on factors such as cell types, antibiotics, and experimental and growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Michiels et al., 2016</xref>). The persistence phenomenon presents a significant health concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huemer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray et al., 2022</xref>), as the transient antibiotic-tolerant state of persister cells promotes recurrent infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>) and establishes them as a reservoir for the emergence of antibiotic-resistant mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barrett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levin-Reisman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Windels et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Drug tolerance is a widespread phenomenon observed in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell types. Otto Warburg’s research in the early 20th century unveiled an intriguing aspect of mammalian cell metabolism known as ‘aerobic glycolysis’, wherein proliferating cells (e.g. tumor cells) derive energy predominantly through glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Warburg, 1925</xref>). This metabolic reprogramming involves restricting entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle through precise enzymatic control, diverting glycolytic intermediates towards anabolic pathways. This adaptation supports the extensive biosynthesis required for active cell proliferation in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Remarkably, tumorigenic persisters that exist in a non-proliferating state may not primarily depend on aerobic glycolysis. Instead, there is substantial evidence suggesting that these cells rely on energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Porporato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vasan et al., 2020</xref>); however, the presence of this metabolic state in antibiotic-tolerant bacteria is still a question mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>). Reprogramming energy metabolism seems to be an evolutionarily conserved strategy for cells facing stress or adverse conditions, as these cells might benefit from the significantly higher ATP production efficiency provided by oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). The identification of a mechanism shared by diverse cell types could open avenues for the development of global strategies to target drug-tolerant cells effectively.</p><p>A recent study suggests that bacterial persisters constitute a stochastically formed subpopulation of low-energy cells, despite some observed overlap in ATP levels between antibiotic-sensitive and persister cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manuse et al., 2021</xref>). The persister cells examined in that study were derived from an aged stationary phase culture (48 hr post-inoculation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manuse et al., 2021</xref>), a condition known to elevate the number of non-growing cells, which do not promptly resume growth upon transfer to a fresh medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohiuddin et al., 2020b</xref>). While the non-growing cells formed during the stationary phase have reduced metabolic activity compared to growing cells, as demonstrated in our earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orman and Brynildsen, 2013a</xref>), they still exhibit a certain degree of respiratory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>). In a recent study measuring ATP levels in viable but non-culturable (VBNC; a phenotype that is antibiotic tolerant but unable to resume growth after antibiotic removal), persister and antibiotic-sensitive cells from 24 hr stationary phase cultures, a significant overlap in intracellular ATP concentrations was observed between antibiotic-sensitive and persister cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2024</xref>). On the other hand, VBNC cells exhibited drastically lower ATP levels compared to both persister and antibiotic-sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2024</xref>). Another independent study, which utilized single-cell analysis, reported that ofloxacin persisters were metabolically active cells in exponentially growing cultures before treatment, and these cultures were obtained from 16 hr overnight precultures (not aged; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goormaghtigh and Van Melderen, 2019</xref>). These findings suggest that while persisters formed during exponential growth may initially retain metabolic activity, they may gradually transition to reduced energy states as they age within the culture. The nature of persister-cell metabolism in bacteria is a topic that has long been a point of contention in scientific circles. The controversy surrounding this topic primarily arises from studies that rely on bacteriostatic chemicals or a limited number of gene deletions, or direct comparisons to exponentially growing cells, all of which have inherent drawbacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conlon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manuse et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orman and Brynildsen, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>). The metabolism of persister cells, a very complex phenomenon, cannot be easily characterized by a simplistic term such as ‘metabolic dormancy’. Even if persister cells may exhibit a lower metabolism compared to the vast majority of rapidly growing exponential-phase cells, they may still rely on energy metabolism for their functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prax and Bertram, 2014</xref>). In fact, analyzing published studies collectively suggests that bacterial cell metabolism undergoes intricate alterations or rewiring as they transition into a tolerant state, and these alterations seem to be highly dependent on the specific conditions tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arnoldini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mok et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orman and Brynildsen, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wakamoto et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To gain a better understanding of the critical role of energy metabolism in persister cell survival, we have focused our research on antibiotic-tolerant cells formed during the stationary phase, given that these cells are known to be highly resilient and capable of surviving a variety of stressors, including antibiotics, and are assumed to be dormant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>). These cells are also referred to as type I persisters, which cannot readily resume growth when diluted in fresh media during the lag phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>). Previous studies showed that these persister cells can metabolize specific carbon sources that make them susceptible to aminoglycosides (AG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mok et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orman and Brynildsen, 2013b</xref>). Their AG susceptibility is due to increased AG uptake, which is facilitated by increased electron transport chain (ETC) activity and membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allison et al., 2011</xref>). The presence of active energy metabolism in antibiotic-tolerant, non-growing cells may indeed explain their rapid killing by AG in the presence of carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orman and Brynildsen, 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>). When the knockout strains of global transcriptional regulators (i.e. ArcA, Cra, Crp, DksA, Fnr, Lrp, and RpoS) were screened using the AG potentiation assay in our previous study. The results showed that the panel of carbon sources tested potentiated the AG killing of tolerant cells derived from most knockout strains, except for Δ<italic>crp</italic> and Δ<italic>cyaA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mok et al., 2015a</xref>). This can be attributed to the lack of active energy metabolism in these mutant strains, as the Crp/cAMP potentially shapes persister cell metabolism during the stationary phase. Depletion of primary carbon sources activates adenylate cyclase (CyaA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pastan and Perlman, 1970</xref>), increasing cyclic-AMP (cAMP) levels in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bettenbrock et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2006</xref>). The cAMP molecules, along with their receptor protein (Crp), activate genes related to the catabolism of secondary carbon sources, potentially supporting cellular functions and energy levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deutscher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Görke and Stülke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kolb et al., 1993</xref>). Here, using metabolomics, proteomics, and high-throughput screening of single-gene deletion strains, we have provided evidence that the Crp/cAMP regulatory complex maintains an active state of energy metabolism while downregulating anabolic pathways in the antibiotic-tolerant persister cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Disruption of the Crp/cAMP complex affects the formation of persister cells at the late stationary phase</title><p>Since Crp/cAMP-mediated metabolic changes can be induced by nutrient depletion during the stationary phase, we wanted to assess the effects of deleting the <italic>crp</italic> and <italic>cyaA</italic> genes (Δ<italic>crp</italic> and Δ<italic>cyaA</italic>) on both persister cell formation and metabolism during this phase. As anticipated, the deletion of the <italic>cyaA</italic> gene resulted in a notable reduction in intracellular cAMP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the Δ<italic>crp</italic> strain exhibited an increase in cAMP concentration, potentially due to the negative feedback regulatory mechanism of the Crp/cAMP complex for the <italic>cyaA</italic> gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keseler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Majerfeld et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). When comparing the growth curves of <italic>E. coli</italic> wild-type (WT), Δ<italic>crp</italic>, and Δ<italic>cyaA</italic> main cultures under identical conditions studied here (see Materials and methods), all three strains started to enter the stationary phase around 5 hr, with the mutant strains exhibiting slightly lower optical density levels than the WT at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Also, our data provide evidence of an increase in cAMP levels in WT cells during their transition into the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), aligning with existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bettenbrock et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keseler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2006</xref>). For type I persister quantification, we diluted cells in the fresh medium, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>), at early (t=5 hr) and late (t=24 hr) stationary phases and subsequently exposed them to an extended period (20 hr) of ampicillin or ofloxacin treatment (200 μg/mL ampicillin and 5 μg/mL ofloxacin). These treatments were carried out at concentrations surpassing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), necessary for the selection of antibiotic-tolerant persister cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keren et al., 2004a</xref>). Also, type I persisters, formed during the stationary phase, exhibit a slow transition from a non-growing state to an active state when transferred to a fresh medium in the lag phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jõers and Tenson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vulin et al., 2018</xref>); therefore, this transition requires longer antibiotic treatment durations. Moreover, we transferred an equal number of cells from each strain to the fresh medium to ensure consistency in cell numbers. To assess persistence, we collected samples during antibiotic treatment, washed them to remove antibiotics, and plated them on agar media to quantify colony-forming units (CFU) of surviving cells (see Materials and methods). The resulting biphasic kill curves—plots of CFU levels over treatment time—are characteristic of persistence phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Notably, the WT strain showed a marked increase in both ampicillin- and ofloxacin-persister cells during the late stationary phase, in contrast to the mutant strains, where no such increase was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). However, this trend was not observed in the early stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). To confirm that the observed decrease in persister levels in the mutant strains in the late stationary phase is solely attributed to the perturbation of the Crp/cAMP regulatory network, we reintroduced <italic>crp</italic> expression to the Δ<italic>crp</italic> strain using a low-copy plasmid carrying the <italic>crp</italic> gene and its promoter. As a control, we utilized an empty vector of the same plasmid. The results demonstrated that the expression of <italic>crp</italic> restored the persister level in the mutant strain, while the plasmid itself had no impact on persister levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A, B</xref>). Altogether, these findings highlight the significant role of Crp/cAMP in ampicillin and ofloxacin persister formation in the late stationary phase.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Crp/cAMP regulation of persister cell formation in the stationary phase.</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 WT and mutant cells at early (t=5 hr) and late (t=24 hr) stationary phases were transferred to fresh medium with antibiotics for persister cell quantification.

This assay provided us with the ability to monitor non-growing cells at a single-cell resolution, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orman and Brynildsen, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roostalu et al., 2008</xref>).

The cells were then inoculated into a fresh medium without IPTG, and their growth was analyzed with a flow cytometer. This allowed us to track the dilution of mCherry protein within the cells, which served as an indicator of cell proliferation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, initially, all cells exhibited high red fluorescence. However, as cells underwent division, the red fluorescence of the overall population decreased in the absence of the inducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

The reduced capacity of stationary-phase WT cells to initiate proliferation upon transfer to a fresh medium suggests the possible presence of an extended lag phase in these cells. To investigate this, we employed flow cytometry to precisely quantify cell numbers and generate growth curves for both WT and mutant strains. As anticipated, the growth curve of the WT strain displayed a slower initial growth rate and a prolonged lag phase duration compared to the mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Conversely, the mutant strains displayed a shorter lag phase, yet they demonstrated an increased doubling time in the exponential phase compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which was also anticipated, considering their decreased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation due to TCA cycle inhibition. Altogether, these results provide additional support and validation for the findings from our metabolomics and proteomics data, as our data reveals a correlation between the abundance of molecules associated with cell division and the ability of the stationary phase cells to resume growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Persister cells rely on energy metabolism</title><p>The Crp/cAMP-mediated metabolic state, characterized by increased respiration in WT compared to mutant strains, was further validated using redox sensor green (RSG) dye and a reporter plasmid measuring the promoter activity of succinate:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) genes. The SQR reporter system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zaslaver et al., 2006</xref>) employs green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression, regulated by the promoter of the SQR operon, which includes the <italic>sdhA</italic>, <italic>sdhB</italic>, <italic>sdhC</italic>, and <italic>sdhD</italic> subunit genes. The SQR complex plays a vital role in cellular metabolism by catalyzing the oxidation of succinate to fumarate concurrently with the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol, thus directly linking the TCA cycle with the respiratory ETC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keseler et al., 2005</xref>). Our results indicate an upregulation of the SQR promoter activity in WT cells compared to the mutant strains in the stationary phase, validating the findings from our metabolomics and proteomics data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The RSG dye, on the other hand, serves as a well-established metabolic indicator, measuring bacterial oxidation-reduction activity, a crucial function involving the ETC driven by the TCA cycle. Once reduced by bacterial reductases, the RSG dye emits a stable green fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our data demonstrate that the redox activities of WT cells are much higher and more heterogeneous compared to those of the mutant strains in the late stationary phase, further corroborating the results from our preceding analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, we utilized a methodology that integrates the mCherry expression system, flow cytometry, and ampicillin-mediated cell lysis to determine whether persister cells in WT still maintain their respiration. In this assay, both the WT and mutant strains carrying the mCherry expression system were exposed to ampicillin after transferring them to a fresh medium. The inducer was added to both growth and treatment cultures to sustain the cells' red signals. Unlike other antibiotics, ampicillin disrupts cell wall synthesis, leading to the lysis of cells upon their resumption of growth. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, the cells that were lysed lost their mCherry signals. On the other hand, the resilient, tolerant cells that evaded ampicillin-induced lysis maintained their mCherry levels throughout the treatment. In the mutant strains, ampicillin was effective in lysing almost all cells as anticipated, leaving no or a small number of intact cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, in the WT strain, we detected a subpopulation of intact cells throughout the entire treatment period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). While the population-level redox activities of these tolerant intact cells in WT are lower than those of exponential phase cells, they still displayed a significant increase in RSG levels compared to cell populations before antibiotic treatments or untreated control cells subjected to identical conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>)<bold>,</bold> suggesting that they maintain steady-state energy metabolism. We want to highlight that not all intact cells in the WT strain reported here are persisters. A significant portion comprises 'viable but non-culturable' (VBNC) cells, and WT cells exhibit markedly higher VBNC levels than Δ<italic>crp</italic> and Δ<italic>cyaA</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).

To further underscore the importance of energy metabolism, we conducted a high-throughput screening of 149 different <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 BW25113 mutant strains from the Keio knockout library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baba et al., 2006</xref>).

However, the mutant strains exhibited reduced tolerance to both antibiotics compared to the control <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 BW25113 WT strain, which was found to be largely associated with the TCA pathway (<italic>sucA, sucB, lpd, sucC, sucD, sdhA, sdhB, sdhC, sdhD, gltA, acnB, aceE, fumA, mdh</italic> and <italic>fumC</italic>), ETC (<italic>nuoB, nuoC, nuoI, nuoK, nuoM,</italic> and <italic>narV</italic>), ATP synthesis (<italic>atpA, atpB, atpC, atpD, atpE,</italic> and <italic>atpH</italic>), and mixed acid fermentation pathways (<italic>ldhA, fdhF, pta, adhE,</italic> and <italic>frdC</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We acknowledge that the Keio strains were generated in a high-throughput manner, and there might be unknown errors in their genomic DNA. To ensure the reproducibility of our findings, we generated knockout strains for key genes associated with the TCA, ETC, ATP synthase, glycolysis, and pentose phosphate pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> for detailed description of genes). We then tested their antibiotic tolerance, and our results were consistent with the omics data and screening outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), confirming the critical role of energy metabolism, specifically the TCA cycle, ETC, and ATP synthase, in bacterial persistence. We note that equal numbers of cells from each strain were transferred into antibiotic treatment media to ensure consistency in cell numbers, and no significant growth deficiencies or differences in cell density were observed in the late stationary phase of the knockout strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study highlights the crucial role of the Crp/cAMP complex in maintaining the metabolic state of stationary-phase persister cells, enabling their survival under adverse conditions. Through metabolomics, proteomics, and high-throughput screening of single-gene deletion strains, we substantiated that the Crp/cAMP regulatory complex sustains an active respiratory state while downregulating anabolic pathways in persister cells. This respiratory state is vital for the survival of persister cells, as perturbing the Crp/cAMP complex or respiration significantly reduced persister phenotypes, which may explain the previously reported decrease in antibiotic tolerance in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells cultured under anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>). Notably, we observed an upregulation of anabolic metabolites and proteins when the Crp/cAMP regulatory complex was perturbed, particularly those associated with cell wall organization, cell cycle, and cell division, enhancing the ability of stationary-phase mutant cells to resume growth. Although the literature has shown associations between antibiotic tolerance with proteins involved in cell division and the TCA cycle (e.g. SdhA, SucB, Mdh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luidalepp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2019</xref>), our study establishes a strong link between these critical cellular processes and the Crp/cAMP complex, providing much-needed clarity in the field. In fact, upon investigating Crp/cAMP regulons via the Ecocyc database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keseler et al., 2005</xref>), we identified that certain metabolic genes, deleted in our <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 background, are potentially regulated by Crp/cAMP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), providing additional support for the validity of our omics results.</p><p>We acknowledge that our metabolomic and proteomic data were obtained at the whole-population level, rather than from isolated persister cells. Fluorescent reporters combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) have been utilized to study persister cells, including in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orman and Brynildsen, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>). However, this approach only enriches for persisters rather than isolating a pure population, as persisters still constitute a small fraction of the sorted cells. Despite these limitations, our population-level analyses provide valuable insights into the role of the Crp/cAMP complex in regulating non-growing cell formation and persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We further validated these findings through single-gene deletions and flow cytometry-based assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), confirming a consistent reduction in both non-growing and persister cells in Crp/cAMP-deficient strains.</p><p>The deletion of <italic>cyaA</italic> resulted in a reduction of cAMP levels, as expected given the role of the CyaA enzyme in cAMP synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Conversely, the removal of <italic>crp</italic> led to an increase in cAMP levels compared to those in wild-type cells. Notably, this increase is statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although this is an interesting observation, it is likely due to the feedback regulation of the Crp/cAMP complex on <italic>cyaA</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aiba, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keseler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Majerfeld et al., 1981</xref>). Specifically, disruption of Crp function is expected to derepress the <italic>cyaA</italic> promoter (P<italic><sub>cyaA</sub></italic>), leading to increased CyaA expression and elevated cAMP levels. To test this, we employed a P<italic><sub>cyaA</sub>-gfp</italic> reporter plasmid (pMSs201) in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 WT, Δ<italic>crp</italic>, and Δ<italic>cyaA</italic> strains to monitor promoter activity. As anticipated, deletion of <italic>crp</italic> led to enhanced <italic>gfp</italic> expression, confirming that Crp/cAMP negatively regulates <italic>cyaA</italic> expression via feedback. These results clarify the observed cAMP differences and support the regulatory role of the Crp/cAMP complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in metabolism (measured by RSG) among WT stationary phase cells, contrasting with the more uniform behavior observed in Δ<italic>crp</italic> and Δ<italic>cyaA</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also demonstrated the presence of two distinct populations in WT cells during the late stationary phase: one that resumes rapid growth and another subpopulation that does not resume growth when transferred to a fresh medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The absence of this non-growing cell subpopulation in the mutant strains could account for their sensitivity to AGs. However, the mechanism by which AGs kill these non-growing cells in the WT strain remains perplexing. The underlying reasons might be linked to their metabolism, as AG uptake is an energy-requiring process, relying on the electron flow through membrane-bound respiratory chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allison et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, persister cells obtained from various antibiotics, such as ampicillin and ofloxacin, in WT <italic>E. coli</italic> were previously found to exhibit sensitivity to AGs when sugar molecules were introduced into the cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orman and Brynildsen, 2013b</xref>). However, the enhanced sensitivity mediated by sugar molecules was reversed to its original state in a subsequent study when the Crp/cAMP complex was genetically perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mok et al., 2015a</xref>). This can be attributed to the lack of active energy metabolism in these genetically altered strains, as suggested by our comprehensive genomic-level analyses here. While the absence of cell division in non-growing cell subpopulations in WT may suggest a downregulation in anabolic metabolism, their energy metabolism may remain partially active, which could potentially explain the phenomenon of AG potentiation. Indeed, our results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> support this interpretation.</p><p>Antibiotics are generally effective against proliferating bacteria, leading to the notions that tolerance is linked to temporary growth suppression and that persister cells are dormant phenotypes with repressed metabolism. Although persister cells are generally considered to have reduced metabolic activity compared to exponentially growing cells, their survival may still depend on energy metabolism. Also, the direct comparison of persister cell metabolism to that of exponentially growing cells may not be the best approach. Growing cells have a very high energy output and consume metabolites at a fast pace. Therefore, any comparison between tolerant and non-tolerant cell populations requires proper normalization techniques such as adjusting cellular metabolic activities to the amount of substrate utilized by cells. An example of this normalization was conducted by Heinemann’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Radzikowski et al., 2016</xref>), demonstrating that ATP production rates per substrate in tolerant cells exceed those of exponentially growing cells.</p><p>We diluted cells in fresh medium at early and late stationary phases before antibiotic treatments. This step is essential for quantifying type I persisters, as these cells do not readily resume growth upon dilution in the fresh medium during the lag phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>). We acknowledge that antibiotic tolerance is influenced by various factors, including culture dilutions, media, specific strains, antibiotics tested, treatment durations, and the growth phase during treatment administration. These factors may contribute to variations in reported persister levels observed in the Δ<italic>cyaA</italic> strain during the exponential phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molina-Quiroz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parsons et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sulaiman and Lam, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamasaki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zeng et al., 2022a</xref>). To assess how <italic>cyaA</italic> and <italic>crp</italic> deletions affect antibiotic responses under conditions similar to those used by Zeng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zeng et al., 2022b</xref>) —specifically, exponential-phase <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 strains (Keio collection), lower antibiotic concentrations, and short treatments (e.g. 1 hr)—we first tested <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 WT, Δ<italic>crp</italic>, and Δ<italic>cyaA</italic> strains in late stationary phase using reduced antibiotic concentrations and shorter exposures. Both knockouts showed decreased survival following ampicillin and ofloxacin treatment compared to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>), consistent with our findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In the exponential phase, the knockout strains exhibited reduced survival after ampicillin treatment but increased survival after ofloxacin treatment relative to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7A</xref>), again mirroring the trends in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Gentamicin treatment, however, produced variable results in MG1655 knockouts, likely due to the brief 1 hr exposure being insufficient for robust conclusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7A</xref>). Notably, when we tested the corresponding Keio knockout strains in the BW25113 background, we observed increased tolerance in exponential-phase cells, reproducing Zeng et al.’s findings under their specific conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7B</xref>), although BW25113 and MG1655 exhibited distinct persister phenotypes in exponential phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7A and B</xref>). These results, altogether, highlight the sensitivity of antibiotic tolerance and persistence phenotypes to factors such as strain background, antibiotic concentration, and treatment duration.</p><p>While we did not focus on the exponential growth phase in our study, it is noteworthy that the reduced growth rate during this phase in the mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) may explain the antibiotic tolerance observed in previous studies involving the <italic>cyaA</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molina-Quiroz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sulaiman and Lam, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamasaki et al., 2020</xref>). The growth disparity noted between mutant and WT strains, particularly evident around 5 hr in our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), may also be linked to the ofloxacin persisters observed in the mutant strains at this specific time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While slow cell growth may indeed correlate with bacterial persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaldalu and Tenson, 2019</xref>), it is important to note that the persistence associated with perturbations of metabolic genes cannot be solely attributed to the slow growth. In fact, the persistence of these mutant strains should depend on many factors (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) as reported by diverse research groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luidalepp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pandey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Spoering et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zalis et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, in <italic>E. coli</italic>, TCA inactivation was shown to decrease ampicillin and ofloxacin persistence during the lag phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>), yet it enhances gentamicin tolerance in the exponential phase, which remains unexplained by factors such as cell growth, redox activities, proton motive force (PMF), or ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shiraliyev and Orman, 2023</xref>). Furthermore, gene deletions often trigger pleiotropic effects, leading to unique tolerance mechanisms not evident in wild-type strains. In our Keio screening data analysis, we observed that the deletion of <italic>icd</italic> appeared to enhance persistence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), in line with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manuse et al., 2021</xref>). The <italic>icd</italic> gene encodes a TCA cycle enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase. While it remains unclear whether this observed outcome is attributable to other unseen pleiotropic effects stemming from the <italic>icd</italic> deletion, our data consistently indicates that the most significant reduction in persistence levels occurs with disruptions in energy metabolism. A comprehensive approach, encompassing omics and knockout screening as presented in this study, offers a more complete understanding, revealing the consensus behavior within the entire metabolic network.</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed to contribute to antibiotic killing; however, our prior work using identical experimental conditions demonstrated that ROS are unlikely to be a major factor in persister formation during the late stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>). In that study, we overexpressed catalytically active antioxidant enzymes, including catalases (KatE, KatG) and superoxide dismutases (SodA, SodB, SodC), yet observed no significant change in persister levels. To further decouple ROS from respiratory activity in that study, we performed anaerobic experiments using nitrate as an alternative terminal electron acceptor. Interestingly, anaerobic respiration enhanced persister formation, and inhibition of nitrate reductases with KCN reduced it—further supporting an ROS-independent mechanism. Together, these findings suggest that under our experimental conditions, it is respiratory activity rather than ROS production that plays a more central role in antibiotic tolerance.</p><p>In conclusion, a significant gap in the current literature is the lack of a comprehensive understanding of how bacterial cell metabolism undergoes changes during the transition to a tolerant state. Identifying the specific metabolic pathways that gain significance for cell survival in this context is crucial. This knowledge can pave the way for the development of more informed and targeted treatment strategies, ultimately enhancing our ability to combat tolerant cells and improve overall treatment outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p>All experiments were conducted using <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 wild-type (WT) and its derivative strains. <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655, MO strains (carrying the mCherry expression system), <italic>hipA7</italic> (high persister strain), and pUA66 plasmids were obtained from Mark P.

Cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm wavelength (OD<sub>600</sub>) using a Varioskan LUX Multimode Microplate Reader (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). The plate reader data was collected using Skanlt Software V 5.0. Cell cultures at both early and late stationary phases were collected from the test tubes and transferred to the baffled flasks to achieve ~5 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL. This concentration represents an approximately 100-fold dilution of the WT main culture into a fresh medium within the flask. It is important to highlight that we consistently employed flow cytometry to quantify the initial cell count (refer to the section ‘Monitoring cell division’ for comprehensive details). As needed, adjustments in cell number-to-volume were executed to ensure the same cell number among both WT and mutant strains. These cultures were then treated with antibiotics at the indicated concentrations and were cultured with shaking at 37 °C for 20 hr. After treatment, a 1  mL sample from each flask was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube for a rigorous washing protocol to minimize antibiotic carryover. The samples were centrifuged at 13,300 RPM (17,000 × <italic>g</italic>) for 3 min, and &gt;950  µL of supernatant was carefully removed without disturbing the pellet. The pellet was then resuspended in 950  µL of PBS, achieving a &gt;20-fold dilution of residual antibiotics. This wash step was repeated once more, resulting in a cumulative &gt;400-fold dilution. After the final wash, cells were resuspended in 100  µL of PBS. A 10  µL aliquot of this suspension was serially diluted in a 96-well round-bottom plate, and 10  µL from each dilution was spotted onto an agar plate. The remaining 90  µL of the sample was also plated to quantify CFU levels around the limit of detection, (~1  CFU/mL).

The cells were then resuspended in 100 μL of cell lysis buffer from the Cyclic AMP XP Assay Kit (Catalog# 4339 S, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) on ice for 10 min. Next, 50 µL of lysed cells was mixed with the kit’s horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked cAMP solution in the cAMP assay plate. This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 3 hr on a plate shaker at 250 rpm. Following the 3 hr incubation, the plate content was discarded, and the plate was washed four times with the kit’s Wash Buffer. Then, 100 µL of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added to allow color development, and after 30 min, 100 µL of the stop solution provided by the kit was added.

Cells were cultured until the early stationary phase and late stationary phase at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. Afterward, cells were collected through centrifugation at 4700 rpm at 37 °C for 15 min, yielding a pellet of approximately 100 μL containing around 10<sup>10</sup> cells. Subsequently, the cells were washed once with 1 X PBS and then centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 3 min at 4 °C). Following this, they were frozen in an ethanol/dry ice bath for 10 min. The extracts from both mutant and WT cells were subjected to analysis using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem accurate mass spectrometry (MS), a process aimed at identifying a wide range of metabolites. Sample extraction, preparation, instrument settings, and conditions for the MS platform adhered to Metabolon’s protocols (as detailed in our previous study) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mohiuddin et al., 2022</xref>). To identify the sample’s metabolites among potential false positives from instrument noise, process artifacts, and redundant ion features, the results were cross-referenced with Metabolon’s extensive metabolite library (standards). Data normalization was carried out based on protein concentration, determined using the Bradford assay. The significant difference between mutant and WT was identified using Welch’s two-sample t-test. Further analysis involved pathway enrichment assessment using MetaboAnalyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2023</xref>). This involved inputting the upregulated and downregulated metabolites based on chosen thresholds. A comprehensive overview of metabolite measurements, pathway enrichment, statistical analyses, and data representations can be found in our previously published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mohiuddin et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Proteomics</title><p>Overnight cultures for both <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 WT and Δ<italic>crp</italic> strains were prepared using 2 mL of LB medium. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C and 250 rpm for 24 hr. The following day, the main cultures were established under the same conditions, using a 1000-fold dilution of the overnight culture in 2 mL fresh LB medium. After 24 hours, the OD<sub>600</sub> of both WT and mutant strains was measured and adjusted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 2.5. For further processing, 2 mL of the main culture was washed twice with cold 1 X PBS, maintaining the cold environment throughout. Centrifugation conditions were set at 4 °C, 13,000 rpm for 3 min. Before the final centrifugation, a cell count was conducted using flow cytometry. This involved using 10 µL of washed culture and 990 µL of 1 X PBS. Subsequent to centrifugation, the pellets were collected. Cell lysis was carried out using 300 µL of NEBExpress <italic>E. coli</italic> Lysis Reagent (Catalog# P8116S, Ipswich, MA, USA) at room temperature for 30 mins. Following this, the lysed samples were centrifuged at 16,600 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and 250 µL of supernatants were collected from each sample for the assay. The total protein concentration of the supernatants was determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Catalog# 23225, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). In a 96-well plate, 25 µL of each cell lysate sample, diluted 5 and 10 times with ultra-pure DI water, were loaded into each well. Subsequently, 200 µL of the BCA working reagent (50:1, Reagent A:B) was added to each well and mixed on a plate shaker for 30 s. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by cooling for 5 min at room temperature, shielded from light. The absorbance was finally measured at 562 nm using a plate reader, and the total protein concentration in each sample was calculated using a standard curve prepared from standard protein solutions. Protein analysis for both WT and mutant was conducted by the proteomics service at UT Health’s Clinical and Translational Proteomics Service Center (Houston, TX). The samples underwent acetone precipitation, during which proteins were precipitated by exposing them to –20 °C for 3 hours. Following this, a centrifugation step at 12,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 min separated the precipitated pellets. These pellets were subsequently subjected to denaturation and reduction using a mixture containing 30 μL of 6 M urea, 20 mM DTT in 150 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 40 min. Afterward, alkylation was carried out with 40 mM iodoacetamide in the absence of light for 30 min. To prepare for digestion, the reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold using 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and then incubated overnight at 37 °C with trypsin at a 1:30 enzyme-to-substrate ratio. The digestion process was terminated by adding an equal volume of 2% formic acid, followed by desalting using Waters Oasis HLB 1 mL reverse phase cartridges, following the vendor’s recommended procedure. Finally, the elutes were dried using vacuum centrifugation. Approximately 1 µg of the tryptic digest, prepared in a solution containing 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water, underwent analysis using LC/MS/MS. The instrument used was the Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer by Thermo Fisher Scientific, connected to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 Binary RSLCnano System. The separation of peptides occurred on an analytical C18 column with dimensions of 100 μm ID x 25 cm, featuring 5 μm particles and an 18 Å pore size. Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 350 nL/min. The gradient conditions applied were as follows: a gradient starting from 3% B and increasing to 22% B over a duration of 90 min, followed by a step to 22–35% B for 10 min, then another step to 35–90% B for 10 min, and finally, maintaining 90% B for an additional 10 min (Solvent A was composed of 0.1% formic acid in water, while solvent B contained 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). The peptides were analyzed using a data-dependent acquisition method. The Orbitrap Fusion MS operated by measuring FTMS1 spectra with a resolution of 120,000 FWHM, scanning in the m/z range of 350–1500, using an AGC target set to 2E5, and with a maximum injection time of 50ms. Within a maximum cycle time of 3 s, ITMS2 spectra were collected in rapid scan mode. High Collision Dissociation (HCD) was employed with a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 34, an isolation window of 1.6 m/z, an AGC target set to 1E4, and a maximum injection time of 35ms. Dynamic exclusion was implemented for a duration of 35 s to prevent repeated analysis of the same ions. For the experimental analysis, the Thermo Fisher Scientific Proteome Discoverer software version 1.4 was utilized to process the raw data files. The spectra were subjected to analysis against the <italic>E. coli</italic> proteome database (Swiss-Prot 29,161) through the Sequest HT search engine. Additionally, the spectra were compared against a decoy database, employing a target false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% for stringent criteria and 5% for more relaxed criteria. The enzymatic cleavage allowance for trypsin included up to two potential missed cleavages. The MS tolerance was defined as 10 ppm, while the MS/MS tolerance was set at 0.6 Da. Fixed modification involved carbamidomethylation on cysteine residues, and variable modifications encompassed methionine oxidation and asparagine deamidation. For proteomics data processing and fold change calculations, the approaches were essentially followed by the method paper from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguilan et al., 2020</xref>. Then, the STRING tool V12.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Szklarczyk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Szklarczyk et al., 2023</xref>) was employed to find the significant networks among input proteins. To generate the protein network and pathway enrichment analysis, we input the protein identifiers (Accession numbers) for upregulated or downregulated proteins with at least a twofold increase or reduction, respectively. <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 was selected as the organism of interest. We opted for evidence as the criterion for network edges, prioritizing the type of interaction evidence, helping us conduct an automated pathway-enrichment analysis, centering on the entered proteins and identifying pathways that occurred more frequently than expected. This analysis was grounded in the statistical background of the entire genome and encompasses various functional pathway classification frameworks, such as Gene Ontology annotations, KEGG pathways, and Uniprot keywords, as detailed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Szklarczyk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Szklarczyk et al., 2023</xref>). In pathway enrichment analysis, the ‘strength score’, calculated as Log<sub>10</sub>(observed/expected), serves to assess the degree or significance of enrichment within a specific biological pathway. This metric reflects the magnitude of the enrichment effect, with a higher score indicating stronger enrichment. The score is derived from the ratio of (i) annotated proteins in the network for a given term to (ii) the expected number of proteins annotated with the same term in a random network of equivalent size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Szklarczyk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Szklarczyk et al., 2023</xref>). To gauge the significance of enrichment, False Discovery Rate (FDR) is employed. FDR scores represent p-values corrected for multiple testing within each category using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Szklarczyk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Szklarczyk et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Monitoring cell division</title><p>To monitor cell division and quantify non-growing cells, we utilized inducible fluorescent protein (mCherry) expression.

These cultures were incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. Cells were allowed to grow until they reached the early stationary phase and the late stationary phase. The mCherry-positive cells were then collected, washed twice with 1 X PBS to remove the IPTG from the culture, and subsequently re-suspended in fresh 2 ml LB media in test tubes to achieve ~5 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL. This concentration represents an approximately 100-fold dilution. When needed, adjustments in cell number-to-volume were made to ensure the same cell number among both WT and mutant strains.

During flow cytometry analysis, a slow sample flow rate of 14 μL/min was chosen, along with a sample stream diameter (core diameter) of 7.7 μm. The instrument maintained a constant sheath flow rate of 6.5 mL/min. The core diameter was calculated using the ratio of the sample flow rate to the sheath flow rate.

These cultures were established in 14 mL Falcon test tubes and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm for 24 hr. Treatment cultures were prepared by diluting the main cultures at a ratio of 1:100 into 25 mL of fresh LB medium supplemented with 1 mM IPTG. These cultures were set up in 250 mL baffled flasks and contained 200 μg/mL AMP. They were then cultured at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm for 20 hr. Both before and after the treatment, 1 mL samples were collected from the cultures. These samples were subjected to a washing procedure with 1 X PBS to eliminate the antibiotic present in the samples. The washed cells were then resuspended in 1 mL of 1 X PBS within flow cytometry tubes. To measure the metabolic activity of the non-lysing cells, the RSG dye was employed as described above. Intact cells (following antibiotic treatment), stained as live with RSG, comprised both persister and VBNC cells. Persister levels were quantified by plating the cells on an agar medium, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orman and Brynildsen, 2013b</xref>). As VBNC cells cannot grow on agar medium, their enumeration involved subtracting the number of persister cells from the total number of intact cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Screening <italic>E. coli</italic> (K-12 BW25113) Keio knockout collection</title><p>Overnight cultures of individual mutant strains, along with their parental strain K-12 BW25113 WT harboring a kanamycin-resistant marker, were diluted at a ratio of 1:1000 in fresh LB medium containing 50 μg/mL of KAN. This was done in 14 mL Falcon test tubes and the cultures were then incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. Upon reaching the late stationary phase, cells were further diluted at a ratio of 1:100 in fresh medium supplemented with antibiotics at specified concentrations. These cultures were once again incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 20 hr. Following the 20 hr treatment period, the same methodology described in the section ‘Cell growth and persister assays’ was employed to quantify the number of persisters. This approach allowed for an assessment of the impact of antibiotics on the formation of persister cells for both mutant strains and the parental K-12 BW25113 WT strain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Persister quantitation in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 single gene deletions</title><p>Overnight cultures of mutant strains were diluted at a ratio of 1:1000 in 14 mL Falcon test tubes containing 2 mL of LB medium.

The significance of these kill curves was determined through the utilization of F-statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohiuddin et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Windels et al., 2019</xref>). Metabolomics data were subjected to analysis using Welch’s two-sample t-test in order to identify metabolites that significantly differed between the control and mutant groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yuen, 1974</xref>). For all experiments, a minimum of three independent biological replicates were conducted, unless explicitly stated otherwise. In each figure (excluding flow diagrams), the data for each time point are represented as the mean value accompanied by the standard deviation. In terms of statistical significance analysis, the designated threshold values for p were set as follows: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, and ****p&lt;0.0001. All figures were generated using GraphPad Prism 10.3.0. The statistical analyses were carried out using the statistical functions of GraphPad Prism 10.3.0. For the clustering of metabolomics and proteomics data, the ‘Clustergram’ function of MATLAB (V R2020b) was employed. FlowJo (V 10.8.1) was the tool used to analyze the data acquired from flow cytometry.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>MIC of antibiotics and concentrations of bactericidal antibiotics used in persister assays.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-99735-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Analyzed metabolomics data.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-99735-supp2-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Analyzed proteomics data.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-99735-supp3-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Analyzed persister survival fraction data.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-99735-supp4-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>The knockout strains generated using the <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 background in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-99735-supp5-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>Persister levels of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 WT, Δ<italic>crp</italic>, and Δ<italic>cyaA</italic> strains in late stationary phase.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-99735-supp6-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp7"><label>Supplementary file 7.</label><caption><title>Persister levels of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 (A) and BW25113 (B) WT, Δ<italic>crp</italic>, and Δ<italic>cyaA</italic> strains in the exponential growth phase.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-99735-supp7-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-99735-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to express our gratitude to the members of Dr. Orman’s laboratory for their support and assistance throughout this study.

In a previous study, we screened knockout strains of global transcriptional regulators using the aminoglycoside (AG) potentiation assay and found that, across a panel of carbon sources, AG potentiation occurred in tolerant cells derived from most knockout strains—except for Δ<italic>crp</italic> and Δ<italic>crp</italic> (Mok et al., 2015). This indicated that both genes are critical components of the Crp/cAMP regulatory network in persistence. Because cAMP exerts its effects when bound to its receptor protein Crp, disrupting crp alone should effectively abolish Crp/cAMP complex function (Keseler et al., 2011). Thus, we reasoned that comparing Δ<italic>crp</italic> to wild-type would be sufficient to capture the key metabolic and proteomic alterations arising from Crp/cAMP perturbation. Given the substantial cost and labor intensity of untargeted metabolomics and proteomics analyses, this experimental design allowed us to extract meaningful insights while maintaining feasibility. Nonetheless, to ensure the robustness of our findings, we have conducted all subsequent validation experiments using both Δ<italic>crp</italic> and Δ<italic>crp</italic> strains, confirming that the observed metabolic and proteomic changes are consistent across both mutants. We have now provided a concise justification statement in the manuscript (see lines 197-200 in the current manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The deletion of crp and <italic>crp</italic> have opposite effects on the concentration of cAMP, a comparison of metabolomics and proteomics data obtained using both mutants might aid in understanding this difference.</p></disp-quote><p>Although this is an interesting outcome, we have already discussed in the manuscript that it is likely due to the feedback regulation of the Crp/cAMP complex on <italic>crp</italic> expression (see Fig. 1 Keseler et al., 2011) (Aiba, 1985; Keseler et al., 2011; Majerfeld et al., 1981). Specifically, perturbation of the Crp/cAMP complex by deleting <italic>crp</italic> should enhance <italic>crp</italic> promoter (P<italic>crp</italic>) activity, leading to increased CyaA protein expression and, consequently, elevated intracellular cAMP levels. To experimentally verify this predicted feedback regulation, we utilized <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 WT, Δ<italic>crp</italic>, and Δ<italic>crp</italic> strains harboring the pMSs201 plasmid, which encodes green fluorescent protein (<italic>gfp</italic>) under the control of the P<italic><sub>cyaA</sub></italic> promoter. This design allowed us to directly assess the effect of Crp/cAMP perturbation on P<italic><sub>cyaA</sub></italic> activity by quantifying <italic>gfp</italic> expression as a reporter. By comparing the mutant strains to WT, we could determine whether loss of Crp/cAMP function indeed derepresses <italic>crp</italic> expression. As expected, genetic perturbation of Crp/cAMP enhanced P<italic><sub>cyaA</sub></italic> promoter activity, resulting in increased gfp expression (Figure 1-figure supplement 2).

While metabolic inhibitors like rifampin and tetracycline can induce dormancy and antibiotic tolerance in the entire population (Kwan et al., 2013), these treatments generate artificially altered cell states that may not accurately reflect naturally occurring persisters. Similarly, fluorescent reporters combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) have been employed to study persister cells, including in our previous studies (Amato et al., 2013; Orman &amp; Brynildsen, 2013, 2015). However, this approach only results in persister-enriched populations rather than a pure isolate, meaning that persisters still constitute a small fraction of the sorted cells (Amato et al., 2013; Orman &amp; Brynildsen, 2013, 2015). Despite these inherent limitations, our untargeted metabolomics and proteomics analyses at the whole-population level provide valuable insights into the regulatory mechanisms of the Crp/cAMP complex and its potential role in persister formation. Specifically, our data reveal clear indications that Crp/cAMP activity promotes the formation of a non-growing cell subpopulation, while its deletion reduces this effect. We have validated this observation through single-cell analyses (see Figure 4 in the current manuscript). Additionally, our data strongly suggest that energy metabolism plays a critical role in persister cell physiology, and we have rigorously tested this hypothesis using persister assays for single-gene deletions (see Figure 5 in the current manuscript).</p><p>Furthermore, in response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we introduced <italic>crp</italic> and <italic>crp</italic> deletions into the HipA-7 high-persistence mutant strain. The impact of these deletions in HipA-7 mirrored their effects in the wild-type strain (Figure 1-figure supplement 8), further supporting our conclusions. This data has been provided and discussed in the manuscript (see lines 185-189, and Figure 1-figure supplement 8 in the current manuscript).</p><p>We acknowledge the challenges in directly assaying persister cells, and we have now discussed this in the manuscript (see lines 397-406 in the current manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors overlooked/omitted a recently published work regarding <italic>cyaA</italic> and crp (PMID: 35648826). In that work, a deficiency in <italic>cyaA</italic> or crp confers tolerance to diverse types of lethal stressors, including all lethal antimicrobials tested. How a mutation conferring pan-tolerance to the major bacterial population would lead to a less protective effect with a minor subpopulation? The authors are kind of obligated to discuss such a paradox in the context of their work because that is the most relevant literature for the present work. It is also very interesting if the <italic>cyaA</italic>/crp deficiency really has an opposing effect on tolerance and persistence. As a note, most of the conclusions from the omics studies of the present work have been reached in that overlooked literature, which addresses mechanisms of tolerance, a major rather than a minor population behavior. That supports comment #1 above. The inability of the authors to observe tolerance phenotype with the <italic>cyaA</italic> or crp mutant possibly derived from extremely high antimicrobial concentrations used in the study prevents tolerance phenotype from being observed because tolerance is sensitive to antimicrobial concentration while persistence is not.</p><p>(3) The authors overly stressed the effect of <italic>cyaA</italic>/crp on persister formation but failed to test an alternative explanation of their effect on persister waking up after antimicrobial treatment. If the <italic>cyaA</italic>/crp-derived persisters are put into deeper sleep during antimicrobial treatment than wildtype-derived persisters, a 16-h recovery growth might have underestimated viable bacteria. This is often the case especially when extremely high concentrations of antimicrobials are used in performing persister assay. Thus, at least a longer incubation time (e.g. 48 and 72h) of agar plates for persister viable count needs to be performed to test such a scenario.</p><p>(4) The rationale for using extremely high drug concentrations to perform persister assay is unclear. There are 2 issues with using extremely high drug concentrations. First, when overly high concentrations are used, drug removal becomes difficult. For example, a two-time wash will not be able to bring drug concentration from &gt; 100 x MIC to below MIC. This is especially problematic with aminoglycoside because drug removal by washing does not work well with this class of compound. Second, overly high concentrations of drug use may make killing so rapidly and severely that may mask the difference from being observed between mutants and the control wild-type strain. In such cases, you would need to kill over a wide range of drug concentrations to find the right window to show a difference. The gentamicin data in the present work is likely the case that needs to be carefully examined. The mutants and the wild-type strain have very different MICs for gentamicin, but a single absolute drug concentration rather than concentrations normalized to MIC was used. This is like to compare a 12-year-old with a 21-year-old to run a 100-meter dash, which is highly inappropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer notes that key literature (PMID: 35648826) was overlooked, showing <italic>cyaA</italic>/crp deficiency confers broad stress tolerance—contradicting the reported reduction in persister protection. They suggest high drug concentrations may mask tolerance, and also, longer incubation (48–72 h) and normalized drug levels based on MIC are recommended. Given that these three independent comments are interconnected, we will address them together.</p><p>We follow a rigorous washing protocol to minimize antibiotic carryover. After treatment, 1 ml of culture is centrifuged at 13,300 RPM (17,000 x g) for 3 minutes, and &gt;950 µl of supernatant is removed without disturbing the pellet. The pellet is resuspended in 950 µl PBS, diluting antibiotics &gt;20-fold. This step is repeated, resulting in a &gt;400-fold cumulative dilution. After the final wash, cells are resuspended in 100 µl PBS, then serially diluted and plated on antibiotic-free agar to ensure consistency and eliminate residual antibiotics. Preliminary experiments are routinely done in our laboratory to confirm the effectiveness of washing procedures. To address concerns that high antibiotic concentrations may mask phenotypic differences—particularly in the gentamicin assay—we conducted additional experiments using MIC-normalized doses (5×, 10×, and the original study concentration) with six wash steps. As shown in Figure 1-figure supplement 6, all concentrations consistently reduced persister levels, supporting our original findings. While 5× MIC ampicillin allowed detection of persisters in mutant strains, their levels remained multiple orders of magnitude lower than in wild-type, maintaining statistical significance. These results, along with updated washing protocols, are now included in the revised manuscript (see lines 176-185 and Figure 1-figure supplement 6 in the current manuscript).</p><p>Although we standardize the incubation time of the agar plates for all conditions and strains, most strains form sufficiently large colonies within 16 hours, and longer incubation often leads to large, overlapping colonies that hinder accurate counting. We assure the reviewer that we always leave the plates in the incubator beyond the initial counting period to monitor the emergence of any new colonies. Here, we provide plate images of key strains after antibiotic treatments, demonstrating that extended incubation did not alter CFU levels, as shown in Figure 1-figure supplement 7. We have updated the relevant section in the Materials and Methods to clarify this point and included the plate images in the current manuscript (see lines 181-182 and Figure 1-figure supplement 7 in the current manuscript).</p><p>We acknowledge the significance of the study highlighted by the reviewer (Zeng et al., 2022); however, direct comparisons with our results are challenging due to substantial differences in experimental conditions, antibiotic concentrations, treatment durations, and most importantly, the <italic>E. coli</italic> strains used. The study of Zeng et al., 2022, utilized strains from the Keio collection, a commercially available <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 mutant library, which may contain unknown background mutations that could influence tolerance phenotypes. While we used the Keio collection for initial screening, we always validate single clean deletions in our lab strain, <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655, to ensure robust conclusions. The observed variations in tolerance and persistence between studies can largely be attributed to these methodological differences rather than an inherent paradox. The concentrations of ampicillin (200 µg/mL) and ofloxacin (5 µg/mL) used in our assays are in line with concentrations employed in foundational persister studies (Amato &amp; Brynildsen, 2015; Cui et al., 2016; Hansen et al., 2008; Leszczynska et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2022; Orman &amp; Brynildsen, 2015; Shah et al., 2006). These levels represent &gt;10 × the MIC and are necessary to ensure the elimination of actively growing cells, thus enriching for persister cells that, by definition, survive high bactericidal drug exposure. Our aim is not to model pharmacokinetics per se, but to apply a standardized challenge to distinguish phenotypic persistence. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic clinical data show that antibiotics such as ofloxacin and ampicillin can reach levels far exceeding 10× MIC for extended periods in patients (OFLOXACIN, 2019; Soto et al., 2014).</p><p>To assess how <italic>cyaA</italic> and crp deletions affect antibiotic responses under conditions similar to those used by Zeng et al. (Zeng et al., 2022) —specifically, exponential-phase <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 strains (Keio collection), lower antibiotic concentrations, and short treatments (e.g., 1 hour)—we first tested <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 WT, Δ<italic>crp</italic>, and Δ<italic>crp</italic> strains in late stationary phase using reduced antibiotic concentrations and shorter exposures. Both knockouts showed decreased survival following ampicillin and ofloxacin treatment compared to WT (see Figure 1-figure supplement 6), consistent with our findings in Figure 1 in the manuscript. In exponential phase, the knockout strains exhibited reduced survival after ampicillin treatment but increased survival after ofloxacin treatment relative to WT (see Author response image 2A below), again mirroring the trends in Figure 1. Gentamicin treatment, however, produced variable results in MG1655 knockouts, likely due to the brief 1-hour exposure being insufficient for robust conclusions (Author response image 2A). Notably, when we tested the corresponding Keio knockout strains in the BW25113 background, we observed increased tolerance in exponential-phase cells, reproducing Zeng et al.'s findings under their specific conditions (see Author response image 2B below), although BW25113 and MG1655 exhibited distinct persister phenotypes in exponential phase (Author response image 2A, B). These results, altogether, highlight the sensitivity of antibiotic tolerance and persistence phenotypes to factors such as strain background, antibiotic concentration, and treatment duration. This is now discussed in detail in the revised manuscript, with supporting data provided (see lines 460-476, and Supplement File 6, 7 in the current manuscript).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Persister levels of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 WT, Δ<italic>crp</italic>, and Δ<italic>crp</italic> strains in late stationary phase.</title><p>Cells were treated with ampicillin (5× MIC for 4 h), ofloxacin (5× MIC for 2.5 h), and gentamicin (3× MIC for 1 h).

These knockout strains reach stationary phase fully by that time.

Cell counts for the metabolic mutants are shown in Figure 5-figure supplement 4 in the current manuscript, and no significant growth deficiencies are observed in the late stationary phase.

In that work, we overexpressed key antioxidant enzymes—catalases (<italic>katE</italic>, <italic>katG</italic>) and superoxide dismutases (<italic>sodA</italic>, <italic>sodB</italic> and <italic>sodC</italic>)—at stationary phase. These enzymes were confirmed to be catalytically active through functional assays, yet their overexpression had no measurable effect on persister levels. To further decouple ROS from respiratory activity in that study, we performed anaerobic experiments using nitrate as an alternative terminal electron acceptor. We found that anaerobic respiration actually enhanced persister formation, and inhibition of nitrate reductases using KCN reduced it—again, independent of ROS. These findings provide compelling evidence that it is the respiratory activity itself, rather than ROS production, that influences persister formation in our system.</p><p>We have now included this discussion in the revised manuscript to clarify that ROS are unlikely to be a major factor in antibiotic killing under these conditions (see lines 503-513).</p><p>ReferencesAiba, H.
