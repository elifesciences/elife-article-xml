Of the four Kv3 gene family members, Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 are highly expressed in the auditory brainstem and we exploited this to test for subunit-specific roles at the calyx of Held presynaptic terminal in the mouse. Deletion of Kv3.3 (but not Kv3.1) reduced presynaptic Kv3 channel immunolabelling, increased presynaptic AP duration and facilitated excitatory transmitter release; which in turn enhanced short-term depression during high-frequency transmission. The response to sound was delayed in the Kv3.3KO, with higher spontaneous and lower evoked firing, thereby reducing signal-to-noise ratio. Computational modelling showed that the enhanced EPSC and short-term depression in the Kv3.3KO reflected increased vesicle release probability and accelerated activity-dependent vesicle replenishment. We conclude that Kv3.3 mediates fast repolarisation for short precise APs, conserving transmission during sustained high-frequency activity at this glutamatergic excitatory synapse.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kcnc3</kwd><kwd>auditory processing</kwd><kwd>potassium channel</kwd><kwd>transmitter release</kwd><kwd>action potential</kwd><kwd>super-resolution expansion microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R001154/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Forsythe</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Case Award M016501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Forsythe</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010677</institution-id><institution>H2020 Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ITN LISTEN 722098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Forsythe</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG SFB870 A-10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kopp-Scheinpflug</surname><given-names>Conny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Kv3.3 potassium channel subunit is necessary and sufficient to permit presynaptic location and accelerated repolarisation of the presynaptic action potential, thereby conserving resources and enhancing accuracy of timing information on transmission at the calyx of Held excitatory synapse.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kv3 voltage-gated potassium currents rapidly repolarise APs and underlie fast-spiking neuronal phenotypes, enabling high-frequency firing with temporal precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kaczmarek and Zhang, 2017</xref>).

The transmembrane domains are generally well conserved across subunits, but both the N- and C-terminal domains have diverse sequences, creating distinct inactivation kinetics, interaction with cytoskeletal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blosa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stevens et al., 2021</xref>) and regulation by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Macica et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Desai et al., 2008</xref>). Kv3 channels display ultra-fast kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grissmer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Labro et al., 2015</xref>) with half-activation at positive voltages, making them particularly effective in AP repolarisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brew and Forsythe, 1995</xref>). N-type inactivation is a powerful means of regulating K<sup>+</sup> channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hoshi et al., 1990</xref>) and inactivation in the Kv3 family is influenced by the subunit(s) expressed and their regulation by protein phosphorylation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kaczmarek and Zhang, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Transgenic knockouts of one subunit generally show mild phenotypes, consistent with heterogeneous composition of native channels and functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Joho et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Espinosa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Joho et al., 2006</xref>). Co-expression of Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 has been widely observed in different brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chang et al., 2007</xref>) and we recently showed that principal neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) within the auditory brainstem, have Kv3 channels composed of Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 subunits.

Indeed, tuning of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channel kinetics not only enhances fast signaling, but also increases metabolic efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). In the present study, we took advantage of the calyx of Held giant synapse in the MNTB to investigate the role of Kv3 subunits at that presynaptic terminal. These binaural auditory nuclei must rapidly integrate AP trains transmitted from left and right cochlea with microsecond accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beiderbeck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Joris and Trussell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Karcz et al., 2011</xref>). The region expresses Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 subunits, with little or no Kv3.2 and Kv3.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choudhury et al., 2020</xref>). This synapse is optimised for speed and fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Taschenberger et al., 2002</xref>) and is operating at the ‘biophysical limit’ of information processing, in that fast conducting axons and giant synapses with nano-domain localisation of P/Q Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, combine with postsynaptic expression of fast AMPARs, short postsynaptic membrane time-constants and exceptionally rapid APs to enable binaural sound localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schneggenburger and Forsythe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Joris and Trussell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Young and Veeraraghavan, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we test whether Kv3.1 or Kv3.3 subunits have a specific presynaptic role by examining the calyx of Held AP waveform and transmitter release on deletion of either subunit. We show that Kv3.3 subunits are localised to the presynaptic terminal and that their deletion increases transmitter release. We demonstrate the role of Kv3.3 in enhancing the speed and reliability of brainstem binaural auditory processing and conclude that presynaptic Kv3.3 subunits are essential for fast AP repolarisation at this excitatory synapse.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The experiments reported here were conducted using CBA/CrL wildtype mice or transgenic mice backcrossed onto CBA/CrL that lacked either Kv3.3 or Kv3.1 (the genotypes are referred to as WT, Kv3.3KO and Kv3.1KO). We previously reported that Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 mRNAs are highly expressed in the MNTB, and no compensation for either subunit in the respective knockouts was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choudhury et al., 2020</xref>). The influence of these deletions was assessed in vivo using extracellular recording from the MNTB and in vitro using whole cell patch clamp from the calyx of Held and MNTB principal neurons. Additionally, immunohistochemical localisation of Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 was determined using expansion microscopy. Together, these methods were applied to determine the contribution of Kv3 subunits to the presynaptic AP waveform, to assess the impact on transmitter release and determine how this impacts the response to sound. As an additional control, we confirmed that both Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 mRNA are present in the cochlear nucleus where globular bushy cells give rise to the calyx of Held synaptic terminal. The percent contribution of each subunit gene to the cochlear nucleus Kv3 mRNA was 30.3% ± 9.1% (Kv3.1), 7.7% ± 2.8% (Kv3.2), 52.0% ± 6.0% (Kv3.3), and 10.0% ± 1.6% (Kv3.4; for data see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and summary statistics). These values are similar to those measured in the MNTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choudhury et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, immunohistochemistry confirmed that both spiral ganglion neurons and cochlear nucleus have broad neuronal staining for Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 and as validated using tissue from knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Kv3 channels contribute to action potential repolarisation at the calyx of Held terminal</title><p>Previous reports have employed potassium channel blockers (4-aminopyridine or tetraethylammonium) to show that Kv3 currents contribute to fast repolarisation of APs in the MNTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Forsythe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brew and Forsythe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). Low concentrations of extracellular TEA (1 mM) give a relatively selective block of Kv3 potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnston et al., 2010</xref>).

This increase in duration at 50% amplitude was accompanied by a slowed rate of AP decay in both Kv3.3KO terminals and WT terminals upon perfusion of TEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc, Kv3.3KO vs WT p=0.0042; TEA vs WT p=0.0016) with no changes in the rising phase of the AP (one-way ANOVA, p=0.50; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), nor in the resting (input) membrane conductance (one-way ANOVA, p=0.56; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) or AP threshold (one-way ANOVA, p=0.96; see statistics table).

This suggests that Kv3.3 subunits are of most importance for presynaptic Kv3 channels and fast AP repolarisation . Despite the lack of a significant increase in action potential duration measured in Kv3.1KOs, the rate of decay was significantly slowed from 99±20 mV/ms (n=10) to 66±16 mV/ms (n=5; one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc, p=0.02), consistent with Kv3.1 having a secondary role in presynaptic AP repolarisation, as might be expected from their localisation at axonal nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Devaux et al., 2003</xref>) and potential to form heteromers with Kv3.3 subunits.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Immunohistochemical localisation shows that presynaptic Kv3 channels require the presence of a Kv3.3 subunit</title><p>Since Kv3 channels are present in both the presynaptic calyx of Held and the postsynaptic MNTB neuron, conventional fluorescence immunohistochemistry fails to resolve any differential localisation of particular subunits in the presynaptic or postsynaptic membranes. An additional complication is that few studies have localised both Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 subunits, most focus on imaging one subunit (usually Kv3.1). Electron microscopic studies demonstrated that Kv3.1b is present in the membrane of the non-release face of the calyx of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Elezgarai et al., 2003</xref>), while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wu et al., 2021</xref> show that Kv3.3 is present at the release face of the calyx.

The technique employs a hydrogel to expand the tissue by ~4.5 x prior to confocal imaging.

All sections are co-stained with bassoon (purple). Each quadrant shows single optical sections from three different MNTB neuron/calyx pairs shown at lower magnification in the respective top row. Kv3.3 staining was clearly present in the presynaptic terminal profiles surrounding each of the 3 MNTB neurons which lacked Kv3.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A1–C1</xref>). In contrast, Kv3.1 labelling (from the Kv3.3KO tissue) showed little evidence of presynaptic labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D1–F1</xref>). As a positive control, Kv3.1 labelling was robust in the postsynaptic membrane; and indeed Kv3.3 is also clearly present in the postsynaptic membrane. Each neuron in rows 1 and 4 has two synaptic profiles indicated by the orange and green arrowheads, each of these synapses are shown enlarged below their neuron of origin in rows 2 and 3 and rows 5 and 6, respectively. Similar labelling profiles are observed in the WT tissue (lower quadrants of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A4–F4</xref>). As for the KO tissue, two examples of WT presynaptic profiles are indicated by the coloured arrows and their enlargement shown below each principal neuron. The Kv3.3 antibody staining was clearly observed in the presynaptic membrane on the non-release face of the WT synapse (for example see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B2 and C3, A6</xref>) and in some image sections the release face of the synapse, between bassoon labelling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C3, B5 and A6</xref>) was clear. It was hard to visualise presynaptic membrane staining with the Kv3.1 antibody in the Kv3.3KO tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D2, E3 and F2</xref>); but some Kv3.1-stained membrane profiles were observed on the non-release face in the WT tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E5, E6 and F6</xref>).</p><p>While the calyceal Kv3.3 staining in the WT is similar to that in the Kv3.1KO, the levels of Kv3.1 staining in the WT are higher (than in the Kv3.3KO) consistent with the hypothesis that Kv3.1 may gain access to the presynaptic compartment through heteromeric assembly with Kv3.3 subunits. This data shows that while both Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 subunits are present in the postsynaptic soma membrane, only Kv3.3 subunits are required to achieve trafficking of Kv3 channels to the presynaptic terminal; and there is some evidence that the presence of Kv3.3 permits access of Kv3.1 subunits to the terminal, while both Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 were localised to the postsynaptic plasma membrane in the WT tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Deletion of Kv3.3 subunits increases calyceal-evoked EPSC amplitude</title><p>Transmitter release crucially depends on depolarisation of the presynaptic membrane and consequent calcium influx.

Examination of miniature EPSCs in postsynaptic MNTB neurons from each genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) showed no difference in the mEPSC frequency, rise-time or decay tau. There was a small significant decrease in quantal amplitude in the Kv3.3KO relative to WT, but no change in the Kv3.1KO. This contrasts with the increased amplitude of the evoked EPSCs in the Kv3.3KO measured here, and perhaps reflects an opposing change in synaptic scaling due to the larger transmitter release induced in the Kv3.3KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tatavarty et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The increased EPSC amplitude observed in Kv3.3KOs suggests that Kv3.3 subunits are major contributors to repolarisation of the presynaptic terminal. If Kv3.3 subunits dominate presynaptic Kv3 channels, then blocking presynaptic Kv3 channels with TEA will have a lesser effect on EPSCs from the Kv3.3KO. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effect of 1 mM TEA on EPSC amplitude from each of the three genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref>). Indeed, blocking Kv3 channels with TEA had a much smaller effect on EPSC amplitude in the Kv3.3 KO compared to WT and Kv3.1 KO. TEA increased EPSC amplitude to 160% ± 33% (n=8) in WT, compared to 114% ± 6% (n=6) in Kv3.3KO (Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn’s multiple comparison, p=0.0031). The EPSC amplitude in the Kv3.1KO (136% ± 11%, n=4) was not significantly different from WT (Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn’s multiple comparison p=0.99). This result is consistent with dominance of presynaptic repolarisation by channels containing Kv3.3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Enhanced short-term depression in Kv3.3KO</title><p>The calyx of Held/MNTB synapse is capable of sustained transmission at firing frequencies of around 300 Hz in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2008</xref>) (also see Figure 8), encoding information about sound stimuli for binaural integration with high temporal precision. Indeed, the calyx of Held giant synapse can sustain short AP bursts with peak firing rates of up to 1000 Hz, in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) for a few milliseconds. Clearly, the increased transmitter release observed in the Kv3.3KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) has consequences for maintenance of EPSC amplitude during repetitive firing, in that vesicle recycling and priming must rapidly replace docked vesicles if transmitter release is to be maintained for the duration of the high frequency train. Repetitive stimulation shows that the evoked EPSC amplitude declines during a stimulus train until rates of vesicle priming are in equilibrium with the rate of transmitter release for a given stimulus frequency.

But closer inspection reveals three phases of AP firing to evoked trains of calyceal synaptic responses as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. This shows MNTB EPSPs/APs during an 800ms 600 Hz train in a WT mouse. In Phase I (green trace, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) which predominates at the start of each train, every evoked EPSP triggered one MNTB AP: so the MNTB output matched the calyx input. Firing then transitioned to Phase II (blue trace, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) after around 6–9 stimuli, where EPSPs often failed to evoke an AP, and the MNTB AP firing becomes chaotic, unpredictable and poorly transmits the timing information contained within the presynaptic AP train. In Phase III (black trace, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>): the EPSP had undergone short-term depression and approached a ‘steady-state’ amplitude; now the MNTB neuron fired APs to alternate EPSPs. At frequencies up to 200 Hz the duration of Phase I was essentially identical across the three genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), all showed 100% firing throughout the train; then from 300 Hz and above, the Phase I duration declined dramatically for all genotypes. Genotype-specific limitations were observed at the highest frequencies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> shows the relative duration of each phase for 600 Hz EPSP trains (as a % of the train duration). There were no differences in the duration of Phase I, while Phase II and III were of variable duration. At 600 Hz stimulation frequency, the latency to the start of Phase II was 34.3±12.3ms for WT (n=10), 25±8ms for Kv3.3KO (n=6) and 26±14ms for Kv3.1KO (n=5). The latency for Phase III was similar in WT and Kv3.1KO (510±224ms and 597±251ms, respectively) but in the Kv3.3KO only 1 out of 6 calyx/MNTB pairs briefly entered Phase III firing (Kv3.3KO vs WT Phase II p=0.0135, Phase III p=0.02, two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc). This is consistent with the idea that presynaptic Kv3.3 and hence fast presynaptic APs, serve a role in maintaining information transmission across the synapse during high frequency firing, when short APs conserve resources, and slow the rate of short-term depression.</p><p>Large magnitude Kv3 currents in postsynaptic MNTB neurons demonstrably assists in transmission of timing information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Song et al., 2005</xref>). Kv3 has little impact on the resting MNTB neuron membrane time-constant or AP firing threshold (induced by current injection through the pipette) and these are essentially identical in the three genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choudhury et al., 2020</xref>), which was also confirmed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i</xref>). However, in the Kv3.1KO, calyceal stimulation evoked a sustained depolarisation (in addition to EPSPs) at frequencies above 100 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The mean amplitude of this depolarising plateau potential during the train is plotted against stimulus frequency for each genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Although all genotypes exhibited this plateau depolarisation at 600 Hz, it was significantly larger for the Kv3.1KO at frequencies above 100 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). In contrast, Kv3.3KOs showed a reduced plateau potential at frequencies above 300 Hz, reaching significance only at 600 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc). This was also observed as a decaying depolarisation at the end of the train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), with the time to half-decay plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref> (WT: 2.79±1.73ms, n=7: Kv3.3KO: 1.89±0.92ms, n=6: Kv3.1KO: 15.96±8.59ms, n=8: Kv3.1KO vs WT p=0. 000553, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc). In WT and Kv3.3KO genotypes, this decay was similar to the postsynaptic membrane time-constant, but in the Kv3.1KO, non-synchronous spontaneous EPSPs were observed. The EPSC decay time constants for all genotypes were essentially identical, consistent with no change in glutamate receptor expression (WT: 2.74±1.26ms, n=8; Kv3.3KO: 3.1±0.87ms, n=8; Kv3.1KO: 3.54±0.9ms, n=6). This plateau depolarisation caused increased depolarisation block of APs and thereby undermined our ability to examine AP firing physiology in the Kv3.1KO. Therefore, in vivo experiments focused on comparison of the WT and Kv3.3KO genotypes, which did not exhibit this postsynaptic epi-phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Kv3.3 increases precision and signal-to-noise ratios in MNTB response to sound</title><p>The prolonged presynaptic AP duration and increased transmitter release observed here in the Kv3.3KO, shows that the calyx has a specific need for Kv3.3 channels.

However, further analysis of the ABR waveform showed significant deficits in Wave IV at 6 months which were not apparent in recordings taken at 1 month of age. We have previously demonstrated that a developmental ‘knockout’ of the MNTB impacts ABR Wave III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jalabi et al., 2013</xref>), so the decrease in Wave IV reflects changes in downstream areas of the auditory brainstem and is being characterized as part of another study. Here, we used the opportunity to examine auditory processing in the MNTB in vivo using extracellular recordings from WT and Kv3.3KO mice during sound stimulation. This data was non-gaussian and summary statistics are presented as median, and quartile values (in square brackets).</p><p>Extracellular MNTB single unit recordings exhibited a typical complex waveform, comprised of a presynaptic and a postsynaptic component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2003</xref>). The time between the peak and trough of extracellular APs is a compelling marker for AP halfwidth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ritzau-Jost et al., 2021</xref>) and confirmed our results of the presynaptic patch clamp recordings. AP halfwidth of the presynaptic AP (preAP) was significantly longer in Kv3.3KOs (0.25ms [0.16; 0.31]; n=13) compared to WT recordings (0.17ms [0.16; 0.19]; n=20; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>; Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test: p=0.036). Synaptic delays as measured by peak-to-peak times in the complex waveform were also significantly prolonged in Kv3.3KOs (0.56ms [0.45; 0.70]; n=13) compared to WT controls (0.44ms [0.41; 0.49]; n=20; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>; n=13; Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test: p=0.013).

MNTB neurons in WT responded with a phasic-tonic firing pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>) with short latencies (3.44ms [3.01; 4.21]; n=25; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I and J</xref>) and minimal jitter (0.18ms [0.09; 0.51]; n=18; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I and K</xref>). In contrast, Kv3.3KO neurons were slower to respond to sound with first spike latencies of 4.06ms [3.01; 4.21] (n=25; Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test: p=0.015; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I and J</xref>) and showed larger temporal variability (0.92ms [0.56; 1.50]; n=18; Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test: p=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I and K</xref>). This increased onset jitter contributed to the reduced magnitude of the phasic component in the peri-stimulus time histogram in Kv3.3KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> arrows). The inability to fire high instantaneous rates at sound onset was accompanied by a shift in the average inter-spike intervals from 2.16ms [1.48; 3.57] (n=22) in the WT to 3.10ms [2.49; 4.19] (n=18) in the Kv3.3KO (Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test: p≤0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Indeed, comparing peak firing rates during the first 10ms of the sound-evoked response revealed significantly lower rates in Kv3.3KOs (240 Hz [180; 280]; n=18) compared to WTs (350 Hz [200; 425]; n=22; Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test: p=0.003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). In contrast to the reduced sound-evoked firing rates, an increase in spontaneous firing was observed in the Kv3.3KOs (Kv3.3KO: 40 Hz [19.3; 62.0]; n=19) compared to WT controls (16.5 Hz [4.5; 42.8]; n=24; Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test: p=0.044; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>). Together, these combined changes caused a significant reduction in signal-to-noise ratio in the Kv3.3KO (2.77 [2.04; 3.99]; n=14) compared to WT controls (9.70 [4.38; 40.95]; n=18; Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test: p=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Neurotransmitter release is triggered by calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels and is highly influenced by the presynaptic AP waveform. Deletion of Kv3.3 subunits increased presynaptic AP duration and transmitter release, enhancing short-term depression on repetitive stimulation. In contrast, deletion of Kv3.1 had little effect on the presynaptic AP or transmitter release. Expansion microscopy was used to enhance resolution in imaging presynaptic compartments and showed localisation of Kv3.3 subunits to the presynaptic membrane. These observations are consistent with a computational model of transmitter release in which Kv3.3 deletion increased vesicle release probability by twofold and to a lesser degree accelerated fast vesicle replenishment. This is consistent with increased calcium influx and activity-dependent facilitation of recycling. The enhanced short-term depression of synaptic responses increased latency jitter and reduced postsynaptic AP firing (output) at high frequencies in the Kv3.3KO. In vivo this manifests as reduced temporal fidelity and firing rates in the binaural auditory circuit in response to sound, whilst spontaneous AP firing increased in the Kv3.3KO. We conclude that presynaptic Kv3 channels require one (or more) Kv3.3 subunits to achieve presynaptic targeting for fast and temporally precise transmitter release at this excitatory synapse.</p><p>On deletion of Kv3.3, synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held showed accelerated recovery from short-term depression, along with increased presynaptic AP duration and increased transmitter release from WT mice of a similar age.

Our modelling indicates that the increase in transmitter release is primarily an increase in vesicle release probability (and subsequent short-term depression) but an acceleration of vesicle recycling also contributes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Changes in auditory processing over development</title><p>A key design element of this study was that each experiment compared mice of similar age against the three genotypes (WT, Kv3.3KO, and Kv3.1KO) all of which were on the same CBA background strain. Thus, variance contributed by the developmental stage was minimized within each experiment and the significant changes therefore related to the absence or presence of the Kv3 subunits under study. The range of animal ages used in this study (in different experiments) shows that Kv3.3 is relevant across development. Nevertheless, auditory responses are maturing, particularly around the onset of acoustically evoked activity (P12) in the mouse. The calyx of Held undergoes a range of developmental changes that foster temporally accurate transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Borst and Soria van Hoeve, 2012</xref>). Presynaptic calcium channels shift from N to P/Q type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Iwasaki et al., 2000</xref>), myelination induces developmental and activity-dependent changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sinclair et al., 2017</xref>) and similar adaptations favouring high-frequency firing are occurring in neonatal rat pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sierksma and Borst, 2017</xref>). The AP time-course accelerates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Taschenberger and von Gersdorff, 2000</xref>) with increased expression of Nav1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Leão et al., 2005</xref>) which in turn influences activation of the voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borst and Sakmann, 1998</xref>) and hence the efficacy of transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yang and Wang, 2006</xref>). Presynaptic Kv currents also increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nakamura and Takahashi, 2007</xref>) with the major change being before hearing onset (and little change from P13 to P20).

The present study interrogates the role of Kv3 subunits over a wide age range, from a relatively immature calyx (P10-P12) to mature adult (6 months old) and despite the inevitable developmental changes during this period, Kv3.3 remains crucial in shaping the presynaptic AP waveform and neurotransmitter release at the calyx. An increase in Kv3 expression with age may actually amplify the deficits observed in Kv3.3KOs at later developmental stages however this study shows that even with a small deficiency in Kv3.3 expression in young Kv3.3KO animals, there are drastic consequences at the synapse.</p><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>Kv3 channel subunit composition</title><p>Knowledge of Kv channel subunit composition, interactions and precise location within identified neurons is key to understanding their extensive physiological roles in controlling neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Trimmer, 2015</xref>). Kv channel building is regulated by the N-terminal tetramerisation domain (T1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 1992</xref>) to favour assembly of ‘dimers of dimers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tu and Deutsch, 1999</xref>) usually from subunits within the same Kv family. Although early studies suggested otherwise, Kv3 subunits do not co-assemble with the accessory subunit gene families (Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, and Kv9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bocksteins et al., 2014</xref>), so Kv3 channels are likely composed of four Kv3 alpha subunits. Frequent co-expression of Kv3 subunits in the same neurons suggest functional channels could exist as heteromers, indeed coimmunoprecipitation has revealed interactions of Kv3.1b with Kv3.4a and Kv3.2 in globus pallidus neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baranauskas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hernández-Pineda et al., 1999</xref>), and with Kv3.3 in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chang et al., 2007</xref>) but homomeric assemblies of Kv3.3 subunits could also form presynaptic Kv3 channels. The data reported here suggests that presynaptic Kv3 channels at the calyx of Held require an obligatory Kv3.3 subunit, since TEA (which will block all Kv3 heteromers) showed little effect on transmission in the Kv3.3KO. This result also implies that Kv3.1 does not have a directive or independent role in the terminal and while heteromers with Kv3.3 may occur, Kv3.1 is certainly not required for Kv3.3 localisation to the presynaptic membrane.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Could other Kv3 subunits contribute to presynaptic Kv3 channels here at the calyx or at other synapses?</title><p>Excitatory synaptic boutons, including hippocampal mossy fiber terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alle et al., 2011</xref>), cerebellar mossy fiber terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ritzau-Jost et al., 2014</xref>) and small neocortical boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ritzau-Jost et al., 2021</xref>) show pharmacological evidence for presynaptic Kv3. Inhibitory interneurons also possess presynaptic Kv3 channels, including cerebellar basket cell terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Southan and Robertson, 2000</xref>) and stellate cell axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rowan et al., 2016</xref>), with the latter being identified as Kv3.4. However, it is difficult to exclude a role for Kv3.3 at this site since the Kv3 antagonist BDS is not specific for Kv3.4, having similar actions on Kv3.1 and Kv3.2; and should also block Kv3.3 subunits on the basis of sequence homology in the putative BDS binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yeung et al., 2005</xref>). It seems unlikely that Kv3.4 (or Kv3.2) subunits have a directive (or independent) role in trafficking Kv3 channels to the calyx terminal, since the mRNA levels for these subunits was very low in the MNTB and VCN. However, if there were effective translation and assembly of Kv3.4 (or Kv3.2) into calyx Kv3 channels, then TEA should have enhanced transmitter release in the Kv3.3KO, but TEA potentiation of transmission was occluded in the Kv3.3KO.</p><p>In contrast to Kv3.1 and Kv3.2, early studies of recombinant Kv3.3 showed N-type (ball-peptide) inactivation, as originally described for Kv1 potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hoshi et al., 1990</xref>). We conclude here that Kv3.3 is a principal component of presynaptic Kv3 channels but we observe little or no inactivation of the presynaptic Kv3 current. There are multiple explanations for this lack of inactivation. The degree of Kv3 inactivation varies between different expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rudy et al., 1999</xref>), perhaps due to there being two methionine start codons. Mammals lack a well-defined Kozak consensus sequence for the first, favouring initiation at the second methionine, thereby excluding the N-terminal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fernandez et al., 2003</xref>). Alternatively, endogenous PKC phosphorylation of N-terminal Kv3.3 could occlude the N-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Desai et al., 2008</xref>). Also, little or no inactivation was observed in the postsynaptic Kv3.3 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choudhury et al., 2020</xref>). Given this lack of inactivating current observed at the calyx, it is unlikely that Kv3.4 subunits are present in this terminal. Further to this, in recombinant co-expression studies, Kv3.3 and Kv3.4 did not readily form heteromers, but instead formed distinct currents with differing kinetics in the same cells (Richardson, Forsythe and Pilati, unpublished observations) suggesting that heteromeric channels composed of these subunits are unlikely.</p><p>In terminals that exhibit inactivation of presynaptic potassium currents, this has important physiological implications for transmitter release, especially during sustained high-frequency AP firing. Repetitive activation during AP trains would cause cumulative Kv3 inactivation and progressively slows AP repolarisation. This can generate a form of activity-dependent short-term potentiation where increasing AP duration potentiates transmitter release, as occurs at mossy fiber terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Geiger and Jonas, 2000</xref>). During sustained high-frequency AP firing at the calyx, the longer AP duration induced by an inactivating Kv3 would risk earlier transmission failure, with faster depletion of vesicles and inactivation of the presynaptic sodium channels. The physiological end-point for an inactivating Kv3 would be similar to that measured for the Kv3.3KO. Hence, the minimal inactivation of the presynaptic Kv3 current at the calyx of Held enables transmission to be sustained for longer, at higher firing rates and greater accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Do interactions with the cytoskeleton dictate Kv3 localisation or function?</title><p>Proximity of K<sup>+</sup> channels have powerful influences on the local voltage and therefore in control of other voltage-gated ion channels. The data reported here demonstrates an ionic role for Kv3.3 in the presynaptic terminal but stabilisation in any compartment will require non-ionic interactions with components of the cytoskeleton. The permutations and complexity of channel subunit assembly optimize function through subunit-specific localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Trimmer, 2015</xref>) involving trafficking, insertion, phosphorylation, and stabilisation of channel complexes. Indeed, a general scaffolding interaction is essential for intrinsic plasticity where insertion into key sites of excitability (axon initial segments, nodes of Ranvier, heminodes and synaptic terminals) will control hyper-excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Steinert et al., 2011</xref>) and calcium overload. There is a well-established role for ankyrin-G in axonal targeting of Kv3.1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Xu et al., 2007</xref>) and for clustering of sodium and potassium channels at the initial segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pan et al., 2006</xref>). Ankyrin-R binds and stabilizes Kv3.1b in fast spiking interneuron somatic membranes and nodes of Ranvier; and crosslinks Kv3.3 via spectrin to the cytoskeleton in Purkinje neurons, which aids their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stevens et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stevens et al., 2022</xref>). This interaction of both subunits with ankyrin-R would explain the inability of the MNTB neuron soma to differentiate or partition channels composed of Kv3.1b or Kv3.3 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choudhury et al., 2020</xref>) so that each subunit type could largely compensate for the absence of the other within the soma. Presynaptic stabilisation of Kv3.3 however, is unlikely to be through ankyrin-R alone, as this mechanism would not discriminate between the subunits.</p><p>Another possibility is that Kv3.3 inactivation is suppressed by the C-terminus associating with Hax1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blosa et al., 2015</xref>) to bind the Kv3.3 N-Terminal ball peptide and modulate the actin network. However, as in the WT, the calyceal outward currents reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zhang et al., 2016</xref> were an order of magnitude smaller than observed here or elsewhere. Additionally, the presynaptic K<sup>+</sup> currents from a Kv3.3KO calyx were similar magnitude to WT (Figure S4: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Based on association with the actin cytoskeleton, deletion of Kv3.3 was proposed to inhibit endocytosis in the calyx synaptic terminal by this non-ionic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). However, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wu et al., 2021</xref> study does not test for the possibility of a simultaneous ionic mechanism or for a change in the presynaptic AP waveform on deletion or mutation of Kv3.3. With the evidence reported here, it is clear that Kv3.3 does have an ionic role at the calyx of Held. Our observations on EPSCs and modelling of short-term depression show that Kv3.3 deletion increases transmitter release and accelerates a fast sub-second component of activity-dependent recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, inset) following conditioning stimulation. Although this contrasts with the slowing of endocytosis observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wu et al., 2021</xref> our observations are over a much shorter time-course and measure EPSC amplitude, rather than presynaptic capacitance.

Short duration APs permit high firing rates by minimising the absolute refractory period, thus Kv3 enables well-timed high-frequency AP trains and when input firing rates exceed the refractory limit, neurons expressing Kv3 readily switch to firing on alternate input spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Song et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, we evoked MNTB neuron AP firing in response to presynaptic stimulation and asked how effective was the input/output relationship across a range of firing frequencies from 100 to 600 Hz in each genotype. Although there was little difference at low firing frequencies, at the highest frequencies only the first few presynaptic APs generate postsynaptic APs with 1:1 fidelity (Phase I) before entering a chaotic phase (Phase II) with many failures, which resolves later in the train into precise firing but to alternate stimuli (Phase III). In the absence of Kv3.3 the MNTB firing passed into Phase II but did not converge into Phase III firing, consistent with the idea that presynaptic Kv3.3 improved stability of synaptic transmission.</p><p>Integration of information from both ears for the purpose of sound localisation requires high temporal accuracy for bilateral transmission of auditory APs from each cochlea to the superior olivary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tollin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Joris and Trussell, 2018</xref>). This is facilitated by Kv3 channels within specific neurons, from cell bodies, axons, synaptic terminals and across the neural network. In vivo extracellular recording from the MNTB measures simultaneously the presynaptic calyx and postsynaptic MNTB single unit APs. Accurate transmission of AP timing was compromised in the Kv3.3KO, and the peak firing rate was reduced. Additionally, spontaneous AP firing was elevated (with respect to WT animals), likely reflecting hyper-excitability upstream in the auditory pathway, with Kv3.3 being expressed in spiral ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kim et al., 2020</xref>) and the globular bushy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cao et al., 2007</xref>) which give rise to the calyx of Held. The use of anesthetic for our in vivo study may affect auditory processing, but comparison with multiple other studies in mice and gerbil and using a range of different anesthetics showed that the synaptic delay measured in this study was favourably comparable to these other studies: ketamine/xylazine in mouse: 0.40ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blosa et al., 2015</xref>), 0.46ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2003</xref>), 0.50ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lorteije et al., 2009</xref>) ketamine/xylazine in gerbil: 0.44ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tolnai et al., 2009</xref>).

One hypothesis is that presynaptic Kv3.3 would enhance resource and energy conservation during high frequency firing, but more importantly it will support the physiological mechanisms as a synapse evolves from a microdomain to a nanodomain architecture for exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Meinrenken et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Young and Veeraraghavan, 2021</xref>) by constraining presynaptic calcium influx.</p><p>Disease mutations associated with Kv3.3, such as spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13) cause multiple neurological defects, which from the evidence reported here could include aberrant neurotransmitter release in addition to postsynaptic excitability changes. In the case of the SCA13 mutation R420H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Middlebrooks et al., 2013</xref>), the observations made here support the hypothesis that SCA13 disrupts the physiological process of interaural level discrimination by reducing the gain and signal to noise ratio, thereby undermining sound source localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tollin, 2003</xref>). The current study suggests several areas for further investigation of presynaptic potassium conductances: First, the contribution of ionic and non-ionic mechanisms is now recognized for Kv3 and their relative contribution to cytoskeleton and physiology can be elucidated. Second, it is necessary to determine which spliced-variants or potassium channel beta subunits/accessory proteins are expressed and how subunit phosphorylation contributes to the physiology. Third, while Kv3.3 can be clearly resolved on the non-release face of the terminal, the resolution on the release face is not sufficient to unambiguously distinguish between the pre- and post-synaptic membranes, but in order to avoid depolarisation by [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> accumulation, one would predict minimal potassium efflux into the synaptic cleft. Fourth, Kv3 currents do not mediate all the presynaptic potassium current and other Kvs operating at more negative voltage activation ranges, such as Kv1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Geiger and Jonas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dodson et al., 2003</xref>) or Kv7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>) are likely to contribute to terminal threshold, excitability and AP waveform.</p><p>The combinatorial potential of Kv3 channel subunits gives rise to a spectrum of physiological roles in fast-spiking neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choudhury et al., 2020</xref>) and interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chang et al., 2007</xref>). The pre- and postsynaptic studies conducted here at the calyx of Held/MNTB neuron clearly show that Kv3.3 subunits are critical for presynaptic localisation of Kv3 channels mediating fast AP repolarisation. They contribute to improved temporal accuracy and conservation of presynaptic resources during high-frequency firing. Together these results suggest a general role for Kv3.3 in raising the biophysical ‘speed limit’ for information transmission at fast synapses, especially during intense synaptic activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The slices were then ‘gelled’ and the gels digested according to the proExM protocol for intact tissues (basic protocol 2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asano et al., 2018</xref>). The digested gels were expanded in ddH<sub>2</sub>O water for 3 × 20 min for same-day imaging or stored at 4 °C in the dark in PBS for later use. For imaging, gels were transferred to 35 mm glass-bottom petri dishes with a sealed lid, previously coated with poly-L-Lysine (Sigma Aldrich P8920). Fluorescence imaging was conducted using a Zeiss LSM 980 Airyscan 2 microscope and images were processed using ZEN 3.1 (blue edition) and Fiji software. Controls for non-specific immunostaining of the secondary antibodies (incubations without the primary antibody, data not shown), and pre-incubation of each primary antibody with the corresponding antigenic peptide (blocking peptide) were conducted as part of the antibody validation procedure. Immunostaining with Kv3.1b and Kv3.3 primary antibodies was confirmed as absent in the corresponding knockout tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-8"><title>In vivo physiology</title><p>Adult (6–8 month) Kv3.3 knockout mice of either sex (n=5) and five age-matched CBA wild type mice were anesthetized with a subcutaneous injection of 0.01 ml/g MMF (0.5 mg/kg body weight Medetomidine, 5.0 mg/kg body weight Midazolam and 0.05 mg/kg body weight Fentanyl). They were placed on a temperature-controlled heating pad (WPI: ATC 1000) in a soundproof chamber (Industrial Acoustics). Depth of anesthesia was measured using the toe pinch reflex and animals responding were given supplemental MMF at 1/3 the initial dose. The mice were stabilized in a custom stereotaxic device. An incision was made at the top of the skull, followed by a craniotomy just anterior to the lambda suture intersection. The skull was tilted to provide access to the auditory brainstem. A ground electrode was placed in the muscle at the base of the neck. Glass microelectrodes were pulled from glass capillaries so that the resistance was 5–20 MΩ when filled with 3 M KCl solution. Signals were amplified (AM Systems, Neuroprobe 1600), filtered (300–3000 Hz; Tucker-Davis-Technologies PC1) and recorded (~50 kHz sampling rate) with a Fireface UFX audio interface (RME). AudioSpike software (HoerrTech) was used to calibrate the multi-field magnetic speakers, generate stimuli and record action potentials. Stimuli consisted of pure tones (50–100 ms duration, 5ms rise/fall time) at varying intensity (0–90 dB SPL) and were presented through hollow ear bars connected to the speakers with Tygon tubing. PSTHs were assessed at characteristic frequency (CF) and 80 dB SPL. MNTB neurons were identified by their excitatory response to contralateral sound stimulation and their typical complex waveform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2003</xref>), consisting of a presynaptic potential (preAP), a synaptic delay (SD) and a postsynaptic potential (AP).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-9"><title>Auditory-evoked brainstem response</title><p>ABR equipment set-up and recordings have previously been described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ingham et al., 2011</xref>. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with fentanyl (0.04 mg/kg), midazolam (4 mg/kg), and medetomidine (0.4 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. Animals were placed on a heated mat inside a sound-attenuated chamber, and electrodes were inserted sub-dermally; below the right pinnae, into the muscle mass below the left ear, and at the cranial vertex. ABR responses were collected, amplified, and averaged using the TDT System3 (Tucker Davies Technology) in conjunction with custom ‘Averager’ software, provided by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Binaural stimuli were delivered in the form of a 0.1ms broadband click. All stimuli were presented in 5 dB SPL rising steps to 95 dB SPL, and responses were averaged 512 times per step. Recordings were averaged over a 20ms period with a 300–3000 Hz bandwidth filter and a gain of 25,000 x. Wave amplitude and latencies were analyzed using the Auditory Wave Analysis Python script developed by Bradley Buran (Eaton-Peabody Laboratory), and calculated as the difference between peak and valley (µV) and time to wave peak (s), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-10"><title>Computation model</title><p>A simple model with activity-dependent vesicle recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Graham et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Billups et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lucas et al., 2018</xref>) was used.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Kv3.3 subunits control presynaptic action potential waveform and neurotransmitter release at a central excitatory synapse&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Henrique von Gersdorff as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Some further analysis of the data (mEPSC amplitudes) and discussion of the results is recommended.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. It follows that the decay of the presynaptic AP slope in Kv3.3KO correlated with a broadening of the AP waveform. It is curious that the AP waveform did not broaden with a Kv3.1 KO, yet the decay slope slowed almost to the extent of the Kv3.3KO. Could it be that Kv3.1 is acting at slightly different time-points during repolarization? What about the AP width at 75% or 25% of the amplitude?</p><p>2. Figure 1B-C: the original study in JPhysiol (Forsythe, 1994) on the calyx AP shows that current step injections produce multiple APs in the presynaptic calyx, but just one in the postsynaptic MNTB cell. I thus wonder if maybe the recordings shown in Figure 1B-C of a solo AP may be perhaps from postsynaptic MNTB principal cells? Can the authors confirm with fluorescent dyes that the recordings shown in Figure 1B-C are indeed from the presynaptic calyx (e.g. they can mention no mEPSCs)? Important to mention also that mice start to hear at about P12, so P10-12 calyces are still immature.</p><p>3. in vitro slice recording was performed in mouse pups (P10-P25), whereas in vivo recording was performed in older mice (6 months). It is not clear why the experiments were done in mice with such huge age difference. The synapse might not be fully mature around P10-P25. Kv channels also tend to have increased expression during development. Were there any published results of immuno-electron microscopy to demonstrate the presence and expression levels of Kv3.3 and Kv3.1 channels in the calyx of Held terminals during these developmental stages?</p><p>4. There may be potential compensatory effects from other Kv3 subunits in Kv3.1 or Kv3.3 global KO mice. Are Kv3.3 channels expressed in the postsynaptic cell? Potential developmental changes caused by global KO should be more extensively discussed.</p><p>5. Figure 2: Could the increase in EPSC sizes be due to postsynaptic effects such as increased mEPSCs? This may be done by looking at asynchronous or spontaneous mEPSCs. In Figure 2, mini EPSCs should also be analyzed to help dissect the role of Kv3.3 at different stages of synaptic transmission.</p><p>6. The potential effect of anaesthesia on in vivo recording in response to sound should be discussed. The FSL difference in the Kv3.3 KO may arise from spiral ganglia and CN neurons firing more slowly. These neurons also may express Kv3.1 and Kv3.3. Please emphasize this in Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

We see little difference between the Kv3.1KO and WT when measured near the peak (75%) or bottom (25%) of the AP, as shown in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 4. The small difference in the 25% and 75% AP widths from WT to Kv3.1KO was not significant at p = 0.05. We have added this data (Figure 1—figure supplement 4) and interpretation to the manuscript on page 4 (last paragraph). The significant decrease in decay slope in Kv3.1KO compared to WT is likely an artefact of the APs in Kv3.1KOs being slightly smaller than those observed in WT, amplifying the difference in the change of voltage over time. We are not excluding a role for Kv3.1-containing channels in influencing the presynaptic AP, since they are located in axonal nodes of Ranvier (See Devaux et al., 2003) and can form heteromers with Kv3.3 subunits in functional Kv3 channels, but we clearly show here that presynaptic Kv3 channels must contain at least one Kv3.3 subunit. We have added IHC of Kv3.3 and Kv3.1 in the calyx using expansion microscopy (New Figure 2); this confirms the dominance of Kv3.3 subunits in the terminal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We showed that by 10 days old the calyx calcium channel compliment has largely switched to P-type, as noted in Forsythe et al., 1998 (p 798 &amp; Figure 1) and documented in detail by Tomoyuki Takahashi with Osvaldo Uchitel in Iwasaki et al., 2000 (Figure 3). In 2003 we showed (Dodson et al., 2003) that block of presynaptic Kv1.2 channels caused multi-spiking in the calyx and Nakamura and Takahashi (2007) demonstrated the developmental acceleration in the calyx AP halfwidth (Figure 1) from 0.5ms at P7/8 to 0.25ms at P13/14 which was unchanged at P19/20. Comparing their AP halfwidth data at P13/14 and P19/20 with ours (0.28ms) suggests that our data is similar to their values from more mature animals. Nakamura and Takahashi also showed a developmental increase in calyceal Kv1 currents (Figure 8) from P7 to P14, which changed spiking from multiple AP firing to single spiking, confirming our observations for the role of Kv1 and specifically highlighting the developmental importance. Thus, our interpretation of the multi-spiking presynaptic recording from Forsythe 1994 is that these observations were from relatively immature animals lacking Kv1. A further change from many of the early studies on the calyx is the transition from rat to mouse as the experimental animal, which occurred as many groups in the field adapted to transgenic technology.</p><p>We have been very careful to exclude contamination of our presynaptic data with postsynaptic recordings. We have a long experience of making presynaptic recordings and although presynaptic fluorescent dyes can be helpful to identify the recording site, we try to avoid dye use when recording from the calyx in order to reduce phototoxicity and free radical damage. Miniature synaptic currents or potentials have never been observed in any calyceal recording (and no axo-axonic synapses have been reported on the calyx). Presynaptic recordings were confirmed empirically through the total absence of spontaneous miniature synaptic events; this is very reliable in our hands and none of these presynaptic recordings are mistakenly from a postsynaptic neuron. As evidence for this no mini events were observed in 16s recordings from each calyx (n=40 in total). In contrast, postsynaptic recordings showed an average of 10±7 mEPSCs per second (range 3-26 events n=9, mice aged P10-P12). In our criteria to confirm a presynaptic recording, if even 1 synaptic event was observed during the whole presynaptic recording, this data was excluded from the data set. Additional confidence for presynaptic recordings were that presynaptic APs had a pronounced depolarizing after-depolarisation potential (DAP) exhibited a fast I<sub>H</sub> current and had a resting membrane potential of around -70mV, compared to -60mV for postsynaptic cells. A paragraph on this has been added to the methods . We have also added a paragraph to the discussion on development of the calyx that includes a statement about hearing onset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. in vitro slice recording was performed in mouse pups (P10-P25), whereas in vivo recording was performed in older mice (6 months). It is not clear why the experiments were done in mice with such huge age difference. The synapse might not be fully mature around P10-P25. Kv channels also tend to have increased expression during development. Were there any published results of immuno-electron microscopy to demonstrate the presence and expression levels of Kv3.3 and Kv3.1 channels in the calyx of Held terminals during these developmental stages?</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to appreciate that a key element of our experimental design was to compare the same age ranges against the three different genotypes (WT, Kv3.1KO and Kv3.3KO). Thus, the sources of variance contributed by development should have been similar and any statistically significant differences should be directly related to the absence or presence of the specific subunits (Kv3.3 or Kv3.1).</p><p>The range of ages used for this study was to provide as much information as possible to the community and to show that the role of presynaptic Kv3 contributes at all ages studied. Additionally, several of the techniques were hard to apply over the whole age-range. For instance, patch clamp recording is more challenging in the spinal cord and brainstem of animals over 1 month old, while in vivo recording is harder in younger animals.</p><p>An increase in channel subunit expression is likely to amplify differences between WT and Kv3.3KO at older time points, however this does not undermine the observations in the younger animals. The expansion microscopy that we have added shows that both Kv3.1b and Kv3.3 are present in the terminal of mice aged ~P20-P30. We have already published quantification of Kv3 mRNA from P9 to P30 in the MNTB and other nuclei in the auditory brainstem; this showed no significant developmental increase in mRNA over this age range, but a high intrinsic variance. We have repeated this study twice (as noted in Choudhury et al. 2020) and even with increased N, there was no statistically significant increase in mRNA levels over this age-range.</p><p>Nevertheless, the development of the calyx/MNTB neuron excitability and synaptic transmission are important and well documented, and we have discussed the evidence in greater detail by adding a paragraph in the discussion. The work of Nakamura and Takahashi (2007) is key data which clearly shows that while there is an increase in Kv currents with development, most of this change has occurred before the age of P13, as there isn’t a significant change in the AP width from P13-P20 in their WT study.</p><p>Many groups including ourselves have conducted developmental studies of synaptic transmission and excitability at the calyx of Held. We have added a paragraph discussing these developmental studies . We have also added discussion of Kv3 potassium channel subunits in EM studies , particularly relevant now we have conducted new experiments using Expansion Microscopy for presynaptic localisation of Kv3.3 and Kv3.1. See new results and data in new Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There may be potential compensatory effects from other Kv3 subunits in Kv3.1 or Kv3.3 global KO mice. Are Kv3.3 channels expressed in the postsynaptic cell? Potential developmental changes caused by global KO should be more extensively discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have already excluded the possibility of compensatory changes by other Kv3 subunit mRNA in the knockouts used in this study (this is reported in Choudhury et al., 2020 cited in the first paragraph of the results). A detailed discussion of compensatory issues in the Kv3 knockouts was made in the discussion of Choudhury et al., 2020. This previous paper also shows that Kv3.3 is present in the postsynaptic MNTB neuron and contains several control experiments pertinent to the current manuscript which we have cited. We have added further data on Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 in the spiral ganglion and cochlear nucleus (figure supplements 2 and 3 to Figure 1, respectively). We also added to the discussion and we have conducted new experiments using Expansion Microscopy to show presynaptic and postsynaptic localisation of Kv3.3 and Kv3.1: see results and data in new Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 2: Could the increase in EPSC sizes be due to postsynaptic effects such as increased mEPSCs? This may be done by looking at asynchronous or spontaneous mEPSCs. In Figure 2, mini EPSCs should also be analyzed to help dissect the role of Kv3.3 at different stages of synaptic transmission.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this data as a Supplementary Figure, Figure 3—figure supplement 1. There is no increase in mEPSC amplitude, if anything the quantal amplitude is decreased slightly in the Kv3.3KO – the opposite of what would be required to explain the increased evoked response. There is no evidence for other presynaptic changes, suggesting the increased transmitter release in the Kv3.3KO is purely an action potential based phenomenon. This is presented in the results and the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The potential effect of anaesthesia on in vivo recording in response to sound should be discussed. The FSL difference in the Kv3.3 KO may arise from spiral ganglia and CN neurons firing more slowly. These neurons also may express Kv3.1 and Kv3.3. Please emphasize this in Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, part of the first spike latency (FSL) difference between WT and Kv3.3KO likely arises upstream of the MNTB, in the VCN and/or SGN, since both locations also express Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 (see supplemental Figures to figure 1, figure supplements 1-3). For a subset of our data we have assessed the FSL for the presynaptic calyceal action potentials, which relate to the output of VCN bushy cells. These data show that already at the level of the calyx, the Kv3.3KO latencies are significantly longer (WT Presynaptic FSL: 3.09 ±0.71ms, n=19 vs. Kv3.3KO presynaptic FSL: 6.05 ±2.79 ms, n=9, Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test: p=0.002), which suggests that there is a cumulative effect of lacking Kv3.3 on FSLs along each synaptic relay of the auditory pathway, in which both the spiral ganglion neurons and the ventral cochlear are shown in the supplemental Figures to figure 1, figure supplements 1-3, as possessing Kv3.1 and Kv3.3.</p><p>Anaesthesia: To test specifically for the effect of Kv3.3 on the synaptic transmission between the calyx of Held to MNTB neuron, we compared the synaptic delay between the presynaptic calyceal action potential and the postsynaptic MNTB neuron AP between both genotypes. In WT, the synaptic delay was 0.45 ±0.05ms (n=26). This value fits perfectly into the range of synaptic delays recorded by different laboratories under different anaesthetics and in different animal models: ketamine/xylazine in mouse: 0.40ms (Blosa et al. 2015), 0.46ms (Kopp-Scheinpflug et al. 2003), 0.50ms (Lorteije et al. 2009); ketamine/xylazine in gerbil: 0.44ms (Tolnai et al. 2009). This narrow distribution of synaptic delays with different anaesthesia suggests that the effect of anaesthesia on synaptic delay is negligible compared to the effect of deleting Kv3.3, which resulted in a synaptic delay of 0.58 ±0.17ms (this manuscript). Taken together, there is always an effect of anaesthesia, just like there is always an effect of stress or attention if no anaesthesia is used. However, since we compare WT to KO within the same anaesthetic protocol; and since our WT data fit well to other published data, the genotype specific effect of the Kv3.3 on synaptic delay seems robust. We have added a paragraph discussing anaesthesia and the above comparisons to the discussion.</p><p>We have added two paragraphs to the discussion in which we discuss the evidence and logic for other Kv3 subunits contributing to presynaptic Kv3 channels. This also includes discussion of ionic versus non-ionic mechanisms for Kv3 roles in the terminal, and comments on areas that require further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.
