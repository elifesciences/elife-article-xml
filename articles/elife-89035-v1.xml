With the recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, already established methods were challenged by the large genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Herein we present an elaborated strategy for the rapid and straightforward rescue of recombinant plus-stranded RNA viruses with high sequence fidelity using the example of SARS-CoV-2. The strategy called CLEVER (CLoning-free and Exchangeable system for Virus Engineering and Rescue) is based on the intracellular recombination of transfected overlapping DNA fragments allowing the direct mutagenesis within the initial PCR-amplification step. Furthermore, by introducing a linker fragment – harboring all heterologous sequences – viral RNA can directly serve as a template for manipulating and rescuing recombinant mutant virus, without any cloning step. Overall, this strategy will facilitate recombinant SARS-CoV-2 rescue and accelerate its manipulation. Using our protocol, newly emerging variants can quickly be engineered to further elucidate their biology. To demonstrate its potential as a reverse genetics platform for plus-stranded RNA viruses, the protocol has been successfully applied for the cloning-free rescue of recombinant Chikungunya and Dengue virus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>reverse genetics</kwd><kwd>RNA virus</kwd><kwd>Chikungunya</kwd><kwd>Dengue</kwd><kwd>One Health</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013348</institution-id><institution>Innosuisse - Schweizerische Agentur für Innovationsförderung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#52533.1 IP-LS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klimkait</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University Hospital Basel / Canton BS and RocketVax</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klimkait</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CLEVER enables the rapid manipulation and direct rescue of plus-strand RNA viruses with the shortest hands-on time to study viral variants of concern.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is responsible for the global pandemic that emerged in November 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gorbalenya et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). The virus possesses a positive-strand RNA genome close to 30 kb encoding at least 26 proteins, flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) and a poly(A) tail at the 3′ terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Principally, the targeted engineering of RNA viruses to study viral biology requires the conversion of the RNA genome into a cDNA copy before it can be manipulated. Based on the large coronavirus genome size of 27–32 kb, and the presence of typical sequences as nucleotide runs or so-called ‘poison sequences’ that are hard to amplify in bacteria, it took quite some time before the first full-length coronavirus cDNA clone was published in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almazán et al., 2000</xref>). The initially described bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) cloning technology was quickly followed by other but similarly laborious techniques to yield infectious cDNA clones of coronaviruses, such as in vitro ligation or vaccinia-based cloning techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Thiel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yount et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>During the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 or Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, applicable coronavirus reverse genetics methods remained largely unchanged. When SARS-CoV-2 emerged in 2019, previously established coronavirus reverse genetics methods including in vitro ligation and BAC cloning were rapidly adapted to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fahnøe et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ye et al., 2020</xref>). Then, additional methods established for other RNA viruses became available: transformation-associated recombination (TAR)-cloning in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Thi Nhu Thao et al., 2020</xref>) and the ‘circular polymerase extension reaction’ (CPER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarilla et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Torii et al., 2021</xref>). However, TAR-cloning still requires multiple steps of in vitro manipulation, and CPER still relies on the in vitro assembly and subsequent transfection of the 30 kb full-length product. Further, the authors of CPER report the design of unique primers to be critical for efficient in vitro assembly, and optimal PCR settings need to be elaborated. Another DNA-based method has been described by Lamballerie et al. in 2014 for the much smaller flavivirus model of about 10 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aubry et al., 2014</xref>). This method, termed ‘infectious subgenomic amplicons’ (ISA), allows transfected overlapping DNA fragments to recombine within the eukaryotic cell into a full-length genome copy. The technique has recently been adapted to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mélade et al., 2022</xref>), eliminating a prior in vitro assembly into a full-length viral cDNA copy or the in vitro transcription and RNA transfection.</p><p>Here, we describe an ISA-based method and show its efficient and versatile use with the 30 kb genome of SARS-CoV-2. Largely independent of the inherent limits of the unique size of this virus, we demonstrate a reliable, straightforward, and reproducible reconstitution inside the target cell with high success rates. Extensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis reveals high sequence integrity of the rescued viruses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that recombinant virus is readily rescued from various cell lines or using different transfection methods, making this protocol highly efficient and broadly applicable.</p><p>We developed the highly productive genome engineering and reconstitution strategy 'CLEVER' (CLoning-free and Exchangeable system for Virus Engineering and Rescue) as a unique feature. It describes a very efficient technique to rapidly mutagenize or quickly insert defined insertions or deletions into the SARS-CoV-2 genome without any need for time-consuming intermediate cloning steps. In addition, a new protocol enables a direct virus rescue from viral RNA preparations. As proof of concept, we engineered an ∆ORF3a (open-reading frame) mutant into an Omicron XBB.1.5 background of SARS-CoV-2 from a clinical isolate within days after the first emergence of this new important virus variant. Notably, the protocol has been adapted and applied for the rescue of recombinant Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV) from viral RNA directly, without the need for any further cloning steps.</p><p>The CLEVER process therefore provides a platform for broad use in multiple virus applications for various plus-stranded RNA viruses and relevant pathogens far beyond SARS-CoV-2. The technical design and process reflect a formidable and powerful strategy that broadens the general molecular applicability and pushes the limits of effective reverse genetics. The platform is highly user-friendly for multiple new applications and various viruses of interest or newly emerging, unknown pathogens in research and/or of clinical importance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimized DNA-based recovery of authentic full-length SARS-CoV-2 virus</title><p>While most previously published techniques for the recovery of full-length, infectious coronaviruses require several intermediate steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kurhade et al., 2023</xref>), we found the DNA-based method by Mélade and colleagues an attractive basis for our work. It introduces overlapping subgenomic DNA fragments, covering the entire virus genome, into permissive cells. DNA recombination by the cellular machinery then leads to the generation of a full-length viral genomic cDNA copy from which plus-strand RNA is transcribed, starting a complete viral replication cycle. Accordingly, we inserted a heterologous promoter as well as critical regulatory elements 5′ and 3′ of the viral genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Eight overlapping fragments spanning the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome were PCR amplified and transfected in equimolar ratios into HEK293T cells. The resulting propagation of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rCoV2) was assessed by the developing cytopathic effect (CPE) once culture supernatant was passaged onto permissive Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A first CPE was typically observed after 6–8 days post-transfection (dpt). Whereas co-transfection of nucleocapsid (N) mRNA or N-expressing plasmid has been reported to be critical for a successful virus recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xie et al., 2020</xref>), we found no such improvement, as it has been reported previously for a different DNA-based reverse genetics method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Torii et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rescue and characterization of recombinant SARS-CoV-2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and the infectious subgenomic amplicons (ISA)-based method for virus recovery.

Furthermore, the skipping of external N allowed us to use standard commercial rapid antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 to semi-quantitatively monitor a successful virus rescue within minutes. Moreover, this test is done inside the safety facility, eliminating the cumbersome sample export into a standard lab for RT-PCR and viral genome determination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>In a first optimization step, we reduced the number of necessary DNA segments from eight to four. This simplified the PCR protocol and reduced the needed intracellular recombination events from seven to only three for reconstituting a full-length viral genome.</p><p>To test our hypothesis that fewer recombination sites will improve reconstitution efficiency and therefore virus production, the number of HEK293T cells releasing infectious virus after transfection was evaluated. HEK293T cells were either transfected with eight or four fragments and subsequently seeded in 96-well plates at 5000 cells/well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). On day 7, supernatant from each well was separately transferred onto Vero E6 cells. Emerging infectious virus was assessed by plaque formation. The transfection of four fragments resulted in about one virus-producing cell per 11,000 transfected cells compared to ~1/160,000 for eight genome fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that transfecting only four fragments does not negatively affect the reconstitution fidelity, we compared the replication competence of recombinant viruses to the parental wild-type virus isolate. At the time of the earliest appearance of cytopathic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), cultures were assessed side-by-side. Plaques of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 reconstituted from four fragments (rCoV2-4fr) were similar in size and shape compared to the wild-type reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When comparing intracellular viral N protein expression with immunocytochemistry (ICC), staining intensity and patterns correlated very well with the wild-type phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To compare the replication kinetics of recombinant virus and parental SARS-CoV-2, Vero E6 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 with either virus and infectious titers were determined 12, 24, 48, and 72 hr post-infection (hpi) using a plaque assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Although the recombinant virus showed decreased titers within the first 24 hr, similar titers were reached after prolonged infection as it has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Torii et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xie et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To further compare virion integrity, viral particles were analyzed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). Regarding size, shape, lumen density, and S protein abundance, the in vitro-generated virus was indistinguishable from wild-type virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Concluding these findings, the viruses reconstituted in vitro from four fragments show similar phenotypes compared to the parental strain, as previously described for recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarilla et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mélade et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Thi Nhu Thao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Torii et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xie et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The reconstitution process is highly reproducible, and rescue of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 from transfection was successful in different cell lines including HEK293T, HEK293, CHO, and BHK-21 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In these cases, due to the absence of the ACE-2 receptor, a productive viral propagation depended on co-cultivation with Vero E6 cells. However, virus was directly rescued from ACE2-expressing A549 cells that did not need co-cultivation.

To this end, we used the design of oligonucleotide primers that anneal upstream and downstream of ORF3a, ‘bridging’ the genomic regions 5′ of the gene directly to the genomic region 3′ of ORF3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

With CLEVER, in vitro assembly steps and intermediate steps required for most other reverse genetic systems can be skipped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, individual pieces of DNA can be freely exchanged, and mutations can be introduced just one step prior to transfection with no need for additional cloning. Conveniently, only newly generated plasmids are needed to be sequence verified, whereas the residual fragments remain the same. We demonstrate this feature by rapidly exchanging and analyzing the S gene properties of newly emerging variants. Neutralizing titers correlated with the introduced S gene variant rather than the genomic background. Thus, we present a tool to rapidly study Spike properties with chimeric viruses in vitro, sparing the cloning of the whole 30 kb genome.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Overview of reverse genetics methods for SARS-CoV-2.</title><p>The most commonly used reverse genetics systems for the rescue of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 are listed and the prominent intermediate steps are depicted.

The protocol was then simplified by reducing fragment number, enabling high recovery efficiency and thus leading to a library of over 150 viruses, including more than 40 characterized mutant SARS-CoV-2 viruses.</p><p>While the initial ISA attempts for SARS-CoV-2 were limited to BHK-21 cells co-cultured with Vero E6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mélade et al., 2022</xref>), we demonstrate successful virus rescue in HEK293T, HEK293, CHO, BHK-21 and A549-ACE2 cells or by using different transfection methods. Thus, we believe that the CLEVER platform can be rapidly established in any laboratory currently doing reverse genetics on SARS-CoV-2 using cell lines and transfection methods of choice.</p><p>Another benefit is the freedom of choosing recombination sites as intracellular recombination depends on the length of the homology region rather than GC content. We did not encounter any inefficient overlaps within this study in contrast to the described CPER method where primer design seemed to be a critical step for the assembly of a full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarilla et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Torii et al., 2021</xref>). For CPER, the repetitive occurrence of transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS) common in coronaviruses can therefore limit the choice of creating new fragment overlaps. Further, unoptimized reaction conditions can favor wrong assemblies. For intracellular recombination like ISA, only correct assemblies will result in an infectious virus and are amplified with repeated infection cycles. Thus, the system is selective for infectious virus.</p><p>The key property of the successful CLEVER protocol is the minimization of any PCR-introduced mutations. Up to date, the ISA method has not yet gained much attention in the field of reverse genetics methods for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kurhade et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mittelholzer and Klimkait, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), despite its straightforward protocol. PCR amplification is still highly associated with polymerase-introduced mutations, and the PCR amplification step has been described as an error-prone limitation of ISA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Driouich et al., 2018</xref>). The authors of this SuPReMe (Subgenomic Plasmids Recombination Method) version of ISA suggest omitting the PCR amplification step in favor of using subgenomic fragments directly liberated from sequence-verified plasmids. However, our optimized protocol states the exclusive use of high-fidelity polymerases and pooling of several parallel reactions, as well as a high template input and a reduced number of amplification cycles. To check on our optimized protocol, we performed NGS of eight reconstituted, recombinant viruses. The observed high fidelity – only one minor substitution was detected – was confirmed even in clonal virus populations: 3/5 viruses showed 100% sequence fidelity.</p><p>This low mutation rate was somehow not surprising as only high-fidelity polymerases were used, which are reported to have an error rate of 10<sup>–6</sup> to 10<sup>–7</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xue et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, very much underestimated in the field is the error rate of RNA polymerases used for in vitro transcription of approximately 10<sup>–4</sup> to 10<sup>–5</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brakmann and Grzeszik, 2001</xref>), which consequently can lead to a highly polymorphic virus population. To our surprise, sequence integrity based on NGS data of recombinant virus was not always assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hou et al., 2020</xref>), or only Sanger sequencing has been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Torii et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xie et al., 2020</xref>), while other studies show various unintentional mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarilla et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rihn et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>A recent study on the versatile use of CPER introduces a confirmatory step by assembling the fragments in bacteria (circular polymerase extension cloning [CPEC]) and fully sequencing them prior to transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kim et al., 2023</xref>). This introduced confirmatory step converts the straightforward and rapid protocol of the initially described CPER protocol to a tedious and time-consuming process. Further, analysis of reported mutations found within the 16 recombinant (mutant) viruses revealed several SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kim et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, the T7 polymerase transcription step might be responsible for the observed mutations within the viral populations.</p><p>We showed that successful recombination of a full-length cDNA copy and subsequent virus production was achieved in several individual cells, leading to a fitness-driven competition and therefore the eradication of any fitness-impairing mutations from the viral population. If clonal virus populations are desired, our established serial dilution protocol after transfection can be applied. Of note, we most probably did not yet reach the limits of the CLEVER platform during this study. We successfully tested fragment size from as big as 9 kb down to only 500 bp, and transfecting four or up to nine fragments (bigger/smaller or less/more fragments have not been tested). Combining these two observations, genomes much bigger than the investigated 30 kb could be reconstituted within the eukaryotic cell.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrate the full capacity of the CLEVER platform by direct mutagenesis of newly arising variants without any intermediate steps. Subgenomic fragments were directly amplified from viral RNA of Omicron BA.5 and XBB.1.5, whereas one primer pair was modified to delete ORF3a. The linker fragment harboring all heterologous sequences needed for intracellular DNA-dependent RNA transcription was added to the transfection, and recombinant Omicron BA.5 or XBB.1.5 virus with an ORF3a deletion, respectively, was rescued. There was no need of cloning or de novo synthesis of any BA.5 or XBB.1.5 sequences, allowing us to rapidly generate a mutant virus shortly after its emergence. Of note, this protocol focuses on rapid rescue and mutagenesis rather than high-sequence fidelity as key features of our optimized CLEVER protocol (such as the exclusive use of high-fidelity enzymes and pooling of several PCR reactions) were neglected in favor of a proof-of-concept attempt. Indeed, a slight increase in unintentional mutations was observed when sequencing clonal virus populations rescued from RNA directly (compare RNA clonal 1–3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>As an additional feature, having the linker sequence in hand, extracted non-infectious viral RNA of emerging variants can be exchanged between laboratories with standard shipping conditions, and infectious virus can be subsequently rescued in BSL-3 conditions.</p><p>Along with the advantages of the CLEVER protocol, limitations must be considered: interestingly, virus was never rescued after transfecting Vero E6 cells, as already reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mélade et al., 2022</xref>). Whether this is due to low transfection efficiency or the cell’s inability to recombine remains to be elucidated. Other cell lines not tested within this study will have to be tested for efficient recombination and virus production first. Further, the high sequence integrity of rescued virus is highly dependent on the fidelity of the DNA polymerase used for amplification. The use of other enzymes might negatively influence the sequence integrity of recombinant virus as it has been observed for the direct rescue from viral RNA using a commercially available one-step RT-PCR kit. Another limitation when performing direct mutagenesis is the synthesis of long oligos to create an overlapping region. Repetitive sequences, for example, can impair synthesis, and self-annealing and hairpin formation increase with prolonged oligos.</p><p>Taken together, CLEVER provides an elaborate platform for the rapid response to any newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant or the fast and efficient rescue of other plus-stranded RNA viruses. Virus can be directly rescued from any clinical isolate, and mutations such as SNPs or insertions/deletions of whole regions can be introduced without the need of any intermediate steps. Sequence integrity can be preserved when starting from sequence-verified plasmids rather than RNA directly. The CLEVER system thereby represents an excellent tool for studying large plus-stranded RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, but also the studying of properties and gene functions in vitro of other, much smaller RNA viruses such as CHIKV or DENV, and for quickly adapting viral genomes to follow and study the evolution of any viral variants of clinical importance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human samples</title><p>Human serum samples for neutralization assays were collected from SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated anonymous donors who gave their informed consent (approved by Ethikkommission Nordwest- und Zentralschweiz #2022–00303).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cells</title><p>BHK-21 and CHO-K1 cells were obtained from Thermo Scientific (ATCC CCL-10 and CCL-61).

However, the sequence fidelity after direct rescue from RNA was indeed tested in this study, even on a clonal level (please see: Table S2, or raw NGS data SRX20303605 - SRX20303607).For higher clarity, we added the following sentence to the manuscript:</p><p>“Indeed, a slight increase of unintentional mutations was observed when sequencing clonal virus populations rescued from RNA directly”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>Minor Points:</p><p>1.

It is not entirely novel (rather it is based on previously described ISA method) but it is clearly efficient and useful complementation to the already existing methods. One of strong points of the approach use by authors is that it is very versatile, i.e. can be used in combination with already existing methods and tools. I find it important as many laboratories have already established their favorite methods to manipulate SARS-CoV-2 genome and are probably unwilling to change their approach entirely. Though authors highlight the benefits of their method these are probably not absolute - other methods may be as efficient or as fast. Still, I find myself thinking that for certain purposes I would like to complement my current approach with elements from authors CLEVER method.</p><p>The work does not contain much novel biological data - which is expected for a paper dedicated to development of new method (or for improving the existing one). It may be kind of shortcoming as it is commonly expected that authors who have developed new methods apply it for discovery of something novel. The work stops on step of rescue the viruses and confirming their biological properties. This part is done very well and represents a strength of the study. The properties of rescued viruses were also studied using NSG methods that revealed high accuracy of the used method, which is very important as the method relies on use of PCR that is known to generate random mistakes and therefore not always method of choice.</p><p>What I found missing is a real head-to-head comparison of the developed system with an existing alternatives, preferably some PCR-free standard methods such as use of BAC clones. There are a lot of comparisons but they are not direct, just data from different studies has been compared. Authors could also be more opened to discuss limitations of the method. One of these seems to be rather low rescue efficiency - 1 rescue event per 11,000 transfected cells. This is much lower compared to infectious plasmid (about 1 event per 100 cells or so) and infectious RNAs (often 1 event per 10 cells, for smaller genomes most of transfected cells become infected). This makes the CLEVER method poorly suitable for generation of large infectious virus libraries and excludes its usage for studies of mutant viruses that harbor strongly attenuating mutations. Many of such mutations may reduce virus genome infectivity by 3-4 orders of magnitude; with current efficiencies the use of CLEVER approach may result in false conclusions (mutant viruses will be classified as non-viable while in reality they are just strongly attenuated).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for the careful review of our work and the valuable feedback. We agree that a direct comparison with other (PCR-free) methods such as BAC cloning, could be useful for demonstrating the unique benefits of the CLEVER method. However, as our laboratory does not use any BAC or YAC cloning methods, we could not ensure an unbiased side-byside comparison using different techniques.</p><p>We would like to highlight the avoidance of any yeast/bacterial cloning steps that render the CLEVER protocol significantly faster and easier to handle. A visualization of the key steps that could be skipped using CLEVER in comparison to common reverse genetics methods is given in Figure 6.</p><p>Further, we firmly believe that the benefits of the CLEVER method become especially apparent for large viral genomes such as the one of SARS-CoV-2, where assembly, genome amplification and sequence verification of plasmid DNA are highly inefficient and more timeconsuming than for small viruses like DENV, CHIKV or HIV.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the overall transfection and recombination efficiencies observed with CLEVER seemed rather low. Although data on transfection/rescue efficiency is known for many techniques and viruses, we did not find any published data on the reconstitution of SARS-CoV-2 or viruses with similar genome sizes. Therefore, a useful comparator for our observations in relation to other techniques is currently simply missing. We therefore emphasize that the efficiencies of CLEVER were achieved with one of the largest plus-stranded RNA virus genomes, and our data can’t be directly compared to transfection efficiencies of short infectious RNAs.</p><p>On the contrary, it was rather interesting to observe the very high rescue efficiency of infectious virus progeny. During the two years of establishing and validating the CLEVER protocol, we reached success rates for the genome reconstitution after transfection of &gt;95 %. This was even obtained with highly attenuated mutants including rCoV2∆ORF3678 (joint deletion of ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF8) (Liu et al., 2022)(see Author response image 1). We amended this data in response to the reviewers’ comment and as an example of the successful rescue of an attenuated virus from five overlapping genome fragments (fragments A, B, C, D1, and D2∆ORF3678).</p><p>The latter data were not added to the main manuscript since in this case the deletions were introduced using a different method: from the plasmid-based DNA fragment D2∆ORF3678 and not directly from PCR-based mutagenesis.</p><p>Further, CLEVER was used for related substantial manipulations, including the complete deletion of the Envelope gene (E) which led to the creation of a single-cycle virus that may serve as a live, replication-incompetent vaccine candidate (Lett et al., 2023).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>rCoV2∆ORF3678.</title><p>Detection of intracellular SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N, green) and nuclei (Hoechst, blue) in Vero E6TMPRSS2 cells infected with rCoV2∆ORF3678 by immunocytochemistry.

As indicated in Public review section the work would benefit from direct comparison of CLEVER with that of infectious plasmid (or RNA) based methods; direct comparison of data would be more convincing that indirect one. Authors should also discuss possible limitations of the method - this is helpful for a reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We were not able to perform a direct comparison of CLEVER with other methods (see our statement above).</p><p>We added the following section to the discussion: “Along with the advantages of the CLEVER protocol, limitations must be considered: Interestingly, virus was never rescued after transfecting Vero E6 cells, as has been observed previously (Mélade et al., 2022). Whether this is due to low transfection efficiency or the cell’s inability to recombine remains to be elucidated. Other cell lines not tested within this study will have to be tested for efficient recombination and virus production first. Further, the high sequence integrity of rescued virus is highly dependent on the fidelity of the DNA polymerase used for amplification. The use of other enzymes might negatively influence the sequence integrity of recombinant virus, as it has been observed for the direct rescue from viral RNA using a commercially available onestep RT-PCR kit. Another limitation when performing direct mutagenesis is the synthesis of long oligos to create an overlapping region. Repetitive sequences, for example, can impair synthesis, and self-annealing and hairpin formation increase with prolonged oligos.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some technical corrections of the text would be beneficial. In all past of the text the use of terms applicable only for DNA or RNA is mixed and creates some confusion. For example, authors state that &quot;the human cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV) was cloned upstream of 5' UTR and poly(A) tail, the hepatitis delta ribozyme (HDVr) and the simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal downstream of the 3' UTR&quot;. Strictly speaking it is impossible as such a construct would contain dsDNA sequence (CMV promoter) followed by ssRNA (5'UTR, polyA tail and HDV ribozyme) and then again dsDNA (SV40 terminator). So, better to be correct and add &quot;sequences corresponding to&quot;, &quot;dsDNA copies of&quot; to the description of RNA elements</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the advice but would like to state that in scientific language it is common to assume that nucleic acid cloning is based on DNA.</p><p>We have corrected the description in the Methods section: “The human cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV) was cloned upstream of the DNA sequence of the viral 5’UTR; herein, the first five nucleotides (ATATT) correspond to the 5’UTR of SARS-CoV. Sequences corresponding to the poly(A) tail (n=35), the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDVr), and the simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal (SV40pA) were cloned immediately downstream of theDNA sequence of the viral 3’UTR.”</p><p>For ease of reading and for consistent terminology, we kept the original spelling in the rest of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In description of neutralization assay authors have used temperature 34 C for incubation of virus with antibodies as well as for subsequent incubation of infected cells.
