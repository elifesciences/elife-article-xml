expression is deregulated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, their specific role in key arthritogenic cells such as the synovial fibroblast (SF) remains elusive. Previous studies have shown that <italic>Mir221/222</italic> expression is upregulated in RA SFs. Here, we demonstrate that TNF and IL-1β but not IFN-γ activated <italic>Mir221</italic>/222 gene expression in murine SFs. SF-specific overexpression of <italic>Mir221/222</italic> in huTNFtg mice led to further expansion of SFs and disease exacerbation, while its total ablation led to reduced SF expansion and attenuated disease. <italic>Mir221/222</italic> overexpression altered the SF transcriptional profile igniting pathways involved in cell cycle and ECM (extracellular matrix) regulation. Validation of targets of <italic>Mir221/222</italic> revealed cell cycle inhibitors <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>, as well as the epigenetic regulator <italic>Smarca1</italic>.

Articular inflammation is fueled by the aberrant production of inflammatory mediators by immune and mesenchymal resident cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McInnes et al., 2016</xref>). Genetically modified mouse models with deregulated expression of TNF develop an erosive polyarthritis resembling RA (huTNFtg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keffer et al., 1991</xref>) and SpAs (spondyloarthropathies) (TNF<sup>ΔARE</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kontoyiannis et al., 1999</xref>]<italic>,</italic> TgA86 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Küsters et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vafeiadou et al., 2020</xref>]), showing also extra-articular manifestations, such as heart valve disease and intestinal inflammation, recapitulating comorbid pathologies often observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kontoyiannis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ntari et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Early studies in our lab established that TNF targeting of TNFR1 on synovial fibroblasts (SFs) is required for the development of arthritis and suffices to orchestrate full pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armaka et al., 2018</xref>). SFs (resident mesenchymal cells in the joints) in RA diverge from their physiological role to nourish and protect the joints and undergo arthritogenic transformation. Under chronic inflammatory signals, SFs hyperproliferate, express ECM-degrading enzymes, and acquire an aggressive, invasive, and tissue-destructive phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kontoyiannis and Kollias, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dakin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koliaraki et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, arthritogenic SFs can migrate via the circulation to distant sites and transfer disease in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aidinis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lefèvre et al., 2009</xref>). Epigenetic alterations, such as global DNA hypomethylation and deregulated expression of miRNAs and lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karouzakis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evangelatos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zou et al., 2018</xref>), have been linked to the aggressive and destructive behavior of SFs.</p><p>Altered expression and important functions have been reported for a number of miRNAs in RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evangelatos et al., 2019</xref>). miRNAs are small regulatory RNAs (19–25 nt long) that fine-tune the expression of target mRNAs and have fundamental roles in development, physiology, and disease. They recognize their RNA targets by binding mainly to their 3′UTR region, guide them to the RISC complex, and lead them either to target degradation or translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Specifically, <italic>Mir221</italic> and <italic>Mir222</italic> have been found upregulated in SFs derived from the huTNFtg mouse model and RA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pandis et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Mir221</italic>/222 are clustered on the X chromosome (<italic>Mirc53</italic> locus) and classified as oncomiRs as they are upregulated in a number of human epithelial cancers. They target genes mainly involved in cell proliferation and survival, such as cell cycle inhibitors <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">le Sage et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pineau et al., 2010</xref>). Under nonresolving inflammatory signals, such as in sepsis, the overexpression of <italic>Mir222</italic> contributes to morbidity by targeting <italic>Smarca4</italic>, a chromatin remodeling component that participates in the SWI/SNF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seeley et al., 2018</xref>). In RA, expression levels of <italic>Mir221/222</italic> positively correlate with disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abo ElAtta et al., 2019</xref>) and ex vivo downregulation of <italic>Mir221</italic> has been shown to decrease migration and invasion of human RA SFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang and Yang, 2015</xref>). However, the in vivo role of these two miRNAs in arthritis remained unexplored.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that <italic>Mir221/222</italic> play a key pathogenic role in TNF-driven arthritis as in vivo SF-targeted overexpression of <italic>Mir221/222</italic> led to more aggressive arthritis associated with enhanced expansion of SF populations and total genetic ablation of these miRNAs led to amelioration of disease manifestations. Additionally, bioinformatic target prediction tools for <italic>Mir221/222</italic> combined with RNA expression data uncovered both known [<italic>Cdkn1b (p27), Cdkn1c (p57)</italic> cell cycle inhibitors] as well as novel targets (<italic>Smarca1</italic>, a chromatin remodeling component). scATAC-seq analysis of SFs from arthritic mice revealed increased <italic>Mir221</italic>/222 gene activity in the destructive subpopulations of the lining and expanding intermediate compartment. Finally, transcription factor motif enrichment analysis revealed transcription factors such as <italic>Rela, Relb, Junb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galardi et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Nfe2l2</italic>, and <italic>Bach1</italic> that could regulate the expression of <italic>Mir221</italic>/222 in arthritis.</p><p>Overall, these data suggest that therapeutic targeting of these two miRNAs in specific SF subpopulations could be beneficial for the treatment of human arthritis and perhaps other inflammatory diseases associated with pathogenic expansion of fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Mir221</italic> and <italic>Mir222</italic> induction in huTNFtg SFs depends on the TNF/TNFR1 axis and IL-1β</title><p>We have previously shown that <italic>Mir221</italic>/222 levels are increased in SFs from arthritic 8-week-old huTNFtg mice and RA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pandis et al., 2012</xref>).

Next, the observed downregulation of genes of the ECM led us to check the expression of additional genes related with a destructive behavior of SFs such as <italic>Mmp3</italic> and <italic>Rankl</italic> (<italic>Tnfsf11</italic>).

Deregulation in miRNA expression levels has been linked with diseases such as cancer, viral infection, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O’Connell et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In RA, alteration in expression of several miRNAs has been reported in different cell types in the synovium or in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). <italic>Mir146a</italic> and <italic>Mir155</italic> are among the most highly studied miRNAs and both are upregulated in response to inflammatory signals and implicated in immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakasa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saferding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blüml et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurowska-Stolarska et al., 2011</xref>); however, in the vast majority of the studies, no tissue specificity for the function of miRNAs in arthritis was considered.</p><p>In this study, we try to shed light on the in vivo role of the <italic>Mir221/222</italic> family of miRNAs in arthritis. In the past, IL-1β had been reported to mediate downstream signaling of TNF/TNFR1 axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brennan et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Probert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zwerina et al., 2007</xref>). In the present study, we provide evidence that in the arthritic microenvironment of the joints, TNFR1 signaling downstream of TNF and independently of IL-1β can induce <italic>Mir221/222</italic> levels in SFs apart from LPS and could suggest that increased TNF and IL-1β levels can serve as signals that lead to <italic>Mir221/222</italic> upregulation specifically in RA SFs.</p><p>In RA, proliferation of fibroblasts consists of one of the hallmarks of the aggressive behavior of the pathogenic mesenchyme, and it is mediated by survival and anti-apoptotic signals in SFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pap et al., 2000</xref>). Although the signals and epigenetic alterations that lead to this aberrant proliferation of SF subsets in RA remain under investigation, in this study we uncovered a novel role for <italic>Mir221/222</italic> in the mesenchyma, where increased levels of <italic>Mir221/222</italic> rendered fibroblasts more proliferative and migratory, even in the absence of an inflammatory trigger. Moreover, a causal role for <italic>Mir221/222</italic> involvement in pannus hyperplasia was shown by the total ablation of these two miRNAs in the arthritic mice that led to decreased disease manifestations due to attenuated proliferation of SFs and decreased numbers of fibroblasts comprising the lining and sublining layers. Also, considering that mesenchymal overexpression of <italic>Mir221/222</italic> at naïve conditions (WT background) led to a tendency towards worse bone integrity and increased fibroblast populations suggests that <italic>Mir221/222</italic> upregulation and control of target gene expression could have dramatic effects in a specific milieu under local unresolved inflammation.</p><p>Analysis of the transcriptional profile of SFs from huTNFtg;TgCol6a1-Mir221/222 mice compared to huTNFtg mice uncovered deregulation in pathways linked to cell cycle and ECM regulation. Cell cycle inhibitors <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>, known <italic>Mir221/222</italic> targets, were both identified in our data and were verified by ex vivo experiments in SFs. Interestingly, deregulation in ECM components was observed due to <italic>Mir221/222</italic> overexpression. ECM plays a crucial role in the joints and apart from providing support, it also promotes cell communication and motility. Synovial fluid containing hyaluronic acid and lubricin (PRG4) protects from friction and lubricates the cavity area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buckley et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, during <italic>Mir221/222</italic> overexpression in arthritis, the expression of ECM-related molecules in SFs was found altered and, more specifically, <italic>Prg4</italic> and the integrin component <italic>Itga3</italic> were downregulated. <italic>Prg4</italic> and <italic>Itga3</italic> were not predicted as direct targets of <italic>Mir221/222</italic>, so indirect mechanisms probably mediate this effect. <italic>Itga3</italic> expression has been found to be downregulated in PBMCs from OA (osteoarthritis) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), and a previous study has reported that the absence of <italic>Prg4</italic> from the synovium leads to OA and aberrant fibroblast expansion and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rhee et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, a cardioprotective and antifibrotic role of <italic>Mir221/222</italic> was observed in cardiac fibroblasts by the downregulation of different types of collagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). So, <italic>Mir221/222</italic> could contribute to the catabolic profile of SFs in arthritis by affecting expression of ECM components. Furthermore, the mesenchymal overexpression of <italic>Mir221/222</italic> did not render SFs more inflammatory or activated per se as it was supported by ex vivo studies in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang and Yang, 2015</xref>). In contrast, our in vivo data suggest that these two miRNAs regulate pro-proliferative signals leading to aberrant expansion of pathogenic SFs that in the end renders the arthritic milieu more inflammatory.</p><p>Additionally, <italic>Smarca1</italic> was identified as a new direct target of <italic>Mir221/222</italic> based on the transcriptional profile of SFs, bioinformatic analysis of predicted targets, and luciferase assay. SMARCA1 participates in the NURF chromatin remodeling complex that can limit or promote chromatin accessibility, and thus block or activate gene expression correspondingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>). NURF complex has been shown to promote cell proliferation, but a role for this complex in RA is missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies will reveal a specific role for SMARCA1 in shaping gene expression in arthritis. Recently, a study reported a role for <italic>Mir222</italic> in targeting <italic>Brg1</italic>, an SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling component, leading to repression of inflammatory cytokine expression in sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seeley et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Finally, analysis of chromatin accessibility data at a single-cell level revealed increased chromatin accessibility in <italic>Mir221</italic>/222 locus in the activated and expanding intermediate cluster and in the destructive cluster of the lining. This analysis, coupled with transcription factor binding site linkage, revealed transcription factors such as <italic>Junb, Rela, Relb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galardi et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Nfe2l2</italic>, and <italic>Bach1</italic>, which may play a role in positively regulating the activity of these two miRNAs in arthritis, leading to the expansion of pathogenic and destructive clusters of the intermediate and lining compartments, respectively. Notably, there is a recent study uncovering a role for NRF2 and BACH1 in promoting NSCLC tumor metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lignitto et al., 2019</xref>). Future experiments may thus elucidate the exact role of these transcription factors in the aggressive, autonomous, and migratory character of RA SFs.</p><p>We observed <italic>Mir221</italic> and <italic>Mir222</italic> induction to reach peak levels in late disease stages, and this agrees with a previous study that correlates their levels with disease activity in RA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abo ElAtta et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, their overexpression is sufficient to worsen the severity of the disease. Thus, these miRNAs could serve as biomarkers to predict disease progression in humans.</p><p>Additionally, therapeutic targeting of <italic>Mir221/222</italic> could be beneficial as total genetic deletion of these two miRNAs protected to a certain degree from arthritis progression and the expression of their confirmed targets was partially restored. This partial protection underlines the fact that most probably there are additional mechanisms assuring the suppression of these targets and should be addressed. It is known that miRNA function is often redundant, which means that if an miRNA is missing, other miRNAs can regulate its targets. Further studies are therefore needed in order to identify additional miRNAs that target the same genes and assess the potential of their combined downregulation in the development of new treatments. Nonetheless, it is very interesting that during arthritis there are redundant and complementary pathways ensuring expansion of the pathogenic stroma subsets. Ιt is of great interest to dissect which pro-survival and pro-proliferative pathways lead to expansion of pathogenic fibroblast subpopulations that could constitute novel targets for subpopulation-specific therapeutic intervention.</p><p>Collectively, we report that <italic>Mir221</italic> and <italic>Mir222</italic> lead to enhanced disease progression in a mouse model of inflammatory polyarthritis due to increased pathogenic SF proliferation under inflammatory conditions, mainly through downregulation of cell cycle inhibitors. Finally, <italic>Mir221</italic>/222 gene activity is increased in the pathogenic and expanding intermediate and destructive lining clusters. Thus, mesenchymal targeting of <italic>Mir221/222</italic> could potentially serve as a therapeutic tool for treating RA and their expression could be used as biomarkers for predicting disease outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Human TNF transgenic (huTNFtg), Tnfr1<sup>-/-</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rothe et al., 1993</xref>), and Deleter-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwenk et al., 1995</xref>) mice have been previously described.
