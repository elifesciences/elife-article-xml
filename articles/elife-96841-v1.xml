However, given the low affinity of known DVL2 self-interaction sites and its low cellular concentration, it is unclear how polymers can form. Here, we detect oligomeric DVL2 complexes at endogenous protein levels in human cell lines, using a biochemical ultracentrifugation assay. We identify a low-complexity region (LCR4) in the C-terminus whose deletion and fusion decreased and increased the complexes, respectively. Notably, LCR4-induced complexes correlated with the formation of microscopically visible multimeric condensates. Adjacent to LCR4, we mapped a conserved domain (CD2) promoting condensates only. Molecularly, LCR4 and CD2 mediated DVL2 self-interaction via aggregating residues and phenylalanine stickers, respectively. Point mutations inactivating these interaction sites impaired Wnt pathway activation by DVL2. Our study discovers DVL2 complexes with functional importance for Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover, we provide evidence that DVL2 condensates form in two steps by pre-oligomerization via high-affinity interaction sites, such as LCR4, and subsequent condensation via low-affinity interaction sites, such as CD2.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dishevelled</kwd><kwd>DVL2</kwd><kwd>Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>biomolecular condensates</kwd><kwd>paralogs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BE 1550/12-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Behrens</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BE 7055/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernkopf</surname><given-names>Dominic B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008672</institution-id><institution>Wilhelm Sander-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018.017.2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernkopf</surname><given-names>Dominic B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research, Erlangen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>D30</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernkopf</surname><given-names>Dominic B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GA22-25365S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bryja</surname><given-names>Vítězslav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical detection of endogenous, paralog-specific DVL2 complexes, molecular characterization of underlying protein domains and functional evidence for their importance extend the knowledge of Wnt pathway regulation through DVL2 biomolecular condensates.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway promotes the proliferation of stem cells, orchestrating self-renewal and regeneration of epithelial tissues in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clevers et al., 2014</xref>). Deregulation of the pathway has been causally associated with severe pathologies, most prominently colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>). In the absence of Wnt ligands, β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling is continuously silenced via glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B)-mediated phosphorylation targeting β-catenin for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stamos and Weis, 2013</xref>). Phosphorylation of β-catenin is induced by the scaffold protein AXIN1, which interacts with β-catenin and GSK3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stamos and Weis, 2013</xref>). Upon binding of Wnt ligands to frizzled receptors and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6) co-receptors, the positive Wnt pathway regulator dishevelled 2 (DVL2) interacts with frizzled and clusters beneath the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">MacDonald and He, 2012</xref>). DVL2 clusters recruit AXIN1 and GSK3B from the cytosol, and together these proteins assemble sphere-like signalosomes at the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bilic et al., 2007</xref>). Within these signalosomes, GSK3B activity is redirected from β-catenin to LRP5/6 and finally inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bilic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taelman et al., 2010</xref>). In consequence, β-catenin accumulates and can translocate into the nucleus, where it promotes transcription of its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behrens et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by DVL2 crucially depends on DVL2 polymerization via its N-terminal DIX domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kishida et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007a</xref>). However, the low auto-affinity of the DIX domain in the mid-micromolar range and the low cellular concentration of DVL2 strongly disfavor polymerization, and only the pre-clustering of DVL2 at Wnt-receptor-complexes is suggested to overcome this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bienz, 2014</xref>). Mechanistically, DVL2 polymerization may support DVL2 clustering, AXIN1 recruitment, and/or signalosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bilic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007b</xref>). When DVL2 is overexpressed, DIX-mediated polymerization gives rise to microscopically visible DVL2 assemblies, which are sphere-like, membrane-free, and highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2005</xref>). Recently, these DVL2 assemblies were characterized as phase-separated biomolecular condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2022</xref>), which represent a functionally diverse class of membrane-free cell organelles with common biophysical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>). In addition to the DIX domain, other parts of the protein contribute to DVL2 condensation and activity, such as the DEP domain or an intrinsically disordered region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gammons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vamadevan et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that major regions of DVL2 are evolutionarily optimized for condensation. Moreover, condensation of DVL2 appears to be a regulated process controlled through posttranslational modification, such as ubiquitination, and depending on its conformation, open versus close form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vamadevan et al., 2022</xref>). However, there is still a controversial debate on whether DVL2 forms condensates at endogenous expression levels, as recent studies report only small DVL2 assemblies with less than 10 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kan et al., 2020</xref>), or only one big DVL2 condensate at the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schubert et al., 2022</xref>), or about 100 condensates per cell with sizes of 0.2–0.5 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, three DVL paralogs exist, DVL1, DVL2, and DVL3. Although overexpression of each paralog activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, loss-of-function studies consistently report that DVL1, DVL2, and DVL3 exhibit different capabilities to transduce Wnt signals and that overexpression of one paralog does not compensate for the loss of another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paclíková et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, these studies point to non-redundant molecular functions of the DVL paralogs, yet, their molecular differences remain poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we report biochemical evidence for endogenous DVL2 complexes consisting of at least eight molecules, supporting the idea of DVL2 polymerization at endogenous expression levels. Using DVL2 deletion and point mutants, we mapped and characterized a low-complexity region in the DVL2 C-terminus that promoted complex formation through mediating intermolecular DVL2 self-interaction. Our data suggest that these complexes most likely represent underlying substructures of DVL2 biomolecular condensates, which precede and initiate condensation. Moreover, the discovered oligomeric DVL2 complexes were of functional importance because point mutations that impaired complex formation attenuated Wnt pathway activation by DVL2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endogenous DVL2 forms oligomeric complexes</title><p>Performing ultracentrifugation assays, endogenous DVL2 (79 kDa) penetrated far deeper into a sucrose density gradient than AXIN1 (96 kDa) in spite of its lower molecular weight, indicating that DVL2 forms protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and E</xref>). Noteworthy, most DVL2 molecules appeared to be engaged in these complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The complexes occurred in different cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and were detectable with two, siRNA-validated antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). DVL2 (79 kDa) showed a fractionation pattern similar to thyroglobulin (669 kDa), a commercial molecular weight marker, suggesting DVL2 complex sizes of about eight molecules assuming homotypic complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). As a control, AXIN1 (96 kDa) showed a fractionation pattern similar to albumin (66 kDa) suggesting monomeric precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Interestingly, the DVL2 complexes appeared to be paralog-specific because complexes were almost absent for DVL1 and DVL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The persistence of the complexes at low protein concentrations in cellular extracts indicated that they form via interaction sites with rather high affinity. Although the DIX domain is the best-characterized polymerization domain in DVL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bienz, 2014</xref>), its low auto-affinity suggests that it is not involved in the formation of these complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007a</xref>). The striking difference between DVL2 and AXIN1 pointed in the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), since both proteins contain a functional DIX domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kishida et al., 1999</xref>). Consistently, a DIX domain-inhibiting point mutation (DVL2 M2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007a</xref>) did not affect DVL2 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Endogenous dishevelled 2 (DVL2) forms paralog-specific oligomeric complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A,C</bold>) Western blotting for indicated endogenous (<bold>A</bold>) or transiently expressed proteins, detected with anit-HA antibodies (<bold>C</bold>) after fractionation of HEK293T cell lysates via sucrose density ultracentrifugation.

However, additional deletion of the remaining C-terminus (construct 1–418) markedly reduced them further, demonstrating a strong contribution of the deleted residues 521–736 to complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Importantly, decreased protein complexation of DVL2 ΔDEP and 1–418 in ultracentrifugation experiments conspicuously correlated with decreased formation of condensates in immunofluorescence-based assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>) and decreased Wnt pathway activation in reporter assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the DVL2 complexes may be important for signaling activity. To identify candidate regions for a more precise mapping within residues 521–736, we used the SEG algorithm predicting low-complexity regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wootton and Federhen, 1993</xref>), the TANGO algorithm predicting aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez-Escamilla et al., 2004</xref>) and protein alignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sievers et al., 2011</xref>). We identified four low-complexity regions (LCR1-4), which are associated with protein assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martin and Mittag, 2018</xref>), one potential aggregation site embedded in LCR4, and two domains whose evolutionary conservation may point to functional importance (CD1-2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Since the deletion of residues 521–736 showed strong effects when combined with the DEP deletion (1–418 vs ΔDEP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we performed the following mapping in the ΔDEP context. Given the good correlation between complexes and condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>), we decided to use immunofluorescence-based analysis of condensates for mapping, as it is more convenient than density gradient ultracentrifugation. Upon individual deletion of the six identified regions LCR1-4 and CD1-2, only deletion of LCR4 and CD2 decreased condensate formation and Wnt pathway activation of DVL2 ΔDEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Combined deletion of LCR4 and CD2 increased the effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). We, therefore, consider the two adjacent regions as one functional unit, hereafter referred to as condensate forming region (CFR). DVL2 ΔDEP-ΔCFR exhibited a marked decrease in the number of cells with condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>), in the number of condensates per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>) and in Wnt pathway activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), similar to 1–418. Importantly, individual or combined fusion of LCR4 and CD2 to 1–418 sufficed to induce condensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1D-G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2A and B</xref>) and Wnt pathway activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>), rendering 1–418+CFR as active as ΔDEP. Mutational inactivation of the DIX domain (1–418+CFR M2) abolished condensates demonstrating that the DIX domain is required for CFR-mediated condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Interestingly, the investigated DVL2 mutant proteins predominantly formed nuclear condensates in contrast to the cytosolic condensates of WT DVL2, most likely, because a nuclear export signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) was deleted in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, investigating only cells with cytosolic condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>) revealed similar differences between the DVL2 mutants as were observed when investigating mainly cells with nuclear condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting that the detected differences are not due to nuclear localization but reflect the overall condensation capacity of the DVL2 mutants. Moreover, fusion of CFR to the isolated DVL2 DIX or AXIN1 DAX domain sufficed to trigger condensation, which was prevented by M2/M3 mutation of the DIX/DAX domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D,G and H</xref>). Thus, loss- and gain-of-function experiments identified CFR as the crucial region for condensation and Wnt pathway activation within the DVL2 C-Terminus, which functionally cooperates with the DIX domain.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The dishevelled 2 (DVL2) C-terminus promotes complexes, condensates, and activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) To scale schemes of DVL2 constructs with the DIX, the PDZ, and the DEP domain.

Indeed, CFR deletion from ΔDEP (ΔDEP-ΔCFR) and fusion with 1–418 (1–418+CFR) decreased and increased complexes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). Moreover, replacing the respective sequence in DVL1 with the CFR of DVL2 (DVL1-CFR<sup>DVL2</sup>) promoted complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). Surprisingly, only LCR4 but not CD2 was required for complex formation when deleted from ΔDEP or mediated complex formation when fused to 1–418 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>), although both parts were required for condensate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

To analyze the role of a putative aggregation site (aggregon) that was predicted by the TANGO algorithm within LCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), we designed mutations of two key valine residues (VV-AA) predicted to prevent aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). LCR4 VV-AA mutation of DVL2 ΔDEP decreased condensate formation as efficiently as LCR4 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>), and fusion of VV-AA-mutated LCR4 failed to increase condensate formation of 1–418, in contrast to WT LCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). In CD2, the TANGO algorithm did not predict aggregation sites. However, we detected interspersed phenylalanine residues in CD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which might promote interaction through stacking of their aromatic rings, acting as ‘stickers’ of unstructured regions, as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin et al., 2020</xref>). CD2 FF-AA mutation decreased condensate formation and Wnt pathway activation as efficiently as CD2 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and CD2 FF-AA fusion failed to increase condensate formation or Wnt pathway activation, in contrast to WT CD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). Our data suggest that CFR is a bipartite protein interaction site for self-association of DVL2. In line with this, the isolated CFR, which exhibited a homogeneous cellular distribution when expressed alone, accumulated within DVL2 condensates upon co-expression of both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>), suggesting CFR-DVL2 interaction. CFR VV-AA FF-AA mutation markedly reduced this CFR-DVL2 co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Moreover, DVL2 CFR did not co-localize with DVL1 or DVL3 condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>), consistent with the low conservation of the LCR4 aggregon in these paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Notably, co-expression of the isolated CFR inhibited Wnt pathway activation by DVL2 in a dosage-dependent manner, which was attenuated by CFR FF-AA mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In this experiment, free CFR might weaken DVL2-DVL2 interaction by saturating the interaction surface of the CFR within DVL2. Together, our data provide evidence that CFR mediates intermolecular DVL2 self-interaction via an aggregation site in LCR4 and phenylalanine stickers in CD2. Since individual deletion of LCR4 or CD2 was sufficient to impair condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), both interaction sites most likely cooperate to drive the condensate formation of DVL2.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Low-complexity region (LCR4) and conserved domain (CD2) cooperatively mediate dishevelled 2 (DVL2)-DVL2 self-interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Condensate forming region (CFR) amino acid sequence with highlighted LCR4 (green) and CD2 (magenta).

To study the nature of CFR-mediated condensates, we treated cells expressing DVL2, 1–418+CFR, or DIX+CFR with a hypoosmolar buffer (osmotic shock) or with the bivalent alcohol 1,6-hexanediol, as previously done in biomolecular condensate research to challenge phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2002</xref>).

Although we investigated several scaffold proteins with various endogenous interactors in this assay, we only observed such complexes for DVL2 and AXIN2 and they were specifically associated with aggregating protein sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernkopf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miete et al., 2022</xref>), indicating that most types of protein-protein interactions are not preserved in this assay. Furthermore, overexpressed DVL2 did not exhibit reduced complex sizes, as one would have expected, if limited endogenous interactors had been part of the complexes. Therefore, we think that the detected complexes most likely reflect homotypic DVL2 assemblies, which would then be about eight molecules in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The size of the complexes was reminiscent of previously described endogenous DVL2 oligomers identified via TIRF imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kan et al., 2020</xref>). Through deletion analysis, we discovered a 14 aa long LCR4 in the DVL2 C-terminus mediating complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>) and condensate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). An adjacent 38 aa long, evolutionary CD2 was required for the formation of DVL2 condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and we conceptually combined LCR4 and CD2 as CFR. Molecularly, an aggregon in LCR4 and phenylalanine residues in CD2 mediated DVL2 assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–G</xref>). The latter may promote protein interaction via sticking of their aromatic rings, as previously described for phase-separating proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin et al., 2020</xref>). Co-localization of the isolated CFR with DVL2 indicated that CFR may mediate DVL2-DVL2 interaction, and this was prevented by specific point mutations targeting the aggregon in LCR4 and the phenylalanine stickers in CD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Treatments that challenge phase separation diffused CFR-induced condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>), in line with a recent report showing that DVL2 condensates form via phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2022</xref>). Importantly, point mutations that inhibit CFR self-interaction markedly attenuated Wnt pathway activation by DVL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Especially in <italic>DVL1/2/3</italic> triple knockout cells, the DVL2 CFR point mutant VV-AA FF-AA was as signaling deficient as the DIX domain M2 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>), which is frequently used for DVL2 inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007a</xref>). In these cells, mere DVL2 VV-AA FF-AA overexpression almost completely failed to activate the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), and its re-expression at close to endogenous levels only poorly rescued activation of the pathway through Wnt ligands, which was disrupted by the DVL knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1K</xref>). We thus identified a novel DVL2 region that promotes complex formation, condensate formation, and Wnt pathway activation.</p><p>Our study provides deeper insights into the assembly of multimeric DVL2 condensates. The complexes detected by ultracentrifugation showed sizes of about eight DVL2 molecules, which were irrespective of expression levels as they were similar between endogenous and overexpressed DVL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Therefore, the complexes cannot be identical with the known microscopically visible condensates, containing thousands of molecules. These oligomeric complexes thus existed in parallel to the condensates or constituted a condensate substructure. Analysis of mutant DVL2 proteins revealed that DVL2 contains domains that promote both complexes and condensates, such as LCR4 and DEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and domains that promote only condensates but not complexes, such as CD2 and DIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, all DVL2 mutations that reduced complexes also affected condensates. Therefore, we suggest that the oligomeric complexes are required for and possibly represent substructures of the multimeric condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). As the stability of complexes at low protein concentrations, e.g., in cellular extracts, indicated a rather high affinity of the underlying interaction sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we hypothesize that complex formation via LCR4 and DEP precedes further assembly of these substructures into condensates via CD2 and DIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our proposed two-step model of DVL2 condensate formation is in line with and supportive of the emerging stickers model for the formation of biomolecular condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). According to this model, oligomerization via one interaction site can drive subsequent condensate formation by increasing the valence of another interaction site (=sticker) of the oligomer compared to a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). The proposed two-step model would increase the options for regulating the polymerization of DVL2 by modulating the oligomerization step or the condensate formation step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). DVL2 polymerization is crucial for Wnt signal transduction. However, the low DVL2 concentration and the low DIX-DIX affinity strongly disfavor polymerization, and clustering of DVL2 at activated Wnt-receptor complexes is suggested to overcome this limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bienz, 2014</xref>). Pre-oligomerization of DVL2 via high-affinity interactions as identified in the ultracentrifugation assay might facilitate Wnt-induced polymerization.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Two-step model of DVL2 condensate formation.</title><p>Schematic illustration of DVL2 domains mediating the formation of oligomeric complexes, such as LCR4 and the DEP domain (green rectangles) and of sticker domains mediating condensate formation, such as CD2 and the DIX domain (magenta circles).

Binding of the very C-terminus of DVL2 to its PDZ domain results in a closed protein conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). It has been suggested that this closed conformation limits the accessibility of the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region that promotes condensate formation, thereby suppressing DVL2 condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vamadevan et al., 2022</xref>). It is very intriguing to speculate that condensate formation will be additionally suppressed in the closed conformation by limiting the accessibility of CFR because only one amino acid separates the identified crucial phenylalanine residues of CFR from the PDZ binding motif in the DVL2 C-terminus. Notably, Wnt ligands induce the open DVL conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harnoš et al., 2019</xref>), which will increase the CFR accessibility and, according to our model, would allow LCR4 and CD2 to contribute to pre-oligomerization and subsequent condensate formation of DVL2, respectively.</p><p>Several studies suggest functional differences between the DVL paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gentzel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paclíková et al., 2021</xref>), while the underlying molecular differences remain unclear. Notably, complex formation as revealed by ultracentrifugation was only observed for DVL2 and not for DVL1 or DVL3, revealing a marked difference between the paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, CFR did not co-localize with DVL1 or DVL3 in contrast to DVL2, indicating that CFR-mediated DVL2-DVL2 interaction, which most likely drove DVL2 complexation, is absent from DVL1 and DVL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Consistently, the crucial CFR aggregon located in LCR4 was not conserved in DVL1 or DVL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Moreover, replacing the complementary part of DVL1 with the DVL2 CFR promoted complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>). Although DVL1 and DVL3 lack the discovered CFR, all three DVL paralogs are able to form condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>) and to activate Wnt signaling to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paclíková et al., 2021</xref>), which can be potentially explained by the other interaction sites (DIX, DEP, intrinsically disordered region). However, quantitative studies suggest functional differences between the paralogs and that they have to cooperate at a certain molar ratio for optimal Wnt pathway activation, with DVL2 being the most abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paclíková et al., 2021</xref>). In this context, the DVL2 condensates with their underlying stable complexes may function as a kind of super scaffold for the integration of DVL1 and DVL3. Our findings may help to understand the functional differences between the paralogs in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>DVL2</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1856</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-3216</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HeLa</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CCL-2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">U2OS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HTB-96</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">T-REx</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paclíková et al., 2017</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DVL tKO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paclíková et al., 2017</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">T-REx cells with <italic>DVL1/2/3</italic> triple knockout</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DVL tKO+</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paclíková et al., 2021</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">T-REx cells with <italic>DVL1/2/3</italic>, <italic>RNF43</italic> and <italic>ZNRF3</italic> penta knockout</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-DVL2 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CellSignaling</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 3216 S;</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-DVL2 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CellSignaling</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 3224 S</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-AXIN1 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CellSignaling</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: 2087 S</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">siRNA to DVL2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dharmacon/Thermo Fisher Scientific;

It builds upon existing research by investigating the endogenous complexes of DVL2 using ultracentrifugation and contrasting them with DVL1 and DVL3 behavior. The study identifies a DVL2-specific region involved in condensate formation and introduces the &quot;two-step&quot; concept of DVL2 condensate formation, enriching the field's knowledge.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A notable strength of this study is the validation of endogenous DVL2 complexes, providing insights into its behavior compared to DVL1 and DVL3. The functional validation of the DVL C-terminus here termed conserved domain 2 (CD2) and the identification of DVL2-specific regions (here termed LCR4) involved in condensate formation are significant contributions that complement the current knowledge on the importance of DVL DIX domain, DEP domain and intrinsically disordered regions between DIX and PDZ domains. Additionally, the introduction of the concept where oligomerization (step 1) precedes condensate formation (step 2) is an interesting hypothesis, which can be further experimentally challenged in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for her/his interest in our work and for acknowledging our significant contributions to the understanding of DVL2 phase separation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>However, the applicability of the findings to full-length DVL2 protein, hence the physiological relevance, is limited. This is mostly due to the fact that the authors almost completely depend on the set of DVL2 mutants, which lack the (i) DEP domain and (ii) nuclear export signal (NES). These variants fail to establish DEP domain-mediated interactions, including those with FZD receptors. Of note, the DEP domain itself represents a dimerization/tetramerization interface, which could affect the protein condensate formation of these mutants. Possibly even more importantly, the used mutants localize into the nucleus, which has different biochemical &amp; biophysical properties than a cytoplasm, where DVL typically reside, which in turn affects the condensate formation. On top, in the nucleus, most of the DVL binding partners, including relevant kinases, which were reported to affect protein condensate formation, are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>The most convincing way to address this valid concern and to support a physiological relevant role of our findings is to extend our experiments with full-length DVL2, which we did alongside the suggestion in point two (please see below). In addition, we address the specific issues as follows:</p><p>We completely agree that interaction through the DEP domain contributes to condensate formation, which was thoroughly demonstrated in great studies by Melissa Gammons and Mariann Bienz, and complex formation (Fig. 2B, C). We deleted this domain on purpose for our mapping experiments, since we obtained more consistent results without any additional contribution of the DEP domain. Once we mapped CFR and identified crucial amino acids within CFR (VV, FF), we demonstrated that CFR-mediated interaction contributes to complex formation, condensate formation and pathway activation in the context of full-length DVL2 (Fig. 7A-G).</p><p>We also agree that the nuclear localization may affect condensate formation because of the reasons mentioned by the reviewer or others, such as differences in DVL2 protein concentration. However, later proof-of-concept experiments in full-length DVL2 confirmed that CFR and its identified crucial amino acids (VV, FF), which were mapped in this rather artificial nuclear context, contribute to the typical cytosolic condensate formation of DVL2 (Fig. 7C, D). Moreover, we also observed cells with cytosolic condensates for the NES-lacking DVL2 constructs, although to a lower extent as compared to cells with nuclear condensates. A new analysis of NES-lacking key constructs focusing exclusively on cells with cytosolic condensates revealed similar differences between the DVL2 mutants as were observed before when investigating cells with nuclear (and cytosolic) condensates (new Fig. S3E, F), suggesting that the detected differences are not due to nuclear localization but reflect the overall condensation capacity.</p><p>In addition, our condensate-challenging experiments (osmotic shock, 1,6-hexandiol) suggested that cytosolic condensates of full-length DVL2 and nuclear CFR-mediated condensates of deletion proteins lacking the DEP domain behave quite similar (Fig. 6A-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the use of an overexpression system, while suitable for comparing DVL2 protein condensate features, falls short in functional assays. The study could benefit from employing established &quot;rescue systems&quot; using DVL1/2/3 knockout cells and re-expression of DVL variants for more robust functional assessments.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the suggested established rescue system of DVL1/2/3 knockout cells (T-REx <italic>DVL1/2/3</italic> triple knockout cells and T-REx <italic>DVL1/2/3 RNF43 ZNRF3</italic> penta knockout cells, which are even more sensitive towards DVL re-expression as they lack RNF43/ZNRF3-mediated degradation of DVL activating receptors; both cell lines from the Bryja lab). Upon overexpression, our key mutants DVL2 VV-AA FF-AA and ∆CFR showed markedly reduced pathway activation compared to WT DVL2 (new Figs. 7F and S5J), as we observed before. Especially in the <italic>DVL1/2/3</italic> triple knockout cells, DVL2 VV-AA FF-AA hardly activated the pathway and was as inactive as the established M2 mutant (new Fig. 7F). Most importantly, while re-expression of WT DVL2 at close to endogenous expression levels fully rescued Wnt3a-induced pathway activation in <italic>DVL1/2/3</italic> knockout cells, DVL2 VV-AA FF-AA revealed significantly reduced rescue capacity and was almost as inactive as DVL2 M2 (new Figs. 7G and S5K).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the discussion and introduction overlook some essential aspects of DVL biology. One such example is the importance of the open/close conformation of DVL and its effects on DVL phase separation and activity. In the context of this study, it is important to say that this conformational plasticity is mediated by DVL C-terminus (CD2 in this study). The second example is the reported roles of DVL1 and DVL3, which can both mediate the Wnt3a signal. How this can be interpreted when DVL1 and DVL3 lack LCR4 and still form condensates?</p></disp-quote><p>We included the open/close conformation of DVL in our manuscript (introduction p. 3 and new discussion paragraph p. 10) and discussed it in the context of our findings. It is intriguing to speculate that Wnt-induced opening of DVL2 increases the accessibility of LCR4 and CD2, thereby triggering pre-oligomerization and subsequent phase separation of DVL2 (see discussion).</p><p>We extended the last paragraph of the discussion to interpret the roles of DVL1 and DVL3 lacking LCR4 (see p. 10). In short, the general ability of DVL1 and DVL3 to form condensates and to activate the Wnt pathway can be potentially explained through the other interaction sites (DIX, DEP, intrinsically disordered region). However, previous studies suggest that the DVL paralogs exhibit (quantitative) differences in Wnt pathway activation and that all three paralogs have to interact at a certain ratio for optimal pathway activation. In this context, a physiologic role for DVL2 LCR4 may be to promote the formation of these DVL1/2/3 assemblies and/or to enhance the stability of these assemblies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In order to increase the physiological relevance of the study, I would recommend analyzing several key mutants in the context of the full-length DVL2 protein using the rescue/complementation system. Further, a more thorough discussion and connections with the existing literature on DVL protein condensates/puncta/LLPS can improve the impact of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for her/his suggestions to improve our study, which we addressed as detailed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors aimed to identify which regions of DVL2 contribute to its endogenous/basal clustering, as well as the relevance of such domains to condensate/phase separation and WNT activation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A strength of the study is the focus on endogenous DVL2 to set up the research questions, as well as the incorporation of various techniques to tackle it.

For example:</p><p>(1) Although endogenous DVL2 indeed seems to form complexes (Figure 1A), neither the number of proteins involved nor whether those are homo-complexes can be determined with a density gradient. Super-resolution imaging or structural analyses are needed to support these claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it will be very interesting to study the nature of the detected endogenous complexes in detail and we will consider this for any follow-up study, as structural analyses were out of scope for the revision of the presented manuscript. To address the issue, we mentioned that the calculation of about eight DVL2 molecules per complex is based on the assumption of homotypic complexes (results p. 4) and we discussed, why we think that homotypic complexes are the most likely assumption based on the currently available (limited) data (discussion p. 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Follow-up analyses of the relevance of the DVL2 domains solely rely on overexpressed proteins. However, there were previous questions arising from o/e studies that prompted the focus on endogenous, physiologically relevant DVL interactions, clustering, and condensate formation.</p><p>Although the title, conclusions, and relevance all point to the importance of this study for understanding endogenous complexes, only Figures 1A and B deal with endogenous DVL2.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the biochemical detection of endogenous DVL2 complexes itself represents a valuable contribution to the understanding of endogenous DVL clustering, especially (i) since it is still lively discussed in the field whether and to which extent endogenous DVL assemblies exist (see introduction) and (ii) since recent studies addressing this issue rely on fluorescent tagging of the endogenous protein, which, among all benefits, harbors the risk to artificially affect DVL assembly. The follow-up analysis predominantly strengthens this key finding through (i) associating the detected complexes with established (DEP domain) and newly mapped (LCR4) DVL2 interaction sites, which we think is crucial to validate our biochemical approach, and (ii) linking the complexes with condensate formation and pathway activation for functional insights.</p><p>In addition, we performed new experiments with re-expression of DVL2 and our key mutants at close to endogenous expression levels in <italic>DVL1/2/3</italic> knockout cells, supporting a physiological relevant role of our findings (new Figs. 7G and S5K, please also see point (5) below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Mutants lacking activity/complex formation, e.g. DVL2_1-418, may need further validation. For instance, DVL2_1-506 (same mutant but with DEP) seems to form condensates and it is functional in WNT signalling (King et al., 20223). These differences could be caused by the lack of DEP domain in this particular construct and/or folding differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We would definitely expect that DVL2 1-506 exhibits increased condensate formation and pathway activation as compared to DVL2 1-418, since the DEP domain was thoroughly characterized as interaction domain in the Bienz lab and the Gammons lab (see references), which we confirmed in our assays (Fig. 2B-D). However, as the DEP domain is an established DVL2 interaction site, we were not interested to further characterize the DEP domain but to explain the marked difference in complex formation between DVL2 ∆DEP and 1-418 (Fig. 2A-C), which could not be associated with any known DVL2 interaction site and which we finally mapped to CFR (Fig. 4A-D).</p><p>Since fusion of the newly-characterized interaction site CFR to DVL2 1-418 (1-418+CFR) rescued complex formation, condensate formation and signaling activity (Fig. 3B-E and Fig. 4C, D), we think that the lacking activity/complex formation of DVL2 1-418 is more likely due to missing interaction sites than due to folding problems. However, as it is hard to exclude folding differences of deletion mutants, we confirmed the CFR activity through loss-of-function experiments in the context of fulllength DVL2 with minimal point mutations (Fig. 7A-G, VV,FF).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The key mutants, DeltaCFR and VV/FF only show mild phenotypes. The authors' results suggest that these regions contribute but are not necessary for (1) complex formation (Density gradient Figures 7A and B), condensate formation (Figures 7C and D), and WNT activity (Figure 7E). Of note Figure 7C shows examples for the mutants with no condensates while the qualification indicates that 50% of the cells do have condensates.</p></disp-quote><p>Condensate formation and Wnt pathway activation by DVL VV-AA FF-AA were reduced by more than 50% as compared to WT (Fig. 7D, E). We consider these marked differences, since loss of function always ranges between 0% and 100%. In newly performed experiments in <italic>DVL1/2/3</italic> knockout cells, the differences were even more pronounced, see point (5) below.</p><p>Yes, Fig. 7C shows an example to qualitatively visualize the change in condensate formation, while Fig. 7D provides the corresponding quantification allowing quantitative assessment of the differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Most of the o/e analyses (including all reporter assays) should be performed in DVL1-3 KO cells in order to explore specifically the behaviour of the investigated mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we employed <italic>DVL1/2/3</italic> knockout cells for performing reporter assays (T-REx <italic>DVL1/2/3</italic> triple knockout cells and T-REx <italic>DVL1/2/3 RNF43 ZNRF3</italic> penta knockout cells, which are even more sensitive towards DVL re-expression as they lack RNF43/ZNRF3-mediated degradation of DVL activating receptors; both cell lines from the Bryja lab). Here, we focused on key mutants in the context of full-length DVL2, as they are closest to the physiologic situation. Upon overexpression, DVL2 VV-AA FF-AA and DVL2 ∆CFR showed markedly reduced pathway activation as compared to WT DVL2 (new Figs. 7F and S5J). Especially in the <italic>DVL1/2/3</italic> triple knockout cells, DVL2 VV-AA FF-AA hardly activated the pathway and was as inactive as the established M2 mutant (new Fig. 7F). Moreover, re-expression at close to endogenous expression levels revealed that DVL2 VV-AA FF-AA less efficiently rescued Wnt3a-induced pathway activation as compared to WT (Figs. 7G and S5K).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) How comparable are condensates found in the cytoplasm (usually for wt DVL) with those located in the nucleus (DEP mutants)?</p></disp-quote><p>In principal, cytosolic condensates could differ from nuclear condensates due to various reasons, such as e.g. different protein concentration, different availability of interaction partners or different biochemical/biophysical properties (please also see point 1 of reviewer 1). In our condensatechallenging experiments (osmotic shock, 1,6-hexandiol), cytosolic condensates of full-length DVL2 and nuclear condensates of DVL2 mutants behaved quite similar (Fig. 6A-C).</p><p>We are confident that the differences between different DEP mutants in our mapping experiments are not due to nuclear localization but reflect the overall condensation capacity because later proofof-concept experiments demonstrated that CFR, which was identified in these mapping experiments, contributes to cytosolic condensate formation in the context of full-length DVL2 (Fig. 7C, D). Moreover, a new analysis focusing only on cells with cytosolic condensates, which can also be observed for DEP mutants to a low extent, revealed similar differences between key DEP mutants as observed before (Fig. S3E, F; for details please also see point 1 of reviewer 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several studies in the last two decades have analysed the relevance of DVL homo - and heteroclustering by relying on overexpressed proteins. Recent studies also explored the possibility of DVL undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation following similar principles. As highlighted by the authors in the introduction, there is a need to understand DVL dynamics under endogenous/physiological conditions. Recent super-resolution studies aimed at that question by characterising endogenously edited DVL2. The authors seemed to aim in the same direction with their initial findings (Figure 1A) but quickly moved to o/e proteins without going back to the initial question. This reviewer thinks that to support their conclusions and advance in this important question, the authors should introduce the relevant mutations in the endogenous locus (e.g. by Cas9+ donor template encoding the required 3' exons, as done by others before for WNT components, including DVL2) and determine their impact in the above-indicated processes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that genomic editing of the DVL2 locus would be the cleanest system to study the relevance of CFR at endogenous expression levels. As we did not have the resources to generate the suggested cells, we, as an alternative, transiently re-expressed DVL2 and the respective mutants at low levels that were really close to the endogenous expression levels in <italic>DVL1/2/3</italic> triple knockout cells (Fig. S5K). These experiments revealed that DVL2 VV-AA FF-AA less efficiently rescued Wnt3ainduced pathway activation as compared to DVL2 WT (Fig. 7G).</p></body></sub-article></article>
