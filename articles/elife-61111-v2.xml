Tissue and organ morphogenesis rely on cellular branching mechanisms that can be multicellular or arise within a single-cell. Through extensive cellular remodelling, this so-called single-cell or subcellular branching, transforms an initially relatively symmetrical unbranched cell into an elaborate branched structure. These cellular remodelling events are triggered by widespread cytoskeletal changes and cell membrane growth, which allow these branched cells to span very large areas and accomplish their final function. Despite this clear link between morphology and function, not much is known about the signalling events that trigger the formation of these subcellular branches or what makes them choose a particular trajectory within the cytoplasm of the cell.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, tracheal system terminal cells (TCs) and nervous system dendrites are models for these subcellular branching processes. During tracheal embryonic through larval development, the generation of single-cell branched structures by TCs is characterised by extensive remodelling of the MT network and actin cytoskeleton, followed by vesicular transport and membrane dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervais and Casanova, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sigurbjörnsdóttir et al., 2014</xref>). During embryonic development, TCs, as tip-cells, lead multicellular branch migration and extension in response to Bnl-Btl signalling, which induces the expression of <italic>Drosophila</italic> serum response factor (DSRF/<italic>blistered (bs)</italic>) and its downstream effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Affolter et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Posern and Treisman, 2006</xref>). Although epithelial in origin, TCs do not have a canonical apical-basal polarity, and, as they migrate, extend numerous filopodia on their basolateral membrane, generating transient protrusive branches at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lebreton and Casanova, 2014</xref>). As a consequence, they display a polarity similar to that of a migrating mesenchymal cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While migrating and elongating, the TC invaginates a subcellular tube from its apical membrane, at the contact site with the stalk cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervais and Casanova, 2010</xref>). The generation of this de novo subcellular lumen can be considered the beginning of the single-cell branching morphogenesis of this cell, which continues throughout larval stages to generate an elaborate single-cell branched structure with many subcellular lumina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best, 2019</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that centrosomes are key players in the initiation of subcellular branching events during embryogenesis. Here, they act as microtubule organising centres (MTOCs) mediating the formation of single or multiple-branched structures depending on their numbers in the TC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ricolo et al., 2016</xref>). Centrosomes organise the growth of MT-bundles toward the elongating basolateral edge of the TC. These MTs have been suggested to serve both as trafficking mediators, guiding vesicles for delivery of membrane material, and as mechanical and structural stabilisers for the new subcellular lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best, 2019</xref>). Actin filaments are present at the growing tip, the basolateral and the luminal membrane of the TC, and actin-regulating factors such as DSRF, Enabled (Ena) and Moesin (Moe) have been shown to contribute to TC morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervais and Casanova, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guillemin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schottenfeld-Roames et al., 2014</xref>). During TC elongation, the lumen extends along with the cell, stabilizing the elongating cell body and maintaining a more or less constant distance between its own tip and the migrating tip of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervais and Casanova, 2010</xref>). At the TC basolateral side, a dynamic actin pool integrates the filopodia and aligns the growing subcellular tube with the elongation axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">JayaNandanan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Okenve-Ramos and Llimargas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oshima et al., 2006</xref>). Together, MT-bundles and the basolateral actin pool are necessary for subcellular lumen formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervais and Casanova, 2010</xref>). However, not much is known on how these two cytoskeletal structures are coordinated within the TC.</p><p>By the time the larva hatches, TCs have elongated and grown a full-length lumen, which becomes gas-filled along with the rest of the tracheal system. In the larva, terminal cells ramify extensively and form many new cytoplasmatic extensions each with a membrane-bound lumen creating tiny subcellular tubes that supply the targets with oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghabrial et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whitten, 1957</xref>). At larval stages, sprouting and extension of new branches in response to local hypoxia is generally considered to occur by essentially the same molecular mechanisms as the initial tube invagination and cell extension in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jarecki et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sigurbjörnsdóttir et al., 2014</xref>). However, not much is known about how hypoxic signalling is transduced into cytoskeletal modulation to achieve the single-cell branching morphogenesis of the TC. Also, what coordinates the crosstalk between microtubules and actin at the basolateral growing tip, how cell elongation is stabilised by lumen formation and how both processes remain coordinated is still poorly understood in both embryonic and larval TCs.</p><p>Spectraplakins are giant conserved cytoskeletal proteins with a complex multidomain architecture capable of binding MTs and actin. They have been reported to crosslink MT minus-ends to actin-networks, making MT-bundles more stable and resistant to catastrophe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dogterom and Koenderink, 2019</xref>). Loss of spectraplakins has been shown in vivo to have remarkable effects on microtubule organisation, cell polarity, cell morphology, and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Röper et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suozzi et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> has a single spectraplakin, encoded by <italic>short-stop</italic> (<italic>shot</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregory and Brown, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Röper et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>shot</italic> mutants display pleiotropic phenotypes in wing adhesion, axon and dendrite outgrowth, tracheal fusion, muscle-tendon junction, dorsal closure, oocyte specification and patterning, photoreceptor polarity and perinuclear microtubule network formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregory and Brown, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khanal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Kolodziej, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Kolodziej, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Subramanian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). Shot has been shown to bind both the microtubule plus-end-binding EB1 and the microtubule minus-end-binding protein Patronin, required for the establishment of acentrosomal microtubule networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khanal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nashchekin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Subramanian et al., 2003</xref>). It also has been shown to bind actin and to crosslink MTs and actin contributing to cytoskeletal organisation and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Applewhite et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Booth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Kolodziej, 2002b</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we uncover a novel role for the spectraplakin Shot in subcellular lumen formation and branching.

We show that Shot promotes the crosstalk between microtubules and actin, which leads to the extension and guidance of the subcellular lumen within the TC cytoplasm. We observe that Shot levels are enriched in cells undergoing the initial steps of subcellular branching as a direct response to FGF signalling. And an excess of Shot induces ectopic acentrosomal branching points in the embryonic and larval tracheal TC leading to cells with extra-subcellular lumina.

Since MTs and actin are essential for subcellular lumen formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervais and Casanova, 2010</xref>), we then asked whether supernumerary luminal branching was due to the MT- or the actin-binding domains present in the Shot molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bottenberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voelzmann et al., 2017</xref>). To this end, we overexpressed an isoform of Shot (ShotC-GFP) with a deletion of the first calponin domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K,L</xref>), resulting in a shorter actin-binding domain (ABD), which binds actin very weakly or not at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Kolodziej, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Kolodziej, 2002a</xref>).

Full-length ShotA-GFP localisation can be detected at the cell-junctions, around the crescent lumen, in MT-bundles, and throughout the cytoplasm, whereas ShotC-GFP localised more to the MT/lumen region, in agreement with the lack of actin-binding capability of ShotC isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We then overexpressed the long isoform of Shot (ShotA-GFP aka ShotOE condition) and could not detect extra branching points in TCs, suggesting that more than just an increased Actin-MT crosstalk is needed for the induction of TCs with supernumerary cytoplasmatic extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Nonetheless, overexpression of ShotA, ShotCtail and Tau induced ESL in TCs, with two or more lumina in all TCs analysed (n = 10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–E and H</xref>). Like in embryos, targeted expression of Shot-∆C-tail did not induce ESL in larval TCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F and H</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that Shot is necessary for larval lumen formation and branching and that Actin-MT crosstalk by Shot or Tau is sufficient for ESL formation within each TC cytoplasmatic extension.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Shot and Tau modulate luminal branching in larval TCs.</title><p>Wandering larval (L3) TCs expressing only GFP (<bold>A</bold>) and different Shot and Tau constructs (<bold>B, C, D, E, F</bold>) under the control of a tracheal DSRFGAL4 driver (all except <bold>A</bold> and <bold>E</bold> where the driver used was btlGAL4). (<bold>A, A’</bold>) UASGFP (n = 8) (<bold>B, B’</bold>) UASshotRNAi, UASGFP (n = 8); (<bold>C, C’</bold>) UASShotA-GFP (n = 10); (<bold>D, D’</bold>) UASshotCtail-GFP (n = 8); (<bold>E, E’</bold>) UASTauGFP (n = 8); (<bold>F,F’</bold>) UASshot∆Ctail-GFP (n = 8).

Our work reveals novel insights into the formation of lumina by single-cells. First, that a spectraplakin in involved in the crosstalk between actin and MTs in tracheal TCs and that this crosstalk is necessary for de novo lumen formation. Absence of Shot leads to defects in MT and actin organisation and a profound alteration of the cytoskeleton in TCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,C</xref>). Consequently, membrane delivery is disrupted and a novel subcellular lumen cannot be formed. Second, that once a primary lumen is formed de novo in TCs, neither actin-MT crosstalk, nor supernumerary centrosomes, are necessary for the formation of new supernumerary lumina (ESLs). New lumina can arise from branching points along the length of the pre-existing lumen, only by MT stabilisation by isoforms of Shot lacking entirely the ABD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B,D</xref>). In these cases, we can form ESLs acentrosomally, perhaps from the MTOC activity provided by the gamma-tubulin present along the crescent lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervais and Casanova, 2010</xref>) or by other types of MTOCs. Third, spectraplakin activity is necessary to organise MTs and actin in TCs; without Shot TCs exhibit a disrupted MT and actin cytoskeleton, which can be restored by tissue specific expression of this spectraplakin. Fourth, increased levels of Shot are induced in TCs by DSRF, and Shot can rescue the subcellular lumen formation phenotypes in <italic>bs</italic> mutants. This agrees with previous observations in other systems where <italic>bs</italic> and <italic>shot</italic> mutants display similar phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prout et al., 1997</xref>). And fifth, high-levels of Tau can replace Shot in subcellular lumen formation and branching.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Shot and Tau dynamically modulate the cytoskeleton during subcellular lumen formation.</title><p>Schematic representation of st.16 embryonic (<bold>A, B, C</bold>) and third instar larval (<bold>D</bold>) TCs; cytoplasm is in pink and luminal space in white.

It was observed that Shot accumulates at E-cadherin-dependent contacts between fusion cells and <italic>shot</italic> LOF disrupts this contact leading to cell-fusion phenotypes. In these cells, interactions of Shot with F-actin and microtubules are functionally redundant and both targeted expression of ShotC or ShotA is sufficient to rescue the cell-fusion phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Kolodziej, 2002a</xref>). Our results are more akin to what has been reported in neuronal growth cones, and both actin and MT-binding domains of Shot are required for TC extension and subcellular lumen formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). In neurons, like in tracheal cells, ShotC is unable to rescue the phenotype caused by <italic>shot</italic> LOF, which is only rescued by expression of the full-length ShotA isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Kolodziej, 2002b</xref>). Shot has also been shown to be required for sealing epithelial sheets during dorsal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takács et al., 2017</xref>). In these epithelial cells, Shot acts as a MT-actin crosslinker to regulate proper formation of the MT network. As in the case of tracheal TCs presented here, the actin- and microtubule-binding activities of Shot are simultaneously required in the same molecule, indicating that like in TCs Shot is engaged as a physical crosslinker also during dorsal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takács et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>MTs and the actin cytoskeleton perform many functions in tracheal TCs that are regulated by different actin- and MT-binding proteins. While mediators of actin function, such as Ena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervais and Casanova, 2010</xref>), and of MT function, like D-Lissencephaly-1 (DLis-1), have been identified previously, we show here that Shot is able to mediate crosstalk between MTs and actin during subcellular lumen formation. In Shot LOF conditions, MTs and actin are disorganised. Consequently, this Shot crosslinking function is essential for de novo lumen formation and extension. It has been previously described that in TCs of mutants affected in MT organisation, the actin-network is not perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervais and Casanova, 2010</xref>), so the ‘actin phenotype’ observed in <italic>shot</italic> LOF cannot be a consequence of defects in the MT network. This observation indicates a possible spectraplakin function in organizing TC actin in agreement with previous observations that Shot and ACF7 can promote filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanchez-Soriano et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Shot expression is regulated by DSRF in TCs</title><p>Our results show that molecular levels of Shot are important for cytoskeletal rearrangements, indicating that there is a dosage dependent effect in lumen formation and extension as well as in luminal branching events. Shot is present in many cells during development but Shot level regulation is likely to be more important in cells such as neurons and tracheal terminal cells, due to their morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voelzmann et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>bs</italic>/DSRF is a TC-specific transcription factor, whose expression is triggered by Bnl signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guillemin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sutherland et al., 1996</xref>), and is required for TC cytoskeletal organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervais and Casanova, 2010</xref>). DSRF has also been shown to be necessary not just for the establishment of TC fate, but to ensure the progression of TC elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gervais and Casanova, 2011</xref>). Cytoskeletal organisation and remodelling as well as TC elongation are tightly coupled during subcellular lumen formation and in <italic>bs</italic> mutants actin accumulation was impaired at the TC tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervais and Casanova, 2010</xref>). We observe a similar actin phenotype in Shot mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>) suggesting that the actin defects observed in DSRF mutants may be due to a lower expression of Shot in these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Shot and Tau functionally overlap in subcellular lumen formation and branching</title><p>It has been suggested that spectraplakins functionally overlap with structural microtubule-associated-proteins (MAPs). Shot displays a strong functional overlap with Tau in MT stabilisation leading to the adequate delivery of synaptic proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Voelzmann et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, it has been proposed that a loss of MAP function in mammals results in a relatively mild phenotype due to a functional compensation accomplished by spectraplakins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Riederer, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the effect of the complete lack of Shot function during dorsal closure is very subtle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takács et al., 2017</xref>), hinting that in another <italic>Drosophila</italic> organ, Shot function might have overlaps with other MAPs.</p><p>Our overexpression and genetic data suggest that also in the context of subcellular lumen formation these two proteins functionally overlap. When we tested the tracheal overexpression of <italic>Tau</italic> in <italic>wt</italic> background, we observed extra-subcellular lumina with morphology very similar to the one caused by ShotOE. Moreover, Tau overexpression in tracheal cells was able to rescue the <italic>shot</italic> LOF phenotype similarly to ShotA expression. We propose that Tau’s rescuing capability does not depend only on its classical MT-stabilisation activity, since expression of ShotC and ShotC-tail in tracheal cells was not able to restore subcellular lumen formation. Tau MT-binding is probably just one of its functions in TCs. In fact, Tau has been shown to co-organise dynamic MTs and the actin-network in cell-free systems and growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biswas and Kalil, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabrales Fontela et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elie et al., 2015</xref>). Our rescue and double mutant analyses suggest that in TCs, Shot and Tau functionally overlap in organizing the coordination between MT-bundling and actin cytoskeleton crosstalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Larval lumen formation and branching</title><p>TC subcellular lumen formation starts at embryonic stages but most of its elongation and branching occurs during the extensive body growth of the third instar larva (L3). Some mutants have been reported to generate larger TCs with higher numbers of branches. Such mutants included the Hippo pathway member <italic>warts/lats1</italic> (aka <italic>miracle-gro</italic>), and the TOR pathway inhibitor, <italic>Tsc1</italic> (aka <italic>jolly green giant</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghabrial et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, activation of the FGF Receptor (Btl) pathway in TCs gives rise to ectopic branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jarecki et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, in all these cases, mutant TCs develop a higher number of branches but no reported ESL per branch. In larvae, as in embryonic TCs, actin is present at the basal plasma membrane and at the luminal/apical membrane. The connection between the basal actin network and the outer plasma membrane is made through Talin, which links the network to the extracellular matrix (ECM) via the integrin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levi et al., 2006</xref>). Regulation of the luminal actin is done by Bitesise (Btsz), a Moe interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">JayaNandanan et al., 2014</xref>). These interactions with actin are required for proper TC morphology, and mutations in either the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Talin gene <italic>rhea</italic> or <italic>btsz</italic> induce multiple convoluted lumina per TC branch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">JayaNandanan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levi et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>rhea</italic> and <italic>btsz</italic> ESLs seem to be misguided within the TC and present a series of U-turns and loops we did not observe in <italic>shot</italic> mutants. Also, mutations in <italic>rhea</italic> and <italic>btsz</italic> do not induce embryonic TC luminal phenotypes, suggesting that despite their interactions with actin, the mechanism of action during subcellular lumen formation and stabilisation is different. They do not seem to interact with MTs and they might have a more structural/less dynamic role in larval subcellular lumen formation. Our results suggest that Shot is able to induce larval ESLs by the same mechanism as in embryos. By modulating a dynamic crosstalk between MTs and actin that induces acentrosomal luminal branching. However, albeit necessary for larval luminal branching excess Shot alone is not sufficient to induce extra branching in TCs. Perhaps ShotOE TCs are able branch their subcellular lumen but lack a specific spatial cue to induce single-cell branching. This cue could be such as the one provided by a hypoxic tissue secreting the FGFR ligand, Bnl, which would allow for the cytoplasmic extensions needed to increase single-cell TC branching.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Spectraplakins and lumen formation in other organisms</title><p>The spectraplakin protein family of cytoskeletal regulators is present throughout the animal kingdom. In the most commonly studied model organisms we find VAB-10 in the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and, in vertebrates, dystonin (also known as Bullous Pemphigoid Antigen 1/BPAG1) and Microtubule-Actin Crosslinking Fac- tor 1 (MACF1; also known as Actin Crosslinking Family 7/ACF7, Macrophin, Magellan) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voelzmann et al., 2017</xref>). They are usually strongly expressed in the nervous system and most of their functions have been unraveled by studying nervous system development and axonal cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Spectraplakin roles have also been reported in cell-cell adhesion and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Röper and Brown, 2003</xref>). Recently, attention has gone into the role of spectraplakins not only during normal cellular processes but also in human disease, from neurodegeneration to infection and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). However, not much is known about a role for spectraplakins neither during lumen formation nor during subcellular branching events. Here, we provide evidence for the involvement of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> spectraplakin Shot in subcellular lumen formation and luminal branching. Through its actin- and MT- binding domains, Shot is necessary for subcellular lumen formation and branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This function can be functionally replaced by Tau, another microtubule- associated protein which has been shown to be able to crosslink MTs and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biswas and Kalil, 2018</xref>). A similar crosslink between MTs and actin may in place during vertebrate lumen formation and in other subcellular branching events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>) <break/></td><td valign="top"><italic>shot<sup>3</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td valign="top">BSDC:2282 <break/>FBst0005141</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2000</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>shot<sup>kakP2</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td valign="top">BSDC:29034 <break/>FBst0029034</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregory and Brown, 1998</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>shot<sup>ΔEGC</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">F.

Two probes, to label luminal chitin were used: Fluostain 1:200 (FB28, Sigma), and chitin binding protein CBP 1:500 (produced by N. Martín in J. Casanova Lab). Bright field photographs were taken using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope with a 20X or 40X objective. Photoshop 21.2.4 and Fiji (ImageJ 2.1.0) were used for measurements, adjustments and to assemble figures.

In the last 10 min of pre-hybridisation, probes (1:100 in hybridisation buffer) were prepared for hybridisation. The probes were hybridised with the embryos at 56°C overnight. The next day the embryos were washed and incubated in POD-conjugated anti-Dig (in PBT) for 1 hr. The fluorescent signal was developed by the addition of Cy3 Amplification Reagent (1:100) diluted in TSA Amplification Diluent and incubation at room temperature in the dark for 10 min.

Specifically, we believe we provide a solid and novel study on cytoskeletal dynamics during lumen formation and branching, important events during vascular development and remodelling. Furthermore, branching abnormalities inflict greatly in development and disease, making these mechanisms interesting to the wide community of life scientists.</p><p>Other points offered as a justification for the denial to publish our work are described in the decision letter and we also do not agree with these. Here is a point by point answer to them:</p><p>1) &quot;this manuscript does not sufficiently address how Shot links leading-edge protrusions and centrosomes”. We totally disagree with this statement. We show Shot provides the connection between MT bundles stemming from the centrosome and the actin at the tip of the tracheal terminal cell. We show this in vivo (by live imaging), using different genetic conditions and by analysing cells in fixed embryos. We also dissect which Shot domains are necessary for this crosstalk, the MT binding domain and the actin-binding domain. Furthermore, we show that Shot can stabilize MT bundles and create new branching events leading to extra lumina in terminal cells in embryos and larvae.</p><p>2) We do not show &quot;how it is organized into pre-lumen tract”.

We know this is very interesting and, of course, we are very interested on how directed secretion is regulated (by Shot or by other molecules), but the whole question is material for another article.</p><p>4) Last but not least, judging by the above-mentioned reasons for rejection, it seems this manuscript only reports an involvement of Shot in cytoskeletal dynamics. However, we also show that Shot is transcriptionally regulated by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> SRF transcription factor (blistered), a novel finding with implications in the transcriptional regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and epithelial adhesion.

Because this is an antibody staining, it detects all centrosomes in all cells in the embryo. Therefore, what can be seen as puncta, is not background but centrosomes in other tissues surrounding the tracheal TCs. Regarding cross-reactivity, we agree that when there is a subcellular lumen sometimes antibodies cross-react with an unidentified antigen at the luminal surface and in Figure 3B this was what was detected (note that Figure 3A is from an embryo in stages before lumen formation). However, we would like to state that this does not interfere with centrosomal detection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Similarly, the acetylated tubulin staining in Figure 4C may require attention. It appears that the morphology of the entire microtubule network changes over time.

This is a developing structure and both shape and the cytoskeleton are changing constantly. This is the reason why, in some instances, we provide snapshots of different stages as is the case of Figure 4 C-E which shows the beginning, middle and final stages of cellular extension. In addition, detection is done in wholemount embryos, using antibodies, which detect MTs in tracheal cells and all other cells in the embryo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Paraformaldehyde fixation is generally unable to capture dynamic microtubules and given that Shot is an EB1-dependent plus-end tracking protein this fixation protocol is likely missing this population of microtubules (Figure 2).

We do not fix with paraformaldehyde, but formaldehyde as stated in the Materials and methods. We have tested many different conditions in order to better detect both microtubules and actin in the same cell, within the whole embryo. During our studies on the influence of centrosomes in subcellular lumen formation we tested methanol fixation, cold fixation, boiling fixation and the rapid fixing protocol we use in this work and we could conclude that rapid fixing gives us the best results for all structures we need to detect. Some of these fixation methods are better for MTs, others for centrosomes, others for actin and luminal structures, but to detect them all, according to our data, rapid formaldehyde fixation is the best (“Fluorescent Analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Embryos,” Chapter 9, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> protocols (eds.

According to our results, in a <italic>bs</italic> mutant background Shot levels in SCs are similar, to controls. However, in TCs they are much lower. We conclude and discuss in the manuscript, that Shot levels in TCs need to be higher than in SCs in order to allow the formation of a subcellular lumen. Regulation of Shot expression in SCs is independent of DSRF and most likely regulated by other transcription factors like on other, non-tracheal cells in the embryo. TC fate and subcellular lumen formation are regulated by DSRF and one of its outcomes is the higher expression of Shot in these cells. These protein data are now backed up by our in situ hybridization experiments (requested by Review Commons reviewers), which show that control TCs display higher levels of Shot mRNA compared to <italic>shot</italic> mutant TCs (Figure 7C).</p><p>We would also like to emphasize that quantifications are always done taking into account the whole TCs, taking all the confocal Z-sections. Quantification of Shot protein accumulation (as all other quantifications in our manuscript) is done comparing control and <italic>shot</italic> mutant TCs at the same stages of development. In the case of figure / AB, there is no lumen because this is an early stage 15 embryo (when lumen has not yet been formed) in the control and in <italic>bs</italic> mutant. Since <italic>bs</italic> mutants do not develop a subcellular lumen in most TCs, it is more accurate to measure Shot protein levels in stages before lumen formation. Otherwise, these would not be comparable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</p><p>This study provides solid evidences showing a role for the spectraplakin Short-stop (Shot) in subcellular lumen formation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic and larval trachea. This subcellular morphogenetic process relies on an inward membrane growth that depends on the proper organization of actin and microtubules (MTs) in terminal cells (TCs). Shot depletion leads to a defective or absent lumen while conversely, Shot overexpression promotes excessive branching, independently on the regulation of centrosome numbers previously shown to be important for the regulation of the lumen formation process (Ricolo et al., 2016). Shot is rather important to regulate the organization of the cytoskeleton by crosslinking MTs and actin. Shot expression in TCs is controlled by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Serum Response Factor (DSRF) transcription factor. Finally Shot functionally overlaps with the MT-stabilizing protein Tau to promote lumen morphogenesis.</p><p>The figures are clear, and the questions well addressed with carefully designed and controlled experiments. However, I would have few suggestions that will hopefully make some points clearer.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>– Statistical analyses should be added for comparisons of proportions, including Figure 1E, 1L, Figure 2G-I, Figure 6L, Figure 7K, Figure 8C-D and Figure 9G.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this and have now redone all graphs and revised all quantifications. We have added error bars in all bar graphs, changed many to box plots (to provide a better grasp of the value-ranges) and have provided statistical analysis where appropriate. We have also redone all graphics and phenotype reporting in relation to total terminal cells (rather than embryos or GBs and DBs TCs), because this is a more stringent and comparable way of quantifying all our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is not always clear what genotype has been used as the &quot;wt&quot; genotype, as in Figure S2 or Figure 3 for example, this should be added to figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified which flies are used as controls in each experiment throughout the paper. We have left <italic>wt</italic> where flies were <italic>wt</italic> and changed all other cases to either the genotype or “control”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Live imaging of Shot has been performed with ShotC-GFP, that cannot bind actin. Don't the authors think ShotA-GFP would reflect more accurately Shot endogenous behavior as it interacts both with actin and MTs? It would be better to show this, even if the results shown here tend to be consistent with Shot endogenous localization shown with Shot antibody staining.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we apologise about this. We have realized there was a mistake in the figure legend of Video 3, which stated the stock we used to do time-lapse was UASShotCGFP when in fact it was ShotAGFP. We would not have drawn the conclusions without analysing live UASShotA embryos. With this new version of the manuscript, we have corrected the figure legend and provide a new video (Video 4) of a time lapse experiment using UASShotAGFP and btl::moeRFP to detect ShotA and actin in live embryos over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is of course not possible to generate CRISPR mutant flies with mutations in putative DSRF binding sites in a reasonable amount of time, to confirm that Shot transcription is controlled by DSRF. It would thus be nice to reveal shot mRNA expression with in situ hybridization experiments in wt vs. bs embryos. This would confirm that Shot mRNA is downregulated upon DSRF inhibition and rule out a possible indirect effect on Shot protein stability for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the presented 3-way approach (in silico, protein quantification and phenotype rescue) is sufficient to show that Shot expression is regulated by DSRF. It is unlikely that we are dealing with protein stability or other issues, because we can rescue the lumen elongation phenotype by solely expressing Shot in TCs. However, we agree that an in situ hybridization experiment provides data to confirm this, and we now provide a conclusive one. Here, it is clear that Shot expression is higher in control TCs and lower in <italic>bs</italic> TCs (Figure 7, C, D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the same figure, it would also be interesting to show what happens to actin and MTs in bs TCs and to which extent their organization is rescued by Shot overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>We have analysed MTs and actin in <italic>bs</italic> TCs as well as in Shot-rescued TCs. We provide these results in Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– UAS-EB1GFP does not seem to be an appropriate control in Figure 9 (A and B) since it can affect MT dynamics (Vitre, B. et al. EB1 regulates microtubule dynamics and tubulin sheet closure in vitro. Nat. Cell Biol. 10, 415-421 (2008)). Why not simply use an UAS-GFP?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not detected any notorious larval TC phenotypes by overexpressing UASEB1GFP in TCs. Their branching is comparable to that in previous studies (for example, Schotenfeld-Roames, et al., 2014) and there were no detectable luminal branching phenotypes. However, we agree it is more correct to analyse cells with a plain GFP and have repeated the controls for this experiment using DSRFGAL4UASGFP. This is now shown in Figure 9A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Shot and probably Tau crosslinking activities are important for lumen morphogenesis with a striking increase in the number of embryos without lumen in shot<sup>3</sup> and shot<sup>3</sup> tau<sup>MR22</sup> mutant embryos. The rescue experiments clearly show that Shot binding to both MT and actin is essential for efficient rescue. The same might apply to Tau since it is able to crosslink actin and MTs (Elie et al., 2015). I believe showing actin and MTs organization in these rescue experiments would be necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We have analysed MTs and actin in <italic>tau</italic>-rescued <italic>shot</italic> mutant TCs. We provide these results in 2 new Figures: Figure 8—figure supplement 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the overexpression experiments indicate that Shot is able to induce extra lumen formation even when unable to bind actin as shown with the increase in the number of supernumerary lumina (ESLs) under overexpression of ShotC and ShotCtail to a lesser extent. This phenotype is also observed under Tau overexpression. This suggest that not crosslinking anymore but rather making MTs more stable could be sufficient to promote extra lumen formation in a wt context. Stabilising MTs by treatment with Taxol might thus be sufficient to promote ESL formation. I am fully aware of the difficulty of treating <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos with drugs, making this experiment hard to do, but I think this dual function of Shot and Tau (crosslinking actin and MTs to promote branching vs. stabilizing MTs leading to excessive branching) should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2 we show not just that UASShotC is able to induce ESL but also that UAS-ShotCtail containing only the MT binding domain of Shot is enough to induce ESLs in TCs as the reviewer noted, but we also show that UAS-∆Ctail, which has been reported to bind actin but not MTs is not able to induce ESL (Figure 2 H and J).</p><p>We agree Taxol treatment would be a nice experiment to do, however we believe we provide enough evidence that MT stability is enough for ESL induction whereas de novo lumen formation requires crosslinking of MTs to actin. As advised, we have discussed better both Shot and Tau dual function in ESL generation and de novo lumen formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance):</p><p>The findings shown in this manuscript shed an important light on the way subcellular morphogenesis occurs. It was known that both actin and MTs were required in this process, particularly during the formation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> trachea (Jayanandanan et al., 2019; Gervais and Casanova, 2010). This work provides additional molecular insights into the way branching morphogenesis from a single cell occurs in vivo, clearly demonstrating a requirement for actin-MT crosslinking mediated by Shot and Tau.</p><p>This could be of great interest in the field of branching morphogenesis and lumen formation, not only in invertebrates but also in vertebrates where such a crosslinking might occur in the vasculature, the lung, the kidney or the mammary gland for example (Ochoa-Espinosa, A. &amp; Affolter, M. Branching Morphogenesis: From Cells to Organs and Back. Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 4, a008243-a008243 (2012)).</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The development of branched structures with intracellular lumen is widely observed in single cells of circulatory systems. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this complex morphogenesis are largely unknown. In previous study, the authors revealed that centrosome as a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) located at the apical junction contributes subcellular lumen formation in the terminal cells of <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheal system. The microtubule bundles organized by MTOC are suggested to serve as trafficking mediators and structural stabilizers for the newly elongated lumen.</p><p>In this manuscript, they focused on a <italic>Drosophila</italic> spectraplakin, Shot, which have been reported to crosslink MT minus-ends to actin network, in the subcellular lumen formation. The paper started by description of lumen elongation defect of the tracheal terminal cells in the shot<sup>3</sup> null mutant. The overexpression of full-length and series of truncated form of shot exhibited extra-subcellular lumina (ESL) in TCs, suggesting that Shot is required for the lumen formation in dose dependent manner. They next addressed whether Shot overexpression induces ESL through the supernumerary centrosomes as in Rca1 mutant, however the number of centrosomes was not affected. Moreover, the ESL were sprouted distally from the apical junction, suggesting that Shot operate in different way from the Rca1-dependent microtubule organization. To get mechanistic insight of Shot in the luminal formation, they checked localization of the Shot and found it localized with stable MTs around the nascent lumen and with the F-actin at the tip of the cell during the cell elongation and subcellular lumen formation. In shot<sup>3</sup> mutant, the MT-bundles were no longer localized to apical region and the actin accumulation at the tip of the cell was also reduced. The rescue experiments using several truncated forms of Shot, and well-designed genetic analysis using various shot mutants revealed that both MT binding domain and actin binding domains are needed to develop the lumen. The expression of shot was under the regulation by terminal cell-specific transcription factor bs/DSRF, and the overexpression of shot in bs LOF mutant suppressed its phenotype, indicated that part of the luminal phenotype of bs mutant in terminal cells are due to lower levels of the activity of shot. Finally, they checked whether Tau can compensate the function of shot in the subcellular lumen formation. The lumen elongation defect in shot mutant was suppressed by tau expression, and tau overexpression phenocopied the shot overexpression-induced ESL. Although tau mutant did not show the lumen formation defects, the double mutant of shot and tau exhibited synergistic effect. Shot was also required for subcellular luminal branching at larval stages.</p><p>Overall, this work highlighted the importance of Shot as a crosslinker between MT and actin that acts in downstream of the FGF signaling-induced bs/DSRF expression for the subcellular lumen formation. An excess of Shot is sufficient for ESL formation from ectopic acentrosomal branching points. Furthermore, the Tau protein can functionally replace Shot in this context.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The conclusions were basically supported by the set of data presented in this article, but following points need to be clarified.</p><p>The truncated form ShotC lacks only half of calponin domain that are essential for the actin binding, thus it is still possible to bind actin to some extent. Although the actin binding activity is reported as &quot;very weak&quot; in the cited references, the quantitative analysis has not been done. Thus, the interpretation and claims based on the experiments using ShotC should be reviewed carefully.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and will revise all the text for resubmission in order to make this unambiguous. However, we would like to remark that our claims are not only based on UAS-ShotC but also in the shotkakP2 allele, which does not contain one of the calponin domains and, more clearly, in isoforms such UAS-Shot C-tail which do not have any ABD (in fact, only have the C-tail part of Shot).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data set in some places seems fragmented. For example, overexpression study of shot constructs (Figure 2) lacks phenotypic comparison of control (btl Gal4 driven control FP) to compare if phenotypes of shot constructs expression are different from control. Different methods of phenotypic quantification are employed. One was counting embryo number with at least one abnormality among 20 TCs of DB or GB, or the other counting every TC for the presence of lumen/branching conditions. The latter is more stringent measure and is more appropriate for the study of single cell morphogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree with the reviewer.

The lumen formation involves assembly of plasma membrane components inside of the cytoplasm. Since the luminal membrane is associated with protein complexes common to apical cell membrane, lumen formation is believed to involve redirection of apical trafficking of membranes to intracellular sites (Sigurbjörnsdóttir, Mathew and Leptin, 2014). The authors previously demonstrated that centrosome is an important link of pre-existing lumen to de novo lumen formation, leading to the hypothesis that centrosome-derived microtubules organize lumen membrane assembly.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors addressed this issue by looking at the function of Shot/Plakin that has both microtubule and actin binding activities. Shot is an ideal candidate for linking actin-rich cell protrusions in the leading edge to centrosome-associated lumen tip. Indeed, the authors clearly showed that shot is required for lumen extension and overexpressed shot protein associates with intracellular tract rich in microtubules and F-actin. Their findings are definitely a progress in the field of <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheal development. Having said that, how Shot links leading edge protrusions and centrosomes, how it is organized into pre-lumen tract, and how it contributes to further assembly of luminal membrane and directed secretion, are not well understood yet. Without clues to those fundamental questions, I believe this paper is most appropriate for expert readers of <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell biology and tracheal development.</p><p>Finally, I feel that the paper includes many data sets and some pictures are not easy to grasp essential points, such as three videos showing localization of overexpressed shot-C, RFP-moesin, and Lifeact.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;Coordinated crosstalk between microtubules and actin by a spectraplakin regulates lumen formation and branching&quot; Ricolo and Araujo characterize the requirement for Short Stop (Shot) in the formation of subcellular tubes in tracheal terminal cells.</p><p>The authors examined embryos homozygous for shot<sup>3</sup>, a presumed null allele of shot. They found an 80% penetrant defect in seamless tube formation or growth. The phenotype resembles that reported for mutations in blistered, which encodes the <italic>Drosophila</italic> SRF ortholog. The authors find that expression of SRF is not blocked by mutations in shot and later find that bs mutants have decreased levels of shot expression and that shot overexpression can partly suppress the bs tube formation defects.</p><p>The authors then examine whether the requirement for shot is autonomous to the trachea and find that it is, as pan-tracheal shot RNAi replicates the seamless tube defects.</p><p>The authors find that overexpression of various Shot isoforms results in the formation of ectopic seamless tubes within terminal cells. Using the various transgenic constructs available for shot, the authors show that the overexpression phenotype is dependent upon the interaction between Shot and microtubules and is dose-dependent.</p><p>Previous work had shown that ectopic terminal cell tubes also can arise due to increased centrosome number; the authors show that centrosome number is not altered in shot mutants.</p><p>Shot has well characterized actin and microtubule binding functions, and the authors show that Shot localization overlaps both with microtubules and with actin, and that both cytoskeletal elements are aberrant in shot mutant cells. In a series of experiments utilizing various shot mutant backgrounds and shot transgenes, the authors identify requirements for both Shot-cytoskeleton interactions in the formation and branching of seamless tubes in terminal cells.</p><p>Finally, the authors examine the requirement for Tau in the same processes. Tau and Shot had previously been found to work together in neurons, and this seems to be true in terminal cells as well. Tau overexpression induces ectopic seamless tubes and can partially suppress shot loss of function. Embryos mutant for tau showed seamless tube directionality defects, but not lumen formation or branching. Embryos doubly mutant for tau and shot showed a more severe seamless tube defect than shot mutants alone – an increase in terminal cells with no lumen from 22% to 85%.</p><p>Authors also examined terminal cells in larval stages using</p><p>DSRF-GAL4 to knockdown shot in terminal cells (rather than pan-tracheal knockdown with breathless).</p><p>The authors conclude from their studies that Shot, through its interactions with microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton coordinate the outgrowth and branching of subcellular tubes. Overlapping function of Tau and possibly other additional MAPs also act in these processes.</p><p>The work is largely well done, and the conclusions are supported by the data.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance):</p><p>The findings will be of interest to a broad cell biology community as they provide a conceptual advance and may help to focus future work on seamless tubulogenesis. The authors do a good job of placing the results in the context of previous studies.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
