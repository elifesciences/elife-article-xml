outer membrane (MOM) proteins, including subunits of the main MOM translocase, require the fungi-specific Mim1/Mim2 complex. So far it was unclear which proteins accomplish this task in other eukaryotes. Here, we show by reciprocal complementation that the MOM protein pATOM36 of trypanosomes is a functional analogue of yeast Mim1/Mim2 complex, even though these proteins show neither sequence nor topological similarity. Expression of pATOM36 rescues almost all growth, mitochondrial biogenesis, and morphology defects in yeast cells lacking Mim1 and/or Mim2. Conversely, co-expression of Mim1 and Mim2 restores the assembly and/or insertion defects of MOM proteins in trypanosomes ablated for pATOM36. Mim1/Mim2 and pATOM36 form native-like complexes when heterologously expressed, indicating that additional proteins are not part of these structures. Our findings indicate that Mim1/Mim2 and pATOM36 are the products of convergent evolution and arose only after the ancestors of fungi and trypanosomatids diverged.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>trypanosome</kwd><kwd>outer membrane</kwd><kwd>MIM complex</kwd><kwd>biogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ITN TAMPting, 607072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vitali</surname><given-names>Daniela G</given-names></name><name><surname>Rapaport</surname><given-names>Doron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>138355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schneider</surname><given-names>Andre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RA 1028/7-1,RA 1028/10-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rapaport</surname><given-names>Doron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The convergent evolution of yeast Mim1/2 and trypanosomal pATOM36 enable the first demonstration of reciprocal functional rescue of two evolutionary unrelated mitochondrial biogenesis complexes belonging to two different eukaryotic supergroups.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) proteins include a diverse set of enzymes, components of protein import machineries, pore forming proteins, as well as proteins mediating mitochondrial fusion, fission, and motility. In addition, the MOM harbours proteins that regulate apoptosis and mitophagy and hence are of central importance for the fate of the organelle and the whole cell. All these MOM proteins are nuclear-encoded and synthesised on cytosolic ribosomes. Therefore, they have to bear appropriate signals that ensure both their correct targeting to the organelle and their ability to acquire different topologies in the lipid bilayer. Despite their well-recognised importance, the diverse molecular mechanisms by which MOM proteins are specifically targeted to the organelle and inserted into their target membrane remain incompletely defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dukanovic and Rapaport, 2011</xref>).</p><p>MOM proteins can be divided into several topological groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dukanovic and Rapaport, 2011</xref>). Some of them span the lipid bilayer with one transmembrane segment (TMS), while others transverse the membrane with multiple β-strands or α-helical structures. Depending on their orientation, single-span proteins can be classified into three groups: the first two are signal- or tail-anchored proteins, which face the intermembrane space (IMS) with either the N- or C-terminus, respectively. These proteins typically expose the bulk of the protein to the cytosol and only a very short segment faces the IMS. A third subclass of single-span proteins exposes soluble domains towards both the IMS and the cytosol. Other integral MOM proteins span the bilayer either with several α-helical TMSs or as β-barrel structures. Whereas the import pathway taken by β-barrel precursor proteins has been studied in some detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Endo and Yamano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Walther et al., 2009</xref>), much less is known about the factors and the mechanisms that assure the membrane integration of MOM proteins with helical TMSs.</p><p>MOM helical multispan proteins follow a unique import pathway in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Papic et al., 2011</xref>). Precursors of these proteins are integrated into the membrane in a process where the MOM protein <italic>m</italic>itochondrial <italic>im</italic>port 1 (Mim1) cooperates with the import receptor Tom70 in binding precursor proteins and facilitating their insertion into the lipid bilayer. Interestingly, it appears that neither other subunits of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) nor components residing in the mitochondrial IMS are involved in this process. Currently, it is unresolved whether the MIM complex has only a receptor-like function or it acts also as an insertase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vögtle et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to mediating the membrane integration of multi-span proteins, Mim1 is also involved in the biogenesis of the import receptors Tom20 and Tom70 and therefore the protein is also required for the proper assembly of the TOM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dimmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hulett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lueder and Lithgow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thornton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Waizenegger et al., 2005</xref>). Mim1 is known to interact with Mim2, another protein of the MOM that has a crucial role in the biogenesis of α-helical multispan proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dimmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krüger et al., 2017</xref>). Both proteins form a high-molecular-weight complex (MIM complex). They transverse the MOM once and expose their N-terminal domains to the cytosol whereas their C-terminal regions are facing the IMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dimmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishikawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lueder and Lithgow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Waizenegger et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Considering their multifaceted functions, it is not surprising that the absence of Mim1 and/or Mim2 results in severe growth retardation and multiple cellular defects like hampered assembly of the TOM complex, alteration in mitochondrial morphology, and accumulation of unprocessed mitochondrial precursor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dimmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishikawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mnaimneh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Popov-Celeketić et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Waizenegger et al., 2005</xref>). Mim1 and Mim2 are conserved among various fungi but homologues in any other eukaryotes were not identified so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dimmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishikawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Otera et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Waizenegger et al., 2005</xref>). This situation raises the question which factor(s) facilitate the membrane integration of helical MOM proteins in non-fungal organisms.</p><p>Recently, a first candidate for such a factor was reported in the parasitic protozoan <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>. It was shown that the integral MOM protein, <italic>p</italic>eripheral <italic>a</italic>rchaic <italic>t</italic>ranslocase of the <italic>o</italic>uter <italic>m</italic>embrane 36 (pATOM36), in analogy to the MIM complex, is involved in the assembly and/or membrane insertion of a small subset of MOM proteins including subunits of the main trypanosomal outer membrane protein translocase (ATOM complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruggisser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Käser et al., 2016</xref>). However, in contrast to the MIM complex, pATOM36 is also directly required for the inheritance of the single unit mitochondrial genome of trypanosomes, termed kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). A fraction of the protein localises to the tripartite attachment complex (TAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Käser et al., 2016</xref>), which connects the kDNA across the two mitochondrial membranes with the basal body of the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schnarwiler et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although pATOM36 and Mim1/2 do not share any sequence or topological similarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we wondered whether convergent evolution allowed these unrelated proteins to fulfil similar tasks in the biogenesis of MOM proteins. To address this question, we expressed pATOM36 in yeast cells. Remarkably, introduction of pATOM36 could complement the deletion of <italic>MIM1, MIM2,</italic> or even of both genes. Accordingly, the presence of pATOM36 in the deletion strains could reverse the known alterations resulting from the absence of the MIM complex. Importantly, the reciprocal complementation was also successful and co-expression of Mim1 and Mim2 in <italic>T. brucei</italic> cells ablated for pATOM36 could rescue all phenotypes associated with the MOM protein biogenesis function of pATOM36. Taken together, we present the first reciprocal functional rescue of two evolutionary unrelated mitochondrial biogenesis complexes between eukaryotic supergroups.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>pATOM36 forms a native-like complex in yeast cells</title><p>To better understand the functional relation between yeast Mim1/2 and <italic>T. brucei</italic> pATOM36, we wanted to investigate whether the trypanosomal protein can complement the phenotypes observed in yeast cells lacking the MIM complex. To that aim, plasmids encoding for pATOM36 or its C-terminally 3xHA-tagged version (pATOM36-HA), as well as an empty plasmid (Ø) as a control, were transformed into wild type (WT), <italic>mim1Δ</italic>, <italic>mim2Δ</italic> or <italic>mim1Δ</italic>/<italic>mim2Δ</italic> cells. In <italic>T. brucei,</italic> pATOM36 is an integral MOM protein with the C-terminus exposed to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pusnik et al., 2012</xref>). Blue native (BN)-PAGE analysis has shown that the endogenous protein occurs in two groups of protein complexes of unknown composition with molecular weights of approximately 140–250 kDa and larger than 480 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Käser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pusnik et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Initially, we verified that pATOM36-HA can be expressed in the aforementioned yeast strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Next, we isolated mitochondria from either control or <italic>mim1Δ/mim2Δ</italic> cells harbouring pATOM36-HA. We observed that the C-terminally HA-tagged pATOM36, similar to the yeast import receptor Tom70, is accessible to added proteinase K in isolated mitochondria, whereas the matrix protein Hep1 was protected as would be expected for intact organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Alkaline extraction of the isolated organelles showed that pATOM36, as Tom70 but unlike the soluble matrix protein Hep1, was detected in the pellet fraction indicating that it is an integral membrane protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Finally, a BN-PAGE analysis demonstrated that pATOM36 expressed in yeast forms complexes of similar size to the 140 and 250 kDa complexes observed in <italic>T. brucei</italic> mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, the higher molecular weight complex, which likely corresponds to a TAC subcomplex required for kDNA maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Käser et al., 2016</xref>), was not detected. In summary, these results suggest that pATOM36 expressed in yeast cells behaves essentially identical to the endogenous protein: it is embedded into the MOM with its C-terminus facing the cytosol and it forms oligomeric complexes of ca. 140–250 kDa.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34488.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>pATOM36 forms native-like complexes in the yeast mitochondrial OM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mitochondria isolated from WT or <italic>mim1Δ/mim2Δ</italic> cells expressing pATOM36-HA were left intact or lysed with Triton X-100 (TX) before they were subjected to treatment with proteinase K (PK).

To test whether pATOM36 is able to reverse this situation, we obtained whole cell lysates from the cells described above. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, the presence of pATOM36-HA in the deletion strains completely eliminated the appearance of the precursor form of mitochondrial Hsp60. The presence of pATOM36-HA in the deletion cell lines resulted also in enhanced levels of Tom40 whereas the amounts of aconitase (Aco1) were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that the function of the MIM complex in TOM complex assembly can be replaced by pATOM36. To substantiate this assumption, we used digitonin-solubilised mitochondria, which were isolated from control and deletion strains, and analysed them by BN-PAGE. To detect the TOM complex, the corresponding immunoblots were probed with antibodies against either Tom40 or Tom22. Of note, pATOM36-HA did not affect the assembly of the TOM complex in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As expected, in the absence of Mim1/2, a dramatic reduction in the amount of assembled TOM complex and an appearance of an unassembled Tom40-containing species can be observed. Strikingly, these alterations completely disappeared upon the introduction of pATOM36-HA into these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the specificity of the complementation by pATOM36, we asked whether it can functionally replace another import factor that mediates the biogenesis of other MOM proteins. To that goal, pATOM36 was introduced into cells lacking Mas37/Sam37, a subunit of the TOB/SAM complex that facilitates membrane integration of β-barrel proteins and the TOM subunit Tom22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan and Lithgow, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dukanovic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wiedemann et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> shows that pATOM36 could revert neither the drop in the steady-state levels of the TOB complex and its altered assembly behaviour nor the reduced levels of either the β-barrel proteins Tom40 and Porin or the single-span protein Tom22. Thus, the effect of pATOM36 is specific for MIM substrates. These findings further support the notion that the single-span protein Tom22 follows an import pathway that is distinct from that taken by the signal-anchored subunits Tom20 and Tom70.</p><p>Previous reports suggested that Tom70 works together with Mim1 in the biogenesis of multi-span helical MOM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Papic et al., 2011</xref>). To test whether pATOM36 can also interact with Tom70, we utilised a recombinant protein composed of the cytosolic domain of Tom70 fused to GST moiety (GST-Tom70). When this protein was incubated with newly synthesised radiolabelled pATOM36, or with Mim1 as a control, we observed a specific binding to both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that Tom70, as an import receptor for MOM proteins, recognises Mim1 and pATOM36 as substrates, it can be envisaged that, similarly to Mim1, pATOM36 can also cooperate with Tom70 in the biogenesis of MOM proteins.</p><p>The aforementioned results indicate that pATOM36 can compensate for the loss of the MIM machinery. To demonstrate directly a role of pATOM36 in protein import into the outer membrane of yeast mitochondria, we performed in vitro import assays. To that aim, we tested whether the presence of pATOM36 in mitochondria lacking the MIM complex can rescue the reduced import capacity of the MIM substrates Tom20 and Ugo1 observed for these organelles. To monitor the import efficiency of radiolabelled Tom20 into isolated organelles, we employed an established assay based on the formation of a proteolytic fragment of an N-terminally extended variant of Tom20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahting et al., 2005</xref>). This assay clearly demonstrated that the presence of pATOM36 is sufficient to improve dramatically the capacity of organelles lacking Mim1/2 to import radiolabelled Tom20 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Along the same line, the assembly of newly synthesised Tom20 molecules into pre-existing TOM complexes was markedly improved when pATOM36 was present in mitochondria lacking the MIM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Similarly to its minor effect on the steady state levels of Ugo1, the presence of pATOM36 did not improve the capacity of isolated mitochondria to import radiolabelled Ugo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As a control, we checked the effect of pATOM36 on the import of proteins that are not known as MIM substrates like the matrix-targeted model protein pSu9-DHFR or the MOM tail-anchored protein Fis1. In both cases, we did not observe altered import upon expression of pATOM36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Collectively, pATOM36 can support the biogenesis of MIM substrates but appears to have preferences to certain ones.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34488.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>pATOM36 can rescue some of the import defects of cells lacking the MIM complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mitochondria were isolated from WT cells transformed with an empty plasmid (WT-) or from <italic>mim1Δ/mim2Δ</italic> cells transformed with either an empty plasmid (<italic>-</italic>) or with a plasmid encoding pATOM36-HA (<italic>+</italic>).

This conclusion is based on the stringent criteria that the two proteins can replace each other in reciprocal complementation experiments. The only major limitation is that the role of pATOM36 in mitochondrial DNA inheritance in trypanosomes cannot be carried out by the MIM complex, which is expected since unlike the MIM complex pATOM36 has a dual function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Käser et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The reciprocal complementation is surprising because yeast belongs to the eukaryotic supergroup of the Opisthokonts whereas trypanosomes are Excavates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burki, 2014</xref>). Thus, except for being eukaryotes the two systems are essentially unrelated. The most parsimonious explanation for the observed phylogenetic distribution of the two functional analogues is that the MIM complex and pATOM36 evolved after the eukaryotic supergroups were already established. Moreover, the observation that within the Opisthokonts the MIM complex is restricted to fungi suggests that it evolved only after the divergence of the ancestors of fungi and metazoans. Thus, the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) likely did not contain the MIM complex, pATOM36 or any other functional analogue of these proteins. This assumption is in line with the notion that LECA had a much simpler MOM protein import system consisting possibly only of a Tom40-like β-barrel protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolezal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mani et al., 2016</xref>), whose integration into the MOM is mediated by the TOB/SAM complex, the core subunit of which, Tob55/Sam50, is conserved in all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolezal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gentle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kozjak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paschen et al., 2003</xref>). During evolution, additional subunits that are anchored in the membrane by α-helices joined the TOM complex to increase its specificity and efficiency. This scenario is supported by the fact that the TOM complexes of yeast, plants and trypanosomes, representatives of three different eukaryotic supergroups, contain three distinct evolutionary unrelated pairs of protein import receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mani et al., 2016</xref>). The appearance of the new TOM subunits required the evolution of a system, such as the MIM complex or pATOM36, that facilitates their assembly with Tom40.</p><p>Interestingly, the capacity of pATOM36 expressed in yeast cells to support the biogenesis of MIM substrates is variable with the import receptor Tom20 as the most favourable substrate and the fusion-modulator Ugo1 as the least favourable one. Ugo1 is a carrier-like protein with several TMSs that lack clear homologues in higher eukaryotes. Hence, one can speculate that pATOM36 cannot deal with it well since there are no similar substrates in the MOM of <italic>T. brucei</italic>.</p><p>Both Mim1 and Mim2 as well as pATOM36 occur in protein complexes of unknown composition. The successful complementation experiments together with the fact that they form complexes of similar sizes when expressed in the heterologous systems strongly suggest that these complexes do not contain any additional proteins. Their ability for reciprocal rescue also suggests that their essential function does not require any further proteins since it is very unlikely that such factors would be present in the other species.</p><p>It is established that pATOM36 and Mim1/Mim2 are integral MOM proteins. However, whereas Mim1 and Mim2 have each a single TMS with the N-terminus facing the cytosol, the topology of pATOM36 is largely unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). It has been demonstrated by antibody shift experiments that the C-terminus of pATOM36 is exposed to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pusnik et al., 2012</xref>), but depending on the prediction programs the protein is postulated to have either one, two or even three TMSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Käser et al., 2016</xref>). While Mim1/Mim2 and pATOM36 do not share sequence similarity and also have different molecular weights (Mim1, 13 kDa; Mim2, 11 kDa; pATOM36, 36 kDa), they all have GxxxG(A) motifs within their putative TMSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is in line with their oligomeric quaternary structures. It has recently been shown by electrophysiological experiments that Mim1, on its own or in complex with Mim2, can form a cation-selective channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krüger et al., 2017</xref>). Should this channel activity of Mim1 be functionally relevant, we would expect pATOM36 to form also a pore.</p><p>Presently, it is unclear whether the convergent evolution of the MIM complex and pATOM36 demonstrated in the present study, resulted in a similar 3D-structure of the two oligomers. Should this be the case, the two complexes may independently have evolved the same mechanisms to perform the equivalent functions. Alternatively, it cannot be excluded that they use structurally different solutions resulting in different mechanisms that nevertheless allow them to carry out the same functions.</p><p>There is evidence that both the yeast MIM complex as well as trypanosomal pATOM36 mediate assembly of already integrated MOM proteins and at least for some substrates also the insertion process itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruggisser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dimmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hulett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Käser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lueder and Lithgow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Papic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thornton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Waizenegger et al., 2005</xref>). Whether the two oligomers directly catalyse protein insertion or whether they form microdomains in the MOM that facilitate membrane integration of helical segments is unclear. In any case, we hypothesise that the MIM complex and pATOM36 should behave similarly in this respect.</p><p>The successful complementation of the functions of the yeast MIM complex by trypanosomal pATOM36 and vice versa opens the way for future comparative studies to define the fundamental features the two biogenesis complexes share. The constraints imposed by their identical functions will help to reveal their mechanism of action. Taken together, our work offers new insights into the evolution of mitochondrial import factors and sheds new light on basic aspects of the biogenesis of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">WT;

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Nikolaus Pfanner, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Kostas Tokatlidis (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mitochondria are iconic structures of eukarytotic cells and are involved in many important functions including oxidative phosphorylation. The greater part of the mitochondrial proteome derives from nuclear-encoded proteins, which are synthesized in the cytosol and subsequently imported into mitochondria. The MIM pathway (consisting of the two outer membrane proteins Mim1/Mim2) is a fungal specific-pathway required for the biogenesis of a subset of outer membrane proteins, including subunits of the general entry gate of the organelle the TOM complex. pATOM36 is a recently identified trypanosomatid-specific essential mitochondrial outer membrane protein that functions in the biogenesis of outer membrane proteins and transmission of mitochondrial DNA. In this study Vitali and colleagues show that Mim1/Mim2 and pATOM36 are functionally interchangeable by using complementation analysis in yeast and <italic>T. brucei</italic> together with functional analyses of import defects.</p><p>The study is important as no functional homologs of the fungal Mim1/2 system have yet been identified in any other eukaryotes. Remarkably, pATOM36 and Mim1/2 share no sequence homology and are different in their topology and possibly structure. The results reveal that MIM and pATOM36 are the products of convergent evolution, which arose after the ancestors of fungi and trypanosomes diverged.</p><p>The work presented in this manuscript is thorough and explores a crucial question of mitochondrial biology, representing the first case of convergent evolution for the mitochondrial protein import machinery.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors present a number of data indicating that pATOM36 may compensate for the loss of the MIM machinery but do not directly show a role of pATOM36 in protein import into the outer membrane of yeast mitochondria. The authors should perform in vitro import assays into isolated yeast mitochondria to show that the import of MIM substrates, including specific TOM subunits, is restored upon expression of pATOM36 in MIM mutant strains. Are MIM-independent protein import pathways impaired in the MIM double mutant and are they affected by expression of pATOM36?</p><p>Figure 3A: The levels of Ugo1 and Tom70 are not completely restored upon expression of pATOM36, when compared to the levels of Tom20. A quantification of these Western blots will be helpful. It would be valuable to see how the in vitro import and assembly of these substrates is influenced in these cells, as it might reveal that pATOM36 might have a preference for certain MIM substrates.</p><p>2) Given that the protein biogenesis function of pATOM36 is substantially restored one wonders whether only MIm1 could do this in trypanosomes or whether there is an additive effect of MIm1 and Mim2 in these studies.</p><p>Why does expression of Mim1/Mim2 not complement the loss of kDNA? Does this have something to do with the considerably larger size/topology of pATOM36? Does this imply that only the TMDs of pATOM36 are involved in the biogenesis of outer membrane proteins?</p><p>3) Does pATOM36 expressed in yeast cooperate with Tom70, as has been shown for Mim1?</p><p>4) Many of the BN blots (for instance Figure 3C) are saturated and need be shown as lower-exposures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34488.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors present a number of data indicating that pATOM36 may compensate for the loss of the MIM machinery but do not directly show a role of pATOM36 in protein import into the outer membrane of yeast mitochondria.

We did not test Tom70 import as we are not aware of a specific and reliable in vitro assay to monitor the correct membrane integration of this protein. In agreement with the changes in the steady state levels (see below), the expression of pATOM36 did not result in a significant effect on the extent of import of Ugo1 but improved significantly the import of Tom20 in the mim1Δ/mim2Δ double deletion strain. The presence of pATOM36 did not affect the import of control non MIM substrates like pSu9-DHFR or Fis1. These new findings are included in revised Figure 4 and are described and discussed in the revised Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3A: The levels of Ugo1 and Tom70 are not completely restored upon expression of pATOM36, when compared to the levels of Tom20.

Indeed, the effect of pATOM36 on such substrates is variable (revised Figure 3B). Whereas, the expression of pATOM36 in the mim1Δ/mim2Δ double deletion strain elevated significantly the levels of Tom70 and especially of Tom20, those of Ugo1 were only mildly increased. Hence, considering also the in vitro import assays (see above), it seems that pATOM36 has a preference for certain MIM substrates like Tom20. These new findings are described and discussed in the revised Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given that the protein biogenesis function of pATOM36 is substantially restored one wonders whether only MIm1 could do this in trypanosomes or whether there is an additive effect of MIm1 and Mim2 in these studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We could identify clones of pATOM36-RNAi cell lines, which unintentionally express only tagged Mim1 or Mim2 in major amounts and in which the other partner protein was barely detected. In such clones, we could neither detect rescue of growth retardation nor restoration of the ATOM assembly defect. Thus, we conclude that restoration of the ATOM complex biogenesis defect requires both MIM subunits. These new results are shown in the newly added supplementary Figure 8—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript and are discussed at the end of the Results section (new section entitled &quot;Complementing the biogenesis function of pATOM36 requires Mim1 and Mim2&quot;). In addition, relevant information was added to the Materials and methods” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why does expression of Mim1/Mim2 not complement the loss of kDNA? Does this have something to do with the considerably larger size/topology of pATOM36?</p></disp-quote><p>It has previously been shown that pATOM36 is present in three distinct complexes of approximately 140, 250 and 480 kDa (Käser et al., 2016). Based on the present study, the 140 and 250 kDa complexes likely represent homo-oligomers of pATOM36. Co-immunoprecipitations of tagged pATOM36 with <italic>T. brucei</italic> cells identified a number of interacting proteins of the 480 kDa complex. Many of these are subunits of the tripartite attachment complex (TAC), which links the kDNA to the basal body of the flagellum and is essential for kDNA maintenance. The TAC is a multiprotein complex of which presently seven subunits were characterized. Each of these subunits is specific for trypanosomatids and essential for TAC function. Thus, pATOM36 needs to interact with other TAC subunits in order to function in the TAC, whereas it does not require other proteins to perform its role in outer membrane protein biogenesis. Our findings that expression of Mim1 and Mim2 selectively complements the outer membrane protein biogenesis but not the mitochondrial DNA inheritance phenotype is therefore expected. It would indeed be very surprising if Mim1 and Mim2 would interact with trypanosomatid-specific TAC subunits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does this imply that only the TMDs of pATOM36 are involved in the biogenesis of outer membrane proteins?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a complex question since, as stated in the manuscript, we do not know how many transmembrane domains pATOM36 really has. However, it is known that pATOM36 contains domains specialized for only one of its two functions. Previous complementation experiments have shown that the C-terminal 75 amino acids, which contain the transmembrane domain, which is predicted with the highest score, are dispensable for mitochondrial DNA inheritance but are required for the biogenesis of the ATOM complex (Käser et al., 2016).</p><p>In order to test further this point, we aimed to expressed in yeast cells the pATOM36 variant that lacks the 75 C-terminally amino acids. Unfortunately, this variant was detected in very low levels, suggesting that it is unstable in the yeast environment. Therefore, its inability to complement the mim1Δ/mim2Δ growth defect cannot be interpreted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does pATOM36 expressed in yeast cooperate with Tom70, as has been shown for Mim1?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed several experiments in order to address this point. Initially, we solubilized mitochondria from yeast cells expressing pATOM36-HA and tested whether Tom70 can be pulled-down by the former protein. We could not observe any specific binding, probably because the interaction under physiological conditions is transient. It should be noted that His tagged-Tom70 could pull-down only minor amounts of Mim1 (&lt;0.5% of total Mim1) in digitonin-solubilized mitochondria (Becker et al., 2011).</p><p>Next, to test the potential of the two proteins to interact with each other, we used recombinant GST-Tom70 cytosolic domain (and GST alone as control) and incubated them with in vitro synthesized radiolabeled Mim1 or pATOM36. We detected specific interaction of Tom70 with both proteins. Thus, although this outcome is not an evidence for an in vivo interaction, it demonstrates that pATOM36 and Tom70 can interact with each other. Naturally, we cannot exclude the possibility that Tom70 recognizes either Mim1 or pATOM36 as substrates rather than as interaction partners. These new results are included in revised Figure 3E and are described in the revised Results sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Many of the BN blots (for instance Figure 3C) are saturated and need be shown as lower-exposures.</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected this point and the BN-PAGE immunodecorations in revised Figures 1B, 3D, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A are shown with lower exposures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
