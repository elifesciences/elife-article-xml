However, loss-of-function mutations in metabolic pathways are not negatively selected in human cancers, indicating that these genes are not essential in vivo. We hypothesize that spontaneous mutations in ‘metabolic genes’ will not necessarily produce functional defects because mutation-bearing cells may be rescued by metabolite exchange with neighboring wild-type cells via gap junctions. Using fluorescent substances to probe intercellular diffusion, we show that colorectal cancer (CRC) cells are coupled by gap junctions assembled from connexins, particularly Cx26. Cells with genetically inactivated components of pH regulation (<italic>SLC9A1</italic>), glycolysis (<italic>ALDOA</italic>), or mitochondrial respiration (<italic>NDUFS1</italic>) could be rescued through access to functional proteins in co-cultured wild-type cells. The effect of diffusive coupling was also observed in co-culture xenografts. Rescue was largely dependent on solute exchange via Cx26 channels, a uniformly and constitutively expressed isoform in CRCs. Due to diffusive coupling, the emergent phenotype is less heterogenous than its genotype, and thus an individual cell should not be considered as the unit under selection, at least for metabolite-handling processes. Our findings can explain why certain loss-of-function mutations in genes ascribed as ‘essential’ do not influence the growth of human cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell lines</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>knockout cells</kwd><kwd>selection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>723997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swietach</surname><given-names>Pawel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Imaging studies of connexin-coupled networks of colorectal cancer cells reveal that cells carrying a genetic defect in an essential metabolic pathway can be rescued by diffusive exchange with neighboring wild-type cells via gap junctions, particularly Cx26, thereby evading negative selection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The role of somatic evolution in advancing cancers is well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nowell, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Merlo et al., 2006</xref>) and can be modeled mathematically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wölfl et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnston et al., 2007</xref>). Its central paradigm asserts that mutations benefiting cancer cells undergo positive selection and appear enriched in cancers. Cells carrying such ‘advantageous’ genetic changes may evade the normal checks and controls that restrict proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tomlinson and Bodmer, 1995</xref>), or become resistant to the harsh microenvironments present in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gillies et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, mutations that inactivate critically important processes are predicted to emerge less frequently than the random mutation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greenman et al., 2006</xref>). A number of in vitro knockout (KO) screens have identified genes deemed essential for cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blomen et al., 2015</xref>), among which are genes involved in metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sinkala et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Denko, 2008</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in these processes are predicted to undergo negative selection in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zapata et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2018</xref>), but this phenomenon is exceedingly rare in vivo, equating to only tens of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martincorena et al., 2017</xref>) such as those involved in protein synthesis and immune-exposed epitopes, but not metabolite handling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zapata et al., 2018</xref>). The reason for the discrepancy between the interpretation of in vitro screens and in vivo observations remains unclear, but it highlights fundamental differences in the notion of gene essentiality under culture conditions and in human tumors. We hypothesize that inactivating mutations in key metabolic pathways may be rescued by access to functional proteins in neighboring wild-type (WT) cells. This scenario is more likely to happen in tumors bearing spontaneous mutations, as compared to mutagenized mono-cultures in vitro. Thanks to this rescue effect, the aforementioned mutations will not incur a functional deficit to the mutation-bearing cell, which - in turn - will not undergo negative selection. A plausible means of rescue could involve connexin-assembled gap junctions that allow metabolite exchange between cells across the continuous cytoplasmic space or syncytium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dovmark et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dovmark et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aasen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nicholson, 2003</xref>). Indeed, early work on gap junctions in fibroblasts provided evidence for metabolic cooperation, whereby connected cells can compensate for complementary deficiencies, such as in enzymic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilula et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pitts, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujimoto et al., 1971</xref>). However, the prevailing paradigm at the time stated that cancer cells do not form gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Loewenstein and Kanno, 1966</xref>), and thus cannot benefit from metabolic cooperation. The prominence of gap junctions in cancer has since been revised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dovmark et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dovmark et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aasen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nicholson, 2003</xref>), but the feasibility of metabolic rescue remains to be tested. In the proposed model, an inactivating mutation arising spontaneously within a coupled network of cancer cells may not emerge as deleterious when the affected cell can access metabolite-handling enzymes or transporters in neighboring cells across connexin-assembled channels. If, however, the same mutation is introduced experimentally into all cells (as is typical with in vitro assays), diffusive exchange is unable to restore metabolic function, irrespective of coupling strength. We speculate that the diffusive exchange of solutes via gap junctions can explain why some metabolic processes may be essential for survival in vitro, but do <italic>not</italic> undergo negative selection in human cancers. This model shares similarity to the bystander effect, whereby toxins or therapeutic agents can spread across a tumor via gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aasen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mesnil et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pitts, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bi et al., 1993</xref>). Metabolic rescue of gene mutations would add another dimension to the role of gap junctions in cancer by addressing their longer-term consequences on carcinogenesis, and offering an explanation for the scarcity of negatively selected genes.</p><p>This study used colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to test our hypothesis that diffusive exchange can rescue cells carrying inactivating mutations in apparently critical genes. We first assessed the degree of cell-to-cell coupling in a panel of CRC cells and identified the major connexin isoforms responsible for assembling these conduits. We then genetically inactivated specific metabolic processes that play important roles in cancer to test whether coupling onto WT cells can compensate the genetic deficit. The inactivated functions included (i) Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger-1 (<italic>SLC9A1</italic>), a pH regulator at the plasma membrane that is critical for survival under acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Counillon et al., 2016</xref>); (ii) aldolase A (<italic>ALDOA</italic>), a glycolytic enzyme that is critical for the Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ritterson Lew and Tolan, 2012</xref>); and (iii) NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S1 (<italic>NDUFS1</italic>), part of complex I required for oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Urra et al., 2017</xref>). In support of our hypothesis, we found that co-culturing genetically-altered cells with WT counterparts rescues the functional deficit by allowing access to operational proteins in neighboring cells. Moreover, we confirm this rescue effect in vivo using co-culture xenograft models. Based on our findings, we propose that connexin-dependent metabolite exchange lessens the deleterious effects of mutations in genes related to metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Screening colorectal cancer cells for connexin expression</title><p>Microarray data from 79 CRC lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wilding et al., 2010</xref>) were analyzed for the expression of connexin (Cx) genes.

The latter was evaluated from the degree of fluorescent dye exchange in co-cultures prepared from two populations of cells loaded with spectrally distinct CellTracker fluorophores. The diffusive properties of CellTracker dyes, determined by FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), correlated inversely with molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

This pixelwise analysis measures the fluorescence emitted from each of the two CellTracker dyes as a fraction of total fluorescence and reports the lower of these two numbers as the coupling coefficient (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for details). Thus, before dye exchange takes place, the coupling coefficient is zero; if dye exchange takes place across gap junctions, the coefficient increases as cells become dually fluorescent. In mono-cultures, the coupling coefficient was negligible, as expected from a control experiment in which only one dye is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, co-cultures produced significant coupling coefficients in the case of cells expressing functional gap junctions seeded at adequate density to form close cell–cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Connexin-negative RKO cells, DLD1 <italic>GJB2</italic> KO cells, or DLD1 and OXCO1 cells plated at low density produced low coupling coefficients. Strikingly, there was no correlation between FRAP-measured calcein permeability and coupling coefficient determined at steady state for CellTracker dyes. Thus, even monolayers expressing low-conductance gap junctions may produce a uniform distribution of diffusible substances at steady state. Coupling coefficients showed considerable heterogeneity when plotted as a frequency distribution, with weakest coupling in RKO cells and low-density DLD1 and OXCO1 monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In the other cell lines tested, around half of the cells showed evidence of significant coupling. This number is likely to underestimate the extent of coupling in tissues, where contacts can be established across three dimensions.</p><p>Some degree of dye leakage from cells is inevitable during long-term culture, but this is unlikely to result in the transfer of dye into neighboring cells. Firstly, CellTracker dyes are chemically rendered to be membrane-impermeable inside cytoplasm, thus any molecules that leak across damaged membranes cannot (re)enter neighboring cells. Secondly, the volume of extracellular space is far greater than the intracellular volume, thus any released dye would become vanishingly diluted outside cells. For these reasons, the above dye-exchange measurements report the consequences of cell-to-cell diffusion across gap junctions, rather than transfer across the extracellular milieu.</p><p>Dye exchange was tested further using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Co-cultures were prepared using various pairs of spectrally resolvable CellTracker dyes. The gain of detection channels was calibrated using mono-cultures prepared using one dye only. After gating-out doublets, fluorescence was measured on two detection channels. DLD1 cells grown as mono-cultures emitted fluorescence detected on one channel only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Co-cultures, in contrast, produced a cluster of cells emitting fluorescence in both channels, indicating that dye exchange had occurred during culture. This can be visualized by overlaying pseudocolored density histograms for co-cultures (as green) against the two mono-cultures (as red or blue). To confirm that dye exchange had taken place whilst cells were connected as part of an intact monolayer, control experiments mixed two suspensions of cells harvested from distinctly labeled mono-cultures immediately prior to cytometry (i.e., without a period of culture when cells are coupled to one another). These experiments produced two separate clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), confirming that dual labeling arises only in intact co-cultures. Similar experiments were performed in other CRC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–G</xref>).

In WT cells, the pHe–pHi relationship was linear and not affected by KO of <italic>GJB2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Steady-state pHi was reduced in KO mono-cultures, as expected from impaired pHi control. However, the pHi difference between WT and KO cells collapsed in co-cultures. This effect was Cx26-dependent because <italic>SLC9A1</italic>-expressing HCT116 cells that had genetically inactivated <italic>GJB2</italic> were unable to raise the pHi of co-cultured KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Since the readout of pHi regulation was recorded with single-cell resolution, the distribution of pHi among cells was analyzed to seek an effect of coupling on cell-to-cell variation. <italic>SLC9A1</italic>-deficient cells have weaker pHi control, which manifests as a wider pHi distribution in mono-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). When, however, these KO cells were co-cultured with WT cells, the pHi distribution returned to normal levels. This observation indicates that NHE1 activity in WT cells was able to service the pHi-regulatory needs of KO cells, manifesting as a narrowing of the population-wide spread of pHi. This rescue effect was Cx26-dependent because knockdown of <italic>GJB2</italic> resulted in a wider pHi spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>To test whether diffusive exchange benefits the growth of <italic>SLC9A1</italic>-deficient cells, co-cultures were established from different seeding ratios of WT and KO cells. Parallel plates were set-up to record growth terminated at various time points. Total biomass (i.e., growth of WT and KO cells) was measured by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) absorbance assay and growth of the KO compartment was determined from GFP fluorescence. In the case of KO mono-cultures, the GFP and SRB signals measure an equivalent quantity and therefore provide a calibration curve for converting between the two types of measurements. When applied to co-culture experiments, this calibration can convert the measured SRB signal into an <italic>expected</italic> GFP signal for comparison against the <italic>measured</italic> GFP signal (i.e. actual growth of the labelled compartment). If WT and KO cells had indistinguishable survival prospects, then the time courses of GFP and SRB should be stoichiometrically related to the seeding ratio and measured GFP should equal expected GFP (i.e. SRB scaled by the seeding density, e.g., by 50% for a 1:1 co-culture). If, however, there is a growth advantage for KO cells in the presence of WT cells, then measured GFP will exceed that predicted from SRB. To test for such rescue, co-cultures were established over a range of seeding ratios. Experiments were performed in media at pH 7.4 or 6.6 to stimulate NHE1 over a range of pH. For co-cultures seeded from 25% KO or 50% KO cells, growth of the GFP-tagged KO compartment exceeded the prediction based on equal WT/KO survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). Similar findings were observed using the second KO line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, co-cultured <italic>SLC9A1</italic>-deficient cells grew faster than expected at the expense of coupled WT cells.

These metabolites are expected to diffuse freely between coupled cells, thus any fructose-1,6-bisphosphate that accumulates in an <italic>ALDOA</italic>-deficient cell should diffuse to neighboring cells for processing, whereas ATP will diffuse in the opposite direction. Diffusive rescue would allow <italic>ALDOA</italic>-deficient cells in co-culture with WT cells to grow faster than expected. To test this, co-culture experiments were performed for various ratios of WT and GFP-labeled <italic>ALDOA</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). After 6 days of culture at pH 7.4, GFP fluorescence (a measure of <italic>ALDOA</italic>-deficient cells) and SRB absorbance (total cell biomass) were recorded. If <italic>ALDOA</italic>-deficient cells received no benefit from being coupled onto WT cells, then the endpoint GFP signal would be proportional to the initial seeding density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, gray line). However, GFP-labeled cells became relatively enriched in co-cultures with WT cells, which was most prominent at 3:1 seeding ratio. Thus, the survival of <italic>ALDOA</italic>-deficient cells improved when these connected onto WT counterparts. A similar effect was seen using the other gRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Rescue of <italic>ALDOA</italic>-deficient cells in co-culture with WT cells was absent when <italic>GJB2</italic> was knocked out in WT cells with gRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), indicating a critical role for Cx26-mediated metabolite exchange in this rescue.

This lack of large-scale rescue may relate to the apparent heterogeneity of Cx43 levels across cells, which allows only Cx43-positive cells to benefit from metabolic rescue. NCIH747 cells express isoforms Cx31 and Cx45 but neither were unable to rescue <italic>ALDOA</italic>-deficient cells in co-culture with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> for knockdown confirmation).</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that the genetic ablation of a metabolite-handling cytoplasmic enzyme in one cell can be rescued by diffusive access to the required catalysis in neighboring cells via connexin channels.

Cells deficient in <italic>NDUFS1</italic> grew three times slower than WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), likely due to ablated mitochondrial metabolism that is critical for delivering substrates and energy. To test whether junctional coupling could rescue <italic>NDUFS1</italic>-deficient cells, WT and GFP-labeled KO cells were co-cultured in medium at pH 7.7 (i.e. alkaline conditions that activate glycolysis fully; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). If KO cells received no benefit from being coupled onto WT cells, the GFP signal measured at endpoint would be proportional to the seeding ratio. However, co-culture with WT cells promoted the growth of GFP-labeled KO cells beyond the expected level, particularly for seeding ratios of 3:1 KO:WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This rescue related to the density of cell-to-cell contacts because KO cells could no longer receive a growth benefit in sparse co-culture with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Furthermore, the rescue was linked to Cx26-dependent coupling as co-culture with WT cells that had genetically knocked down <italic>GJB2</italic> by siRNA yielded no benefit to co-cultured <italic>NDUFS1</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).

Solute exchange was demonstrated using fluorescent dyes in terms of an apparent permeability constant and degree of color mixing at steady state. The apparent permeability to calcein, as measured by FRAP, varied among CRC cell lines and correlated best with <italic>GJB2</italic> expression and Cx26 immunoreactivity at cell-to-cell contacts. The role of this particular connexin isoform in producing functional conduits was inferred from the effect of genetic knockdown on permeability, which was most sensitive to siRNA against <italic>GJB2</italic>. The gene coding for Cx26 is expressed in normal colorectal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kanczuga-Koda et al., 2005</xref>), and the unimodal distribution of its message level among CRC cell lines suggests that transformed cells retain its expression, with a few notable exceptions (e.g., RKO). In addition to <italic>GJB2</italic>, some CRC cells express isoforms <italic>GJA1</italic> and <italic>GJC1</italic>, possibly due to mutations or stable epigenetic changes present only in a subset of lines. Intriguingly, the magnitude of calcein permeability measured by FRAP did not predict the degree to which solutes equilibrate between cells at steady state, as measured by coupling coefficient. This is because even weakly coupled confluent monolayers can exchange dyes, if allowed sufficient time. Thus, the phenomenon of solute equilibration across coupled cellular networks is likely to be significant even in cancer cells with nominally low connexin expression.</p><p>In the context of cancer, diffusion through connexin-assembled channels is significant for growth when its traffic includes important metabolites handled by enzymes or transporters. In the event of a loss-of-function mutation, the absence of activity could be compensated by access to fully functional proteins in neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G and H</xref>). This rescue effect was confirmed for three cases of biologically important processes that handle small molecules at distinct subcellular domains: at the plasma membrane (NHE1, coded by <italic>SLC9A1</italic>, handling intracellular H<sup>+</sup> ions), in the cytoplasm (aldolase A, coded by <italic>ALDOA</italic>, handling the glycolytic intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate), and in mitochondria (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S1; <italic>NDUFS1</italic>, part of complex I). Mono-cultures of genetically altered cells manifested a functional defect, namely, impaired pHi regulation (<italic>SLC9A1</italic>-deficient cells), blocked glycolysis (<italic>ALDOA</italic>-deficient cells), or inactivated mitochondrial respiration (<italic>NDUFS1</italic>-deficient cells). However, co-culture with WT counterparts provided rescue, detected as an enrichment in cells carrying the genetic ablation (i.e. the GFP-labelled compartment of co-cultures). Metabolic rescue by connexins was observed in vitro, as well as in vivo, where it allowed a genetically defective cell (<italic>NDFUS1</italic> KO) to expand faster than otherwise. The rescue effect was related to Cx26 channels because it was diminshed by genetically inactivating <italic>GJB2</italic>. However, a role for other connexin isoforms cannot be excluded, although the findings herein suggest that Cx26-low/negative cells expressing <italic>GJB3</italic> (Cx31) or <italic>GJA1</italic> (Cx43) were unable to match the metabolic rescue provided by Cx26 pathways. In the case of Cx31, the conductance established by these channels is likely to be small as its knockdown did not reduce ensemble permeability. Strong conductances could be established in at least some cells of nominally <italic>GJA1</italic> (Cx43)-positive lines. Intruigingly, Cx43-dependent connectivity tended to be heterogenous within a monolayer, which has the consequence of restricting the benefit of metabolic rescue to only a subset of cells. This pattern of expression may explain why Cx43 is less efficacious in metabolic rescue globally, as compared to the more uniformly distributed Cx26.</p><p>Metabolic rescue by gap junctions is relevant to our understanding of somatic evolution in cancer because it provides a mechanism by which cells carrying loss-of-function mutations in metabolite-handling genes are able to survive and divide as long as connections are made onto WT neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G and H</xref>). Consequently, cells acquiring such spontaneous mutations will evade negative selection in a human tumor. However, the same mutation studied in a mono-culture may be lethal because this in vitro setting does not offer a means of rescue by wild-type proteins. Metabolic rescue by gap junctions may explain the paradox of why some genes are found to be essential in vitro but not in vivo (i.e., their inactivating mutations are not negatively selected in human cancers). In contrast, genes responsible for processes that do not handle diffusible solutes cannot benefit from connexin-mediated coupling, irrespective of their cellular neighborhood. This category includes genes coding for ribosomal subunits that are too large to cross connexin channels, or genes coding for neoantigens that are, by design, confined to the mutation-carrying cell. Inactivating mutations in such genes may be selected negatively as there are no tangible ways for compensating the ensuing functional deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zapata et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Another implication of our findings in the context of carcinogenesis relates to the definition of the 'unit' that is being selected during somatic evolution. A key assumption of current tumorigenesis models is that mutations act in a cell-autonomous fashion. Exceptions to this paradigm have been postulated for autocrine interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tomlinson and Bodmer, 1997</xref>), but the role of gap junctional connectivity has not been explored. In terms of genotype, each cell in a tumor is a distinct unit, responding independently to selection pressures. However, diffusive coupling between cells of contrasting genotype can produce an emergent phenotype that is less distinct. This scenario can arise in the case of spontaneous mutations affecting metabolite-handling genes and is significant because the coupled cells will have comparable survival prospects, despite striking differences in genotype. In this system, the unit under selection extends beyond a single cell. Our findings emphasize the importance of measuring phenotypic variation, particularly in instances relating to diffusible molecules, as this may not overlay with the more compartmentalized genotypic landscape. In cases where cell-to-cell phenotypic differences are blurred as a result of connexin connectivity, it would not be appropriate to consider a single cell as the unit under selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertolaso and Dieli, 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, connexin genes are rarely mutated in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zapata et al., 2018</xref>) and we speculate that this reflects a protective role of cell-to-cell coupling in cancer. Therapeutic interventions that target connexins may expose vulnerabilities in cancer and increase the efficacy of treatments, particularly those with demonstrably strong in vitro effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

The following day, medium was replaced with bicarbonate-buffered media (D7777, Sigma) and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 7 days; in some experiments, atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> was reduced to 2% to produce hypoxia. For some experiments, incubations were terminated on days 2–7 to obtain a time course. Plates were analyzed for GFP fluorescence and SRB absorbance (Cytation 5). The GFP signal was measured in intact monolayers (excitation 490 nm, emission 520 nm). Next, wells were prepared for the SRB assay by fixing with PFA 4% for 30 min, washing with water and staining with 100 μL 0.057% SRB (in 1% acetic acid) for 30 min. Residual SRB was removed by washing with 1% acetic acid four times. Finally, 200 μL/well 10 mM Tris base was added to release SRB and measure absorbance (520 nm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>In vivo xenograft experiments</title><p>Six-week-old female athymic Nude Crl:NU(NCr)-Foxn1nu mice were injected subcutaneously with a 1:1 mixture of either WT DLD1 cells and GFP-labeled <italic>NDUFS1</italic> KO SW1222 cells or a 1:1 mixture of <italic>GJB2</italic> KO DLD1 cells and GFP-labeled <italic>NDUFS1</italic> KO SW1222 cells. CRCs cells were resuspended in 100 µL of a 1:1 mixture of Matrigel and serum-free DMEM medium before injection. Each mouse was injected with 2 million cells to each flank: WT DLD1 + <italic>NDUFS1</italic> KO SW1222 on left and <italic>GJB2</italic> KO DLD1 cells + <italic>NDUFS1</italic> KO SW1222 on right. Mice were weighed and tumors were measured three times a week. At the end of the experiments, when tumors reached the scientific or humane endpoint, mice were sacrificed and tumors excised and processed for imaging. Tumor cryo-sections were cut (Thermo Fisher Scientific cryostat) across the tumor height to slices of thickness 5 microns. Sections were then stained with Hoechst and anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Thermo Fisher #A-11122) to enhance the signal from GFP-expressing <italic>NDUFS1</italic>-deficient SW1222 cells. Briefly, frozen slides were air-dried for 30 min, relevant sections marked with a PAP pen ring, and then slides were dip-washed in PBS for 10 min (staining jar), dried with tissue and placed in staining chamber tray, blocked with PBS Triton 0.1% with 5% goat serum and 2% BSA for 30 min, rinsed with PBS 3× (using 3 mL pipette), incubated with primary anti-GFP antibody in PBS Triton 0.1% at 1:250 dilution and 2% goat serum for 1 hr, rinsed 3× with PBS, incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488) at 1:1000 and Hoechst-33258 in PBS Triton 0.1% for 30 min, rinsed 1× with PBS and then dip-washed in PBS for 2 min, then dried with tissue. Approximately 35 μL of slow-fade diamond (Thermo Fisher, S36963) was added and a coverslip applied and sealed with nail polish. Every fifth slides was imagined using a Zeiss Axioscan slide scanner using a ×20 0.8 Plan-Apochromat objective. The montage of images was constructed for the Hoechst and GFP channels. To demarcate the area of the tumor, the Hoechst signal was dilated (rolling ball, 50 pixels) to expand beyond nuclei and fused to form a mask, with smaller particles ignored. The background of GFP images was calculated from the mean of fluorescence within the Hoechst-defined tumor mask. To produce a thresholded GFP image, pixels were defined as GFP-positive if their fluorescence exceeded 4, 5, or 6 standard deviations from the mean GFP signal within the masked region; all other pixels were reassigned a GFP value of zero. Next, all GFP-positive clusters were counted (ignoring large particles that are likely noncellular stains) and the total area calculated. Each slide also provided a measure of tumor area. The total GFP-positive cluster count and area, and overall tumor area were summed over all slices. The analyses were repeated for the three levels of thresholding to ensure the findings are consistent.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data are expressed as mean ± SEM.

Each experiment consisted of three conditions: (i) cells that were loaded with Violet only, (ii) cells that were loaded with Orange only, and (iii) a co-culture of cells that had been loaded with Violet or Orange, mixed in 1:1 ratio. Thus, (i) and (ii) are a mono-culture, whereas (ii) is expected to be a well-mixed co-culture. Diffusive exchange across gap junctions is expected to lead to mixing of dyes between cells. This will have no effect on the mono-cultures as like is exchanged for like, but in co-cultures, some cells would contain Violet and Orange pixels.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Aleksandra Walczak as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bruce J Nicholson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the study was found to be important, and well designed and executed. A related question to address is if Cx31 and 43, which do not seem to have the same roles in maintaining cell coupling as Cx26, also play any role in such metabolic rescue. Additional experiments are needed to address the Cx31 and 43 KD effects, particularly western blots on these two Cxs to prove if adding both shRNAs to Cx43 and 31 also results in reduced expression (or for that matter in KD of any of the three Cxs affects any of the others). Some of gap junctional coupling measurements are qualitative, rather than quantitative, and should be presented as such. Additionally, metabolic coupling and by-stander effect, similar to what is seen here, have been extensively reported; these important contributions ought to be thoroughly discussed including citations of important literature that are not currently included. A more, clear elaboration is needed to explain the novelty of the study and how these in vitro findings recapitulate the types of actual somatic mutations in cancer growth under clinical scenarios.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>On top of page 9, it is not clear if targeting a single connexin gene like GJA1 as stated would be a more viable approach since among the expression of other connexin isoforms, Cx26 is a dominant connexin that forms gap junctions in most of the CRC cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The conclusions from this work are of strong interest to the field, but the authors should do a better job of pointing out how this is really the logical opposite effect of the bystander effect. Which has been demonstrated to be dependent on gap junctions for many years. This does not, however, detract from the current work, but is important for placing it in context.</p><p>The work is quite extensive and represents a very cleverly constructed to study such a complex subject. Complex results are generally well presented, with the exception of the pH effects presented in Figures5 G-H, which are not easy to understand. Also, the terms used to describe permeability are misleading and inappropriate. Permeability has a specific meaning, and requires knowledge of the concentration gradient, the relative volumes of the cells and control over the number and extent of interfaces across which permeation occurs – none of which apply in this case. What is actually measured is a rate of FRAP, which is loosely correlated with permeability of gap junctions. With regard to coupling coefficient, this has a specific meaning in the literature that is usually related to simple transfers between paired cells. The meaning of the term here should be better explained. In addition, it appears that some cells do not partake in the dye mixing, and it may be of use to know if these represent a subset of cells that do not express connexins, which could be established through IF labeling after the transfer.</p><p>In Figure 2 it is clearly shown that KD of Cx26 impairs coupling, but KD of Cx31 or 43 do not (and may even increase coupling). Yet this is then ignored and focus shifts exclusively to Cx26. Given that these Cx31, and at least in a subset of cells Cx43, are expressed at similar levels to Cx26, this should be explored, as in terms of physiological relevance to the tissue this could be of great importance. Initial understanding of this result would require information on the efficacy of KD for Cx32 and 43, yet the authors only show results for Cx26 KD (Figure 2 H and J). It could also be useful to include at least one test of Cx31 KO in one of the metabolite systems studied subsequently in the paper. The others also need to be shown. At the very least, some discussion of this anomalous result should be presented. Points that could be considered are: Cx26 and 31 oligomerize, so perhaps the oligomer has different permeation than Cx26 monomers; This is not true for Cx43, but it appears that it is not expressed in all cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific comments</p><p>1. In the abstract the authors' write:</p><p>Line 35 – Function rescue was dependent on Cx26 channels and reduced phenotypic heterogeneity among cells.</p><p>In isolation this sentence seems to be a strong statement. The authors probably did not mean it to come across this way and likely view that it should be interpreted in the context of prior sentences. However, as a standalone inference it should be toned down – and also other places in the manuscript where related wording occurs. The authors only looked carefully at Cx26, excluding other connexins. It is not clear that other connexins can not also contribute to this phenomenon, or that important nuances may occur in their models with heteromeric and/or heterotypic patterns of connexin contact.</p><p>2. In a related vein, that another Cx was examined (e.g., Cx43) appears to be a gap in generalizing the results from the study.</p><p>3. To obtain Cx loss of function the authors rely almost exclusively on knockdown (KD). This is OK – but it does raise the prospect of phenotypic changes occurring over the multi-hour time course to effective KD/loss of function. There are peptides that enable relatively selective and rapid (within minutes) loss or gain of function of Cx function. Also, effective and quick, though somewhat less selective, are pharmacological agents that can block or enhance GJ junction. Why are such approaches not employed to address this issue?</p><p>4. The explanation of the statistical approach was minimal. More details are required on the nature of the analyses undertaken. Normal, non-parametric? If normal, was testing for homogeneity of variance or normality performed? Was post-hoc testing performed? A review by a professional statistician may be required.</p><p>5. The authors' write:</p><p>Line 321- Intriguingly, the exact magnitude of permeability did not predict the degree to which solutes can be equilibrated between cells at steady-state. This is because even weakly coupled confluent monolayers were able to exchange dyes, if allowed sufficient time. Thus, the phenomenon of solute equilibration across coupled cancer cells is likely to be significant even in cells with low connexin expression.</p><p>Some care here needs to be taken in this reviewer's opinion. The authors model involves intermingled cultures in which diffusion typically occurs for distances of not more than a few cell diameters. The situation may be different in cancer in vivo (e.g., in solid tumors) or 3D cultures – where diffusion distance from competent non-cancer cells will likely present a more exacting path for a diffusing metabolite. Have the authors considered an approach for replicating the situation of action at distance in vitro in their model? Without such data the statement &quot;…the phenomenon of solute equilibration across coupled cancer cells is likely to be significant even in cells with low connexin expression&quot; Is really only supported by the data in hand within the tight confines of the models used in these studies.</p><p>6. A diagram summarizing findings may help readers efficiently determine what is new and significant about this study -information that may help address the opening point on differentiation from the already longstanding concept of &quot;metabolic cooperation&quot;.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Solute exchange through gap junctions lessens the adverse effects of inactivating mutations in metabolite-handling genes&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Aleksandra Walczak (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers appreciate your detailed responses to the previous review, revised text and additional experiments. The manuscript has been improved. Please address two remaining issues raised by Reviewer #2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done an excellent job in responding to reviewer's suggestions, even including additional experiments that directly address some of the issues, as well as appropriately modifying the text. As noted before, this is an important extension of prior work that establishes a novel explanation as to why defects in essential genes that produce gap junctionally permeant metabolites are not selected against in tumor populations (or presumably any well coupled cell populations). As such, it is highly appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Only two issues remain that should be addressed:</p><p>1. The authors persist in using the term &quot;Permeability&quot;, measured in units of uM/min for their FRAP data. the explanation of its quantitation is now significantly extended in Appendix 1, and this is a valuable addition. However, as is evident in the calculation, The α factor in equations 2 and 3 converting fluorescence to concentration cancels in calculating the final permeability (rho), so there is no concentration information in rho. So while the permeability numbers are good for comparative purposes, as used here, it is inappropriate to list permeability as uM/min, as nowhere is the concentration of Calcein inside the monolayer established. In addition, the comparison BETWEEN cell lines would require that the initial concentration of calcein in the monolayer be independently established for each cell line (as the uptake of calcein in each cell line is likely different and unlikely to reach equilibrium in the 10 min incubation used). Otherwise, a caveat would need to be included in such inter-cell type comparisons. All of this being said, the assay is nicely described, and still useful for comparisons as used here. It just does not represent an actual permeability in terms of uM/min.</p><p>2. The authors have done a creditable effort to demonstrate that Cx31 appears not to be anywhere near as effective in rescuing metabolite deficient phenotypes as Cx26. They also make the same claim for Cx43, but this is not supported by the data they present. They test if ALDO KO DLD1 (Figure 6) or NDUFS1-KO SW1222 (Figure 7) can be rescued by wt cells expressing Cx43 (C10), stating that &quot;These co-cultures should, in theory, produce heterotypic connexins (should read gap junctions)&quot;. The problem is they should and likely do NOT, as Cx26 and 43 have been demonstrated to NOT form heterotypic channels, and the authors demonstrate earlier that neither DLD1 or SW1222 express Cx43. To demonstrate that Cx43 can or cannot mediate the metabolic rescue they are studying, they would need to do the Aldolase of NDUFS1 KOs in C10 cells, and then do cultures of the KO and wt cells, all of which express Cx43. Otherwise they need to limit their conclusions about lack of metabolic rescue to Cx31, which does form heteroptypic channels with Cx26. This is important, as Cx43 is also commonly expressed in tumors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78425.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the study was found to be important, and well designed and executed. A related question to address is if Cx31 and 43, which do not seem to have the same roles in maintaining cell coupling as Cx26, also play any role in such metabolic rescue.</p></disp-quote><p>To test for metabolic rescue by Cx isoforms other than Cx26, we now provide additional experiments using CRC cells that express Cx43 or Cx31, but have low or absent Cx26. Cells meeting this criterion included C10 and NCIH747, respectively (Figure 1E). We performed two types of experiments: In the first, we co-cultured <italic>ALDOA</italic>-deficient cells with their wild-type counterparts (Figure 6H). For the second experiment, we co-cultured <italic>NDUFS1</italic>-knockout SW1222 cells with either C10 or NCIH747 cells (Figure 7H). As an additional negative control, we provide new data using connexin-negative RKO cells. Overall, the results confirm that metabolic rescue is best achieved with Cx26 expressing cells. The lower effectiveness of Cx31 is consistent with our observations that <italic>(i) GJB3</italic> expression levels do not correlate with overall connectivity, and <italic>(ii) GJB3</italic> knockdown does not ablate coupling functionally, i.e. Cx31 channels are unlikely to form strong conductance pathways for metabolites between cells. In the case of Cx43, we find that monolayers grown from <italic>GJA1</italic>-expressing lines contained both Cx43-positive and negative cells (confirmed by IF, and now by FACS – new data in Figure 2H). Thus, not all cells of nominally <italic>GJA1</italic>-high cell lines will benefit from Cx43-dependent connectivity, and hence metabolic rescue. Thus, our findings strengthen the case for Cx26 being particularly effective in metabolic rescue, at least in CRC cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional experiments are needed to address the Cx31 and 43 KD effects, particularly western blots on these two Cxs to prove if adding both shRNAs to Cx43 and 31 also results in reduced expression (or for that matter in KD of any of the three Cxs affects any of the others).</p></disp-quote><p>This point has arisen from data shown in Figure 2D results. There, we show that coupling in selected cells is reduced by <italic>GJB2</italic> knockdown, but not <italic>GJB3</italic> knockdown. The rationale for this experiment was that expression of these two genes is often concordant, so a KD experiment was necessary to verify the functionally dominant isoform. There was a trend that <italic>GJB3</italic> knockdown increased coupling, but we explain that this was not statistically significant (<italic>GJB3</italic> v scrambled) when analysed by hierarchical (nested) methods (indeed, we did not indicate this to be significant in the original revision, and therefore did not study it further). The trend may result from a compensatory increase in other connexin isoforms but Cx31 knockdown did not appear to substantially change Cx26 or Cx43 levels (new blots in Figure 2-supp1). Moreover, <italic>GJB3</italic> (Cx31) knockdown did not induce <italic>GJA1</italic> (Cx43) expression in an otherwise negative line (DLD1). Similarly, Cx43 knockdown did not affect Cx31 or Cx26 levels (Figure 2-supp1). Moreover, in DLD1 Cx26 stable knockout cells, we find no major effect on Cx31 or Cx43 expression, relative to wild-type cells (Figure 2-supp1). It is possible that changes to connexin expression could alter the density of connections or confluency of cells, thereby strengthening Cx26-dependent connections, but this cannot be resolved with fluorescence imaging alone. Overall, we do not see compelling evidence for compensatory changes in connexin levels upon knockdown. It is plausible that <italic>GJB3</italic> knockdown reduces the incidence of Cx26/Cx31 heterotypic channels, which have been shown to be less permeable than Cx26 channels. Genetic ablation of Cx31 would therefore increase overall permeability. Given that Cx26 channels are the dominant source of metabolic rescue, we felt that studying gene regulation of other connexins would fall outside the scope of this study; we hope the reviewers agree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of gap junctional coupling measurements are qualitative, rather than quantitative, and should be presented as such.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide an explanation of our method and explain how it can provide a reasonably quantitative estimate of ensemble permeability. This is because we combine geometrical data with flux data, and we expand on this further in the Methods. We agree that the original description did not provide sufficient information for the reviewers to judge the method’s robustness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, metabolic coupling and by-stander effect, similar to what is seen here, have been extensively reported; these important contributions ought to be thoroughly discussed including citations of important literature that are not currently included.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Introduction and Discussion to explain how our findings go beyond what is known about the bystander effect. We added key references for the discovery of the bystander effect and metabolic cooperation, and put these in the context of our tested hypothesis. Thank you for these valuable suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A more, clear elaboration is needed to explain the novelty of the study and how these in vitro findings recapitulate the types of actual somatic mutations in cancer growth under clinical scenarios.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded on the significance of our findings for cancer – elaborating further on what we had written about negative selection (specifically, how our data can explain the scarcity of negative selection in vivo, a hitherto unexplained finding). In recognition that our experiments were in vitro, we now add findings from animal xenografts that support our hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>On top of page 9, it is not clear if targeting a single connexin gene like GJA1 as stated would be a more viable approach since among the expression of other connexin isoforms, Cx26 is a dominant connexin that forms gap junctions in most of the CRC cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the poor wording. Our intention was to select cells with a range of Cx26 expression, without other major connexins. We now added data from other cell lines, thus this sentence is no longer accurate, and we have revised it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The conclusions from this work are of strong interest to the field, but the authors should do a better job of pointing out how this is really the logical opposite effect of the bystander effect. Which has been demonstrated to be dependent on gap junctions for many years. This does not, however, detract from the current work, but is important for placing it in context.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text to refer to the by-stander effect, and indicate how the present work is distinct, and its logical extension.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The work is quite extensive and represents a very cleverly constructed to study such a complex subject. Complex results are generally well presented, with the exception of the pH effects presented in Figures5 G-H, which are not easy to understand.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been addressed (see comments under weaknesses).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the terms used to describe permeability are misleading and inappropriate. Permeability has a specific meaning, and requires knowledge of the concentration gradient, the relative volumes of the cells and control over the number and extent of interfaces across which permeation occurs – none of which apply in this case. What is actually measured is a rate of FRAP, which is loosely correlated with permeability of gap junctions.</p></disp-quote><p>We elaborate on this calculation: please see comments under weaknesses</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regard to coupling coefficient, this has a specific meaning in the literature that is usually related to simple transfers between paired cells. The meaning of the term here should be better explained. In addition, it appears that some cells do not partake in the dye mixing, and it may be of use to know if these represent a subset of cells that do not express connexins, which could be established through IF labeling after the transfer.</p></disp-quote><p>We explain the calculation of coupling coefficient and provide a definition (please see comments under weaknesses). The idea of performing IF is a good one; however, fixing cells will also wash away CellTracker, so the suggested analysis would not be feasible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2 it is clearly shown that KD of Cx26 impairs coupling, but KD of Cx31 or 43 do not (and may even increase coupling). Yet this is then ignored and focus shifts exclusively to Cx26. Given that these Cx31, and at least in a subset of cells Cx43, are expressed at similar levels to Cx26, this should be explored, as in terms of physiological relevance to the tissue this could be of great importance. Initial understanding of this result would require information on the efficacy of KD for Cx32 and 43, yet the authors only show results for Cx26 KD (Figure 2 H and J).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not providing these blots in the first instance. Blots of lysates matching functional data are shown in Figure 2-suppl1+2 and confirm efficacy of Cx43 and Cx31 knockdown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It could also be useful to include at least one test of Cx31 KO in one of the metabolite systems studied subsequently in the paper. The others also need to be shown. At the very least, some discussion of this anomalous result should be presented. Points that could be considered are: Cx26 and 31 oligomerize, so perhaps the oligomer has different permeation than Cx26 monomers; This is not true for Cx43, but it appears that it is not expressed in all cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide new data using cells that are Cx26-low/negative but express other connexins (added to Figure 6 and Figure 7). There, we show that connexins other than Cx26 are not as effective as Cx26 in enabling metabolic rescue. Specifically, we performed co-cultures of <italic>NDUFS1</italic>-KO SW1222 (Cx26+) cells with either C10 and NCIH747, i.e. Cx26-low lines. These co-cultures should, in theory, produce heterotypic connexins but there was no significant rescue of <italic>NDUFS1</italic>-deficient cells. These new data demonstrate the high effectiveness of Cx26 channels in enabling metabolic rescue. Strikingly, a recent analysis by Robert Gatenby and colleagues showed that only Cx26 is ‘never mutated in cancers’, i.e. is absolutely necessary for cancers to thrive. This is also the connexin isoform that is native to the parent epithelium, and thus may be most suited to sustain communication, even after mutations.</p><p>The issue of oligomerisation between Cx isoforms is interesting, and thank you for raising this point. Indeed, it is plausible that weakly-conducting Cx26/Cx31 channels are formed in CRC, and the apparent strengthening of coupling in Cx31 KD cells could be explained as a shift away from heterotypic channels, towards higher conductance homotypic Cx26 channels. However, as explained above, hierarchical analysis does not detect a statistically significant effect between scrambled controls and <italic>GJB3</italic> knockdown cells, so the issue is unresolved. Nonetheless, the firm conclusion of the work is that <italic>GJB2</italic> KD (as well as KO for DLD1) strongly uncouples monolayers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>1. In the abstract the authors' write:</p><p>Line 35 – Function rescue was dependent on Cx26 channels and reduced phenotypic heterogeneity among cells.</p><p>In isolation this sentence seems to be a strong statement. The authors probably did not mean it to come across this way and likely view that it should be interpreted in the context of prior sentences. However, as a standalone inference it should be toned down – and also other places in the manuscript where related wording occurs. The authors only looked carefully at Cx26, excluding other connexins. It is not clear that other connexins can not also contribute to this phenomenon, or that important nuances may occur in their models with heteromeric and/or heterotypic patterns of connexin contact.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We have toned down the abstract, and reviewed the text for inaccurate wording. We have added new data showing that Cx26-low/negative cell lines expressing other connexins (e.g. Cx43-positive C10 or Cx31/Cx45 positive NCIH747) cannot produce the same degree of rescue as Cx26 channels in DLD1 or similar CRCs. These new data are added to Figure 6/7. Further, we provide new data (Figure 7H) showing that heterotypic connections (e.g. between SW1222 and C10 or SW1222 and NCIH747) do not have the same efficacy in metabolic rescue as homotypic Cx26 connections (e.g. in SW1222 mono-cultures). Cx43 channels can produce strong connectivity in some cell lines (e.g. C10), but we observed considerable heterogeneity among cells in terms of their Cx43 levels (first inferred from IF images). We now confirm the presence of Cx43-low and Cx43-high sub-populations by FACS (new data; Figure 2H). Based on these findings, we argue that only some cells of a nominally <italic>GJA1-</italic>high cell line could potentially benefit from metabolic rescue. We believe that this pattern explains why Cx43 is less efficacious for metabolic rescue in a network of CRCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In a related vein, that another Cx was examined (e.g., Cx43) appears to be a gap in generalizing the results from the study.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we have added new data using C10 cells, a Cx26-low but strongly Cx43-positive line. Due to heterogeneity in Cx43 levels among cells, this line shows considerable variation in functional coupling as measured by FRAP (Figure 2). This cell was unable to rescue genetic deficiencies in <italic>ALDOA</italic> (homotypic Cx43; Figure 6) or <italic>NDUFS1</italic> (potentially heterotypic Cx26-Cx43; Figure 7). The original IF images in Figure 2G suggested that Cx43 expression is heterogenous among cells, with only a subpopulation being clearly positive. This is in contrast to the more uniform abundance of Cx26. We speculate that non-uniform Cx43 expression in a monolayer may limit the ability of this connexin to rescue metabolism globally, as it would require two random events to coincide: a somatic loss-of-function mutation <italic>and</italic> expression of Cx43. For this reason, Cx43 may be less effective in metabolic rescue than Cx26. To confirm this heterogeneity, we sorted <italic>GJA1</italic>-high LOVO and Caco2 cells by Cx43 levels, and found distinct sub-populations of dramatically different Cx43 levels, even after allowing cells to expand for western blotting. We add these new data to Figure 2. Note, however, that after prolonger culture and multiple passages, the cells return to the original, heterogenous population (thus it is not possible to keep a purely positive or negative population for experiments, such as rescue, over several days).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. To obtain Cx loss of function the authors rely almost exclusively on knockdown (KD). This is OK – but it does raise the prospect of phenotypic changes occurring over the multi-hour time course to effective KD/loss of function. There are peptides that enable relatively selective and rapid (within minutes) loss or gain of function of Cx function. Also, effective and quick, though somewhat less selective, are pharmacological agents that can block or enhance GJ junction. Why are such approaches not employed to address this issue?</p></disp-quote><p>We concur that peptides and drugs are available for blocking Cxs. However, cancer-relevant readouts such as cell growth take days to develop, and therefore a genetic alteration is preferred over pharmacology. Moreover, some Cx inhibitors (e.g. carbenoxolone) require relatively high concentrations for efficacy, which raises concerns about off-target effects. Some blockers (e.g. glycyrrhetinic acid) also affect enzymes involved in signalling, which may impact cancer growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The explanation of the statistical approach was minimal. More details are required on the nature of the analyses undertaken. Normal, non-parametric? If normal, was testing for homogeneity of variance or normality performed? Was post-hoc testing performed? A review by a professional statistician may be required.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now expanded on the statistics. We performed normality tests, and elaborate on the methods used..</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors' write:</p><p>Line 321- Intriguingly, the exact magnitude of permeability did not predict the degree to which solutes can be equilibrated between cells at steady-state. This is because even weakly coupled confluent monolayers were able to exchange dyes, if allowed sufficient time. Thus, the phenomenon of solute equilibration across coupled cancer cells is likely to be significant even in cells with low connexin expression.</p><p>Some care here needs to be taken in this reviewer's opinion. The authors model involves intermingled cultures in which diffusion typically occurs for distances of not more than a few cell diameters. The situation may be different in cancer in vivo (e.g., in solid tumors) or 3D cultures – where diffusion distance from competent non-cancer cells will likely present a more exacting path for a diffusing metabolite. Have the authors considered an approach for replicating the situation of action at distance in vitro in their model? Without such data the statement &quot;…the phenomenon of solute equilibration across coupled cancer cells is likely to be significant even in cells with low connexin expression&quot; Is really only supported by the data in hand within the tight confines of the models used in these studies.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good point. Our reasoning is that in a human cancer, mutations will be sporadic and therefore highly localized. Thus, the potential diffusion distance over which rescue would happen is small – perhaps a few cells, and not radically different to the in vitro situation. We have added this reasoning to the Discussion.</p><p>In light of this comment, we felt it was important to perform a series of xenograft experiments to confirm our in vitro findings in a more physiological scenario. The new in vivo data are shown in Figure 8. Xenografts were grown on the two flanks of mice and consisted of admixtures of respiring DLD1 cells and mitochondrially-defective (<italic>NDUFS1</italic> KO) SW1222 cells. We show that wild-type (Cx26-expressing) DLD1 cells can rescue the growth of <italic>NDUFS1</italic>-cells, which otherwise grow very poorly. However, a xenograft established using DLD1 <italic>GJB2</italic>-KO cells (instead of wild-type DLD1 cells) was unable to produce the same degree of rescue. This finding shows that rescue requires Cx26 channels between respiring DLD1 and mitochondrially-defective SW1222 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. A diagram summarizing findings may help readers efficiently determine what is new and significant about this study -information that may help address the opening point on differentiation from the already longstanding concept of &quot;metabolic cooperation&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We include a summary cartoon on the last figure (Figure 8), and expanded the Discussion accordingly.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have done an excellent job in responding to reviewer's suggestions, even including additional experiments that directly address some of the issues, as well as appropriately modifying the text. As noted before, this is an important extension of prior work that establishes a novel explanation as to why defects in essential genes that produce gap junctionally permeant metabolites are not selected against in tumor populations (or presumably any well coupled cell populations). As such, it is highly appropriate for publication in eLife.</p><p>Only two issues remain that should be addressed:</p><p>1. The authors persist in using the term &quot;Permeability&quot;, measured in units of uM/min for their FRAP data. the explanation of its quantitation is now significantly extended in Appendix 1, and this is a valuable addition. However, as is evident in the calculation, The α factor in equations 2 and 3 converting fluorescence to concentration cancels in calculating the final permeability (rho), so there is no concentration information in rho. So while the permeability numbers are good for comparative purposes, as used here, it is inappropriate to list permeability as uM/min, as nowhere is the concentration of Calcein inside the monolayer established. In addition, the comparison BETWEEN cell lines would require that the initial concentration of calcein in the monolayer be independently established for each cell line (as the uptake of calcein in each cell line is likely different and unlikely to reach equilibrium in the 10 min incubation used). Otherwise, a caveat would need to be included in such inter-cell type comparisons. All of this being said, the assay is nicely described, and still useful for comparisons as used here. It just does not represent an actual permeability in terms of uM/min.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concerns raised, and kindly provide further explanations. We think there is a misunderstanding about the units. The Reviewer writes about “uM/min”, which is a unit of <italic>flux</italic> (concentration/time). Such a parameter would need accurate measurements of concentration. However, our reporting unit in Figure 2 is “um/min” (length/time), which is the standard unit of <italic>permeability</italic> (cf the standard unit of diffusion coefficient is um<sup>2</sup>/min, and can also be quantified by FRAP). This unit has:</p><p>i) a <italic>geometrical aspect</italic> that accounts for the extent of cell-cell contacts (unit: um), and</p><p>ii) a <italic>temporal aspect</italic> that is derived from the time-constant of fluorescence recovery (unit min<sup>-1</sup>)</p><p>Thus, our unit is independent of concentration. Appendix 1 clarifies why this is so.</p><p>We double checked our axis labels and confirm that we used micron per min for all the data.</p><p>We’d like to clarify some points made in the comment, please:</p><p>1) Correct: there is no concentration information in rho. Rho is purely geometrical and has no concentration data – it is calculated from cell outlines and indeed, could have been measured from brightfield images. Units: um<sup>-1</sup>. This accounts for the “geometric” component of P.</p><p>2) We used a proportional measure of intracellular calcein levels to calculate a recovery time constant after bleaching (the “time” component of P), in units of min<sup>-1</sup>. This time constant is, by definition, independent of concentration. The same recovery time constant would be obtained irrespective of whether we chose uM, mM or (as in our case) fluorescence units on the y-axis. Thus, a calibration from fluorescence units to (real) concentration is not required.</p><p>3) The initial concentration of calcein in μm (or similar) is not a factor in calculating permeability from FRAP. In Appendix 1, we show that concentration features on the left and right side of equation 1: thus, the unit of concentration is irrelevant, as long as it’s the same on both sides. Thus, we could assess calcein abundance in uM, mM or fluorescence units, and still arrive at the same answer. [NB: this assumes linearity between fluorescence and concentration – a reasonable assumption for dyes in sub-mM levels, like in cells]. Please consider a thought experiment: if we loaded cells with half the amount of calcein, and bleached half of this amount in the central cell, the recovery of fluorescence would be unaffected. Geometry will, of course, be the same, thus P will be unchanged.</p><p>Since we have used um/min in all our previous studies of gap junctions over the past two decades, we would like to retain this convention, please. Many authors have chosen to quantify FRAP in terms of a time constant only, but this ignores geometry, which will be different between cell lines – e.g. some cells form denser contacts. We believe our approach of combining recovery and geometry is more appropriate.</p><p>Multiple FRAP studies of cytoplasmic properties have converted recovery time constants into a diffusion coefficient (e.g. of fluorescent dyes), in units of um<sup>2</sup>/min. Diffusion, like permeability, is independent of initial concentration: at 100 mM or 10 mM, Na<sup>+</sup> ions still have the same diffusion coefficient (at constant temperature).</p><p>We do, however, accept that a more accurate description of our measured parameter would be <italic>“apparent permeability to calcein”</italic> and we renamed permeability to this throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors have done a creditable effort to demonstrate that Cx31 appears not to be anywhere near as effective in rescuing metabolite deficient phenotypes as Cx26. They also make the same claim for Cx43, but this is not supported by the data they present. They test if ALDO KO DLD1 (Figure 6) or NDUFS1-KO SW1222 (Figure 7) can be rescued by wt cells expressing Cx43 (C10), stating that &quot;These co-cultures should, in theory, produce heterotypic connexins (should read gap junctions)&quot;. The problem is they should and likely do NOT, as Cx26 and 43 have been demonstrated to NOT form heterotypic channels, and the authors demonstrate earlier that neither DLD1 or SW1222 express Cx43. To demonstrate that Cx43 can or cannot mediate the metabolic rescue they are studying, they would need to do the Aldolase of NDUFS1 KOs in C10 cells, and then do cultures of the KO and wt cells, all of which express Cx43. Otherwise they need to limit their conclusions about lack of metabolic rescue to Cx31, which does form heteroptypic channels with Cx26. This is important, as Cx43 is also commonly expressed in tumors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We had, indeed, performed the Cx43 experiment. Figure 6H shows data from C10 cells (i.e. Cx43-dependent). However, we now noticed that the revised legend to Figure 6H had an error: the ALDOA KD was performed on C10 cells, <italic>not DLD1 cells</italic>. Nonetheless, the description of this experiment in the main text and in the figure labelling in Figure 6H are correct. The ALDOA KD of C10 is confirmed in the supplement. A similar ‘typo’ occurred for Figure 6I: the KD was in NCIH747 cells, <italic>not DLD1 cells</italic>. We profusely apologise for this oversight.</p><p>To recap: in the experiment shown in Figure 6H, we co-cultured wild-type cells with ALDOA-deficient C10 cells. The principal mechanism by which these monolayers are connected is via Cx43. However, these channels did not give rise to significant metabolic rescue, to the extent that Cx26-coupling does. In the text, we speculate that this may relate to our observation that Cx43 levels across a population of CRC cells is very heterogenous, and that only the positive sub-population would benefit from coupling. This, therefore, limits the extent of metabolic rescue across a cell-population (e.g. monolayer).</p><p>Thank you for drawing our attention to the inability of Cx43 and Cx26 channels to form heterotypic gap junctions. We have revised the text on p17 (line 390) to correct our mistake. We quote a review article.</p></body></sub-article></article>
