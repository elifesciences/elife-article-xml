Severe hearing impairment follows OHC degeneration. Previous attempts at regenerating new OHCs from cochlear supporting cells (SCs) have been unsuccessful, notably lacking expression of the key OHC motor protein, Prestin. Thus, regeneration of Prestin+ OHCs represents a barrier to restore auditory function in vivo. Here, we reported the successful in vivo conversion of adult mouse cochlear SCs into Prestin+ OHC-like cells through the concurrent induction of two key transcriptional factors known to be necessary for OHC development: <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Ikzf2</italic>. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed the upregulation of 729 OHC genes and downregulation of 331 SC genes in OHC-like cells. The resulting differentiation status of these OHC-like cells was much more advanced than previously achieved. This study thus established an efficient approach to induce the regeneration of Prestin+ OHCs, paving the way for in vivo cochlear repair via SC transdifferentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prestin</kwd><kwd>outer hair cell</kwd><kwd>cochlea</kwd><kwd>Ikzf2</kwd><kwd>Atoh1</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81771012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0103901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB32060100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018SHZDZX05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004921</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SSMU-ZLCX20180601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001003</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE811138149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adult cochlear supporting cells (SCs) are plastic and respond to ectopic Ikzf2 and Atoh1, and hair cell damage by up-regulating HC and down-regulating their endogenous SC genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hair cells (HCs) are the auditory sensors that enable vertebrates to hear. These cells are located in the auditory epithelium, the latter referred to as the organ of Corti (OC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu and Kelley, 2012</xref>). Located near HCs are several supporting cell (SC) subtypes, which, from the medial side to lateral side, are Pillar cells (PCs) and Deiters’ cells (DCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Montcouquiol and Kelley, 2020</xref>). Auditory HCs comprise two subtypes, inner and outer HCs (IHCs and OHCs). IHCs are the primary sensory cells and innervated by type-I cochlear spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). IHCs specifically express vGlut3, encoded by <italic>Slc17a8</italic>, which is required for sound information transmission from IHCs to SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2018b</xref>); consequently, <italic>Slc17a8<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice are completely deaf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ruel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seal et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, OHCs act as sound amplifiers and lack vGlut3. OHCs express a motor protein unique to them, Prestin, encoded by <italic>Slc26a5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>). Prestin mediates electromotility, which enables OHCs to function as sound amplifiers, an important step in broadening our ability to perceive sounds. Indeed, Prestin-deficient (<italic>Slc26a5</italic><sup>−/<italic>−</italic></sup>) mice show severe hearing impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liberman et al., 2002</xref>). IHCs and OHCs are believed to originate from communal pool of Atoh1+ progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Driver et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Groves et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matei et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tateya et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Atoh1 is a bHLH transcriptional factor (TF) that is necessary for specifying general HC fate, and, accordingly, both IHCs and OHCs are lost in <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>−/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bermingham et al., 1999</xref>). Two additional TFs, encoded by Insm1 and Ikzf2, are known to be required for specifying OHC fate and/or repressing IHC fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chessum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wiwatpanit et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, OHCs in <italic>Insm1</italic><sup>−/<italic>−</italic></sup> and Ikzf2 point-mutant mice tend to transdifferentiate into IHCs. Insm1 and Ikzf2 differ in that the former is only transiently expressed in differentiating OHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lorenzen et al., 2015</xref>), whereas the latter is expressed permanently throughout the lifetime of OHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chessum et al., 2018</xref>). Unlike IHCs, OHCs are highly vulnerable to ototoxic drugs, noise, and aging and their damage is a common cause of hearing impairment. Non-mammalian vertebrates such as fish and chicken are able to regenerate HCs from neighboring SCs, during which key HC developmental genes (e.g. <italic>Atoh1</italic>) are reactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2015</xref>). Mammals have lost this regenerative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Janesick and Heller, 2019</xref>). Nonetheless, recent single-cell transcriptomic analyses of cochlear cells suggest that some SCs share recent progenitors with OHCs (particularly Lgr5+ PCs and DCs populations) and are thus regarded as a promising source for new OHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kolla et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McLean et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, PCs and DCs are also in close physical proximity to OHCs requiring minimal if any displacement.</p><p>In previous work, we demonstrated that in vivo ectopic <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression in neonatal and juvenile SCs (primarily PCs and DCs) is sufficient to convert these cells into nascent HCs that express early HC markers such as Myo6 and Myo7a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>). In contrast, adult PCs and DCs are not sensitive to ectopic Atoh1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>), unless additional manipulations are performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walters et al., 2017</xref>). Despite this progress, no newly in vivo transformed HCs has been reported to express Prestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walters et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, an outstanding challenge is how to regenerate Prestin+ OHCs from SCs, particularly from adult lesioned cochlea; indeed, OHC damage is the much more prevalent in the elderly population, than in younger generations. As ectopic Ikzf2 induction in IHCs leads to ectopic Prestin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chessum et al., 2018</xref>), we hypothesized that together Atoh1 and Ikzf2 might synergistically reprogram adult PCs and DCs into not only HCs, but into further differentiated Prestin+ OHCs.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we generated genetic mice lines that allowed us to conditionally and concurrently induce ectopic expression of Atoh1 and Ikzf2 in adult cochlear SCs (primarily PCs and DCs), with or without pre-damaging wild-type OHCs. In summary, the results that emanated from our comprehensive genetic, transcriptomic, immunostaining, morphological, and fate-mapping analyses supported our general hypothesis. Indeed, new Prestin+ OHC-like cells were frequently observed across the entire cochlear duct; interestingly, this occurred much more readily when endogenous OHCs were pre-damaged. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of in vivo generation of Prestin+ OHC-like cells from adult cochlear SCs. Our findings identify Atoh1 and Ikzf2 as potential targets for OHC regeneration therapy in hearing-impaired patients. Nonetheless, future work is still called for as the Prestin+ OHC-like cells were still insufficiently differentiated to restore hearing loss caused by OHC damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of conditional Ikzf2-overexpression mouse model</title><p>To test whether concurrent Atoh1 and Ikzf2 expression was sufficient to induce transdifferentiation of adult SCs into OHCs, we needed various conditional transgenic lines. A conditional Atoh1-overexpression transgenic strain, CAG-Loxp-stop-Loxp-<italic>Atoh1</italic>*2xHA+ (CAG-LSL-<italic>Atoh1</italic>+ for short) already existed, and its ability to efficiently drive high Atoh1 protein expression was previously confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>). In this mouse line, 2× HA fragments were tagged to the C-terminus of Atoh1 as a practical means for reading out expression. However, a similar conditional expression model for Ikzf2 was not available. Therefore, we began by generating a <italic>Rosa26</italic>-CAG-Loxp-stop-Loxp-<italic>Ikzf2</italic>*3xHA-T2A-Tdtomato/+ knock in mouse line (<italic>Rosa26<sup>CAG-LSL-Ikzf2/+</sup></italic> for short), in which Ikzf2 is similarly tagged with 3× HA fragments at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). The mouse line was generated following the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-targeting approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2020b</xref>), Southern blotting results confirmed the lack of random donor DNA insertion into the host mouse genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), and PCR-genotyping of tail DNA allowed us to readily distinguish among wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Both heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Rosa26<sup>CAG-LSL-Ikzf2/+</sup></italic> mice were healthy and fertile and did not display any noticeable abnormalities.</p><p>The genetic constructs were designed such that upon Cre-mediated recombination, Tdtomato and Ikzf2 would be translated, initially together from the same polycistronic mRNA, and subsequently cleaved by the 2A peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2020a</xref>); and once triggered, expression of Ikzf2 and Tdtomato would be permanent, enabling genetic fate-mapping analysis at single-cell resolution. Thus, this construct, when used in conjunction with a SC-specific Cre-driver, would readily allow us to distinguish potential new OHCs (Tdtomato+) derived from adult cochlear SCs (primarily PCs and DCs in this study) from endogenous OHCs (Tdtomato−). Due to the lack of high-quality commercial antibodies against either Atoh1 or Ikzf2, we used anti-HA antibody to assess the presence of ectopic Atoh1 and Ikzf2 proteins in CAG-LSL-<italic>Atoh1</italic>+ and <italic>Rosa26<sup>CAG-LSL-Ikzf2/+</sup></italic> strains, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Induction of ectopic Ikzf2 in IHCs is sufficient to induce OHC-markers, prestin, and Ocm expression, as well as reduce IHC-marker, Slc7a14 expression</title><p>We began by validating the ability of the new mouse model (<italic>Rosa26<sup>CAG-LSL-Ikzf2/+</sup></italic>) to drive ectopic and ‘functional’ Ikzf2 expression. It is known that IHCs, infected with an Anc80-virus expressing Ikzf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chessum et al., 2018</xref>), begin synthetizing the typically OHC-exclusive protein, Prestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liberman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>). We therefore used ectopic Prestin expression as a proxy for ‘functional’ Ikzf2 expression in IHCs. More specifically, we crossed the transgenic Atoh1-CreER+ mouse line, in which Cre activity is restricted to HCs (both IHCs and OHCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chow et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox et al., 2012</xref>), to the new <italic>Rosa26<sup>CAG-LSL-Ikzf2/+</sup></italic> line. Atoh1-CreER+ or <italic>Rosa26<sup>CAG-LSL-Ikzf2/+</sup></italic> mice were used as controls, and Atoh1-CreER+; <italic>Rosa26<sup>CAG-LSL-Ikzf2/+</sup></italic> mice were experimental group mice.

In the Atoh1-CreER+ control group (n = 3), neither Prestin nor Tdtomato was expressed in IHCs at P42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–B’’’</xref>). In contrast, in the experimental P42 mice (n = 3) Prestin was ectopically expressed in IHCs that were vGlut3+/Tdtomato+ (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–C’’’</xref>) and, as expected, not in IHCs that were vGlut3+/Tdtomato− (asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–C’’’</xref>). All Tdtomato+ IHCs were Prestin+ and all Prestin+ IHCs were Tdtomato+. Quantification revealed that 30.8% ± 4.2%, 38.4% ± 1.6%, and 70.7% ± 6.0% of IHCs were Prestin+ in basal, middle, and apical turns, respectively, at P42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>); the apical turn thus harboring more Prestin+ IHCs than the basal and middle turns. This is in accord with the higher reported Cre efficiency of Atoh1-CreER+ in the apex of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox et al., 2012</xref>). We also confirmed that all Tdtomato+ (Prestin+) IHCs expressed HA (Ikzf2) and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), which validated the co-expression of Ikzf2 and Tdtomato. As a point of potential interest, these results bring further support toward the ability of Ikzf2 to induce Prestin expression in IHCs. We noted that despite Tdtomato+ OHCs likely expressing both endogenous and ectopic Ikzf2, they appeared normal suggesting that these cells are able to tolerate additional Ikzf2 expression, at least until P42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–C’’’ and F</xref>).</p><p>Besides Prestin, overexpressing Ikzf2 IHCs also upregulated a second OHC-specific marker, Oncomodulin (Ocm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simmons et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tong et al., 2016</xref>).

Both the HC layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–C’’’</xref>) and the SC layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–D’’’</xref>) were imaged. As expected, numerous Tdtomato+ cells were observed in cochleae. As before, all Tdtomato+ cells expressed HA and vice versa (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D’’’</xref>). However, none of these Tdtomato+/HA+ cells expressed Prestin (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D’’’</xref>). Furthermore, we could not detect any Tdtomato+/Myo6 (HC marker)+ cells. We also noted the loss of endogenous OHCs (Prestin+/Tdtomato−) throughout the cochlear duct, particularly at the basal turn, which was likely a secondary effect of ectopic Ikzf2 expression in adult cochlear SCs. Collectively, these results suggested that Ikzf2 alone was insufficient for converting adult cochlear SCs into nascent Myo6+ HCs or Prestin+ OHCs. Thus, in terms of cell-fate conversion, more barriers from adult cochlear SCs into OHCs needed to be overcome than from IHCs to OHCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Concurrent induction of Ikzf2 and Atoh1 converts, at low efficiency, adult PCs, and DCs into Prestin+ OHC-like cells</title><p>Considering the synergistic effects reported among TFs, such as between Six1, Atoh1, Pou4f3, and Gata3 and between Myc and Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Menendez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walters et al., 2017</xref>), we hypothesized that concurrent induction of Ikzf2 and Atoh1 might convert adult cochlear SCs into OHCs.

The fact that most Tdtomato+ cells were HA+ further confirmed the high Cre activity in the Fgfr3-iCreER model. The small fraction of HA+/Tdtomato− cells represented populations in which ectopic Atoh1, but not Ikzf2 was expressed (HA is tagged to both Atoh1 and Ikzf2 constructs) due to independent Cre-recombination events in the two loci.

These cells were defined as new OHC-like cells as they were derived from the original Tdtomato+ cochlear SCs (PCs and DCs) but were not identical to wild-type adult OHCs (see below). These OHC-like cells were distributed in both HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–E’’’</xref>) and SC layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–F’’’</xref>). However, the number of new OHC-like cells was low, averaging to 4.7 ± 4.2, 0.7 ± 0.3, and 14.3 ± 6.4 in the basal, middle, and apical turns, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Moreover, Prestin protein expression was substantially lower in these OHC-like cells (blue arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F’’’</xref>) compared to wild-type endogenous OHCs, the latter which expressed Prestin but not Tdtomato (yellow arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–F’’’</xref>).

This prompted us to test whether damaging endogenous wild-type adult OHCs would engender a more favorable environment for SC transdifferentiation, thereby potentially increasing the conversion efficiency of adult cochlear SCs overexpressing Ikzf2 and Atoh1 into OHC-like cells. For this, we compared four genetic mouse strains: (1) <italic>Slc26a5<sup>DTR/+</sup></italic>; (2) Fgfr3-iCreER+; CAG-LSL-<italic>Atoh1</italic>+; <italic>Slc26a5<sup>DTR/+</sup></italic> (Fgfr3-Atoh1-DTR); (3) Fgfr3-iCreER+; <italic>Rosa26<sup>CAG-LSL-Ikzf2/+</sup>; Slc26a5<sup>DTR/+</sup></italic> (Fgfr3-Ikzf2-DTR); and (4) Fgfr3-iCreER+; CAG-LSL-<italic>Atoh1</italic>+; <italic>Rosa26<sup>CAG-LSL-Ikzf2/+</sup>; Slc26a5<sup>DTR/+</sup></italic> (Fgfr3-Atoh1-Ikzf2-DTR). All mice were first injected tamoxifen at P30 and P31, to trigger expression of Atoh1 or Ikzf2 or both or non. Six days later, at P36, DT was administered to trigger OHC damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). By injecting Tamoxifen, prior to DT, we could selectively and permanently label adult SCs (mainly PCs and DCs) with HA and Tdtomato before any OHC damage. The reverse order was not used so as to avoid the possibility of OHC damage leading to changes in the Cre-expression pattern in Fgfr3-iCreER+ mice.</p><p>Akin to before, P60 <italic>Slc26a5<sup>DTR/+</sup></italic> mice treated with DT had few visible OHCs (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) as compared to the untreated, same aged, <italic>Slc26a5<sup>DTR/+</sup></italic> control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, unlike the findings at P42, at P60 little OHC debris was observed.

Confocal scanning of the entire cochlear duct (n = 3) revealed the presence of 359.3 ± 46.2, 878.0 ± 118.7, and 1195 ± 81.6 Tdtomato+/HA+ cells of which 86.3 ± 6.3, 241.0 ± 21.1, and 190.3 ± 31.1 cells were new Prestin+ OHC-like cells (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–G’’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B'''</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) in the basal, middle, and apical turns, respectively. Or in other words, 25.0% ± 4.1%, 29.0% ± 5.7%, and 16.2% ± 3.4% of adult cochlear tdTomato+ SCs trans-differentiated into OHC-like cells in the basal, middle, and apical turns, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

Nascent HCs were defined as Tdtomato+/Myo6+/Prestin− (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B–B'''</xref>). OHC-like cells were defined as Tdtomato+/Myo6+/Prestin+. P42 was the earliest age at which the nascent HCs were detected; Myo6 expression was weak at this stage. Scanning the entire cochlear duct at P42 revealed the presence of only 29.0 ± 13.5, 66.0 ± 35.23, and 52.7 ± 25.4 nascent HCs throughout the basal, middle, and apical turns (n = 3), respectively (black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). No Tdtomato+/Myo6+/Prestin+ OHC-like cells were detected at P42.</p><p>Four days later, at P46 (n = 4), there were 56.5 ± 28.8, 118.0 ± 61.2, and 111.0 ± 57.3 new HCs that were Tdtomato+/Myo6+ (gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D,F</xref>), and, of these, 27.8 ± 15.0, 43.5 ± 25.3, and 36.8 ± 21.0 were Tdtomato+/Myo6+/Prestin+ (classified as OHC-like cells; green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>); thus, OHC-like cells accounted for 49.2% (27.8/56.5), 36.9% (43.5/118), and 33.2% (36.8/111) of total new HCs in basal, middle, and apical turns, respectively. As mentioned, the remaining Tdtomato+/Myo6+/Prestin− cells were defined as nascent HCs, and the Tdtomato+/Myo6-/Prestin− cells were defined as ‘SCs failing to become HCs’. Notably, we sorted new HCs into nascent HCs and OHC-like cells based solely on absence or presence of Prestin. Among the four mice analyzed, two mice harbored substantially fewer Tdtomato+/Myo6+ cells than the others, which caused the large variations in numbers; nevertheless, the overall trend was that the larger the number of Tdtomato+/Myo6+ cells, the larger the number of Tdtomato+/Myo6+/Prestin+ OHC-like cells. Importantly, no Tdtomato+/Prestin+ cells lacking Myo6 expression were detected. Together, these findings suggested that the generation of new OHC-like cells generally involved an initial cell-fate transition from SCs (PCs and DCs) into nascent HCs, which occurred by P42 (12 days after Atoh1 and Ikzf2 gene induction, and 6 days after DT treatment), and that this was followed by a second transition from nascent HCs into OHC-like cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>New OHC-like cells are able to produce hair bundles</title><p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to ascertain the presence and morphology of hair bundles (a cluster of stereocilia) of the Prestin+ new OHC-like cells at P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

The proportion of OHC-like cells was 26.2% (11/42), which agreed with the immunostaining results (16.2%–29.0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), giving us confidence in the suitability of this criterion. Moreover, expression of <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Ikzf2</italic> (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>) was enriched in all 42 cells, but not in adult endogenous SCs.

Furthermore, we also included data from nascent HCs and SCs failing to become HCs for completeness and as potential intermediate cell types. In general, the identified genes above were either not or only slightly upregulated or downregulated in SCs failing to become HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Together, this suggested that OHC-like cells were on an OHC-lineage differentiation track.</p><p>To our surprise, trajectory analysis including the 42 Tdtomato+ cells suggested that OHC-like cells and nascent HCs were closer to each other, relative to SCs failing to become HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Furthermore, another trajectory analysis confirmed that OHC-like cells and nascent HCs were closer to WT_P30 OHCs, and conversely SCs failing to become HCs were closer to WT_P60 SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). The transcriptomic similarity between OHC-like cells and nascent HCs supported that, despite Prestin expression only being present in OHC-like cells, the general expression patterns of other HC genes might be quite similar. This possibility was partially supported by the finding that not all Prestin+ OHC-like cells expressed the early pan-HC markers, Rbm24, Pvalb, and Calb1, according to both RNA-Seq and immunostaining results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>).

More specifically, we extracted from these data OHCs at three different ages: E16 (n = 87), P1 (n = 170), and P7 (n = 39) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>).

These E16, P1, and P7 OHCs were pooled with our own OHC-like cells, nascent HCs, SCs failing to become HCs, WT_P30 OHCs, and WT_P60 SCs to form a new dataset. Five main clusters were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>): cluster 1 included 9/11 OHC-like cells, 11/16 nascent HCs, and the majority of wild-type OHCs at P1 (WT_P1 OHCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Cluster 2 consisted of 2/11 OHC-like cells, 5/16 nascent HCs, 12/15 SCs failing to become HCs, and wild-type OHCs at E16 (WT_E16 OHCs). Majority of wild-type OHCs at P7 (WT_P7 OHCs) and WT_P30 OHCs formed cluster 3, suggesting that P7 OHCs were already well differentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeng et al., 2020</xref>). Cluster 4 contained the remaining fraction of WT_P1 OHCs and 3/15 SCs failing to become HCs, while majority of cells in cluster 5 were WT_P60 SCs. UMAP analysis suggested that OHC-like cells generally resembled WT_P1 OHCs the most. Further support for this came from the presence of <italic>Insm1</italic> mRNA and protein in OHC-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A–B'''</xref>); <italic>Insm1</italic> is a gene that is only transiently expressed in differentiating OHCs during late embryonic and perinatal ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lorenzen et al., 2015</xref>). We speculated that WT_P1 OHCs in cluster 1 originated from basal and middle turns as they more closely resembled WT_P7 and _P30 OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), whereas WT_P1 OHCs in cluster 4 that were grouped with the more immature E16 OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>) originated from apical turns.</p><p>Finally, trajectory analysis was applied to all the pooled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,I</xref>).

Notably, in agreement with trajectory analysis described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, OHC-like cells and nascent HCs were similar and intermingled with each other in both UMAP and trajectory analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Neonatal-specific OHC genes are highly expressed in OHC-like cells</title><p>We next took a more focused look at the transcriptomic differences and similarities between OHC-like cells and WT_P1 OHCs.

These have been shown to be significantly enriched in WT_P0/P1 OHCs, but not in adult OHCs. The expression levels of these 53 genes in all 11 OHC-like cells was extracted from our raw data and expressed as transcripts per million (TPM).

Our selection criteria for genes that were highly expressed in OHC-like cells thus were as follows: (1) that the gene’s average TPM across all OHC-like cells was above 16; (2) that more than half of all OHC-like cells expressed this gene with TPM &gt;16.

While <italic>Atoh1</italic> is sufficient to convert neonatal PCs and DCs into HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>), it is insufficient to do so in adults. Ikzf2 alone also cannot convert adult SCs into HCs but the combination both <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Ikzf2</italic> is synergistic and can do so in adults. Whether these effects are similar to the synergistic effects between Atoh1 and Pou4f3, which were recently reported during normal cochlear HC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu et al., 2021</xref>), will require further investigation.</p><p>Ikzf2 is necessary for OHC maturation, and an Ikzf2 point-mutation model, Ikzf2 <sup>cello/cello</sup>, displays early-onset hearing loss and diminished Prestin expression; dual to this, ectopic Ikzf2 induces Prestin expression in IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chessum et al., 2018</xref>). Whether Prestin is a direct target of Ikzf2 is unclear, but the onset of Ikzf2 expression at neonatal ages and its specific and permanent expression in OHCs suggest that Ikzf2 is a key TF required to specify and maintain the OHC fate and/or repress the IHC fate. Therefore, we speculate that Ikzf2 was responsible for directing nascent HCs into the OHC differentiation track. In accord with this, Ikzf2 alone was able to induce Prestin expression in wild-type IHCs but not adult SCs, likely due to that IHCs are already in the general ‘HC differentiation track’ and thus more are poised to express OHC genes. In contrast to the ability of Atoh1, which takes approximately three weeks to convert SC to HC fate in the neonatal cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>), the combined effects of Atoh1 and Ikzf2 in mediating this cell-fate switch in the adult cochlea occurred within a shorter time window (approximately 12 days). This could be a result of the synergistic actions between Atoh1 and Ikzf2.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Active OHC death promotes transformation from adult SCs into OHC-like cells</title><p>In our study, DT treatment led to selective OHC death, which was defined as active OHC death. In opposition to this, OHC death occurred as a side effect of overexpressing Ikzf2 alone or Ikzf2 and Atoh1 concurrently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which we refer to as passive OHC death. While the detailed mechanisms are unclear, passive OHC death has been observed in multiple instances upon: (1) overexpressing Atoh1 in neonatal or juvenile cochlear SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>), (2) triggered neonatal SC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>), and (3) conditional SC damage at postnatal ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mellado Lagarde et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mellado Lagarde et al., 2014</xref>). Our data showed that only OHC death that was ‘active’ could significantly increase numbers of OHC-like cells upon Atoh1 and Ikzf2 overexpression in adult SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).</p><p>How to interpret the differential effects of active and passive OHC death? It is known that DT, but not neomycin, induced HC death can trigger Wnt-dependent HC regeneration from SCs in neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). This exemplifies that the precise way that HC dies can drastically affect how cochlear SCs respond to HC death. DT treatment causes cell membrane rupture leading to the release of cellular components in the extracellular space. We speculated that SCs overexpressing Atoh1 and Ikzf2 responded favorably to yet unidentified factors released from OHCs during active cell death. Such factors may not be made accessible to SCs upon passive OHC death.</p><p>We also conjectured that the timing of OHC active death in relation to the SC cellular status was likely the key. When active OHC death occurred by DT injection, Atoh1 and Ikzf2 had already been overexpressed in adult SCs for 6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This particular temporal coupling may have permitted those adult SCs to respond more favorably to the unidentified factors released from nearby dying OHCs, to ultimately become OHC-like cells. When no active death was induced, and instead OHCs died passively due to secondary effect of ectopic Atoh1 and Ikzf2 expression, it may have been the timing between SC gene induction and OHC death that was unfavorable. Future studies will be needed to determine the main contributing factors dictating conversion efficiency or whether these hypothesis have any ground at all.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Degree of cell fate conversion of the OHC-like cells</title><p>By comparing the transcriptomic profiles between adult endogenous OHCs and SCs, we identified 1051 OHC and 1982 SC genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We then used the degree of OHC gene upregulation and SC gene downregulation to estimate the extent of cell fate conversion from adult SCs to OHC-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Promisingly, relative to adult SCs (primarily PCs and DCs), 69.4% (729/1051) of OHC genes were significantly up-regulated in OHC-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). A more limited number of SC genes, 16.7% (331/1982), were significantly down-regulated in OHC-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). It appears that our reprogramming manipulations were more efficient at endowing OHC-like status to SCs, than ‘erasing/making them forget’ their SC status.</p><p>To compare the transcriptomic profiles between OHC-like cells and adult endogenous OHCs, we selected endogenous OHCs at P30, but not P60, because OHC-like cells were derived from SCs at P30 and thus their intrinsic age might be ~P30, although the mice were analyzed at P60. Nevertheless, cochlear development is complete by P30, and wild-type OHCs at P30 and P60 are expected to differ minimally. Consistently, it is reported that transcriptomic profiles of adult cochlear SCs at P60 and P120 are indistinguishable from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoa et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, compared to adult endogenous OHCs, 17% (179/1051) of OHC genes were expressed at lower levels in OHC-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). A substantial proportion of SC genes 67.6% (1339/1982) remained expressed at much higher level in OHC-like cells than that in adult endogenous OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition, 19 OHC genes, including <italic>Slc26a5, Lmo7,</italic> and <italic>Kcna10</italic>, were not sufficiently up-regulated in OHC-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Notably, Ocm was not included in the 19 OHC genes, suggesting that Ocm was better upregulated than <italic>Slc26a5</italic> in the OHC-like cells. Likewise, 54 SC genes, including <italic>Sox10, Dbi,</italic> and <italic>Zfp36,</italic> were not sufficiently downregulated in OHC-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>In logic accord to only finding moderate transcriptomic similarities between OHC-like cells and adult endogenous OHCs, we identified stronger similarities with neonatal OHCs via different approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Firstly, our integrated UMAP analysis embedded OHC-like cells closest to WT_P1 OHCs. Secondly, we found that OHC-like cells had upregulated 26 of the 53 known characteristic neonatal OHC genes. For instance, <italic>Insm1</italic> was upregulated but not <italic>Bcl11b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6A</xref>). This was consistent with that <italic>Insm1</italic> is turned on earlier than <italic>Bcl11b</italic> during OHC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wiwatpanit et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We also investigated how similar OHC-like cells were to neonatal IHCs or utricle HCs. To do this, we first identified genes specifically enriched in neonatal IHCs or utricle HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6B</xref>) and extracted their expression level in OHC-like cells. We found that neonatal IHC and utricle HC-specific genes were minimally expressed, if at all, in OHC-like cells. In addition, we noted that <italic>Cfap161</italic>, one of the four neonatal utricle HC genes expressed in OHC-like cells, is recently reported to be expressed in many cells with cilia structure including cochlear HCs via immunostaining assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckers et al., 2021</xref>). Such discrepancies may be due to difference in the sensitivity of different techniques used. In addition, the current HC subtype specific genes were selected from three studies, but it is always challengeable and has limitations to compare data from different studies, especially the data are generated by different sequencing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kolla et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, more detailed gene profiling studies of different inner ear HCs at various developmental ages are needed to more precisely define some markers of individual HC subtypes.</p><p>Despite many OHC genes were significantly upregulated, numerous SC genes were retained in the OHC-like cells. Then, how best to define the cellular status of OHC-like cells? Alternatively, are they more akin to OHCs or new hybrid OHCs/SCs taking a novel differentiation path? In our mind, there is no consensus yet to these questions, but great scope for exploration and discovery. We postulate that transcriptomic assays alone will likely be insufficient to define what constitutes a cell type for our purposes. Macro properties such as anatomical features, especially hair bundle structure in apical surface of HCs, as well as electrophysiological properties, will need to be measured. With that said, the most indisputable proof of an OHC cell state should be hearing recovery after OHC damage. In summary, our data supported that OHC-like cells resemble neonatal OHCs and not neonatal IHCs or utricle HCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Potential future approaches to promote more complete differentiation of OHC-like cells</title><p>How to further promote differentiation of these OHC-like cells? This is the key question as the ultimate goal is to convert adult cochlear SCs into functional OHCs. To begin with, <italic>Atoh1</italic> is only transiently expressed in cochlear OHCs during normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Driver et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matei et al., 2005</xref>). However, our model induced permanent Atoh1 expression, potentially hindering maturation of OHC-like cells. Therefore, transient Atoh1 expression combined with permanent Ikzf2 expression may be the focus of future work.</p><p>In conjunction, we speculated that combining other candidate genes, together with <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Ikzf2</italic>, would likely drive OHC-like cells to further mature. Promising candidate genes could include ones necessary for hair bundle organization and growth, as our results highlighted the reduced number and deformity of the stereocilia in OHC-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For instance, the neonatal OHC gene <italic>Bcl11b</italic> was missing in OHC-like cells (gray arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6A</xref>) and heterozygous <italic>Bcl11b<sup>±</sup></italic> mice exhibit impaired formation of hair bundles in OHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Okumura et al., 2011</xref>). Simultaneous expression <italic>Atoh1, Ikzf2,</italic> and <italic>Bcl11b</italic> might therefore have higher reprogramming efficiency than Atoh1 and Ikzf2. Encouragingly, OHC-like cells did express multiple MET-channel-related proteins such as <italic>Cib2</italic> and <italic>Tmc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). This aligned with the previous report that MET-channel assembly does not require normal hair bundle morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As hair bundles mostly develop after birth, we also hypothesized that genes crucial for hair bundle organization are likely to be differentially expressed between P1 and P14/P30 OHCs. In terms of phenotypic assessment of functional hair bundles, rapid loss-of-function test will be performed following the protocols described in our previous pilot studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). The phenotypes we hope to focus on will include shorter or disorganized OHC hair bundles, and ones with reduced numbers of OHC hair bundles at P14 or P30. Finally, we took note of the many SC genes expressed in OHC-like cells, including <italic>Fgfr3, Id1,</italic> and <italic>Id2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Fgf signaling is known to be involved in SC fate maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doetzlhofer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacques et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shim et al., 2005</xref>). Id gene family is known to repress HC formation by negatively regulating <italic>Atoh1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2006</xref>). Decreasing Fgfr3 and Id1/2 may promote further maturation of OHC-like cells.</p><p>In summary, our current study provided a genetic model for OHC damage and subsequent regeneration in adult mouse cochlea. Building on this model and adding further genetic manipulations represent a promising avenue to regenerate functional OHCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

To assess the extent of OHC death in the <italic>Slc26a5<sup>DTR/+</sup></italic> model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the ratio of the OHC to IHC numbers was used as a proxy as IHC were not affected by DT treatment. To this end, OHC and IHC numbers within a scanning region (60×, confocal microscopy) were computed. This was repeated for two areas in each cochlear turn and mean number was calculated.

All cell counting data were presented as means ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA, followed by a Student’s t-test with Bonferroni correction. All statical analyses were implemented using GraphPad Prism 6.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis</title><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed in three different mouse lines; each time the cells of interest were identifiable by Tdtomato expression. Cells originated: (1) from P30 <italic>Slc26a5<sup>CreER/+</sup></italic>; Ai9/+ mice that were injected with tamoxifen at P20 and P21; in this case, Tdtomato+ cells were exclusively OHCs due to selective Cre expression in OHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fang et al., 2012</xref>). (2) from P60 Fgfr3-iCreER+; Ai9/+ mice that were administered tamoxifen at P30 and P31; in this instance, Tdtomato+ cells within the cochlear sensory epithelium were SCs (primarily PCs and DCs) according to our previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>). (3) from P60 Fgfr3-Atoh1-Ikzf2-DTR mice that were administered tamoxifen at P30 and P31 and then DT at P36. In this case, Tdtomato+ cells within the cochlear sensory epithelium included OHC-like cells, nascent HCs, and SCs failing to become HCs.</p><p>The cochlear sensory epithelium from each mouse was dissected out, digested, and single-cell suspensions were prepared according to our previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2020b</xref>). All the aforementioned Tdtomato+ cells were picked under a fluorescence microscope (M205FA, Leica) as illustraed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. We picked 17 wild-type adult OHCs at P30, 16 wild-type adult SCs at P60, and 42 Tdtomato+ cells from the Fgfr3-Atoh1-Ikzf2-DTR model at P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Once the cells were picked, they were immediately subjected to reverse-transcription and cDNA amplification using a Smart-Seq HT kit (Cat# 634437, Takara). The cDNAs (1 ng each) were tagmented using a TruePrep DNA Library Prep Kit V2 for Illumina (Cat# TD503-02, Vazyme) and a TruePrep Index Kit V2 for Illumina (Cat# TD202, Vazyme). The final libraries were subject to paired-end sequencing on the Illumina Novaseq platform. Each library was sequenced leading to 4 G of raw data.</p><p>FastQC (v0.11.9) and trimmomatic (v0.39) were used for quality control of raw sequencing data. High-quality mapping to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38) was achieved for 70–80% of the reads using the Hisat2 (v2.1.0) program with default parameters. Raw counts were calculated using HTSeq (v0.10.0), and gene-expression levels were estimated by using StringTie (v1.3.5) with default parameters. Gene abundances were presented as transcript per million (TPM) values. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using R package ‘DESeq2’ (p&lt;0.001, absolute value of (log2 fold change) &gt; 2). Based on the identified DEGs, biological process enrichment was evaluated (p&lt;0.001, adjusted using FDR correction) by using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery). Extensive quality checks of the data were carried out throughout the analyses.

To adequately compare the transcriptomic profiles obtained from 10× genomics and smartseq methods, we first integrated them by using the Seurat functions ‘SCTransform’, ‘FindIntegrationAnchors’ (k.filter = 30), and ‘IntegrateData’. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed by executing the ‘RunPCA’ function, and the top 20 principal components (PCs) were used for further dimensionality reduction using UMAP (via ‘RunUMAP’). Unsupervised clustering was performed using the ‘FindNeighbors’ and ‘FindClusters’ function (resolution = 0.5 for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>, 0.8 for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, or 1.5 for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, E16_WT OHCs were defined as cells in which the expression level of <italic>Insm1, Myo6,</italic> and <italic>Atoh1</italic> were all above zero; P1_WT OHCs were identified as those with above zero expression of <italic>Bcl11b, Myo6, Myo7a,</italic> and <italic>Atoh1</italic>. Finally, cells expressing above zero level of <italic>Slc26a5</italic> (Prestin)<italic>, Myo6, Ocm,</italic> and <italic>Ikzf2</italic> were classified as P7_WT OHCs. Trajectory analysis was performed using Monocle (R package v2.0). Pre-processed Seurat datasets were imported into Monocle. The top 2000 most variable genes identified from the Seurat object were used as data input to Monocle. Cells were ordered along a pseudotime axis by using the ‘orderCells’ function in Monocle. The pseudotime scale in monocle is an arbitrary unit, and it is simulated according to the developmental order (or age/differentiation status) of each cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>ABR measurement</title><p>ABR were measured in response to the following sound frequencies: 4 k, 5.6 k, 8 k, 11.3 k, 16 k, 22.6 k, and 32 k Hz, following our previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2018b</xref>).

On the following day, the cochlear samples were washed thrice with 1× PBS and subsequently decalcified using 10% EDTA (Cat# ST066, Beyotime) for 1 day, then refixed for 1 h with 1% osmium tetroxide (Cat#18451, Ted Pella), and subject to a second fixation with thiocarbohydrazide (Cat#88535, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min and further fixed fixation for 1 hr with osmium tetroxide. Next, the cochlear samples were dehydrated using a graded ethanol series (30%, 50%, 75%, 80%, 95%; Cat#10009259, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd.) at 4°C with each incubation step lasting 30 min. The series was completed by fully dehydrating the samples in 100% ethanol (three times, 30 min for each) at 4°C. The cochlear samples were then dried in a critical point dryer (Model: EM CPD300, Leica), after which whole-mount cochlear samples were prepared under a microscope to ensure that hair bundles were facing upward. Finally, samples were treated with a turbomolecular pumped coater (Model: Q150T ES, Quorum). The prepared samples were then scanned using a field-emission SEM instrument (Model: GeminiSEM 300, ZEISS).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>We filed an auditory hair cell regeneration patent based on the key findings of this manuscript.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All mice were bred and raised in SPF level animal rooms and animal procedures were performed according to guidelines (NA-032-2019) of the IACUC of Institute of Neuroscience (ION), Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of all genes that were expressed at higher (<italic>P</italic> &lt;

Here, Sun et al. demonstrated that a combination of Atoh1 and a transcription factor important for specifying outer hair cell (OHC) fate, Ikzf2, can convert supporting cells in damaged adult cochleae to form hair cells that exhibit OHC characteristics. This experimental approach is a positive step towards the goal of alleviating hearing loss.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dual expression of Atoh1 and Ikzf2 promotes transformation of adult cochlear supporting cells into outer hair cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This non-autonomous effect is not explored or discussed. It makes one wonder why co-expression of Atoh1 with Ikzf2 in this experimental series was inefficient in inducing OHC-like production, since that worked when OHCs were deliberately killed.

The authors should perform unsupervised graph-based clustering of the data shown in Figure 6D to see if the cells that are outlined cluster with the OHCs. The analysis may have been performed but needs to be shown in the main figures.</p><p>2. Although the three cell types may not segregate cleanly, they do seem to spread out in interesting ways in Figure 6D, with more nascent HCs and &quot;failed &quot; SCs closer to the SC cluster and more OHC-like cells closer to the OHC cluster. This is encouraging and supports their main point. More interestingly, this spread is suggestive of a developmental trajectory, with intermediate cell states. With this in mind, they should perform a trajectory analysis, using a tool such as Monocle or Cell Trails, agnostic to their own assessment of cell type. It is also important to show that this spread is not due to technical heterogeneity, such as the number of genes detected, sequencing depth, or the proportion of mitochondrial genes. The authors should overlay this information on the UMAP plot in Figure 6D to demonstrate whether the spread is caused by technical artifacts.</p><p>3. The comparison to published data is informative and seems to have been performed appropriately using new tools in Seurat. It is strange, though, that the &quot;semi-converted&quot; cells overlap with only one of the P1 OHC clusters. The authors should add some more information about what distinguishes those clusters and how they interpret the fact that their cells overlap with one and not the other. These data would also be shown more appropriately as trajectories, again as determined using tools such as Monocle, Cell Trails, or Waterfall. Along these lines, the authors should include all of the data from the Kelley lab, not just the subsets they selected in Figure 6 supplemental Figure 4. The whole point is to place the converting cells within the context of normally developing hair cells, so it is best to include cells at multiple stages in this comparison.</p><p>4. The small samples sizes limit what one can conclude about differential gene expression. The problem is that there can be a very high false discovery rate when there are so few cells in each population. It would be better to lower the cut-off to an FDR-adjusted p-value of 0.001 or even lower. This would provide a more accurate view of the nature of differential gene expression for all of the comparisons. It is likely that the numbers of differentially expressed genes (thousands when comparing SCs and HCs and hundreds when comparing semi-converted cells to WT cells) will decrease with a more rigorous cut-off and thus provide a more accurate view of gene expression differences.</p><p>5. Along the same lines, rather than repeating the analysis in Figure 6E with other cell types, the authors should simply document the expression of known IHC or vestibular HC enriched genes. Presumably, there isn't a big enough cohort of non-OHC genes (either the number of genes or the level of expression) to drive the converting cells out of the OHC cluster. However, this does not mean that highly relevant genes associated with other hair cell types are not expressed at all. A reasonable list of genes can be compiled from the literature and then shown in a heat map for the three cell types. This is particularly important given that Atoh1 acts across hair cell types and there is a substantial Prestin-negative population. It is important to know if there is some heterogeneity here, in terms of the nature of HC identity taken on.</p><p>6. The authors need to soften their discussion of the GO analysis. Many of the terms they mention in the text are not actually statistically significant (i.e. p&lt;0.05) in Figure 6 (Figure supp 1) and Figure 6 (supp 2). Only terms that are significantly enriched should be discussed.</p><p>7. I am surprised that only ABR results are reported, when DPOAEs offer a specific measure of OHC function. However, this would not significantly alter conclusions, would just be a nice confirmation.</p><p>8. Line 62: &quot;transition&quot; is not the right word to use here. Perhaps the authors mean &quot;transmission&quot;?</p><p>9. Line 1072: &quot;compliment&quot; should be &quot;complement&quot;.</p><p>10. Figure 6- supplement 4: Please explain what the dots labeled 1 and 2 indicate. I found this figure hard to understand. There is also a typo in &quot;apical&quot;. There should also be a clearer explanation of what the &quot;pseudotime&quot; scale is (arbitrary units??).</p><p>11. Line 537: &quot;or to repress the IHC fate&quot;: this doesn't need to be an either/or statement. Many transcription factors both induce one fate and repress another.</p><p>12.

Line 643: &quot;whole-amount&quot; should be &quot;whole-mount&quot;.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Dual expression of Atoh1 and Ikzf2 promotes transformation of adult cochlear supporting cells into outer hair cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kathryn Cheah (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>All three reviewers thought you have made a good-faith effort in incorporating all the suggestions. However, there are still some outstanding issues from all three reviewers, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript demonstrated the effectiveness of combined activation of Atoh1 and Ikzf2 in converting adult supporting cells to outer hair cell (OHC)-like cells in a mouse model, in which the OHCs have been selectively ablated with diphtheria toxin. The authors showed that while the number of regenerated hair cells was low and there was no functional recovery based on ABR, these OHC-like cells do express prestin and exhibit a genetic profile that resemble nascent hair cells. This paper will be of great interest to researchers interested in hearing restoration as well as regenerative biology.</p><p>Essential revisions:<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Figure 4 still needs improvement. I thought a z-axis view will help readers to see where the OHC-like cells are located, at the normal HC level as depicted by Figure 4B or they remained at the SC level or both. The added insets of Z axis did not clarify this point. If the OHC-like cells were located at different positions, then better illustrations and quantification are needed.</p><p>The diagram in 4B could also be modified to indicate the OHC-like cells came from td-labeled SCs, using hatched black and red colors, for example.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Overall, the authors have done a decent job of incorporating our suggested changes, but the changes do not persuade me that their conversion is as complete as they make it seem. I remain puzzled by the scRNA-seq results, which to me indicate a far from complete conversion that undermines the suggestion that they have even been able to make P1-ish OHCs from adult SCs. For instance, the new hierarchical clustering data in Figure 6 show that 5 cell types form 2 clusters, which tells me that there isn't enough power in the study to make fine distinctions, likely because of the nature of gene expression changes involved. The new trajectories underscore this point, in that the cells that receive Atoh1/Ikzf2 follow their own trajectory and just barely converge with the mature OHCs, not with the P1-ish OHCs. I was glad to see some plots of known IHC genes and one vestibular gene, but really they just show a handful of genes. It would have been much better to show a heat map of ~50 enriched markers for each. I would also be curious to see if the OHC-like cells are like P1 vestibular cells, with the OHC nature driven mostly by expression of Prestin. Also, the new data for oncomodulin expression and synaptic ribbon number are not germane to the argument, as they are shown only for overexpression of Ikzf2 alone in IHC; the heat maps in Figure 6- supplement 6 in fact show that oncomodulin is just barely induced in a handful of OHC-like cells. The discussion contradicts this data and states that the OHC-like cells do express oncomodulin (p. 28, line 19), so this needs to be clarified.</p><p>To be clear, I do not think that it is reasonable to expect complete conversion of mature SCs into functional OHCs upon sustained overexpression of Atoh1 and Ikzf2. In the regeneration field, one can learn just as much from incomplete conversions and in fact, that is an important goal since it tells us how far certain combinations can take us while uncovering new roadblocks that we should tackle in the future. The authors made a good attempt to discuss this at the end of the discussion. My request to the authors is to be more restrained in how they present these data. I am not yet convinced that the OHC-like cells are basically like P1 OHCs so much as hybrid HC/SCs that have been able to turn on a few developmentally regulated HC genes and enough prestin to make them cluster with OHCs. I feel that the extent of the conversion needs to be discussed more explicitly, maybe just with a quick summary paragraph outlining how many OHC genes come up, how many SC genes go down, what key genes are missing, plus the extent of similarity to P1 OHCs (how many genes are differentially expressed between P1 OHC and their OHC-like cells and what are those genes?). The authors make some interesting points, such as lack of expression of functionally relevant genes, but still don't provide any meta-analysis that could help others to think about what might be limiting the extent of conversion. I would like to see a more concrete discussion of what the results mean, aside from what we already knew (Atoh1 is good at turning on HC genes and Ikzf2 is pretty good at turning on Prestin).</p><p>Finally, all three reviewers thought the manuscript could use some in-depth editing from a trusted colleague who understands the science as well as a master of the English language.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Dual expression of Atoh1 and Ikzf2 promotes transformation of adult cochlear supporting cells into outer hair cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kathryn Cheah (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The RNA seq data are acceptable. However, some sentences need clarification.</p><p>Line 569, We concluded that OHC-like cells were, based on their characteristic gene profiles, unlike neonatal IHCs or utricle HCs, instead ~50% similar with neonatal OHCs.</p><p>This sentence is awkward, and it is not clear whether the approximately 50% meant 50% in similarity between OHC-like cells and neonatal OHCs based on the selected 53 OHC genes analyzed or 50% of the OHC-like cells were more like the neonatal OHCs. Either clarify or simplify. For example: Taken together all the gene profiling results, we concluded that OHC-like cells resemble neonatal OHCs and not neonatal IHCs or utricle HCs.</p><p>Similar clarification is needed for the sentence on line 726.</p><p>2) The positions of OHC-like cells within the epithelium still need further clarification. Despite the nice video and the added supplemental figure, it remains difficult to distinguish the location of all the OHC-like cells shown in Figure 4G. A simple fix would be to use the blue and gold color arrows in Figure 4G to point out which are the HCs located in the HC layer versus SC layer. The supplemental figure can then be used to illustrate the two different locations of HCs in more detail.</p><p>Line 340, In addition, ~82.6% of OHC-like cells (i.e. arrows in Figure 4G') migrated up (toward the HC layer), and the rest remaining in the bottom (SC layer).</p><p>Is it necessary to instil the phrase of &quot;migrated up&quot; considering the cellular organization of the epithelium appears to be somewhat disrupted? &quot;Migrated-up&quot; suggests some active process on the part of the OHC-like cells. Consider replacing the sentence with: &quot;In addition, ~82.6% of OHC-like cells were located in the top HC layer (blue arrows in Figure 4G', supple figure), whereas the rest remained in the bottom SC layer (gold arrows in Figure 4G&quot;, Supl figure ).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66547.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that the ability of Atoh1 and Ikzf2 to drive supporting cells towards outer hair cell fates are interesting and represent an important milestone in hearing restoration research.

Basically, panel G is same as Panel F, except that each of the 8 cell populations are assigned with different colors in the 5 main clusters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors should perform unsupervised graph-based clustering of the data shown in Figure 6D to see if the cells that are outlined cluster with the OHCs. The analysis may have been performed but needs to be shown in the main figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing it out. The unsupervised graph-based clustering is now included in the updated Figure 6D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although the three cell types may not segregate cleanly, they do seem to spread out in interesting ways in Figure 6D, with more nascent HCs and &quot;failed &quot; SCs closer to the SC cluster and more OHC-like cells closer to the OHC cluster. This is encouraging and supports their main point. More interestingly, this spread is suggestive of a developmental trajectory, with intermediate cell states. With this in mind, they should perform a trajectory analysis, using a tool such as Monocle or Cell Trails, agnostic to their own assessment of cell type. It is also important to show that this spread is not due to technical heterogeneity, such as the number of genes detected, sequencing depth, or the proportion of mitochondrial genes. The authors should overlay this information on the UMAP plot in Figure 6D to demonstrate whether the spread is caused by technical artifacts.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We have performed trajectory analysis via Monocle. Indeed, the OHC-like cells/nascent HCs are also closer to wild type OHC cluster along the developmental trajectory line. Please refer to the added Figure 6—figure supplement 3. Furthermore, we also include the raw reads genome mapping rate, gene detection numbers (TPM&gt;1 and TPM&gt;10) in the Supplementary file 8. Basically, we confirm the technical heterogeneity among our Smartseq library is minimal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The comparison to published data is informative and seems to have been performed appropriately using new tools in Seurat. It is strange, though, that the &quot;semi-converted&quot; cells overlap with only one of the P1 OHC clusters. The authors should add some more information about what distinguishes those clusters and how they interpret the fact that their cells overlap with one and not the other. These data would also be shown more appropriately as trajectories, again as determined using tools such as Monocle, Cell Trails, or Waterfall. Along these lines, the authors should include all of the data from the Kelley lab, not just the subsets they selected in Figure 6 supplemental Figure 4. The whole point is to place the converting cells within the context of normally developing hair cells, so it is best to include cells at multiple stages in this comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with and accept this good suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we pool all OHCs covered by the data from the Kelley lab, with our manually picked cells. Trajectory analysis is performed via Monocle. Consistent with previous analysis, OHC-like cells and nascent cells primarily overlap with only one of the P1 OHC clusters which should be more differentiated OHCs (middle and basal turns) because they are closer to P7 and P30_WT OHCs. Cluster 4 should be P1 OHCs at apical turns which are less differentiated and closer to E16_WT OHCs. Please refer to lines 20-21 on page 22, and lines 12-15 on page 23 and the updated Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The small samples sizes limit what one can conclude about differential gene expression. The problem is that there can be a very high false discovery rate when there are so few cells in each population. It would be better to lower the cut-off to an FDR-adjusted p-value of 0.001 or even lower. This would provide a more accurate view of the nature of differential gene expression for all of the comparisons. It is likely that the numbers of differentially expressed genes (thousands when comparing SCs and HCs and hundreds when comparing semi-converted cells to WT cells) will decrease with a more rigorous cut-off and thus provide a more accurate view of gene expression differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We have switched to use FDR-adjusted p-value of 0.001, as clearly described in method section (lines 5-7 on page 38). Accordingly, the numbers of different genes are decreased, GO analysis and the corresponding figures and excel files containing list of all differently expressed genes are updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Along the same lines, rather than repeating the analysis in Figure 6E with other cell types, the authors should simply document the expression of known IHC or vestibular HC enriched genes. Presumably, there isn't a big enough cohort of non-OHC genes (either the number of genes or the level of expression) to drive the converting cells out of the OHC cluster. However, this does not mean that highly relevant genes associated with other hair cell types are not expressed at all. A reasonable list of genes can be compiled from the literature and then shown in a heat map for the three cell types. This is particularly important given that Atoh1 acts across hair cell types and there is a substantial Prestin-negative population. It is important to know if there is some heterogeneity here, in terms of the nature of HC identity taken on.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We choose several reported OHC, IHC and vestibular HC specific genes and plot their TPM values in all the 11 OHC-like cells. In agreement with our UMAP analysis, OHC specific genes Insm1, Insm2, and St8sia3 are highly expressed in OHC-like cells, however, IHC specific genes Fgf8, Otof, Slc17a8, Slc7a14, Tbx2 and vestibular HC gene Zpld1 are minimally or not expressed in OHC-like cells. Again, it confirms that OHC-like cells do resemble neonatal endogenous OHCs. Please refer to lines 5-15 on page 21 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2C-E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors need to soften their discussion of the GO analysis. Many of the terms they mention in the text are not actually statistically significant (i.e. p&lt;0.05) in Figure 6 (Figure supp 1) and Figure 6 (supp 2). Only terms that are significantly enriched should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated our analysis standard in the revised manuscript and only discussed the GO analysis of genes that are statistically different (FDR-adjusted p-value of 0.001).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. I am surprised that only ABR results are reported, when DPOAEs offer a specific measure of OHC function. However, this would not significantly alter conclusions, would just be a nice confirmation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that DPOAE are more specific for OHC function measurement. We did not include it only because we are not confident yet of our current DPOAE assays in the lab. To validate our DPOAE assay, we will practice more by using mutant mice with OHC specific deficiency (e.g. Prestin -/- mice). Thanks for pointing it out, and we certainly will incorporate DPOAE measurement in our future OHC regeneration studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

I thought a z-axis view will help readers to see where the OHC-like cells are located, at the normal HC level as depicted by Figure 4B or they remained at the SC level or both.

The new OHC-like cells were currently labelled with hatched back and red colors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Overall, the authors have done a decent job of incorporating our suggested changes, but the changes do not persuade me that their conversion is as complete as they make it seem. I remain puzzled by the scRNA-seq results, which to me indicate a far from complete conversion that undermines the suggestion that they have even been able to make P1-ish OHCs from adult SCs. For instance, the new hierarchical clustering data in Figure 6 show that 5 cell types form 2 clusters, which tells me that there isn't enough power in the study to make fine distinctions, likely because of the nature of gene expression changes involved. The new trajectories underscore this point, in that the cells that receive Atoh1/Ikzf2 follow their own trajectory and just barely converge with the mature OHCs, not with the P1-ish OHCs. I was glad to see some plots of known IHC genes and one vestibular gene, but really, they just show a handful of genes. It would have been much better to show a heat map of ~50 enriched markers for each. I would also be curious to see if the OHC-like cells are like P1 vestibular cells, with the OHC nature driven mostly by expression of Prestin.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the encouraging comments. First, our previous analysis criteria/resolution might underestimate the power of the transcriptomic difference among our manual picked cells. Indeed, the 5 cell types in Figure 6E was able to be divided into 4 main clusters (updated Figure 6D), but the key conclusion was the same.</p><p>Second, we agreed with the comments about how to describe the OHC-like cells. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> revised manuscript, we clarified that we did not intend to conclude that OHC-like cells were fully equivalent to P1-OHCs, instead their similarity was ~50%.</p><p>Third, following the suggestions, we provided a heatmap where 49 neonatal cochlear IHC and 26 neonatal utricle HC specific genes were selected. The number of IHC specific genes was close to 50, but number of utricle HC specific genes was roughly half. Those genes were selected by overlapping cell type specific genes reported in three different studies (Burns, et al., <italic>Nat Commun</italic>, 2015, PMID: 26469390; Wiwatpanit, et al., <italic>Nature</italic>, 2018, PMID: 30305733; Kolla, et al., <italic>Nat Commun</italic>, 2020, PMID: 32404924). Their different sequencing methods or other bench factors would cause variations. In other words, if one gene is only cell type specific in one or two reports, it was not regarded as IHC or utricle HC specific genes. This standard led to reduced numbers of cell type specific genes, but in our mind would make the analysis more accurate. Please refer to result section “Neonatal specific OHC genes are highly expressed in OHC-like cells” starting from line 14 on page 24.</p><p>Notably, we remind the readers that we also feel it is challengeable and has limitations to compare data from different studies, especially the data are generated by different sequencing methods, as the similar comment is alerted (Kolla, et al., <italic>Nat Commun</italic>, 2020, PMID: 32404924). In other words, the field urgently needs a complete transcriptomic profile produced by smartseq or other full-length cDNA sequencing approaches that covers distinct inner ear HC subtypes at different developmental ages, because adult inner ear HCs are hard to perform via 10x single cell sequencing platform. Given this dataset is available, it is easier and more precise to define what the regenerated HCs are in future studies. Please see text on lines 18-22 on page 32 and line 1 on page 33.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the new data for oncomodulin expression and synaptic ribbon number are not germane to the argument, as they are shown only for overexpression of Ikzf2 alone in IHC; the heat maps in Figure 6- supplement 6 in fact show that oncomodulin is just barely induced in a handful of OHC-like cells. The discussion contradicts this data and states that the OHC-like cells do express oncomodulin (p. 28, line 19), so this needs to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify this issue, we double checked the oncomodulin (Ocm) expression level in the 11 OHC-like cells. It seemed low in previous heatmap primarily because the TPM value in the P30_WT OHC was high. In the current revised version, we included the log- transformed transcripts per million (TPM) value of <italic>Ocm</italic> in each OHC-like cell in the updated Figure 6—figure supplement 6B (heatmap) and the raw TPM value in Supplementary file 6.</p><p>Indeed, 7/11 new OHC-like cells expressed high level of Ocm. Consistently, Ocm was not included in the differently expressed genes between OHC-like cells and adult endogenous OHCs (updated Figure 6—figure supplement 7A). We modified Figure 6—figure supplement 7A (previously as Figure 6—figure supplement 6A) to better help readers to more clearly appreciate the differentially expressed SC-or OHC-genes between OHC-like cells and adult OHCs. Please also see text on lines 19-21 on page 31.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To be clear, I do not think that it is reasonable to expect complete conversion of mature SCs into functional OHCs upon sustained overexpression of Atoh1 and Ikzf2. In the regeneration field, one can learn just as much from incomplete conversions and in fact, that is an important goal since it tells us how far certain combinations can take us while uncovering new roadblocks that we should tackle in the future. The authors made a good attempt to discuss this at the end of the discussion. My request to the authors is to be more restrained in how they present these data. I am not yet convinced that the OHC-like cells are basically like P1 OHCs so much as hybrid HC/SCs that have been able to turn on a few developmentally regulated HC genes and enough prestin to make them cluster with OHCs. I feel that the extent of the conversion needs to be discussed more explicitly, maybe just with a quick summary paragraph outlining how many OHC genes come up, how many SC genes go down, what key genes are missing, plus the extent of similarity to P1 OHCs (how many genes are differentially expressed between P1 OHC and their OHC-like cells and what are those genes?).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks and we accepted those suggestions. Thus, we added a section to explicitly discuss the extent of cell fate conversion, similarity between OHC-like cells and P1-OHCs as well as how to define the converted OHC-like cells.

The key missing genes were also summarized in summarized in Supplementary files 6 and 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors make some interesting points, such as lack of expression of functionally relevant genes, but still don't provide any meta-analysis that could help others to think about what might be limiting the extent of conversion. I would like to see a more concrete discussion of what the results mean, aside from what we already knew (Atoh1 is good at turning on HC genes and Ikzf2 is pretty good at turning on Prestin).</p></disp-quote><p>Besides what we have included previously, we have further discussed the barriers that preventing OHC-like cells from undergoing further differentiation. Two main points were added after meta-analysis:</p><p>1) <italic>Bcl11b</italic> was missing in OHC-like cells and Bcl11b is involved in stereocilia development in OHCs. We have speculated that <italic>Bcl11b</italic> might be one candidate gene to be combined with Atoh1 and Ikzf2 in future. Please refer to text on lines 4-8 on page 34.</p><p>2) <italic>Fgfr3</italic> and <italic>Id1/2</italic> families were expressed much higher in OHC-like cells than in adult endogenous OHC cells.
