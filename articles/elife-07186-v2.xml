To investigate the mechanisms underlying RTK specificity in craniofacial development, we performed RNA-seq to delineate the transcriptional response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling in mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme cells. While the early gene expression profile induced by both growth factors is qualitatively similar, the late response is divergent. Comparing the effect of MEK (Mitogen/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and PI3K (phosphoinositide-3-kinase) inhibition, we find the FGF response is MEK dependent, while the PDGF response is PI3K dependent. Furthermore, FGF promotes proliferation but PDGF favors differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate overlapping domains of PDGF-PI3K signaling and osteoblast differentiation in the palate and increased osteogenesis in FGF mutants, indicating this differentiation circuit is conserved in vivo. Our results identify distinct responses to PDGF and FGF and provide insight into the mechanisms encoding RTK specificity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07186.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07186.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07186.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells produce many different proteins that play a variety of important roles. For example, proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases can detect particular molecules and send signals to other parts of the cell to regulate the activity (or “expression”) of genes involved in cell division, movement, and other processes.</p><p>Humans have 58 receptor tyrosine kinases, and defects in these proteins have been linked to diseases such as cancer and diabetes. However, many different receptors regulate the activities of shared sets of genes, so it is not clear how an individual receptor can specifically control the genes involved in a particular process.</p><p>Two receptor tyrosine kinases called PDGFR and FGFR are crucial for the development of the face, palate, and head in humans and other animals. Vasudevan et al. used a technique called RNA-sequencing to find out which genes are regulated by these receptors in mouse palate cells. The experiments show that there is a common set of genes whose activities change quickly—within 1 hour—in response to the activation of either PDGFR or FGFR. However, several hours later, cells in which PDGFR is activated have different patterns of gene expression compared to those with active FGFR.</p><p>Vasudevan et al. also found that FGFR promotes cell division, while PDGFR promotes the changing of palate cells into different types with more specialized roles. These different outcomes arise because PDGFR and FGFR use different signaling pathways that involve distinct proteins. For example, a protein called PI3K is critical for changes in gene expression in response to PDGFR but not FGFR.</p><p>These results suggest that PGDRF and FGFR control different cellular processes in the palate by sending distinct signals into the cell. Understanding the receptor tyrosine kinases and the networks of genes they activate will help us to identify the signals that are important for other processes, such as the development of the face.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07186.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07186.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>RTK</kwd><kwd>PDGF</kwd><kwd>FGF</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>craniofacial development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DE022363</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soriano</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DE022778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soriano</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRSA Individual Predoctoral Fellowship F31DE023456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vasudevan</surname><given-names>Harish N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99DE024617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Fenglei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PDGF and FGF signal via distinct intracellular pathways to confer different cellular outcomes during craniofacial development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) signal through a shared set of intracellular pathways, including extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), yet the in vivo functions directed by different RTKs can be quite distinct, raising the question of how specific cellular responses are elicited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). Several models have been put forth to explain how RTKs encode specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pawson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Volinsky and Kholodenko, 2013</xref>). In concept, distinct responses may be encoded by modulation of individual pathways downstream of receptor activation, with each pathway regulating a specific outcome. Alternatively, many cellular responses may require integration from multiple input pathways, and signal specificity could arise from this unique combination of pathways. Analysis of mice harboring point mutations to disrupt binding of specific effector proteins to RTKs suggests both these models may apply in vivo; platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) Receptor α (<italic>Pdgfra</italic>) mutants display effector-specific phenotypes in line with the former model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klinghoffer et al., 2002</xref>), but PDGF Receptor β (<italic>Pdgfrb</italic>) mediated outcomes require combined output across multiple pathways, consistent with the latter model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tallquist et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, quantitative differences in the duration and magnitude of signal induction provide an added layer of regulatory complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marshall, 1995</xref>). At the transcriptional level, one outcome of RTK activation is the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cochran et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lau and Nathans, 1987</xref>). Studies in cell culture have suggested IEGs constitute a generic readout of RTK activation with minimal specificity at the receptor or intracellular effector level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fambrough et al., 1999</xref>), but genetic experiments in mice indicate a degree of IEG specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmahl et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, a central goal remains to delineate RTK responsive transcriptional programs, identify the key signaling parameters encoding their regulation, and determine how these gene expression profiles dictate cellular decisions.</p><p>Many components of RTK signaling play important roles in mammalian craniofacial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentires-Alj et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Newbern et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fantauzzo and Soriano, 2015</xref>). In particular, PDGF and FGF signaling are both essential for midface development. In mice, loss of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soriano, 1997</xref>) or its ligands <italic>Pdgfa</italic> and <italic>Pdgfc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2004</xref>) results in facial clefting, and mice harboring a mutation abrogating PI3K binding to PDGFRα mirror these craniofacial phenotypes, implicating PI3K as the main effector of PDGFRα signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klinghoffer et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, both <italic>Pdgfra</italic> (<italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic>; <italic>Pdgfra</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tallquist and Soriano, 2003</xref>) and FGF receptor 1 (<italic>Wnt1-Cre; Fgfr1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trokovic et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2013</xref>) neural crest conditional mutants exhibit cleft face, indicating both pathways are required for normal development of the neural crest derived facial skeleton. At the intracellular pathway level, previous work has implicated ERK as a key effector downstream of FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanner and Rossant, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, mutations in both PDGF and FGF signaling have been linked to craniofacial syndromes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miraoui and Marie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rattanasopha et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, chimeric receptor experiments in mice have shown that the intracellular domain of <italic>Fgfr1</italic> cannot compensate for <italic>Pdgfra</italic> during development, suggesting these two receptors transmit biologically distinct signals in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamilton et al., 2003</xref>). The midface thus offers a unique opportunity to interrogate the mechanisms of signal specificity between these two RTKs in a developmentally relevant system.</p><p>Given the requirement for PDGF and FGF signaling in the development of the neural crest derived midface, we sought to compare the gene expression programs regulated by these two RTKs. The architecture of the transcriptional response to RTK activation consists of three stereotypic waves: an IEG response involving core transcriptional regulators (<italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Jun</italic>, <italic>Egr</italic>), a delayed response playing a feedback role (phosphatases, RNA-binding proteins), and a late sustained response determining cellular outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>). However, the degree of conservation between genes regulated in each wave across different RTK families is unclear. Furthermore, although classic feedback regulators of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways have been described, such as dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) for ERK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Owens and Keyse, 2007</xref>), the extent of effector-dependent transcription genome-wide is not well characterized.</p><p>In the present work, we compare the transcriptional response to PDGF and FGF signaling in E13.5 mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme (MEPM) cells. Although both PDGF and FGF are required in the neural crest for craniofacial development, we find distinct transcriptional programs, effector dependencies, and cellular outcomes in response to each RTK. While many genes in the early wave are shared across the two RTKs, FGF induces a quantitatively stronger response than PDGF. In addition, the feedback control provided by the delayed transcriptional wave displays distinct characteristics in response to PDGF and FGF. By exploring the effect of MEK/ERK and PI3K inhibition on these RTK-regulated gene expression profiles, we find PDGF-mediated transcription displays greater PI3K dependence, while FGF-mediated gene expression programs predominantly require ERK activity. This relationship is conserved at the level of cellular outcome, with FGF driving proliferation but PDGF promoting PI3K-dependent differentiation. Finally, we show overlapping domains of PI3K signaling, PDGF target gene expression, and skeletal differentiation during palatogenesis in vivo, a process perturbed in <italic>Fgfr1</italic> conditional mutants. Taken together, our studies suggest unique roles for PDGF and FGF during development of the facial skeleton, and more broadly, demonstrate that distinct transcriptional responses to RTK signaling are encoded through qualitative and quantitative differences in intracellular pathway activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PDGF and FGF have distinct patterns of effector activation and transcriptional responses in E13.5 MEPMs</title><p>Since neural crest conditional loss of either <italic>Fgfr1</italic> or <italic>Pdgfra</italic> leads to clefting, we chose to perform RNA-seq on E13.5 MEPMs treated with either PDGFA or FGF1 + heparin to identify the gene expression programs regulated by each signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Consistent with this observation, visualization of all replicates by principal component analysis (PCA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) revealed that the 1-hr PDGF and 1-hr FGF samples cluster together, but the 4-hr FGF replicates are distinctly separate from the 4-hr PDGF samples. Comparing the stimulated MEPMs to untreated cells, genes differentially regulated at 1 hr by either PDGF or FGF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary File 2</xref>) show high correlation (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.8173, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), but by 4 hr, the two RTK signals are divergent (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2881, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C'</xref>). In addition, the genes regulated by PDGF at 1 hr (n = 40) form a subset of those genes regulated by FGF at 1 hr (n = 159), further highlighting the similarity within the early response to both growth factors. Gene ontology analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2009</xref>) of the genes induced at 1 hr revealed an enrichment of transcription factors and MAP kinase phosphatases downstream of both RTKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, p &lt; 0.001), similar to previous descriptions of the response to RTK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>). To better visualize the organization of these targets, we constructed a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network from the genes regulated at 1 hr; in constructing this network, we only included direct interactions between proteins (path length = 1) and excluded predicted interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). The resulting network contains 25 upregulated genes (out of 113 total induced genes), including many classic components of the IEG response, such as activator protein-1 (AP-1) subunits (<italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Jun</italic>) and their regulators (<italic>Zfp36</italic>, <italic>Atf3</italic>) as well as <italic>Myc</italic>, <italic>Egr1-4</italic>, and <italic>Srf</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Closer inspection revealed that many shared target genes within this network are regulated to both a stronger magnitude and longer duration following FGF treatment compared to PDGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

In sum, the two RTKs induce a similar gene expression profile at 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), as evidenced by the high-correlation coefficient and overlap between genes differentially regulated by PDGF and FGF at 1 hr. However, FGF drives a quantitatively stronger early response with many transcription factors showing both a stronger magnitude and greater duration of induction in response to FGF compared to PDGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which may explain in part the divergent gene expression profiles observed at 4 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Differential roles for the delayed transcriptional response in regulation of signaling downstream of FGF and PDGF</title><p>Given the importance of MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling downstream of these RTKs during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klinghoffer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanner and Rossant, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fantauzzo and Soriano, 2014</xref>), we analyzed pERK and pAkt activation following FGF and PDGF stimulation in MEPMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with the stronger response to FGF treatment in the gene expression data, the FGF-induced pERK response displays both a higher magnitude and longer duration of activation compared to the PDGF-induced pERK signal. In contrast, both FGF and PDGF induce similar patterns of pAkt activation, but the magnitude of the PDGF-pAkt induction is slightly greater. The FGF-pERK signal is apparent up to 6 hr following growth factor treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and increasing the dose of PDGFA ligand did not alter the kinetics of pERK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To better understand differences in the response to PDGF and FGF, we performed gene ontology analysis for the molecular function of genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between 4-hr PDGF treatment and 4-hr FGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). The top results for genes enriched following FGF treatment are sets associated with modulation of signaling, such as protein kinases and GTPase regulators, which may function as activators of Ras to promote MEK/ERK signaling. Transcriptional feedback regulation of RTK signaling is well established, particularly the role of DUSPs providing negative feedback for MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Owens and Keyse, 2007</xref>). Indeed, many DUSPs (MAPK phosphatases) are induced in response to both PDGF and FGF treatment at 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), but FGF alone induces the expression of kinases and GTPase regulators at 4 hr, suggesting a distinct role for the FGF response in regulating MEK/ERK activity. We, thus, performed Western blots in the presence of cycloheximide following both PDGF and FGF treatment to determine the effect of inhibiting protein synthesis (and consequently, the delayed transcriptional response) on ERK activation. Consistent with previous work exploring the role of DUSP-mediated negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit et al., 2007</xref>), cycloheximide treatment increased the duration of the PDGF-pERK response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, we observed the opposite effect of cycloheximide treatment on the FGF-pERK response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C'</xref>), suggesting a positive feedforward loop in which FGF induces the expression of kinases and GEFs to modulate the ERK response in addition to activating ERK directly. To further explore the architecture of the late FGF response, we constructed a PPI network from genes increased at 4-hr FGF stimulation compared to 4-hr PDGF treatment. The FGF network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) contains <italic>Prkca</italic> as a highly connected node, which is interesting given reported roles for protein kinase C (PKC) in facilitating a sustained pERK response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhalla et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Santos et al., 2007</xref>) as well as its importance downstream of FGF in skeletal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miraoui and Marie, 2010</xref>). We found that inhibition of PKC decreased both the initial pulse and sustained activation of the FGF-mediated pERK response in MEPMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C'</xref>), consistent with its potential function as a hub within the FGF response network. In addition, many of the kinases and GEFs transcriptionally regulated by FGF have reported roles in positively modifying MEK/ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which may explain in part the residual pERK response to FGF in the presence of PKC inhibition. Collectively, these data support a model in which the balance between positive and negative transcriptional loops is critical for determining patterns of pERK response to different RTKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07186.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The delayed transcriptional response provides differential regulation of pERK duration in response to FGF and PDGF signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Signaling time course shows a more robust phospho-ERK (pERK) response to FGF (blue) than PDGF (red) and a similar pAkt response to both growth factors.

We next directly tested the effect of pathway inhibition on both the shared gene expression program induced by the two RTKs at 1 hr (113 genes total) and the genes regulated between FGF and PDGF treatment at 4 hr. Globally, FGF target genes show greater MEK/ERK dependence than PI3K dependence, while PDGF responsive genes exhibit the opposite relationship (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary File 3</xref>) mirroring the reported signaling requirements for each RTK. This trend is apparent at 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, A'</xref>) and striking for genes DE at 4 hr, where 52% of FGF responsive genes are MEK/ERK dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) but only 22% were PI3K dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B'</xref>).

When directly comparing the effect of MEK and PI3K inhibition at 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), the crosstalk between FGF targets is particularly striking, as a large number of genes repressed by MEK inhibition were regulated (both positively and negatively) by PI3K inhibition.

Many such examples of crosstalk between ERK and PI3K have been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mendoza et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we assayed the activation of these pathways following MEK inhibition with PD325901 and PI3K inhibition with LY294002. We found striking induction of pJNK upon pERK inhibition by PD325901 downstream of both FGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and PDGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) stimulation. Interestingly, a moderate change in pAkt induction following PDGF treatment and MEK inhibition seems apparent, although this induction was not observed at the dose used for the RNA-seq experiment (1 μM PD325901). Next, we investigated the effect of PI3K inhibition with LY294002. We found that FGF-mediated pERK induction increased with LY294002 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A'</xref>), but PDGF treatment did not produce this increase in pERK signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B'</xref>), consistent with changes observed at the level of target gene expression. At the inhibitor doses used in the RNA-seq experiment (1 μM PD325901, 10 μM LY294002), both PDGF and FGF significantly induce JNK activation in the presence of MEK inhibition, while only FGF activates ERK when PI3K is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, C'</xref>).

Crystal violet staining for cell viability confirms a greater effect of FGF than PDGF as well as the importance of MEK/ERK activity for this response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the PDGF-dependent effect on cell viability is significantly greater at day 3 compared to the 0.1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) treated cells, underscoring the role of PDGF in cell survival/growth in the absence of other growth factors. We next measured apoptosis following PDGF and FGF treatment in the presence of both inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Consistent with the cell viability results and phospho-JNK induction patterns, MEK inhibition following FGF stimulation results in a greater increase in apoptosis than inhibition of FGF-mediated PI3K signaling; in contrast, PI3K inhibition has a greater effect than MEK inhibition downstream of PDGF stimulation, although inhibiting either pathway results in increased apoptosis. Finally, we tested cell differentiation by alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining, a marker of osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). PDGF-treated MEPMs display a robust AP response, while FGF-treated cells show a striking lack of AP positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In addition, MEK/ERK inhibition increases AP staining, but PI3K inhibition represses osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Although the initial wave of gene expression shows high overlap, FGF elicits a quantitatively stronger response in terms of both signal magnitude and duration, which is reinforced by a positive signal from the delayed transcriptional wave in response to FGF but not PDGF. Furthermore, FGF-responsive genes are predominantly ERK dependent, while PDGF targets exhibit greater PI3K dependence genome-wide, relationships mimicked at the level of cellular outcome. Finally, we observed correlation between PDGF-PI3K signaling and osteoblast differentiation at E13.5 as well as increased AP staining in <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutants, indicating the differentiation circuit repressed by FGF signaling in MEPMs is functional in vivo.</p><p>The architecture of the transcriptional response to RTK signaling has been well described as three stereotypic waves: an IEG response, a delayed wave providing feedback control, and a late wave determining cellular outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>). In MEPMs, the magnitude and duration of the IEG wave is much stronger in response to FGF compared to PDGF, suggesting one level of specificity may be achieved through quantitative differences in IEG induction. Indeed, transient and sustained pERK induction, resulting in distinct magnitudes of <italic>Fos</italic> mRNA expression, drive binary responses in c-Fos abundance and activity at the protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murphy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakakuki et al., 2010</xref>), delineating one mechanism through which quantitative differences lead to a thresholded ‘ON-OFF’ response in downstream transcriptional activity. Thus, in addition to the observed PDGF-PI3K and FGF-ERK relationships, distinct patterns of IEG transcription factor expression may also contribute to the divergent gene expression profiles at later time points.</p><p>While inhibition of the delayed transcriptional response prolongs the PDGF-pERK wave, the opposite effect is observed on FGF-pERK induction. This result is consistent with the diversity of feedback and feedforward regulation on the RTK response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Volinsky and Kholodenko, 2013</xref>). In addition to transcriptional feedback, many other mechanisms, including ligand identity and receptor endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Francavilla et al., 2013</xref>), contribute toward specifying the signaling response to RTK activation. The complexity of this regulation underscores the intricate balance between positive and negative control systems, and it will be critical to determine how these regulatory mechanisms interact to produce the desired developmental outcomes.</p><p>Given the pleiotropic roles of RTKs, a central question involves how a common set of signal transduction modules specifies distinct outcomes. Our study supports a model in which differential intracellular pathway activation is responsible for the distinct transcriptional responses and cellular processes mediated by RTK signaling in MEPMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Pathway activation downstream of a single RTK can be affected by many parameters, such as receptor expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Traverse et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tallquist et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that even a single receptor can regulate multiple downstream outputs and transcriptional programs across different contexts. The role of quantitative differences in the pERK response leading to distinct cellular outcomes is well characterized in PC12 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marshall, 1995</xref>), and the transcriptional response to the proliferative program mediated by sustained pERK activation in 3T3 fibroblasts has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamamoto et al., 2006</xref>). Building on these studies, the MEPM RNA-seq data provide insight into the differences in gene expression following both transient and sustained pERK induction as well as qualitatively specific target genes downstream of MEK/ERK and PI3K signaling, with the added advantage of profiling these responses within a system requiring these pathways for normal development. It is important to note that mRNA levels alone (as measured by RNA-seq) are not the only level of specificity in the transcriptional response, for example, differential cofactor recruitment can also specify distinct gene expression programs in response to FGF and PDGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vasudevan and Soriano, 2014</xref>). Further work is necessary to identify the precise mechanisms regulating the activity of individual RTK target genes.</p><p>Although we focused on MEK/ERK and PI3K signaling based on their reported roles downstream of PDGF and FGF during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klinghoffer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corson et al., 2003</xref>), many other intracellular pathways are activated by RTKs, such as JNK, p38, Src, PLCγ, and PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). As previously reported in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhalla et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Santos et al., 2007</xref>), we found the FGF-pERK induction was dependent on PKC activity, and we further identified crosstalk in the presence of pathway inhibition between ERK, PI3K, and JNK. In addition, a subset of genes (34% FGF, 43% PDGF) are not affected by MEK/ERK or PI3K inhibition, suggesting they either lie downstream of other intracellular pathways or require inhibition of both ERK and PI3K. Thus, while our studies demonstrate PI3K is necessary for differentiation and ERK is necessary for proliferation in MEPMs, the high connectivity across intracellular pathways suggests no single pathway in isolation is sufficient to drive transcriptional responses and cellular outcomes in their entirety. Rather, integrated output from multiple effector pathways likely contributes to the ultimate cellular outcome, and instead of the existence of linear PDGF-PI3K-differentiation and FGF-ERK-proliferation axes, we favor a model in which multiple signaling events converge on PI3K to promote differentiation and ERK to drive proliferation in the midface.</p><p>The finding that effector inhibition increased the induction of many RTK target genes was surprising given their presumed primary function as positive effectors of signaling. The ‘superinduction’ of these transcriptional responses was due at least in part to compensatory activation of other pathways: inhibition of pERK downstream of both RTKs resulted in increased pJNK induction while inhibition of PI3K downstream of FGF, but not PDGF, resulted in increased pERK activation. This observation has implications for both genetic studies in mice and any system in which effector inhibition is used as an experimental or therapeutic agent. First, allelic series experiments in which adaptor binding is abrogated in order to abolish specific effector cascades may result in induction of alternate signaling pathways, complicating assignment of developmental function to a single intracellular pathway. Indeed, mice harboring a PI3K binding site mutation at the PDGFRα locus show increased SHP2 binding and altered pERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klinghoffer et al., 2002</xref>). Second, chemical inhibition of these effectors may prime activation of other pathways, facilitating alternate signaling mechanisms and cellular outcomes. Many examples of such crosstalk between ERK and PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mendoza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun and Bernards, 2014</xref>) as well as ERK and JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopez-Bergami et al., 2007</xref>) have been described downstream of RTK signaling in cancer. The MEPM RNA-seq data provide a transcriptional signature for this crosstalk, offering an additional readout to measure activation of these pathways. However, it is important to caution that these responses likely vary based on cellular context, and although the core target genes and effector dependencies may be conserved, extrapolating this framework to other systems requires careful validation.</p><p>In comparing our gene expression studies to mouse craniofacial development in vivo, we found co-localization of pAkt and AP in the upper lip and middle to posterior palate at E13.5 as well as overlapping domains of <italic>Runx2</italic> and <italic>Id</italic> gene expression, indicating the PDGF-PI3K axis identified in MEPMs is correlated with osteoblast differentiation in the midface. It is interesting to note that the distribution of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> mRNA expression compared to pAkt activity and AP staining is not strictly one-to-one; we speculate other factors such as ligand distribution, availability of intracellular signaling proteins, and input from other pathways may contribute toward the spatially restricted domains of osteoblast differentiation. We further observed elevated AP expression in <italic>Fgfr1</italic> conditional mutants at E14.5, consistent with FGF-mediated repression of osteoblast differentiation. Many functions have been ascribed to FGF signaling in skeletogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ornitz and Marie, 2002</xref>), and a combination of parameters is likely responsible for the multiplicity of observed roles, such as ligand identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Francavilla et al., 2013</xref>) and cellular context. During palatogenesis, <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutants have been previously reported to exhibit proliferation defects and increased BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), supporting the notion that FGF drives proliferation and represses differentiation in this system. In addition, the facial clefting phenotypes associated with neural crest conditional loss of RAF, MEK, or ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Newbern et al., 2008</xref>) suggest that the FGF-ERK axis is functionally relevant in vivo.</p><p>One important point merits further discussion: Are PI3K and ERK induction interpreted the same independently of the stimulus driving effector activity? There is evidence to suggest this is indeed the case, as IGF (Insulin-like growth factor 1)-mediated PI3K/Akt activation is a key regulator of osteoblast differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xian et al., 2012</xref>), consistent with the PI3K-mediated differentiation outcome in MEPMs. However, this interpretation is likely restricted in large part by cellular context, as MEK/ERK signaling functions as a positive regulator of differentiation in embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ying et al., 2008</xref>), in contrast to the role of MEK/ERK signaling in MEPMs. In skeletal differentiation, our findings of a MEK/ERK-mediated proliferation program and PI3K-mediated differentiation program are in line with previous work analyzing the role of these effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mansukhani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raucci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miraoui and Marie, 2010</xref>). In addition, a FGF-PKC-AP-1 signaling axis in calvarial osteoblasts has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miraoui et al., 2010</xref>), consistent with the MEPM data linking FGF to a robust AP-1 response and FGF-mediated pERK activation to PKC signaling. Delineating the hierarchy between these signals and pathways and determining the exact combinations sufficient to specify particular outcomes will be key questions for future studies. The present work provides a roadmap of the gene expression profiles underlying these cellular behaviors and a transcriptomic view of how two different RTKs lead to distinct outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), Marianne Bronner (Reviewing editor), and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, the authors took advantage of palatal mesenchymal cells in which both FGF and PDGF signaling utilize receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) to regulate downstream target genes during palatogenesis. To investigate the mechanisms underlying RTK specificity in craniofacial development, the authors performed detailed FGF and PDGF responsive gene analyses. They show that FGF signaling favors cell proliferation through activation of ERK whereas PDGF signaling mainly promotes cell differentiation through PI3K. Their results show that PDGF requires PI3K and affects differentiation while FGF depends on MEK/ERK and promotes proliferation. Furthermore although the FGF response was shown to be quantitatively stronger, there was considerable interconnectivity across the intracellular pathways which urges caution with respect to general effector inhibitor experiments and conclusions. The study is carefully done. Some further experimentation, described below, would strengthen the results.</p><p>1) The interpretations seem too focussed on the differences in MEK and PI3K signaling as explaining the changes in transcription between 1h and 4h. For example, in the Results section it is concluded: “In sum, both RTKs induce a qualitatively similar gene expression program at 1 hour, but FGF drives a quantitatively stronger early response, resulting in divergent gene expression profiles at 4 hours.” This seems to be jumping the gun, as much of the evidence comes later in the Results. What is meant by ‘similar’ gene expression programs at early stages? Perhaps there are some differences in early transcription factor expression that contribute to the greater divergence at 4h. A network of induced genes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, but are these the only ones? It would be useful to have a list of the differentially expressed genes at 1h, and some explicit discussion on this point.</p><p>2) Although the PDGF-PI3K/Akt signaling axis and FGF-MEK/ERK signaling are known to be important for craniofacial development, this concern is outweighed by the novelty of the comparative systematic transcriptional analyses of PDGF and FGF signaling in the palatal mesenchyme under the same experimental conditions. Some deeper analyses of the respective <italic>Fgfr1</italic> or <italic>Pdgfra</italic> mutants (either null or conditional as appropriate) would strengthen the authors' interpretations and conclusions in vivo. The RTK pathway intersection the authors observed in MEPM cells could easily be thoroughly validated in the background of the respective mutants.</p><p>3) In the experiment where the authors inhibited pERK by using PD325901, the authors found activation of pJNK. It would be helpful to know if there are any changes in apoptotic activity in PD325901-treated MEPMs.</p><p>4) In reviewing the <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression pattern, it is clear that <italic>Pdgfra</italic> is localized throughout the palatal mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B'</xref>) whereas the condensation of palatal mesenchyme and osteogenic differentiation is mainly located in the nasal region of the palatal shelf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). What is the functional significance of PDGF signaling in the oral region of the palatal shelf? Is PI3K activation only restricted to the nasal region where osteogenic differentiation will occur?</p><p>5) The tissue orientation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> is not clear. In general, palatal shelves should have fused at E14.5 in the control sample. Here, both control and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutant samples show that palatal shelves are blocked by the tongue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07186.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The interpretations seem too focussed on the differences in MEK and PI3K signaling as explaining the changes in transcription between 1h and 4h.

It would be useful to have a list of the differentially expressed genes at 1h, and some explicit discussion on this point</italic>.</p><p>We agree that a more thorough discussion of the transcription factor changes observed at 1 hour is warranted. By ‘similar’ gene expression programs, we are referring to the high correlation coefficient between the fold change of differentially regulated genes at 1 hour for both PDGF and FGF treatment, as plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compared to the correlation at 4 hours, as plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C'</xref>. Further, the set of PDGF targets at 1 hour are a subset of FGF targets at 1 hour (i.e. all PDGF targets at 1 hour are also identified as significantly regulated FGF targets by Cuffdiff, although the kinetics and magnitude of regulation are different). The main text has been amended in the Results section to make these points explicit. In addition, of the 34 total transcription factors identified within the FGF target gene list at 1 hour, 76% (26/34) are also significantly regulated by PDGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>), again underscoring the high degree of overlap at the early timepoint.</p><p>We do concur with the reviewers' point that quantitative differences in the early transcriptional response (which is shared across both PDGF and FGF stimulation) likely contribute to the divergence at 4 hours. Indeed, there exist examples in which the magnitude and duration of IEG induction can specify distinct late responses (Murphy, LO, et al. Nat. Cell Biology. 4, 556-564, 2002 and Nakakuki, T. et al. Cell. 141, 884–896, 2010). We accordingly altered our statement in the Results section, as the reviewers rightly indicate much of the data comes later in the manuscript, and we further added a few sentences in the Discussion summarizing the likely importance of distinct transcription factor induction patterns (in addition to MEK/ERK and PI3K dependence) to explain the observed differences at 4 hours.</p><p>In the presented PPI network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), 25 of the 113 genes significantly upregulated at 1 hour are depicted, and this statement has been added to the main text (Results section). A full list of these genes can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, Columns A-H on the sheet entitled ‘ComparedToUntreated.’</p><p><italic>2) Although the PDGF-PI3K/Akt signaling axis and FGF-MEK/ERK signaling are known to be important for craniofacial development, this concern is outweighed by the novelty of the comparative systematic transcriptional analyses of PDGF and FGF signaling in the palatal mesenchyme under the same experimental conditions. Some deeper analyses of the respective Fgfr1 or Pdgfra mutants (either null or conditional as appropriate) would strengthen the authors' interpretations and conclusions in vivo. The RTK pathway intersection the authors observed in MEPM cells could easily be thoroughly validated in the background of the respective mutants</italic>.</p><p>We agree that in vivo validation of our observations in MEPMs is highly desirable. Neither Pdgfra (Soriano, P. Development. 124, 2691-2700, 1997) nor Fgfr1 (Deng, CX. et al. Genes and Dev. 8, 3045-3057, 1994. and Yamaguchi, TP. et al. Genes and Dev. 8, 3032-3044, 1994) null mutants are recovered at Mendelian ratios at E13.5. Thus, we carried out RT-qPCR analysis in E13.5 secondary palates isolated from Wnt1-Cre; Pdgfra<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Wnt1-Cre; Fgfr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> neural crest conditional mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07186.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Expression of PDGF and FGF target genes in Pdgfra (red) and Fgfr1 (blue) mutant E13.5 secondary palates compared to control embryos without the Wnt1-Cre transgene (black). *p &lt; 0.1; **p &lt; 0.01, n = 4 for each genotype.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07186.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07186.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07186-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>The expression of IEGs such as Fos and Jun is unchanged, an expected result given the number of stimuli capable of inducing these genes as well as the observation that both PDGF and FGF treatment can induce these genes in MEPMs. Many differentiation genes (Mef2c, Alx1, Alx4, and Alpl) exhibit significantly greater expression in Fgfr1 mutants compared to Pdgfra mutants or control embryos, consistent with the MEPM data in which these genes display greater expression at 4 hours following PDGF treatment compared to 4 hours following FGF treatment. However, the Id genes (Id1, Id2, and Id3) do not conform to this trend and have similar expression across all genotypes; this may be due to compensation in vivo, particularly by BMP signaling, a canonical inducer of Id gene expression. Finally, it is interesting to note a high level of residual Pdgfra and Fgfr1 expression in the corresponding mutants. We believe this reflects receptor expression from non-neural crest derived contributions to the secondary palate (such as the mesoderm). Indeed, when we performed in situ hybridization for Pdgfra in Wnt1-Cre; Pdgfra<sup>fl/fl</sup> mutants and Fgfr1 expression in Wnt1-Cre; Fgfr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mutants, we found some receptor mRNA expression in the E13.5 palate of the respective conditional mutants (data not shown), consistent with our qPCR results. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis of PDGFRα expression in 10.5 branchial arches of Wnt1-Cre; Pdgfra<sup>fl/fl</sup> conditional mutants revealed no receptor expression, indicating satisfactory deletion by the Wnt1-Cre transgene in early structures derived from the neural crest (Tallquist, MD, and Soriano, P. Development. 130, 507-518, 2003). Finally, the same qPCR primers, when used to measure Pdgfra and Fgfr1 expression in E11.5 facial prominences isolated from the respective conditional mutants, revealed almost complete loss of these genes, thus suggesting the observed residual expression is likely not a technical issue associated with the qPCR protocol itself (Vasudevan, HN, and Soriano, P. Dev. Cell. 31, 332-344, 2014).</p><p>In summary, although we do observe supportive trends for a number of differentiation genes (Mef2c, Alx1, Alx4, and Alpl), results are mixed for other targets, which may be explained by compensation in vivo, residual receptor expression, or other factors. The development of Cre drivers more precise than the Wnt1-Cre that drive recombination within the secondary palate itself (rather than in the early neural crest) would facilitate the in vivo validation of the observations made in MEPMs. We believe the generation of such tools and subsequent analysis of Pdgfra and Fgfr1 mutants, while certainly important, is outside the scope of this study. We chose not to include the in vivo data obtained from the Wnt1-Cre mutant palatal shelves in the main text, as the observed residual receptor expression precludes clear interpretation of these results.</p><p><italic>3) In the experiment where the authors inhibited pERK by using PD325901, the authors found activation of pJNK. It would be helpful to know if there are any changes in apoptotic activity in PD325901-treated MEPMs</italic>.</p><p>We have performed the suggested experiment and measured apoptosis using cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) for FGF and PDGF treated MEPMs in the presence and absence of both PD325901 (MEK inhibitor) and LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In the case of FGF treatment, both MEK and PI3K inhibition increase the percentage of CC3+ cells, but MEK inhibition has a significantly greater effect, consistent with the induction of pJNK in this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, PI3K inhibition has a greater effect on apoptosis in PDGF treated cells, and again, both inhibitors show significantly increased apoptosis compared to PDGF treated cells alone. This result is not wholly surprising given the modest pJNK induction in the LY294002 dose response curve for PDGF treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B'</xref>). In addition, both PD325901 and LY294002 are known to induce apoptosis in other cell types, and our results suggest intracellular signaling in response to FGF and PDGF stimulation exhibit different sensitivities to the apoptotic effect of these inhibitors. The CC3 measurements are generally consistent with the crystal violet assay, where FGF exhibits greater MEK dependence while PDGF-mediated effects on cell viability are sensitive to both MEK and PI3K inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We have added this result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref> and removed the schematic of RTK mediated control of cell proliferation and differentiation, as a similar model is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. We have included a line in the main text describing these apoptosis results (please see the subsection headed “FGF drives MEK/ERK-dependent cell proliferation, and PDGF promotes PI3K-dependent cell differentiation”).</p><p><italic>4) In reviewing the Pdgfra expression pattern, it is clear that Pdgfra is localized throughout the palatal mesenchyme (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B'</italic></xref><italic>) whereas the condensation of palatal mesenchyme and osteogenic differentiation is mainly located in the nasal region of the palatal shelf (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref><italic>). What is the functional significance of PDGF signaling in the oral region of the palatal shelf? Is PI3K activation only restricted to the nasal region where osteogenic differentiation will occur?</italic></p><p>The reviewers astutely observe that Pdgfra mRNA expression is evenly distributed, which leads to a question regarding the spatial distribution of Pdgfra mRNA expression, PI3K activation, and osteogenic differentiation in the palate. Regarding PI3K activation, it is important to note that our immunohistochemistry results identify regions of relative enrichment for pAkt and may not reflect an absolute lack of pAkt in regions that appear negative. In addition, PI3K can signal through Akt independent pathways, and it is possible PI3K activation recruits these other pathways outside the observed pAkt domains. While Pdgfra mRNA expression is ubiquitous throughout the palatal mesenchyme, receptor expression level, ligand distribution, or availability of intracellular signaling proteins may all affect the extent and function of PDGF signaling in different regions. It is also possible that PDGF signaling is necessary but not sufficient for PI3K activation and osteogenic differentiation. In this scenario, the spatially restricted patterns of pAkt induction and osteogenic differentiation may function as coincidence detectors that respond only to the coordinate activation of multiple signals. We have added a line in the Discussion mentioning these possibilities. One approach to unambiguously determine the functional role of PDGFRα in the oral region could involve the use of a spatially specific Cre driver, but the tools to perform such an analysis are currently lacking.</p><p><italic>5) The tissue orientation in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6C</italic></xref> <italic>is not clear. In general, palatal shelves should have fused at E14.5 in the control sample. Here, both control and Fgfr1 mutant samples show that palatal shelves are blocked by the tongue</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers raise a concern regarding the time of palatal fusion in mouse development. In our mice, which are maintained on a 129S4 background, secondary palate fusion is not complete at E14.5 (see also Fantauzzo, KA, and Soriano, P. Genes Dev. 28, 1005–1017, 2014). This is also consistent with previous observations made with SEM (Kaufman. The Atlas of Mouse Development. 426-429, 1992) and H/E staining (Bush, JO, and Jiang, R. Development 139, 828–828, 2012). However, it is intriguing to note that other databases, such as FaceBase depict contact between the palatal shelves at E14.5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.facebase.org/sites/default/files/SEM_images/anatomy.html">https://www.facebase.org/sites/default/files/SEM_images/anatomy.html</ext-link>). We suspect this discrepancy in the exact time of secondary palate fusion may be background dependent, as FaceBase uses C57BL/6 embryos. Regarding the sections from Fgfr1 mutant palatal shelves, we have replaced the original image with a lower magnification image from a different embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) to better orient the reader and have clarified in the figure legend that these are frontal sections.</p></body></sub-article></article>
