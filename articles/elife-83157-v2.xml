self-renewed progenitor cell, maintaining the potential to go through additional rounds of cell divisions, and differentiating daughter cells, populating the developing cortex. Previous work in the embryonic rodent brain suggested that the preferential inheritance of the pre-existing (older) centrosome to the self-renewed progenitor cell is required to maintain stem cell properties, ensuring proper neurogenesis. If asymmetric segregation of centrosomes occurs in NPCs of the developing human brain, which depends on unique molecular regulators and species-specific cellular composition, remains unknown. Using a novel, recombination-induced tag exchange-based genetic tool to birthdate and track the segregation of centrosomes over multiple cell divisions in human embryonic stem cell-derived regionalised forebrain organoids, we show the preferential inheritance of the older mother centrosome towards self-renewed NPCs. Aberration of asymmetric segregation of centrosomes by genetic manipulation of the centrosomal, microtubule-associated protein Ninein alters fate decisions of NPCs and their maintenance in the VZ of human cortical organoids. Thus, the data described here use a novel genetic approach to birthdate centrosomes in human cells and identify asymmetric inheritance of centrosomes as a mechanism to maintain self-renewal properties and to ensure proper neurogenesis in human NPCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>asymmetric cell division</kwd><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>organoid</kwd><kwd>human progenitor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STEMBAR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jessberger</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BSCGI0_157859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jessberger</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_196869</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jessberger</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Royall</surname><given-names>Lars N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic birthdating in forebrain organoids shows asymmetric inheritance of centrosomes in human neural progenitor cells, required for proper human neurogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During human brain development, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) undergo two modes of cell division. At first, NPCs, at this developmental stage called neuroepithelial cells, undergo expansive symmetric divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cadwell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Libé-Philippot and Vanderhaeghen, 2021</xref>). Symmetric divisions are characterised by the generation of two daughter cells of similar fate; here, two NPCs both retain their potency, their capacity to self-renew and remain in the ventricular zone (VZ). Around gestational week (GW) 5 in the developing human brain (corresponding approximately to embryonic day (E) 11.5 in the mouse embryo), NPCs, at this developmental stage referred to as radial glia or apical progenitor cells, transition from an expansive phase into a neurogenic phase and shift their mode of division from symmetric to asymmetric divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Götz and Barde, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Malatesta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Juan Romero and Borrell, 2015</xref>). Asymmetric divisions result in two daughter cells with different fates and cellular behaviour: one daughter remains in the VZ and retains the ability to self-renew, comparable to the mother cell. The other daughter cell migrates along the basal process of their sister cell, out of the VZ and either directly begins the process of neuronal differentiation or initiates additional rounds of symmetric, differentiating cell divisions producing two neurons (at this stage referred to as intermediate progenitors or basal progenitor cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). Exactly how differential fates of sister cells are established remains not completely elucidated; however, previous work showed that the centrosome might play a central role in distinct fates of daughter cells upon neurogenic, asymmetric cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Centrosomes are unbound organelles comprised of two centrioles connected by a flexible linker and surrounded by a dynamic protein matrix called pericentriolar material. Centrosomes are the primary microtubule organising centres of metazoan cells and provide the contractile forces required for mitosis in most human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bornens, 2002</xref>). The centrosome duplicates once per cell cycle that occurs in a semi-conservative way, producing one centrosome that is older and functionally more mature than the other one. At mitosis, the older and younger centrosome will always be asymmetrically segregated to one of the two daughter cells. Previous work showed that there is non-random inheritance of centrosomes based on their age in the developing cortex of flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Januschke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ranjan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sunchu and Cabernard, 2020</xref>), chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tozer et al., 2017</xref>), and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paridaen et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, in the mouse developing cortex self-renewing NPCs appear to inherit the older, more mature centrosome while the newborn neuron inherits the new, daughter centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, randomisation of centrosome inheritance leads to premature depletion of NPCs from the VZ, indicating functional relevance of asymmetric centrosome inheritance during mouse cortical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). How asymmetric centrosome inheritance affects cellular fate is only poorly understood but, for example, recent work showed that Mind-bomb1, a Notch signalling regulator, is preferentially enriched at the younger centrosome, asymmetrically segregates with it into the differentiating daughter cell, and thereby potentially promotes stemness via Notch signalling activation in surrounding NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tozer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite substantial evidence supporting the importance of asymmetric centrosome inheritance in NPCs from diverse, evolutionary distant species, there is little known about human tissues. This is mainly due to the difficulty obtaining samples of human developing cortex coupled with the fact that perturbations are only feasible in vitro. However, it is clear that the human brain relies on species-specific molecular regulators and genetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bystron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinson and Huttner, 2021</xref>). Recent methodological advances such as the generation of brain organoids, derived from human pluripotent stem cells, recapitulate early steps of human brain development, allowing for novel approaches to characterise the principles of cortical development in human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Lullo and Kriegstein, 2017</xref>). Cortical organoids render a perfect system to study asymmetric cell divisions as the stem cells and their progeny segregate spatially with the NPCs lining the ventricle and the neurons surrounding the NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qian et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we used human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived, regionalised forebrain organoids as a model of early human cortical development to identify the dynamics and functional relevance of asymmetric centrosome inheritance for human neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Centriolin-RITE birthdates human centrosomes</title><p>With the aim to birthdate and track the segregation of centrosomes over multiple cell divisions in human cells we created a novel genetic tool based on the recombination-induced tag exchange (RITE) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hotz et al., 2012</xref>), consisting of the red fluorescent protein tdTomato flanked by LoxP sites and followed by a second section containing the green fluorescent protein NeonGreen (with each section ending with a terminal stop codon followed by a 3′UTR or a T2A Neo, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ran et al., 2013</xref>) we inserted the RITE construct into hESCs immediately upstream of the terminal stop codon of Centriolin, a protein that localises to the subdistal appendages of the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gromley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gromley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kashihara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chong et al., 2020</xref>). The Centriolin yeast ortholog, Nud1, has previously been shown to have limited turnover on the pre-existing yeast spindle pole body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lengefeld et al., 2017</xref>). As the reading frame is maintained, Centriolin will be constitutively tagged with tdTomato. LoxP recombination with Cre recombinase will excise the first section containing tdTomato, causing Centriolin to be tagged with NeonGreen, and allowing for the discrimination of pre-existing vs. newly synthesised Centriolin based on red vs. green fluorescence. Indeed, tdTomato-positive dots were observed in each cell and NeonGreen was detectable within 24 hr after recombination induced by electroporation of Cre recombinase expressing plasmid; staining with the centrosomal marker protein Pericentrin showed that Centriolin-tdTomato was properly localising to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Correct localisation of RITE-tagged Centriolin was confirmed by live imaging of hESCs following electroporation of GFP-Centrin-1, which localised to the centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In line with the known behaviour of Centriolin as a subdistal appendage of the mother centriole, Centriolin-tdTomato co-localised to one of the two centrioles.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Recombination-induced tag exchange (RITE)-based birthdating of centrosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Centriolin is tagged with the RITE system in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) so that all Centriolin protein made is tdTomato-tagged. Upon recombination with Cre recombinase, the tdTomato fluorophore is replaced with NeonGreen, making all new Centriolin protein tagged with NeonGreen. Identifying a proteins tag will indicate the proteins age with tdTomato being the oldest, then NeonGreen. (<bold>B</bold>) Image of hESCs expressing Centriolin-RITE 24 hr post Cre induction.

Such mixed tdTomato and NeonGreen centrosomes were observed at longer time points (&gt;20 days) after recombination indicating that centriolin was remarkably stable on the centrosome, labelled with CEP164.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ventricular NPCs retain the older centrosome</title><p>To assess whether there is an asymmetric inheritance of older centrosomes, the RITE-tagged centrosome signal was compared between NPCs in the VZ and progeny that had migrated away from the centre of cortical units. NPCs in VZ were selected for comparison, as opposed to all SOX2-positive cells, as their presence in the VZ strongly indicates their capacity for self-renewal whereas SOX2-positive cells outside of the VZ may have already started differentiation along the neural lineage.</p><p>Twenty-two days after recombination organoids were stained and the ventricles, and the surrounding tissue, were imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). During this process, the 3D tissue gets collapsed into a 2D image. As ventricle-like structures in organoids are tubular or spherical in nature, this dimension collapse produces a circle of centrosomes, where multiple Z planes show a ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This leads to an inclusion of centrosomes whose-cell bodies are not imaged because of the radial orientation of NPCs relative to the ventricles and the volume of tissue imaged. This is problematic as the progeny of the recombined NPCs whose centrosomes are on the inner ventricular wall (shown in purple in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) would migrate along the NPCs’ radial projection and would not be in the imaged area. However, NPCs whose centrosomes are on the outer ventricular wall will produce progeny that should remain in the imaged area (shown in orange and yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The inclusion of NPC centrosomes and not their progeny could potentially skew the data. To correct for this, images were digitally subdivided into areas of recombined NPCs and their likely progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Centrosomes were manually allocated a colour by the quantity of Centriolin-tdTomato signal present in recombined centrosomes. Orange centrosomes’ tdTomato signals were visibly indistinguishable from non-recombined centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>); yellow centrosomes had some tdTomato signal but less compared to non-recombined centrosomes and green centrosomes showed no detectable tdTomato signal. The number of orange, yellow, and green centrosomes was counted in the VZ section (vent) and the non-VZ section (nonvent) and compared. Comparison between these two regions revealed a higher proportion of orange centrosomes in the ventricle compared to outside the ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). The inverse was observed for green centrosomes, whereas there was no difference seen in the localisation of yellow centrosomes, similar to what was observed in the absolute number of each centrosome colour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). To validate the manual approach, we used an unbiased method of analysing fluorescence levels at the centrosomes. The mean tdTomato and NeonGreen signal was acquired, and a ratio was calculated for each centrosome (see Methods for details). This analysis showed that VZ centrosomes had a lower proportion of NeonGreen signal compared to their non-ventricular progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>), corroborating the previous results obtained by manual grading. Next, centrosomes were divided into thirds by their NeonGreen to total signal ratio, with the highest, middle, and lowest thirds being labelled ‘green’, ‘yellow’, and ‘orange’, respectively. Again, we found increased orange centrosomes in the VZ and more green centrosomes in the non-ventricle areas within organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>). To test whether comparing ventricular to non-ventricular cells indeed reflects different cell types, organoids were stained for NPCs (SOX2) and neuronal progeny (TBR1). TBR1 was excluded from the NPC dense VZ and indeed, green centrosomes co-localised with TBR1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that the older, tdTomato-enriched centrosomes are preferentially retained by VZ NPCs, whereas the differentiating progeny inherits the younger, more NeonGreen-containing centrosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ninein knockdown affects NPC fate</title><p>Next, we wanted to understand how centrosome inheritance affects the behaviour of human NPCs.

Such non-random and preferential inheritance of one of the centrosomes depending on centrosomal age by one of the two daughter cells has previously been reported for asymmetric cell divisions in yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Januschke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hotz et al., 2012</xref>). The evolutionary conservation of this phenomenon emphasises the important role that centrosome inheritance may play in maintaining the proper cellular behaviour during asymmetric cell division.</p><p>In the study presented here, centriolin was endogenously tagged with fluorophores, in contrast to previous approaches relying on overexpression of centrosomal proteins. This reduces potential artefacts of excess protein expression; however, endogenous tagging provides only few fluorophores per centrosome to be visualised. Therefore, the signal is too dim to, with current technical approaches, perform live imaging or clonal analyses to follow individual centrosomes and their subsequent segregation. Nevertheless, the Centriolin-RITE tool kit presents a number of potential benefits over the previously described photoconversion-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Photoconversion requires the tagged proteins to be targeted with a laser, which requires surgery or tissue extraction to allow for laser accessibility. This potentially alters the natural physiological processes within the tissues and may introduce experimental artefacts. Furthermore, photoconversion inevitably produces phototoxic events in cells which may alter their behaviour. The Centriolin-RITE birthdating tool can be activated in a spatial and temporal dependent manner by the use of tamoxifen-inducible Cre approaches. This allows any tissues within an organism to be birthdated without having to physically disturb it. Additionally, we designed the RITE system to use fluorescent proteins tdTomato and NeonGreen that originate from two evolutionary distinct species: <italic>Discosoma</italic> sp. and <italic>Branchiostoma lanceolatum</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shaner et al., 2013</xref>). This facilitates biochemical separation of the birthdated proteins by immunoprecipitation; further, the addition of high-affinity biochemical tags to the RITE cassette is feasible and will allow for further biochemical and proteomics-based analyses, which are essential to untangling the complex protein–protein interactions in centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">O’Neill et al., 2022</xref>). The data we present here show that asymmetric inheritance of centrosomes is an evolutionary conserved mechanism during cortical formation that may be of critical relevance for human brain development by maintaining the proper cellular behaviour of human NPCs. Furthermore, using it in human brain organoids will allow future experiments studying whether centrosomal age differs between apical and basal radial glia cells, the latter one being rare in brains of lisencephalic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Camp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The reason why human ventricular NPCs retain the older mother centrosome remains unclear. Several hypotheses may explain preferential inheritance of the old centrosome to the self-renewed daughter NPC. One potential reason could be that inheritance of the old centrosome may reduce aberrant mitotic events as the mother centrosome had participated previously in at least one successful mitosis, suggesting that the centrosome is capable of producing a daughter centriole, nucleating microtubules, and facilitating normal chromosome segregation, while the newly synthesised daughter centrosome is newer and less ‘tested’ as it has never produced a functional centrosome. If this centrosome has an aberration in its structure, it could lead to duplication defects and deleterious chromosomal missegregation. Thus, one may hypothesise that evolution would favour retaining the older, tested centrosome with the daughter cell that must undergo additional rounds of cell divisions. In support of this notion, the older centrosome is inherited by self-renewing NPCs in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) and, as we here show, in human cortical development, and by the daughter cell in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pereira et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lengefeld et al., 2017</xref>), which is considered the stem cell. In contrast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts inherit the younger centrosome and pass on the older centrosome to their differentiating daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Januschke et al., 2011</xref>). Why <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts do not follow the mode of centrosome inheritance observed in other species is not known. One may speculate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts produce less progeny and therefore have lower selective pressure to maintain their fitness.</p><p>Another potential reason for asymmetric inheritance could be that the old centrosome of NPCs is maintained on the ventricular wall associated with the primary cilium. Indeed, it has been shown that the mother centrosome is quicker to reassemble the primary cilium, likely because it was already decorated with the distal appendages from the previous interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paridaen et al., 2013</xref>), which has been shown to be critical for NPC cellular behaviour. Moreover, at the ventricular wall, space is limited, and the apical feet of ventricular NPCs are crowded together forming adherens junctions. The stability of these junctions and the maintenance of the apical foot itself is dependent on the junctional microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasioulis et al., 2017</xref>), which can be destabilised by increased centrosomal microtubule organisational activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camargo Ortega et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, previous work showed that overexpression of the centrosomal protein AKNA increased centrosomal microtubule organisational activity, destabilised the apical junction, and caused NPCs to delaminate from the apical surface and migrate out of the VZ. Furthermore, the mother centrosome was shown to anchor to the apical membrane via the distal appendage protein CEP83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shao et al., 2020</xref>). Loss of CEP83 causes impaired apical anchorage of the centrosome, disorganisation of microtubules, increase in NPC proliferation and subsequent enlargement of the cortex. These data indicate that the maintenance of NPCs in the VZ requires a delicate balance of centrosomal function at the apical surface. Inheritance of the older centrosome could be one mechanism by which NPCs regulate this balance. Removing Ninein from the centrosome could alter this balance and lead to the older centrosome being inherited to a non-ventricle destined cell. Additionally, it is becoming apparent that centrosomes act as one of the key signalling centres of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arquint et al., 2014</xref>). The Notch signalling regulator, Mind-bomb1, was shown to be preferentially enriched on the daughter centrosome and asymmetrically segregated with it into the differentiating daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tozer et al., 2017</xref>). Mind-bomb1 in this cell would then promote stemness via Notch signalling activation in the surrounding NPCs. Consistent retention of particular centrosome allows of such asymmetric signalling pathways to be established and could facilitate the coordination of other cellular asymmetries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Royall and Jessberger, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The extent to which proper asymmetric inheritance of the older centrosome by dividing NPCs is associated with human disease remains currently unknown. For example, disturbance of asymmetric inheritance of centrosomes could play a causative role in microcephaly where indeed a substantial number of human variants and mutations have been identified in genes associated with centrosome function and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faheem et al., 2015</xref>). Strikingly, a recent cell type-specific analysis of centrosomal proteomes identified a large number of proteins, previously implicated with neurodevelopmental disease, to be associated with centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">O’Neill et al., 2022</xref>). We here identify that human NPCs show asymmetric inheritance of centrosomes and that disrupting retention of the pattern of centrosome inheritance affects proper neurogenesis in human forebrain organoids. Together with these proof of principle findings, the genetic approach we present here may become a powerful tool in elucidating the role centrosome inheritance plays in human disease and cortical malformations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genetic targeting and constructs</title><p>Guide RNAs and CRISPR/Cas9 tagging was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2021</xref>).

EBs were transferred to a 6 well Ultra-Low Attachment Plate (Corning) or a 10-cm Ultra-Low Attachment Plate (Corning) and maintained in mTeSR-E5 (Stem Cell Technologies) with 2 µM Dorsomorphin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 µM A83-01 (Tocris) until day 4. Media was changed days 3 and 4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Days 5–14, adaption and maintenance in induction media</title><p>Days 5–14 follow the exact same steps as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qian et al., 2018</xref>, but with a different media. The induction media used was mTeSR-E5 with 1 µM CHIR99021 (Stem Cell Technologies) and 1 µM SB-431542 (Stem Cell Technologies).</p><p>To ensure batch-to-batch variability was kept to a minimum, we started organoid production with the same number of cells each time and an organoid batch production was only started if the hESC culture looked healthy with very low levels of differentiation. In addition, only the H9 hESC line (purchased from WiCell) was used to remove genetic differences introducing batch effects. Furthermore, organoid batchs that did not show the signs of typical forebrain organoid development were not used for experimentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Imaging and immunostaining</title><p>hESCs were fixed by either incubation with prewarmed 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at room temperature or with chilled methanol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at 4°C. All monolayer immunostainings used 3% Donkey Serum (Millipore) as a blocking agent and 0.25% Triton-X (Sigma-Aldrich) as a permeabilisation agent. Primary antibodies were incubated with the samples at 4°C overnight and secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 hr and 30 min at room temperature. Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope was used to obtain all images. For live cell imaging, hESCs were maintained at 37°C and with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> facilitated by the incubator chamber and heated stage that is fitted to the microscope. hESCs were imaged in Matrigel coated Lab Tek II chambered cover glasses (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For imaging following electroporation, cells were plated on the Lab Tek cover glasses. Imaging started after at least 6 hr. For imaging involving ER<sup>T2</sup>-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> expressing cells, hESCs were first plated on Lab Tek chambered coverglasses (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and allowed to settle for at least 24 hr. Recombination was induced in situ with the addition of 0.5 μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) into the media. hESCs were imaged every hour. Throughout imaging hESCs were maintained in mTeSR plus containing 10 µM Y-27632 and penicillin–streptomycin–amphotericin B (Anti-Anti, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Additionally, media was supplemented with 1:1000 SiR-DNA (Spirochrome), in the absence of Verapamil, to visualise the nucleus and facilitate easier tracking of cells. Media was changed every 24 hr.</p><p>Organoids were electroporated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2022</xref>). As each organoid was individually injected and electroporated, further technical repeats were not conducted. To determine the fate of electroporated NPCs expressing either scrambled shRNA or NIN-targeting shRNA, organoids were stained with antibodies detecting GFP (H2B-CFP), SOX2, and CTIP2. Every electroporated cell expressing shRNA (H2B-CFP) was categorised as NPC (SOX2+), neuron (CTIP2+), or undefined. For each cortical unit, the number of SOX2+ or CTIP2+ was divided by the number of targeted cells to assess the percentage of NPCs and neurons, respectively. The signal of H2B-CFP electroporated organoids was amplified using an anti-GFP antibody.</p><p>Recombination was induced in ER<sup>T2</sup>-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> expressing organoids by administration of 10 μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 hr. Organoids were fixed with prewarmed 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed organoids were suspended in 30% sucrose overnight at 4°C; organoids were maintained in 30% sucrose until sectioned. For sectioning, organoids were embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek) and frozen solid. 20–40 µm sections were sectioned using a cryostat and adhered to cover slides. Sections were kept at −20°C until stained. For tissues containing fluorophores, proper measures were undertaken to prevent unnecessary and extensive exposure to light during the whole process. All organoid immunostainings used 10% Donkey Serum (Millipore) as a blocking agent and 0.5% Triton-X (Sigma-Aldrich) as a permeabilisation agent. Primary antibodies were incubated with the samples at 4°C for 1–3 nights and secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 hr and 30 min at room temperature. The signal of H2B-CFP electroporated organoids was amplified using an anti-GFP antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Image analysis</title><p>All images were analysed using ImageJ/Fiji and the data were processed and analysed in Excel or R. For organoid analysis, images with ventricular recombined centrosomes were selected. Cortical units were defined as a densely packed, spherical layer of SOX2+ cells, with their nuclei orientated inwards, surrounded by non-NSPC cells. To limit the effect of batch-to-batch variability, only well-formed cortical units were analysed. To define the size of the cortical unit, the thickness of the ventricle was measured using the SOX2 staining as the outer boundary. A circle with a radius of a maximum of three times the ventricle thickness or to the edge of the tissue (which ever was less), centred on the ventricle midpoint was cropped out. The centre of the ventricle was cropped out leaving a ring of three to five centrosomes, care was taken not to crop out recombined centrosomes that were part of the same cluster. A line was drawn between the two ends of the cluster. A perpendicular line was draw in the middle of the line extending radially out of the VZ to the edge of the circle. Two more lines were drawn from the ends of the first line at an angle of 45° extending to the edge of the circle. The area within these three lines and the arc of the edge of the circle was cropped out and analysed.</p><p>Recombined centrosomes were manually assigned one of three colours, orange, yellow, or green. The criteria for each were as follows and were dependent on the unrecombined centrosomes in the same image. Orange centrosomes were centrosomes with both tdTomato and NeonGreen signal, and where the tdTomato signal was similar to that of unrecombined centrosomes. Yellow centrosomes had both tdTomato and NeonGreen signal, but the tdTomato signal was visibly less than unrecombined centrosomes. Green centrosomes had only NeonGreen signal; the tdTomato signal in these centrosomes was undetectable by eye. The ventricular centrosomes (vent) and non-ventricular centrosomes (nonvent) were counted by colour for each image. Ratios of each colour were calculated and compared between different images. The absolute counts of centrosomes by colour were calculated across images and compared by their region. Additionally, the ratio of counts between regions was calculated for each colour.</p><p>Centrosomes were analysed in two groups: centrosomes from the ventricle (vent) and centrosomes outside the ventricle (nonvent). Vent centrosomes were defined as the centrosomes visibly localised on the ventricular wall, identifiable by the high density of centrosomes in a circular configuration. Nonvent centrosomes were centrosomes localised outside of the ventricular wall. Centrosomes were drawn around and the mean signal intensity was recorded for tdTomato and NeonGreen. The ratio of NeonGreen to total signal was calculated by dividing the NeonGreen by the sum of tdTomato and NeonGreen signal. Means of this ratio were calculate for each region of each image. This ratio was used for the digital allocation of orange, yellow, and green, with the centrosomes in the top third for highest ratio being assigned green, the second third yellow and the lowest ratio centrosomes being assigned orange.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>Validation of Ninein knockdown</title><p>HEK cells were transfected with constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 2 days before they were fixed, stained, and imaged. Cells were either transfected with a plasmid expressing shRNA-targeting Ninein or scrambled shRNA. Cells were stained using antibodies against Ninein and Pericentrin and the ratio of their fluorescence intensity was measured in H2B-CFP-expressing cells. Alternatively, cells were additionally infected with a plasmid expressing GFP-Ninein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2003</xref>) and stained for Pericentrin. Fluorescence intensity of GFP-Ninein and Pericentrin was measured in H2B-CFP-expressing cells and ratios were plotted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>Used antibodies:</title><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Antibody</th><th align="left" valign="top">Species</th><th align="left" valign="top">Manufacturer</th><th align="left" valign="top">Catalogue No./RRID</th><th align="left" valign="top">Dilution</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>PCNT</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">Rabbit</td><td align="left" valign="top">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="top">ab4448 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_304461">AB_304461</ext-link></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>SOX2</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">Rabbit</td><td align="left" valign="top">Millipore</td><td align="left" valign="top">AB5603 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2286686">AB_2286686</ext-link></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>SOX2</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse</td><td align="left" valign="top">R&amp;D</td><td align="left" valign="top">MAB2018 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_358009">AB_358009</ext-link></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>CTIP2</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">Rat</td><td align="left" valign="top">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="top">ab18465 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2064130">AB_2064130</ext-link></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>CEP164</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">Rabbit</td><td align="left" valign="top">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="top">ab221447/n.a.</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>tdTomato</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">Goat</td><td align="left" valign="top">Origene</td><td align="left" valign="top">AB8181-200/n.a.</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1:750</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>Ninein</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse</td><td align="left" valign="top">Santa Cruz</td><td align="left" valign="top">sc-376420 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_11151570">AB_11151570</ext-link></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1:250</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>GFP</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">Chicken</td><td align="left" valign="top">Aves</td><td align="left" valign="top">GFP.1020 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10000240">AB_10000240</ext-link></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>TBR1</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">Rabbit</td><td align="left" valign="top">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="top">ab31940 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2200219">AB_2200219</ext-link></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1:250</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance of all data presented here was tested by using unpaired, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Anita Bhattacharyya as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the manuscript reports important findings in the field of developmental neurobiology, particularly in our understanding of human cortical development. The methods, data, and analyses support the claims with one key piece of data missing. Specifically, the lack of clonal resolution or timelapse imaging makes it hard to assess whether the inheritance of centrosomes occurs as the authors claim.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should include analysis at clonal resolution or timelapse imaging to show the asymmetric inheritance of centrosomes during organoid development.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors state that differentiating progeny inherit younger, more neon green centrosomes, based on the localization of labelled centrosomes and distance from VZ (Figure 2). To directly support the conclusion that differentiating progeny inherit younger centrosomes, the authors need to show neuron double labeling to validate this point (either TF as in Figure 3, or neuron-specific marker).</p><p>The discussion needs to be reorganized and expanded.</p><p>1. The methodology should be discussed first and include improvements to existing technology.</p><p>2. Asymmetric inheritance generally (the bulk of the current Discussion).</p><p>3.

To show the asymmetric inheritance of centrosomes during organoid development, the authors could perform live imaging on the organoid slices. The Reviewer acknowledges the effort authors did to quantify the centrosomes in their organoids but finds it important to corroborate such data with time-lapse imaging that can show beyond any doubt such asymmetric inheritance. Fully aware of the technical issues that might arise during such imaging, I do not find it necessary to repeat all the quantifications using live imaging, but I do think that showing movies with asymmetric inheritance would significantly increase the impact of this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) In many images, red and magenta are used together.

We do agree that such data would strengthen our findings. Indeed, we have tried to image individual RITE-labeled centrosomes in human organoids before. However, we have – despite very extensive efforts – failed to do so for the following reasons: in complex, highly scattering tissues, such as organoids, the RITE-based signal is too dim. This is due to the fact that the sizes of the fluorescent spots are extremely small (given the size of centrosomes just a few pixels consisting of very few centriolin molecules) which makes it obviously complicated and requires, for any even “dim” detection, very high power laser settings. However, the required laser power in turn causes extensive photobleaching (together with potential other effects on imaged tissues). Thus, we would have loved to add these data, have tried very hard before submitting the initial version of our manuscript, but we are afraid that these experiments are just not technically feasible at this time.</p><p>We understand that others have established very recently clonal linage tracing approaches in human organoids (e.g., He et al., 2022, Nature Methods). However, they used strong overexpression of GFP throughout the cell (which will be hundredfold brighter than the fluorescence signal of individual centrosomes). Indeed, we are not aware of any experiments showing long-term imaging of clonal lineages together with (very small) intracellular organelles, which will be needed to address the suggested revision experiment.</p><p>Purely for technical reasons, as outlined above, we will not be able to add novel data using RITE and clonal lineage tracing. We tried these experiments before but failed due to current technical limitations. Unfortunately, we had not discussed that shortcoming (and the technical difficulties) in our initial version. However, we now explicitly discuss in a revised version why i) such experiments would strengthen our data but also ii) why these experiments are not feasible at this time (page 13). Again, we fully agree that these data would strengthen our data; but at the same time we are convinced that the evidence provided by us is not just based on a “single observation” – but for example also very much supported by the Ninein-related experiments – and therefore are confident that the interpretation of our findings is valid based on the existing data and available technology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors state that differentiating progeny inherit younger, more neon green centrosomes, based on the localization of labelled centrosomes and distance from VZ (Figure 2).

We changed the order and expanded the discussion of human-specific aspects. We did not discuss in more detail the impact of centrosome inheritance on the fate of aRG versus bRG as we used day 40 to day 60 organoids which might not contain substantial numbers of bRG yet. bRG were reported in day 80 organoids onwards (Qian et al., Cell, 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

And would have loved to add such imaging experiments. As outlined above (please refer to point #1 of the editorial summary), we have tried very hard to do these experiments. However, the size and fluorescent intensities of single centriolin-labeled centrosomes did not allow for the suggested experiments.
