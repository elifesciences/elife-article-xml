We designed evolution experiments to disentangle and quantify effects of these forces on the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Previously, we showed that selection of the pathogen <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> in both structured and unstructured environments containing the antibiotic ciprofloxacin produced distinct genotypes and phenotypes, with lower resistance in biofilms as well as collateral sensitivity to β-lactam drugs (Santos-Lopez et al., 2019). Here we study how this prior history influences subsequent evolution in new β-lactam antibiotics. Selection was imposed by increasing concentrations of ceftazidime and imipenem and chance differences arose as random mutations among replicate populations. The effects of history were reduced by increasingly strong selection in new drugs, but not erased, at times revealing important contingencies. A history of selection in structured environments constrained resistance to new drugs and led to frequent loss of resistance to the initial drug by genetic reversions and not compensatory mutations. This research demonstrates that despite strong selective pressures of antibiotics leading to genetic parallelism, history can etch potential vulnerabilities to orthogonal drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>acinetobacter</kwd><kwd>collateral sensitivity</kwd><kwd>population genetics</kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd><kwd>efflux</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01AI124302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Vaughn S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H2020-MSCA-IF-2019 REPLAY-895671</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santos-Lopez</surname><given-names>Alfonso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Selection imposed by antibiotics may dominate evolutionary forces acting on opportunistic pathogens like <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, yet chance effects and a prior history in biofilm may constrain resistance and impose collateral sensitivities.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evolution can be propelled by natural selection, it can wander with the chance effects of mutation and genetic drift, and it can be constrained by history, whereby past events limit or even potentiate the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Travisano et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keller and Taylor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kryazhimskiy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rebolleda-Gomez and Travisano, 2019</xref>). The relative roles of these forces has been debated, with the constraints of history the most contentious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blount et al., 2018</xref>). A wealth of recent research has shown that evolution can be surprisingly repeatable when selection is strong even among distantly related lineages or in different environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lieberman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lassig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Turner et al., 2018</xref>), but disparate outcomes become more likely as the footprint of history (i.e. differences in genetic background caused by chance and selection in different environments) increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blount et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mahrt et al., 2021</xref>) (For definitions of the forces and their role in the evolution of antibiotic resistance, see <xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>). In the absence of chance and history, selection will cause the most fit genotype to fix in the particular environment, and provided this variant is available, evolution will be perfectly predictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lassig et al., 2017</xref>). However, historical and stochastic processes inevitably produce some degree of contingency, making evolution less predictable, reflecting the importance of evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blount et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajić et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blount et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Card et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galardini et al., 2019</xref>). The evolution of a new trait, whether by horizontally acquired genes or de novo mutation, is a stochastic process that depends on available genetic variation capable of producing a new trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Salverda et al., 2011</xref>). As any other evolved trait, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is subjected to these three evolutionary forces (<xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>).</p><boxed-text id="box1"><label>Box 1.</label><caption><title>Definitions of selection, chance, and history in the evolution of AMR.</title></caption><p>Antibiotics impose strong selective pressures on microbial populations, which can produce highly repeatable outcomes when bacterial population sizes are large and mutations are not limiting. In the absence of chance and history, <bold>selection</bold>, the process by which heritable traits that increase survival and reproduction rise in population frequency, will cause the fixation of the resistant allele associated with the highest fitness in the population, making evolution highly predictable. However, the origin of genetic variation is a stochastic process. <bold>Chance</bold> effects of acquiring a mutation, gene, or mobile element, or changes in the frequencies of these alleles by genetic drift determine whether, by what mechanism, and to what degree, resistance evolves in a given population. Furthermore, the evolutionary <bold>history</bold> of a population can produce contingencies that can make evolution unpredictable. For instance, different genetic backgrounds shaped in different environments can alter the phenotype of a given mutation. History can therefore alter the occurrence, mechanism, degree, and success of antimicrobial resistance.</p><p>Antibiotic treatments usually target advanced infections, which implies medium to large bacterial population sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palaci et al., 2007</xref>). Estimates suggest that a typical antibiotic treatment above the MIC concentration will clear the infection with a probability higher than 99% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paterson et al., 2016</xref>). But some bacterial infections can be established from as few as 10 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al., 2016</xref>), so even small surviving subpopulations could re-infect the host. Thus, we might expect that strong selection imposed by antibiotics acting on large populations would be powerful enough to overwhelm the constraints of history. The large population sizes also might enable many mutations to be accessible in each infection, which would diminish the effects of chance. However, bottlenecks produced by the antibiotic could increase effects of drift and amplify contributions of chance and history. By propagating large populations under sequential bottlenecks, we can reproduce some of the population dynamics of the establishment and clearance of infections, and by applying the framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Travisano et al., 1995</xref>, we can quantify the roles of history, chance, and selection in adaptation to antibiotics.</p></boxed-text><p>Antibiotics can impose strong selection pressure on microbial populations, leading to highly repeatable evolutionary outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vogwill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lukačišinová et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scribner et al., 2020</xref>), with the level of parallelism predicted to depend on the strength of antibiotic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wistrand-Yuen et al., 2018</xref>). However, evolutionary history can also alter the distribution of fitness effects of AMR mutations, their mechanisms of action, or their degree of conferred resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eyre-Walker and Keightley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hall and MacLean, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yen and Papin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbosa et al., 2019</xref>). The phenotypic effect of any given mutation acquired is contingent on prior events and will determine the potential of further adaptations to a given environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Travisano et al., 1995</xref>). For example, the effects of a given mutation can vary in different genetic backgrounds (epistasis) or in different environments (pleiotropy) and those mutations can constrain further adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trindade et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hall and MacLean, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yen and Papin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gifford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santos-Lopez et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, chance differences in the mutations acquired, their order of occurrence, or compensatory mutations that decrease resistance costs can affect the eventual level of resistance and its evolutionary success in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Salverda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wistrand-Yuen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The study of mutational pathways to AMR has become accessible by applying population-wide whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to experimentally evolved populations (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baquero, 2021</xref>). Growth in antibiotics will select for resistant phenotypes whose genotypes can be determined by WGS, and their frequencies and trajectories indicate relative genotype fitness. When large populations, 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mL or higher, of bacteria are propagated, the probability that every base pair is mutated at least once approaches 99% after ~80 generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lynch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santos-Lopez et al., 2019</xref>). Yet chance still remains important because most mutations are initially rare and subject to genetic drift until they reach a critical frequency of establishment, when selection dominates their fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heffernan and Wahl, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Good et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cooper, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, many mutations arise concurrently and those with higher fitness tend to exclude other alleles, known as clonal interference. Thus, the success of new mutations will be determined by their survival of drift, the chance that they co-occur with other fit mutants, and by their relative fitness, which is shaped by selection and history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nguyen Ba et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The contributions of history, chance, and selection to evolution can be measured using an elegant experimental design (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>, and described in detail in the Methods) introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Travisano et al., 1995</xref>, in which replicate populations are propagated from multiple ancestral strains with different evolutionary histories.

In that experiment, which established the history for the present study and is analogous to prior exposure in a clinical setting, three replicate populations each were propagated in biofilm conditions or planktonic conditions (hereafter B1–B3 and P1–P3 respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These environments selected for different genetic pathways to CIP resistance and replicate populations also diverged by chance, which produced the genetic and phenotypic histories of the ancestral strains in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

CAZ or IMI concentrations were doubled every three days (ca. 20 generations), starting with 0.5× minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) for each clone and finishing with 4× MIC, where maximum killing has been observed with β-lactams antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nightingale, 1980</xref>). Each population was therefore exposed to the same selective pressure during evolutionary rescue. In this study design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Supplementary Text), the extent of increased resistance represents selection, effects of chance are the phenotypic variation among triplicate populations propagated from the same ancestor, and differences between populations derived from different ancestors quantifies effects of history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>While the scale of this experiment could seem small, it is well suited for studying the evolution of resistance as 160 generations correspond to ca. 100 days, 15 days, or 170 days of growth in patients of <italic>Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa,</italic> or <italic>Salmonella enterica,</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gibson et al., 2018</xref>).

It is expected that as drug concentrations increase, the strength of selection relative to other forces also increases. We therefore analyzed resistance phenotypes of the whole population after 3 days of evolution under subinhibitory drug concentration and after 12 days of evolution in increasing drug levels that concluded at four times the MIC. We analyzed population-wide resistance instead of measures of single isolates because heterogeneity can determine the success or failure of an antibiotic treatment in clinical scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sánchez-Romero and Casadesús, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dewachter et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We estimated the role of each force as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Travisano et al., 1995</xref>.

We estimated effects of these forces during propagation in two antibiotics, CAZ and IMI, and present results of each treatment sequentially. First, after 3 days of growth in subinhibitory concentrations of CAZ, history explained the largest variation in resistance phenotypes (61.7% of variation, p&lt;0.05), with 30.7% for selection and only 7.6% chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,E</xref>, Materials and methods). As expected, CAZ resistance increased overall, but some individual populations did not differ significantly from their ancestor (populations P2, P3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, by day 12, following propagation in 4× MIC CAZ, the amount of variation explained by selection increased to 47.8% and effects of history dropped to 31.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E</xref>), indicating that strong selective pressures can diminish or erase the effects of history.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effects of history, chance, and selection on the evolution of CAZ or IMI resistance after 3 days at 0.5x MIC.</title><p>(<bold>A, C</bold>) and after 12 days of increasing concentrations (<bold>B, D</bold>).

For example, a history of adaptation to one antibiotic could alter resistance and subsequent evolution in the presence of a subsequent antibiotic. The phenomena of cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity are specific examples of pleiotropy, where the mechanism of resistance to the initial drug either directly increases or decreases resistance to other drugs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pal et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, the resistance mechanism could interact with other genes or alleles in the genome, a form of epistasis, and also promote or impede resistance evolution. We hypothesized that resistance mechanisms arising during selection in CAZ would alter resistance to other antibiotics both by genotype-independent (pleiotropy) and genotype-dependent (epistasis) mechanisms. Recall that during the history phase of the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santos-Lopez et al., 2019</xref>), populations propagated in increasing concentrations of CIP became from 4- to 200-fold more resistant to CIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santos-Lopez et al., 2019</xref>). Some of these strains also became more resistant to CAZ (populations P1–P3), while others became more susceptible (populations B1 and B3, for more details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santos-Lopez et al., 2019</xref>), and given that these populations originated from the same ancestor, this variation in collateral resistance phenotypes is best explained by pleiotropy. In the current study, after 12 days evolving in the presence of CAZ, the grand mean of CIP resistance levels did not change, so history was the dominant force shaping the MIC to CIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, if we analyze the P and the B populations independently, B populations became significantly more sensitive to CIP but the P populations did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), showing that the emergence of collateral sensitivity may depend on prior selection in different environments.

Namely, B-derived populations evolved CAZ resistance at the expense of their prior CIP resistance, reversing this tradeoff. To test whether these results are repeatable and not limited to CAZ and CIP, we replayed the ‘selection phase’ with the same genotypes using the carbapenem IMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santos-Lopez et al., 2019</xref>).

This result demonstrates that mechanisms of IMI resistance also interact with historical resistance to CIP and produce tradeoffs.

In our experimental system, assuming a conservative uniform distribution of mutation rate of 10<sup>–3</sup>/genome/generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lynch et al., 2016</xref>), each base pair experiences approximately three mutations on average during the 12 days of serial transfers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santos-Lopez et al., 2019</xref>). This estimate implies that reversion mutations affecting historical CIP resistance did occur amidst billions of cell divisions, but nonetheless they are expected be much rarer than suppressor mutations in other genes. Surprisingly, we identified genetic reversion of <italic>adeL</italic> mutations five different times in CAZ lines and three different times in IMI lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, respectively), and these back-mutations reversed resistance tradeoffs between β-lactams and CIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref> for CAZ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref> for IMI). We also observed genetic reversion of <italic>parC</italic> mutations in each P3 replicate propagated in CAZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The topoisomerase IV <italic>parC</italic> is one of the canonical targets of CIP but these mutations have been shown to incur a high fitness cost in the absence of CIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kugelberg et al., 2005</xref>). Selection in the presence of CAZ or IMI therefore favored these reversions in the absence of CIP, but in this case without notable loss of CIP resistance presumably via secondary mutations in <italic>pgpB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santos-Lopez et al., 2019</xref>). It can be argued that we propagated polygenic colonies bearing the resistant genotype and the sensitive genotype at very low frequencies but undetectable by our analysis methods. For example, we detected standing genetic variation in <italic>adeL</italic> in the B2 ancestral clone that could explain the reversion to the sensitive genotype. However, with a depth of ca. 300× coverage, we did not detect any low frequent variants either in B3 or P3 that could explain the reversions. To test the unlikely possibility that the sensitive allele was present in the ancestral clone, we re-isolated the P3 ancestral clone, selected a single clone, and propagated it again in increasing concentrations of CAZ. By re-plating the ancestral clone , we reduced the possibility that the sensitive allele was present at low frequencies in the new selected clone.

The evolution and spread of AMR provide a test of this hypothesis because countless evolution experiments are initiated each day with each new prescription to combat infections caused by bacteria with different histories.

If we consider that the established history of these experimental populations is shallow – the result of only 80 prior generations of growth in a different antibiotic that selected between one and three mutations – it is remarkable how deeply these genotypes were imprinted, resulting in divergent evolutionary trajectories under stringent selection in new drugs. Our data also suggest that, as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teotonio and Rose, 2000</xref>), viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bedhomme et al., 2013</xref>) and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rebolleda-Gomez and Travisano, 2019</xref>), history and chance may determine the reversibility of acquired traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Evolutionary history and natural selection determine the evolution of antibiotic resistance.</title><p>A sensitive population (left panel) is subjected to two successive treatments (antibiotic A and antibiotic B, middle and right panels respectively).

Finally, our data reveals that evolution of AMR follows a clear diminishing return pattern, where antibiotic pressure selects for mutations with progressively smaller phenotypic effects as the population is treated with higher antibiotic concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result mirrors findings in the original Travisano et al. paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Travisano et al., 1995</xref>), where populations that were pre-adapted to compete well in maltose did not adapt further, but populations with major deficiencies in maltose evolved to become just as fit. This result may be instructive for AMR management: on the one hand, more resistant populations at the outset did not increase this phenotype further, but on the other hand, more susceptible lines rapidly compensated for this deficit.</p><p>Our experiment was performed in planktonic cultures and was limited to a sensitive strain of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> treated with a single fluoroquinolone followed by one of two β-lactam drugs. These were deliberate experimental design choices that allowed careful assessment of the evolutionary forces at play in a rapidly evolving population but may be considered limitations for some broader applications. Despite these limitations, our finding that history and chance are ancillary forces compared to the strength of selection imposed by antibiotics is universal and is well supported by the literature. For instance, exposure to fluroquinolones in Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria commonly selects for mutations in <italic>gyrA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seward and Towner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weigel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hooper and Jacoby, 2015</xref>). However, we also observed that history and chance can play important roles in resistance evolution in certain specific environments. For example, the reversions in <italic>adeL</italic> are probably lifestyle dependent and would not be expected to occur if we replay the experiment in the biofilm lifestyle instead of planktonic.</p><p>Finally, our experiment focuses solely on de novo mutations and does not allow the opportunity for horizontal gene transfer from other species or strains, which is the principal mechanism of the emergence of AMRs in most clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">MacLean and San Millan, 2019</xref>). However, genetic background also affects the fitness of transmissible elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso-del Valle et al., 2021</xref>) and epidemiological data indicate that evolutionary history constrains the persistence of resistance mediated by plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">León-Sampedro et al., 2021</xref>). The framework defined here illustrates the potential to identify genetic and environmental conditions where selection is the most dominant evolutionary force and it predictably produces antagonism between resistance traits. With ever greater knowledge of the present state, we gain hope for guiding the future to exploit the past.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Summary of experimental design</title><p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Travisano et al., 1995</xref>, consider replicate populations founded by a single clone that are propagated in the same environment for a certain number of generations. We can dissect the roles of each evolutionary force by measuring changes in the mean and variance of an important trait (e.g., fitness or antibiotic resistance) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the first scenario, the mean and variance of the studied trait did not change, so one can conclude that the trait did not evolve (Top left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the second scenario, while the grand mean of the trait remains the same as the ancestral value, trait variance increases (top middle panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Here, the main evolutionary force is chance, comprised of mutation and genetic drift. In the third scenario, the grand trait mean increases significantly, but not the variance (top right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), a change that is best explained by natural selection. Combining these two forces of chance and natural selection, we would expect both trait mean and variance to increase (bottom left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Note that these four scenarios describe outcomes when starting from a single clone, that is with no genetic variation, but this rarely happens in nature. If we conduct the same experiment using different ancestors that vary in the studied trait, two additional scenarios are possible. In the first, the initial variation among the different ancestors is erased by chance and adaptation (bottom middle panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which cause the trait variance and mean to increase to identical values, regardless of the ancestral value. In the last scenario, the effect of history constrains the evolution of the trait, where the final trait value correlates with the ancestral value (bottom right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) despite contributions of both chance (increased variance) and selection increasing the trait.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental evolution</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Historical phase</title><p>Before the start of the antibiotic evolution experiment, we planktonically propagated one clone of the susceptible <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strain ATCC 17978-mf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) in a modified M9 medium (referred to as M9<sup>+</sup>) containing 0.37 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 8.7 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 42.2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 22 mM KH2PO<sub>4</sub>, 21.7 mM NaCl, 18.7 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, and 0.2 g/L glucose and supplemented with 20 mL/L MEM essential amino acids (Gibco 11130051), 10 mL/L MEM nonessential amino acids (Gibco 11140050), and 10 mL each of trace mineral solutions A, B, and C (Corning 25021–3 Cl).

If multiple mutations in a given gene were present in a population, the frequency of mutated alleles was the sum of the frequencies of all mutated alleles in that gene. This assumes that each mutation occurred on a different genetic background.</p><p>The genotypic role of chance was calculated as half the mean d<sub>M</sub> between all pairs of evolved populations founded from the same ancestral clone. The genotypic role of history was calculated as half the mean d<sub>M</sub> between all pairs of evolved populations founded from the different ancestral clones minus the role of chance. The genotypic role of selection was calculated as the mean d<sub>M</sub> between evolved populations and their founding clone, minus the roles of chance and history. In comparing the role of the different forces, we accounted for the fact that chance and history are calculated as the distance between two evolved populations, whereas selection is calculated as the distance between ancestral and evolved populations, by defining the roles of chance and history as half the mean d<sub>M.</sub> In calculating selection, mutations present in the founding clone were not excluded when subtracting the effect of history.</p><p>To analyze the role of each force, it is important to note some limitations of the study. First, the analysis of the forces makes no assumption about the linearity or additivity of their effects. Phenotypic variation between populations is simply partitioned between three possible pools: differences between ancestral and evolved populations (selection), differences between evolved populations with different ancestors (history), and differences between evolved populations with the same ancestor (chance). For the genotypic metric, the same logic applies and differences in the frequencies of mutations are attributed to the same three pools. Where non-additive effects become important to consider is in interpreting the differences between the phenotypic and genotypic metrics. The contributions of the forces at the genotypic and phenotypic levels would be the same if every mutation that arose had an equal effect on the phenotype (or at least that the frequency of each mutation in the population was proportional to its phenotype) and phenotypic effects were additive, with no epistasis. The greater the deviation from those assumptions, the greater the differences will be between the genotypic and phenotypic roles of history, chance, and selection. Second, while the three forces play ongoing roles during evolution, it is important to note that the moment when we analyze their role has been arbitrarily selected. For instance, historical effects are cumulative and every moment in the course of evolution may be contingent on previous historical adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Travisano et al., 1995</xref>). Here, we analyze how evolution in two lifestyles, planktonic and biofilm, challenged by one antibiotic, CIP, influences further adaptation to a second antibiotic, CAZ or IMI. Therefore, we consider evolutionary history to any adaptation occurred before exposure to CAZ or IMI, and we measured the role of the forces at only two timepoints: after 3 or 12 days exposing the populations to the antibiotic.</p><p>All statistical comparisons of MIC values were performed on the log<sub>2</sub> transformed values. Differences in grand means between populations were analyzed by a one-way nested ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison tests or by a nested t-test. Spearman correlation was performed using the grand means to determine the correlation between the ancestral MIC and the fold change of MIC acquired during the experiment. There are three possible outcomes by correlating the original MIC and the fold dilution change: (1) a negative correlation, in which the populations with lower initial MICs increased their resistance level more than populations with higher MICs, implies that the selection erased the previous effects of history; (2) a positive correlation indicates that initial differences in MIC were magnified by selection; and (3) a lack of correlation indicates that the effect of history did not change before and after selection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data processing</title><p>The variants were called using the breseq software v0.31.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrick et al., 2014</xref>) using the default parameters and the -p flag when required for identifying polymorphisms in populations after all sequences were first quality filtered and trimmed with the Trimmomatic software v0.36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>) using the criteria: LEADING:20 TRAILING:20 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:70.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This work uses an elegant and well-designed experimental evolution strategy to investigate the roles of history, chance, and selection on the evolution of antibiotic resistance in the clinical pathogen <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>. The authors show that while history impacts the evolution of antimicrobial resistance, this effect decreases with increasing drug selection strength and indicates that natural selection is a dominant driver. The work presents clear, unambiguous data on the importance of antibiotic exposure on the evolution of resistance.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The roles of history, chance, and natural selection in the evolution of antibiotic resistance&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alan McNally (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the work addresses a very relevant and interesting question, the reviewers raised some concerns that need to be addressed in order to improve the manuscript. Additional experimental details should be included, and clarification is needed regarding some of the concepts used. More importantly, the limitations of the approach need to be specifically addressed and some of the claims and interpretations should be toned down, particularly given the absence of a drug-free control.</p><p>1) A main concern is in the interpretation of populations having the same genetics but different phenotypes (eg lines 300-310) – this conclusion is wrong given the experimental design. The authors provide several explanations but leave out a high likelihood alternative which is that different experiments consist of mixed populations with diverse genetic makeups. Alternatively, if the authors meant instead to focus on specific mutations (ie same mutations/localized mutations) regardless of the background, then this conclusion is trivial – it is known that pleiotropy exists.</p><p>2) I agree with the author's definitions of change due to history vs change due to selection given the evolution they designed – and I found this quite innovative and overall strong. However, the definition and calculations of evolution due to chance here are shaky given the three replicates only. There are plenty of extremely rigorous estimates of genetic drift during bacterial evolution (see all of Lenski's work) – three populations is quite small to make that claim and run the statistics. Including chance as a possible contributor didn't add much to the story, and it raised more questions than answers given the extremely diverse genetics that were observed, and that data of the mixed populations below 75% was not included.</p><p>3) Experiments are flawed without a no drug control. Was the reversion of CIP resistance specific to the new drug selection, or is it simply the lack of CIP pressure? This is important as the authors make claims about drug-specific evolutionary tradeoffs and collateral sensitivity. The methods in line 428: &quot;We froze 1 mL of the control populations on days…&quot; but this is the only place a control population is mentioned.</p><p>4) Much of the data was difficult to follow, such as the fold changes for MICs – for example, following the discussion of CIP resistance, maintenance, and reversion was nearly impossible with the reference to figure 4 fold changes only. Also going back and forth between IMI and CAZ, which is discussed in parallel near the beginning, but then broken down later on, is another example.</p><p>5) Key experimental details are missing. What volume were the populations propagated in? Population experiments were not well described – how were replicate MICs initiated? How much volume was used for sequencing? So on and so forth. These are particularly important to interpret the results.</p><p>6) Why was a 75% threshold used to determine alleles if the populations were sequenced to a level of 5%?</p><p>7) Despite being described in great detail in the methods, it doesn't come across to non-modeler such as myself exactly how selection, history, and chance were quantified in the phenotypic experiments shown in figure 2. I am a bit clearer as to how these were quantified for the genomic data. However, I think a broad readership may benefit from a layman's description of how these were differentiated. It is vital to the science and data shown and I would certainly have appreciated a clarification, especially for the phenotypic data in figure 2.</p><p>8) In line 307. In the absence of bacterial genetic experiments to confirm that these historical infections are actually driving the 4 fold differences in phenotype, I think this inference needs to be toned down.</p><p>9) Line 343: Is there a benefit to be had of fitness experiments in antibiotic-free medium to confirm the supposition made here?</p><p>10) In some cases, I found the framing of the results in terms of history, chance, and selection to be a bit overly general, which sometimes obscured the specific results being reported. The paper could be improved by using more specific language-perhaps restricted in scope- in describing and interpreting the results, both because 1) it's not obvious to me that the results would apply generally to antibiotic resistance beyond the very nice, but potentially system-specific, results presented here; and 2) the terms themselves (history, chance, selection) could conceivably have different meanings in different contexts (more on this below).</p><p>11) The study design has been used in numerous previous studies; it is well established, elegant, and has given rise to many new insights. However, as I understand it, there are some inherent assumptions of the approach that should be briefly discussed. Most notably, does the approach inherently assume that the effects of history, chance, and selection are additive (or perhaps linear) in some sense (in terms of phenotypic variance measurements or the Manhattan-based genotype metric)? While this simplifying assumption seems critical to the power of the approach, it is not clear to me that this assumption holds in general. When I try to think of this in terms of, say, a simple population dynamics model, the terms history, chance and selection are themselves somewhat nebulous, and it's not clear to me that they could be unambiguously and uniquely defined even in simplified theoretical models (or more directly, that the variance-based phenotype measures correspond to well-defined features or parameters of population dynamics models). I say this not to criticize the approach-again, its power lies in the simplicity of the design and the intuitive value of separating these three evolutionary features and attempting to quantify their contributions. But I think the article could be strengthened by briefly discussing the underlying assumptions-ideally by pointing to previous work (if it exists) that establishes that the features are additive and measurable in the sense required by the experimental design. If not, I think it would be worth discussing that limitation briefly, as I worry the inherently nonlinear nature of these very complicated, evolving systems could lead us to misinterpret the results. Given the general success of similar approaches in past work, I suspect the authors have thought through these issues in detail; discussing those points might open the paper to a broader audience not intimately familiar with all the previous studies.</p><p>12) One example related (but not identical to) the point above: in the current experiment, the role of history is defined in terms of previous selection conditions (drug and growth phase). But the new evolution experiment itself has multiple time points, and even qualitatively distinct epochs (sub- and super-MIC drug). So one might argue that history is playing a role continuously throughout the experiment-history not merely of the previous selection in fluoroquinolones, but also history of the previous time points / epochs of the new evolution (β-lactams). My point is that it is important to clearly define the terms at all stages and discuss, at least briefly, the limitations of the definitions that are chosen.</p><p>13) While history, chance, and selection are quantified at both the genetic and phenotype level, it's not clear to me that these numbers can be directly compared to one another (though it's tempting to do so!). Could the authors briefly comment on the connection between these measures-that is, when (and to what extent) one would expect correlations between them (e.g. high levels of historical influence at the genetic level leads to high levels of historical influence at the phenotype (MIC) level….assuming the definitions used here).</p><p>14) Do the authors have any thoughts on how the results might be affected by the fact that the new evolution experiments take place in planktonic (rather than biofilm) conditions? How might the results differ if they had been performed in biofilm, and what could you learn from the fully symmetric experiment (P/ B initial strains evolved in both P and B new selection conditions). The authors may wish to discuss this avenue for future work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70676.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the work addresses a very relevant and interesting question, the reviewers raised some concerns that need to be addressed in order to improve the manuscript.

However, we are not analyzing the effect of chance in just three replicates, but rather in 3 replicates of 6 ancestors in two independent experiments. In fact, both the genotype and the phenotype results show that most of the replicates started from a single ancestor followed a unique evolutionary trajectory, highlighting the importance of chance in our experiment. Chance is one of the principal forces determining variance in evolution. In the absence of chance, evolution from a single genotype will lead to the fixation of the most fit genotype in every experiment. We only detect 3 events of parallel evolution at the nucleotide level in replicates coming from the same ancestor (B3 and P2 in CAZ, and P1 in IMI) but each of those populations acquired unique mutations during the experiment. The fact that we don’t detect the same evolutionary trajectories in the replicates from a given ancestor -- a result that would be expected in the absence of chance -- shows that the experimental setup is able to detect the effects of chance in the evolution of AMR.</p><p>Once we acknowledge that the role of chance can be detected in our experiment and knowing that the number of replicates is limited, we decided to assess the statistical evidence of each force by means of a Bayesian approach, which works particularly well when sample sizes are small and exhibits some advantages over frequentist methods (Wagenmakers, 2007). Specifically, for a given force we computed the Bayes factor that results from comparing the regression model excluding that force against the full model that includes all three forces. This approach enables assessment of how powerful the included force is with respect to its absence according to the observed data. In the case of chance, the support for its inclusion was very strong in most scenarios. On the other hand, an alternative, traditional analysis using bootstrap showed that the contribution of chance was statistically different to the contribution of history in most of the cases analyzed (Figures 2E and 3E).</p><p>Finally, we would like to clarify that we have included in our analysis the data of all mutations detected above 5% of frequency. Please also see point #6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Experiments are flawed without a no drug control.

With our experimental setup, we can conclude only that the reversions were produced in planktonic conditions, in the presence of CAZ or IMI and in the absence of CIP. We have clarified this in the text (Line 370).</p><p>We understand that the reversions were produced when the populations were exposed to CAZ or IMI, and whether they also happen in the absence of the antibiotic is beyond the scope of the paper. See Dunai et al., eLife 2019, a brilliant example where genotypic reversions in antibiotic-free environments were analyzed.</p><p>We did not find it necessary to propagate all six clones in triplicates in the absence of CIP to analyze the role of the evolutionary forces during evolution in a new antibiotic. However, we valued the need for a drug-free control of the overall experiment. Therefore, we propagated control populations of the original ancestor in the absence of antibiotic for 12 days. Two replicates were sequenced and the two intergenic mutations observed in the control populations were subtracted from the propagated lines in the presence of CAZ or IMI. We apologize for this confusion and we have clarified it (Lines 484, 501).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Much of the data was difficult to follow, such as the fold changes for MICs – for example, following the discussion of CIP resistance, maintenance, and reversion was nearly impossible with the reference to figure 4 fold changes only.

We apologize for the confusion, and to improve the clarity of the manuscript, we have referenced the text and figure 4 (Lines 322, 365, 367 and 372). In addition, to facilitate the reading of the paper, we have outlined which sections describe results from the CAZ evolution and which section describes IMI results (Lines 173-176). We believe that describing both experiments together was more challenging to follow and decided to split them in two parts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Key experimental details are missing.

We only used a 75% threshold to represent the mutations in Figure 4. We decided to show just mutations with &gt;75% of frequency for clarity in the figure. All mutations detected in the experiment can be found in Table S3. Importantly, for all the analyses, including the estimations of the forces at the genotypic level, all observed mutations were used (Lines 264-265). We have clarified this in the methods section (Lines 547-548).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Despite being described in great detail in the methods, it doesn't come across to non-modeler such as myself exactly how selection, history, and chance were quantified in the phenotypic experiments shown in figure 2.

Therefore, we have toned down the conclusion (Lines 325 – 336).

We do not believe that fitness experiments in antibiotic-free medium confirm the supposition made in the line 343. Evolution experiments can be viewed as optimum competition experiments. Arguably, these designs are the best experiments to test the fitness of a given genotype, as the genotype of interest is competing not only against one strain like in pairwise competitions, but with all other contending mutations that arise each generation. The high level of parallelism found is the best indicator that the reversions are adaptive in those propagated populations.</p><p>We do not know if the reversions produce any benefit in the absence of antibiotics, and whether the reversions are beneficial in the absence of CAZ or IMI is trivial for this experimental setup, as those genotypes were selected in the presence of CAZ or IMI. However, we can confirm that those reversions were adaptive in planktonic conditions, in the absence of CIP, and in the presence of CAZ/IMI.</p><p>We have clarified that the reversed mutations initially imposed a fitness cost in presence of CAZ or IMI and in the absence of CIP (Line 388).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In some cases, I found the framing of the results in terms of history, chance, and selection to be a bit overly general, which sometimes obscured the specific results being reported. The paper could be improved by using more specific language-perhaps restricted in scope- in describing and interpreting the results, both because 1) it's not obvious to me that the results would apply generally to antibiotic resistance beyond the very nice, but potentially system-specific, results presented here; and 2) the terms themselves (history, chance, selection) could conceivably have different meanings in different contexts (more on this below).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, we better acknowledge these limitations. We have included a paragraph discussing the generality of our results in the discussion (Lines 437-450), and we have included a paragraph analyzing the assumptions done to analyze the forces (Lines 570-591). Also, see responses to #11, #12 and #13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The study design has been used in numerous previous studies; it is well established, elegant, and has given rise to many new insights. However, as I understand it, there are some inherent assumptions of the approach that should be briefly discussed. Most notably, does the approach inherently assume that the effects of history, chance, and selection are additive (or perhaps linear) in some sense (in terms of phenotypic variance measurements or the Manhattan-based genotype metric)? While this simplifying assumption seems critical to the power of the approach, it is not clear to me that this assumption holds in general. When I try to think of this in terms of, say, a simple population dynamics model, the terms history, chance and selection are themselves somewhat nebulous, and it's not clear to me that they could be unambiguously and uniquely defined even in simplified theoretical models (or more directly, that the variance-based phenotype measures correspond to well-defined features or parameters of population dynamics models). I say this not to criticize the approach-again, its power lies in the simplicity of the design and the intuitive value of separating these three evolutionary features and attempting to quantify their contributions. But I think the article could be strengthened by briefly discussing the underlying assumptions-ideally by pointing to previous work (if it exists) that establishes that the features are additive and measurable in the sense required by the experimental design. If not, I think it would be worth discussing that limitation briefly, as I worry the inherently nonlinear nature of these very complicated, evolving systems could lead us to misinterpret the results. Given the general success of similar approaches in past work, I suspect the authors have thought through these issues in detail; discussing those points might open the paper to a broader audience not intimately familiar with all the previous studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this thoughtful comment. To clarify, the history, chance, and adaptation study design itself does not make an assumption about the linearity or additivity of effects. The only linear assumption adopted in this study was through the use of a nested linear mixed model to estimate the forces in the phenotypic case. We opted to use such a model for its simplicity. Using more complex models that could account for non-linear effects, while being promising direction, was beyond the scope of the study.</p><p>Briefly, in the case of phenotypic variation, variation between populations is simply partitioned between three possible pools: (i) differences between ancestral and evolved populations (selection), (ii) differences between evolved populations with different ancestors (history) and (iii) differences between evolved populations with the same ancestor (chance). For genotypic variation, the same logic applies, using differences in the frequencies of mutations attributed to the same three pools. Where non-additive effects become important to consider is in interpreting the differences between the phenotypic and genotypic metrics, which we discuss further below (see #13). We added discussion of these assumptions in Lines 591-613.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) One example related (but not identical to) the point above: in the current experiment, the role of history is defined in terms of previous selection conditions (drug and growth phase). But the new evolution experiment itself has multiple time points, and even qualitatively distinct epochs (sub- and super-MIC drug). So one might argue that history is playing a role continuously throughout the experiment-history not merely of the previous selection in fluoroquinolones, but also history of the previous time points / epochs of the new evolution (β-lactams). My point is that it is important to clearly define the terms at all stages and discuss, at least briefly, the limitations of the definitions that are chosen.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that history is playing a continuous role during the experiment. According to Travisano, (Travisano et al., 1995) “the set of potential adaptations is severely limited to inherited constitution, so that at every moment the course of evolution is contingent on prior (historical) events”. We now acknowledge this more clearly that history plays a continuous role in lines 71-74 and 606-613.</p><p>For example, the mutations acquired at day 1 on the experiment arose by chance, were selected for in presence of CAZ or IMI, with a crucial importance of the previous evolutionary history, i.e. evolution in presence of CIP. If we jump, for example, to day 3, the previous mutations acquired on day 1 are right now historical mutations. We can apply this logic to any combination possible: mutations on day 2 are historical mutations if you analyze their evolutionary consequences at day 4, 5, 6… It just depends on the question that you want to answer. What we are asking here is how the previous exposure to an antibiotic X in lifestyles A and B, influences the further adaptation to an antibiotic Y. Therefore, we arbitrarily chose that everything happened before the exposure to the second antibiotic was just evolutionary history.</p><p>Analyzing the literature, most of the experiments following the Travisano design chose arbitrarily what they consider evolutionary history and from when they consider selection + chance (this even varies somewhat in the original article). Then, the roles of the forces are analyzed at the end of the experiment. However, there is an elegant paper from Rebolleda-Gomez and Travisano, where they analyze the contribution of the three forces periodically during their whole experimental evolution and not just at the end of the experiment (Rebolleda-Gomez and Travisano, Evolution 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) While history, chance, and selection are quantified at both the genetic and phenotype level, it's not clear to me that these numbers can be directly compared to one another (though it's tempting to do so!). Could the authors briefly comment on the connection between these measures-that is, when (and to what extent) one would expect correlations between them (e.g. high levels of historical influence at the genetic level leads to high levels of historical influence at the phenotype (MIC) level….assuming the definitions used here).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. The contributions of history, chance, and selection at the genotypic and phenotypic levels would be same if every mutation that arose had an equal effect on the phenotype (or at least that the frequency of each mutation in the population was proportional to its phenotype) and phenotypic effects were additive, with no epistasis. The greater the deviation from those assumptions, the greater the differences will be between the genotypic and phenotypic roles of history, chance and selection. However, the differences between genotypic and phenotypic contributions may suggest additional information about the evolutionary system. In our results, the differences between the genotypic and phenotypic analyses were modest, suggesting relatively small deviations from these assumptions. The largest distinction was that in imipemen-selected populations, history contributed about 45% of genetic variation (Figure 4), but only about 33% of variation in imipenem resistance. This indicates that the mutations contributing to history, those in which parallel changes were observed in populations derived from the same ancestor, had a smaller effect on imipenem resistance than mutations associated with other categories. Interestingly, the “historical mutations” in these populations occurred most often in populations with ancestors previously evolved under biofilm conditions, implying constraining effects of this prior environment. It may be that some of these mutations were adaptations to the return to a planktonic environment, rather than to antibiotic selection. We further explain the connection between the phenotypic and the genotypic metrics in the methods (Lines 570-585).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Do the authors have any thoughts on how the results might be affected by the fact that the new evolution experiments take place in planktonic (rather than biofilm) conditions? How might the results differ if they had been performed in biofilm, and what could you learn from the fully symmetric experiment (P/ B initial strains evolved in both P and B new selection conditions). The authors may wish to discuss this avenue for future work.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. This is an interesting question, and we have asked this question ourselves too. We decided to run the experiment planktonically for one reason: after the CIP exposition, planktonic populations showed cross resistance to CAZ via mutations in adeJ and biofilm populations showed collateral sensitivity to CAZ via mutations in adeL. We believed that mutations in adeL had the potential to constrain evolution in CAZ while mutations in adeJ would be selected for. In fact, we detect mutations in adeB, which is regulated by adeJ.</p><p>We believe that the general take home message of the paper would be the same: selection is unsurprisingly the predominant force in the evolution of AMR and produced convergent evolution even at the nucleotide level in some instances. Yet history and chance play clear and important roles in the emergence of new resistance phenotypes, and possibly more so in biofilm. However, we argue that the reversions probably are lifestyle dependent, and therefore the likelihood of detecting the same reversions is low if we replayed the experiment in biofilm.</p><p>We have included this discussion in the manuscript (Lines 437-450).</p></body></sub-article></article>
