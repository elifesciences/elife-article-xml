Planarians are capable of whole-body regeneration and mount distinct molecular responses to wounds that result in tissue absence and those that do not. A major question is how these distinct responses are activated. We describe a follistatin homolog (<italic>Smed-follistatin</italic>) required for planarian regeneration. <italic>Smed-follistatin</italic> inhibition blocks responses to tissue absence but does not prevent normal tissue turnover. Two activin homologs (<italic>Smed-activin-1</italic> and <italic>Smed-activin-2</italic>) are required for the <italic>Smed-follistatin</italic> phenotype. Finally, <italic>Smed-follistatin</italic> is wound-induced and expressed at higher levels following injuries that cause tissue absence. These data suggest that Smed-follistatin inhibits Smed-Activin proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue absence and identify a mechanism critical for regeneration initiation, a process important across the animal kingdom.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00247.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00247.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00247.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most animals can respond to injury with some form of tissue regeneration. In mammals, this is limited to wound healing, whereas other vertebrates—such as salamanders and zebrafish—can regenerate parts of internal organs and even entire appendages. The planarian, a flatworm, is even more remarkable, being able to regenerate its head or tail following amputation, and even a whole animal from just a small body fragment. This is particularly impressive given that planarians have a complex internal anatomy, which includes muscles, intestines, a system similar to kidneys, and a central nervous system with a brain.</p><p>How is such regeneration accomplished? Why are planarians able to regenerate their bodies so extensively, whereas humans cannot? To what extent are the mechanisms of planarian regeneration common to other animals? These questions have driven the study of planarian regeneration for more than a century, but it is only in recent years that the tools needed to address these questions at the molecular level have become available.</p><p>Planarian regeneration proceeds over several days and involves multiple processes, including gene expression, cell division and cell death. Importantly, it has recently been shown that planarians activate different responses depending on whether an injury results in significant tissue loss—and therefore requires regeneration for repair—or if simple wound healing will be sufficient. The mechanisms behind these different responses to injury have, however, remained a mystery.</p><p>Now, Gaviño et al. have identified a key mechanism in the initiation of regeneration following tissue loss. This is centered on the gene <italic>follistatin</italic>, which is expressed following wounding. When genetic techniques are used to disrupt the expression of <italic>follistatin</italic>, regeneration is completely blocked. However, the animal’s ability to routinely replace old cells via a stem-cell mediated mechanism is unaffected. This indicates that <italic>follistatin</italic> is specifically required for the replacement of cells lost through injury. Gaviño et al. further demonstrate that the protein encoded by <italic>follistatin</italic> likely initiates tissue regeneration upon substantial tissue loss through inhibition of proteins called Activins.</p><p>Activin and Follistatin proteins are broadly conserved in evolution, and are also expressed in mammals, raising the possibility that similar molecular circuits may govern regenerative responses in many species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00247.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00247.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>planarian regeneration</kwd><kwd>wound signaling</kwd><kwd>Follistatin</kwd><kwd>Activin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM080639</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reddien</surname><given-names>Peter W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reddien</surname><given-names>Peter W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Keck Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reddien</surname><given-names>Peter W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Flatworm regeneration of lost tissue relies on a mechanism distinct from that used for routine tissue turnover.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regeneration occurs in widespread contexts and species. Invertebrates such as <italic>Hydra</italic> are capable of whole-animal regeneration from tissue fragments, and many vertebrates can regenerate appendages or repair damaged organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>). Despite this widespread relevance, the central mechanisms that drive regeneration are poorly understood.</p><p>Planarians are flatworms capable of regeneration following an almost limitless variety of injuries and have emerged as a powerful model for exploring the molecular underpinnings of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2002</xref>). New tissues are formed at planarian wound sites in a process called blastema formation, and pre-existing tissues are reorganized after amputation to accommodate reduced animal size and further generate missing tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Morgan, 1901</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004</xref>). The source of regenerated tissue in planarians is a population of adult dividing cells called neoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004</xref>), which include pluripotent stem cells called clonogenic neoblasts (cNeoblasts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). Neoblasts are the only somatic cycling cells in adult animals and can be specifically ablated by gamma irradiation, allowing for dissection of the requirements for neoblasts in regenerative processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004</xref>). Recent work has described the earliest molecular and cellular events that occur following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pellettieri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sandmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>). One finding to emerge from this work is that animals initiate distinct cellular and molecular responses to ‘major injuries’ that remove significant amounts of tissue (e.g., head amputation) and to ‘simple injuries’ that require only minimal healing for repair (wounds that do not elicit blastema formation, such as punctures or incisions). Following simple injury, for example, animals display an increase in mitotic numbers 6 hr after injury before returning to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>), and expression of numerous wound-induced genes becomes undetectable by 24 hr after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>). Following a major injury, these same initial responses are observed, but subsequent responses are also activated: the 6 hr increase in mitotic numbers is followed by a second increase 48 hr after amputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>), and wound-induced gene expression persists beyond 24 hr and is refined over several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>). These responses are referred to as the ‘missing-tissue response’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>). How animals distinguish between injuries involving varying amounts of tissue loss and regulate these distinct wound response programs remains unknown.</p><p>We identified <italic>Smed-follistatin</italic> as required for molecular and cellular ‘missing-tissue’ responses during regeneration. Specifically, Follistatin-mediated inhibition of Activin signaling is required for regeneration to occur, with <italic>Smed-follistatin</italic> expression at wounds controlled by the extent of tissue absence following injury. These results suggest a mechanism by which regenerative responses can be initiated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Smed-follistatin</italic> is a wound-induced gene required for regeneration</title><p>To identify genes mediating regeneration-specific wound responses, we inhibited recently identified wound-induced genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>) with RNA interference (RNAi).

Some aspects of this process do not require blastema formation. For example, <italic>wntP-2</italic> (also known as <italic>wnt11-5</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Gurley et al., 2010</xref>]) is normally expressed in planarian tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Petersen and Reddien, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Gurley et al., 2010</xref>) and its expression domain restricts posteriorly within 48 hr of amputation whether regeneration proceeds or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Gurley et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>fst(RNAi)</italic> animals did not rescale the <italic>wntP-2</italic> expression domain 48 hr following amputation, further supporting a model in which <italic>fst</italic> is required for responding to missing tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Planarians are an exceptional example of the regenerative potential of animals. Distinct cellular and molecular programs for responding to simple injury vs missing tissue exist in planarians. In the case of injuries involving substantial missing tissue, animals mount unique mitotic and apoptotic responses and produce an extended program of wound-induced gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pellettieri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>). These events represent the earliest described divergent behaviors following major injuries requiring regeneration vs simple injuries requiring only wound healing. A central question has therefore become how these distinct responses are mediated.</p><p>We identified a gene encoding a homolog of the TGF-β inhibitor, <italic>follistatin</italic>, that is required for regeneration and for regeneration-specific cellular and molecular responses to injury. Our data suggest that inhibition of Activin signaling by Fst is required for initiating a regenerative response at wounds following major injury. Finally, <italic>fst</italic> is wound-induced, with the level of <italic>fst</italic> expression persisting at high levels longer following a major injury than following a simple injury. We propose that wound-induced <italic>fst</italic> expression allows for regenerative responses to be initiated specifically as a consequence of tissue absence.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The nature of the planarian missing-tissue response</title><p><italic>fst</italic> is the first gene known to be required for regeneration-specific responses in planarians. Not all missing-tissue responses are abolished following <italic>fst</italic> inhibition, however. For example, neoblast migration to amputation sites occurred normally in <italic>fst(RNAi)</italic> animals, despite the absence of a normal proliferative response. Similarly, although expression of <italic>act-1</italic> and <italic>act-2</italic> are required for the <italic>fst(RNAi)</italic> phenotype, inhibition of <italic>activin</italic> expression in the absence of amputation does not affect homeostatic tissue turnover or induce a regeneration-like state, demonstrating that the suppression of Activin alone is not sufficient to induce missing-tissue responses. Therefore, some aspects of the missing-tissue response to injury require an as yet unknown ‘missing-tissue’ signal or signals that operate independently of <italic>fst</italic> and Activin signaling. Identifying and characterizing these processes will be important for understanding how the decision to mount a regenerative response occurs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>TGF-β signaling across regenerative contexts</title><p>Our findings describe a system in which suppression of Activin signaling is required for regeneration. The possibility therefore exists that Activin signaling may serve similar functions in other organisms. Indeed, TGF-β signaling has been implicated as a negative regulator of regeneration in a variety of contexts, including following partial hepatectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Russell et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kogure et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Romero-Gallo et al., 2005</xref>), in embryonic chick retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sakami et al., 2008</xref>), in renal regeneration following ischemia/reperfusion injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kojima et al., 2001</xref>), and for mouse skeletal muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). Given the relevance of these systems to human medicine, it will be important to investigate to what extent regenerative regimes recapitulate the mechanisms observed in planarians. Interestingly, a number of systems use TGF-β signaling to promote rather than suppress regeneration: TGF-β signaling is involved in axolotl limb and <italic>Xenopus</italic> tail regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lévesque et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ho and Whitman, 2008</xref>), <italic>activin</italic> expression can be induced by wounding and exogenous TGF-β can speed healing in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mustoe et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hübner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sulyok et al., 2004</xref>), TGF-β signaling can promote regeneration following mouse ear hole-punching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), and wound-induced <italic>activin</italic> promotes cell proliferation and migration following zebrafish fin amputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Jaźwińska et al., 2007</xref>). Despite these contextual differences, TGF-β signaling plays a major role in many forms of regeneration studied. Therefore, uncovering ‘missing-tissue’ signals in planarians, describing how these signals interact with Activin signaling, and identifying the key factors regulated by these signals will inform a broad understanding of core regenerative mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Gene cloning</title><p>For RNA probes, genes were cloned into pGEM and amplified with T7-promoter-containing primers.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Marianne Bronner, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports. Our goal is to provide the essential revision requirements as a single set of instructions, so that you have a clear view of the revisions that are necessary for us to publish your work.</p><p>This is a thorough and interesting paper that makes an excellent contribution to the body of knowledge in this field. Gaviño, et al. demonstrate a novel role for the Activin branch of TGFβ signaling in planarian regeneration. The paper is potentially appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> after the authors attend to the following concerns:</p><p>1) The major findings revolve around two TGFβ family members, <italic>follistatin</italic> and <italic>activin-1</italic>, and their role in regeneration, effects on cell proliferation, etc. The story is interesting but fairly simple and straightforward. Therefore, the paper would be improved by significant shortening to concentrate on the major findings. The authors are encouraged to rewrite the paper in shorter format and reduce the number of figures accordingly.</p><p>2) The interpretation that <italic>activin-1(RNAi)</italic> significantly speeds up the normal regenerative response is not convincing. An alternative interpretation is that the mechanisms regulating homeostasis and regeneration may have become uncoupled in <italic>activin-1(RNAi)</italic>. The increased <italic>ovo</italic> expression in animals 20 days after amputation is intriguing, suggesting that there is an elevated level of tissue homeostasis after a single round of RNAi and regeneration. Are there survival disadvantages for animals that have undergone long term <italic>activin-1(RNAi)</italic> coupled with amputation? The claim of speeding regeneration is semantic in nature and should be toned down.</p><p>3) The authors argue that <italic>activin</italic> is upstream of <italic>Smad4</italic> by showing that <italic>Smad4(RNAi)</italic> causes an increase in apoptosis like <italic>activin(RNAi)</italic>. Since <italic>Smad4(RNAi)</italic> causes a profound regeneration defect, the apoptotic increase could be secondary to this defect. Furthermore, it has been shown that <italic>activin</italic> can signal independent of <italic>Smad4</italic> (Suzuki et al., Biochemical and biophysical research communications, 2010.) Are there any other upstream R-Smads capable of recapitulating the Activin defect or also rescue the Follistatin phenotype?</p><p>4) The authors show adult homeostatic expression patterns for <italic>follistatin</italic> and <italic>activin</italic>, yet they have no apparent phenotype under homeostasis. One concern is that the RNAi conditions may not be effective enough to knock down these homeostatic levels of these factors. This would prevent them from making the conclusion that these factors have no effect normally. Activin especially seems like a good candidate to regulate the neoblast homeostatic niche. In order for the authors to conclude that knockdown of these factors has no effect in homeostasis, they should provide in situ data to demonstrate that the adult expression of these factors is indeed repressed by RNAi to a reasonable degree.</p><p>5) The generic controls for RNAi seem inadequate. The authors should perform rescue experiments and lack of off-target effects.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00247.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>1<italic>) The major findings revolve around two TGFβ family members</italic>, follistatin <italic>and</italic> activin-1, <italic>and their role in regeneration, effects on cell proliferation, etc. The story is interesting but fairly simple and straightforward.

This is now referenced in the main text.</p><p><italic>3) The authors argue that</italic> activin <italic>is upstream of</italic> Smad4 <italic>by showing that</italic> Smad4(RNAi) <italic>causes an increase in apoptosis like</italic> activin(RNAi)<italic>. Since</italic> Smad4(RNAi) <italic>causes a profound regeneration defect, the apoptotic increase could be secondary to this defect. Furthermore, it has been shown that</italic> activin<italic> can signal independent of</italic> Smad4 <italic>(Suzuki et al., Biochemical and biophysical research communications, 2010.) Are there any other upstream R-Smads capable of recapitulating the Activin defect or also rescue the Follistatin phenotype</italic>?</p><p>We removed the <italic>smad4</italic> phenotype from the manuscript, as we now are leaving the apoptosis responses to wounding in <italic>activin</italic> deficient animals for more detailed future work.</p><p><italic>4) The authors show adult homeostatic expression patterns for</italic> follistatin<italic> and</italic> activin<italic>, yet they have no apparent phenotype under homeostasis. One concern is that the RNAi conditions may not be effective enough to knock down these homeostatic levels of these factors. This would prevent them from making the conclusion that these factors have no effect normally. Activin especially seems like a good candidate to regulate the neoblast homeostatic niche. In order for the authors to conclude that knockdown of these factors has no effect in homeostasis, they should provide in situ data to demonstrate that the adult expression of these factors is indeed repressed by RNAi to a reasonable degree</italic>.</p><p>We performed the RNAi controls in homeostatic conditions as suggested. We used quantitative PCR to measure <italic>fst</italic> expression levels in unamputated <italic>fst(RNAi)</italic> animals and also in <italic>fst(RNAi)</italic> fragments 24h after amputation. In these two cases, <italic>fst</italic> expression was inhibited by RNAi to a similar extent. We performed the same experiment in unamputated <italic>activin-1(RNAi)</italic> animals and 24h <italic>activin-1(RNAi)</italic> regenerating fragments. Here as well, expression was inhibited by RNAi to a similar degree in both contexts. These data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>, respectively.</p><p>To further demonstrate that the effect of <italic>fst</italic> RNAi is specific to regeneration, we labeled amputated <italic>fst(RNAi)</italic> animals that had failed to regenerate with a combination of markers that identify differentiating neurons 20d after amputation. Strikingly, in these animals that produced no blastemas, new neurons were still being made in old tissues. Furthermore, irradiated animals (irradiation kills neoblasts and blocks tissue turnover) die within roughly 2 weeks of irradiation, whereas these amputated animals survive long-term despite failing to regenerate. These data demonstrate that <italic>fst(RNAi)</italic> animals that fail to produce new tissues at wound sites continue to replace aging cells for tissue turnover, indicating the specificity of requirement for fst under these experimental conditions for regeneration. These data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) The generic controls for RNAi seem inadequate. The authors should perform rescue experiments and lack of off-target effects</italic>.</p><p>We performed and now present quantitative PCR experiments to measure the extent of both <italic>fst</italic> and <italic>activin-1</italic> inhibition by RNAi in unamputated and regenerating animals (see point 4 above).</p><p>Furthermore, (in addition to previously presented <italic>in situ</italic> controls) we measured the extent of <italic>fst</italic> and <italic>activin-1</italic> inhibition in <italic>fst</italic>; <italic>activin-1</italic> double RNAi animals and observed that <italic>fst</italic> is inhibited at least as strongly in these double RNAi animals as in <italic>fst; control</italic> double RNAi animals. These data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>To address the specificity of <italic>fst</italic> RNAi, we produced two additional RNAi constructs for inhibiting <italic>fst</italic> expression, with each construct spanning a non-overlapping portion of the <italic>fst</italic> gene. Both of these constructs caused a regeneration phenotype. These data are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
