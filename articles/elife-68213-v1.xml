These proteins insert into the inner membrane co-translationally. Therefore, mitochondrial ribosomes engage with the OXA1L-insertase and membrane-associated proteins, which support membrane insertion of translation products and early assembly steps into OXPHOS complexes. To identify ribosome-associated biogenesis factors for the OXPHOS system, we purified ribosomes and associated proteins from mitochondria. We identified TMEM223 as a ribosome-associated protein involved in complex IV biogenesis. TMEM223 stimulates the translation of COX1 mRNA and is a constituent of early COX1 assembly intermediates. Moreover, we show that SMIM4 together with C12ORF73 interacts with newly synthesized cytochrome <italic>b</italic> to support initial steps of complex III biogenesis in complex with UQCC1 and UQCC2. Our analyses define the interactome of the human mitochondrial ribosome and reveal novel assembly factors for complex III and IV biogenesis that link early assembly stages to the translation machinery.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>oxidative

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria play key roles in a plethora of cellular processes such as signaling processes, metabolism, and energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pfanner et al., 2019</xref>). Among this multitude of functions, cellular energy conversation by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a hallmark. ATP is produced by the mitochondrial OXPHOS system, which is comprised of the respiratory chain complexes I–IV and the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP-synthase (complex V). Except for complex II, these multi-subunit complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) are composed of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins.</p><p>The human mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) encodes 2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 proteins. These proteins are synthesized by membrane-associated mitochondrial ribosomes (mt-ribosome) to insert their translation products into the membrane co-translationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Englmeier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pfeffer et al., 2015</xref>). Subsequently, these subunits have to engage with nuclear-encoded, imported subunits to form functional enzyme machineries. This process requires a large number of chaperone-like assembly factors, which promote the maturation of the complexes through a number of assembly intermediates.</p><p>Since the accumulation of non-assembled OXPHOS proteins or subcomplexes can lead to the production of cellular damaging radicals (e.g., ROS), their assembly processes are highly regulated in a stoichiometrically and temporally manner, which is facilitated by a plethora of assembly factors. These biogenesis factors act at different maturation stages and stabilize assembly intermediates, insert cofactors or ensure the correct protein membrane integrity.</p><p>The assembly pathway of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase is one of the best characterized processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dennerlein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Timón-Gómez et al., 2018</xref>). The three core proteins COX1, COX2, and COX3 are encoded by the mtDNA. COX1 represents the step-stone of the assembly pathway, while COX2 and COX3 get added in a sequential manner. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), COX1 translation is regulated by translational activators that bind to the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of COX1 mRNA. However, due to the lack of a significant 5′UTR of human COX1 mRNA, such a mechanism probably does not exist in human mitochondria. It has been recently shown that COX1 translation is regulated by early and late assembly stages. MITRAC (mitochondrial translation regulation assembly intermediate of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase) represents the COX1 specific assembly intermediate, which comprises at least two sub-complexes (MITRAC<sup>early</sup> and MITRAC<sup>late</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mick et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richter-Dennerlein et al., 2016</xref>). MITRAC<sup>early</sup>, which interacts directly with the mt-ribosome during COX1 synthesis, is considered as the COX1 translation regulation complex, containing C12ORF62 (COX14) and MITRAC12 (COA3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richter-Dennerlein et al., 2016</xref>). In MITRAC<sup>late</sup>, the first nuclear-encoded subunit, COX4I1, joins the assembly intermediate impairing the accomplishment of COX1 synthesis. Thus, the transition from MITRAC<sup>early</sup> to MITRAC<sup>late</sup> represents a key regulatory step for COX1 synthesis and downstream events during cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase biogenesis. However, how the MITRAC complexes regulate COX1 translation on a molecular level remains unclear.</p><p>Other mitochondrial OXPHOS assembly pathways, such as for the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase (complex III), have been predominantly investigated in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The biogenesis of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase relies on the expression and coordinated assembly of 10 nDNA-encoded subunits and one mtDNA-encoded subunit, cytochrome <italic>b</italic> (CytB). The assembly process starts with the translation of CytB. During synthesis, two translation factors are bound to the nascent polypeptide emerging at the exit tunnel—Cbp3 (UQCC1) and Cbp6 (UQCC2), forming intermediate 0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez-Vizarra and Zeviani, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ndi et al., 2018</xref>). Both translation factors mediate the insertion of newly synthesized CytB into the IMM and dissociate once synthesis is complete. After incorporation of the first haem-b (bL), a third factor—Cbp4 (UQCC3) joins the pre-complex and the second heam bH gets integrated (intermediate I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez-Vizarra and Zeviani, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ndi et al., 2018</xref>). The release of Cbp3/Cbp6 (UQCC1/UQCC2) from the fully hemylated CytB is triggered by the insertion of the structural subunits Qcr7 (UQCRB) and Qcr8 (UQCRQ). Now dimerization occurs and the Cor1/Cor2 modules are joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stephan and Ott, 2020</xref>). In yeast, the translation activators Cbp3/Cbp6 are now available to initiate a new translation cycle of CytB (intermediate II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez-Vizarra and Zeviani, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ndi et al., 2018</xref>). The addition of Rip1 (UQCRFS1) together with the smallest subunit Qcr10 (UQCR11) to a dimeric subcomplex (pre-cIII2) is a crucial maturation step and ensures its catalytic activity. The composition of the cytochrome c reductase from yeast to human is highly similar, where cytochrome c1 (CYC1), Rip1 (UQCRFS1), and CytB (CYTB) form the core, which is organized in a tightly bound symmetrical dimer.</p><p>To define the interplay of translation and assembly of mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes, we defined the interactome of the human mt-ribosome under mild solubilization conditions. Among the identified proteins, we detected the uncharacterized protein TMEM223 and showed that it is involved in cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase assembly. Furthermore, we identified SMIM4, which interacts with the recently described cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase assembly factor C12ORF73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). We demonstrate that both proteins are involved in cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase biogenesis and that their interplay links mitochondrial translation to cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of TMEM223 and SMIM4 as mt-ribosome-associated proteins</title><p>At the IMM, the mt-ribosome synthesizes 13 essential OXPHOS subunits in human. During translation, it associates with the OXA1L insertase and early assembly factors of the OXPHOS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Itoh et al., 2021</xref>). To identify factors that are associated with the mt-ribosome and thereby contribute to OXPHOS biogenesis, we generated a human HEK293T cell line that enables inducible expression of a FLAG-tagged version of the ribosomal subunit mL62<sup>FLAG</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richter-Dennerlein et al., 2016</xref>). mL62 is a component of the 39S large ribosomal subunit (39S mtLSU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Busch et al., 2019</xref>). To capture interactions of proteins with the mitochondrial translation machinery, we isolated mitochondria and performed co-immunoisolation experiments under mild solubilization conditions. Proteins that co-purified with mL62<sup>FLAG</sup> were subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation and gradient fractions analyzed by western blotting. As expected, the gradient distribution of mL62<sup>FLAG</sup> revealed a free pool of mL62<sup>FLAG</sup> in fractions 1–3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), a fraction of mL62<sup>FLAG</sup> that co-sedimented with the 39S mtLSU (fractions 7 and 8) and with the 55S mt-ribosome (fraction 10) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richter et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TMEM223 and SMIM4 interact with the mitochondrial ribosome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mitochondria isolated from cells expressing mL62<sup>FLAG</sup> were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation.

Additionally, factors that regulate the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kummer and Ban, 2021</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying coordination of mitochondrial translation with OXPHOS assembly and the involved factors remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Richter-Dennerlein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dennerlein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kummer and Ban, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hällberg and Larsson, 2014</xref>). Especially, the question as to how long the mitochondrial ribosome remains associated with biogenesis intermediates of the oxidative phosphorylation system is still unaddressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richter-Dennerlein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maiti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferrari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lavdovskaia et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we aimed to define the interactome of the mt-ribosome in human cells with a special focus on its membrane-bound interaction partners. Using mild solubilization and purification conditions, we identified previously described auxiliary factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Busch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kummer and Ban, 2021</xref>) and the IMM proteins TMEM223 and SMIM4 as mt-ribosome interactors. Furthermore, we identified NT5DC2 and DNAJC13. The molecular function of these proteins is largely unknown and if they could act as OXPHOS assembly factors requires further investigation. Interestingly, we also identified assembly factors of respiratory chain complexes IV, such as COX20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lorenzi et al., 2018</xref>) or COA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). These findings suggest that the mitochondrial ribosome and its interacting partners could act as a platform to initiate OXPHOS assembly and that the mitochondrial ribosome remains associated with maturing complexes beyond the cotranslational assembly stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richter-Dennerlein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maiti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferrari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lavdovskaia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mick et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>However, in agreement, a recent complementary proteomic study in mouse, which identified new mt-ribosome biogenesis factors, also listed SMIM4 in the group of uncharacterized mt-ribosome interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Busch et al., 2019</xref>). We show that TMEM223 is involved in assembly of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, while SMIM4 and the interacting C12ORF73 contribute to the biogenesis of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase.</p><p>We show that TMEM223 is an IMM protein. Thus, our data represent experimental evidence for a previous prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sánchez-Caballero et al., 2020</xref>). TMEM223 acts early in the assembly process of the mitochondrial-encoded COX1 and is required for cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase assembly. Concomitantly, the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase increases in the TMEM223 knockout cell line, potentially as a stress response to compensate the reduction of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase. Interestingly, depletion of TMEM223 affects COX1 synthesis. Although TMEM223 is lacking in the knockout cell line mitochondria maintain reduced amounts of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase. It is tempting to speculate that the function of TMEM223 is partially overlapping with other assembly factors, such as C12ORF62 (COX14) or MITRAC12 (COA3) or that TMEM223 acts as a chaperone for cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase assembly, rather than presenting an essential assembly factor. However, these hypotheses need to be tested further. The reduction in cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase is in line with the observation that TMEM223 is predominantly found in the early assembly MITRAC intermediate together with C12ORF62 (COX14). C12ORF62 (COX14) was previously shown to bind mt-ribosomes and is required for efficient COX1 translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richter-Dennerlein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Weraarpachai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Richter-Dennerlein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dennerlein et al., 2017</xref>). However, TMEM223 is released from COX1 during assembly of other subunits, as it is only marginally associated with later MITRAC complexes, which are characterized by the presence of MITRAC7. These findings support the idea of TMEM223 representing a new early COX1 assembly factor that links biogenesis processes with translation.</p><p>In addition to TMEM223, we identified SMIM4 as an mt-ribosome-associated factor. Our work links SMIM4 to known early assembly factors for complex III (UQCC1 and UQCC2), and we identified C12ORF73 as an SMIM4-associated protein. Both, SMIM4 and C12ORF73, are functional interdependent, since loss of C12ORF73 leads to a reduction of SMIM4 and vice versa loss of SMIM4 leads to a reduction of C12ORF73. We show that SMIM4 and C12ORF73 regulate cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase assembly. However, cells depleted for SMIM4 or C12ORF73 maintain reduced amounts of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase. Considering the knockdown conditions used in our study, it is feasible that the remaining low amounts of SMIM4 or C12ORF73 can still participate in the biogenesis process. Another consideration would be that the half-life of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase could exceed the time frame of the siRNA application. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2020</xref> reported a strong reduction, but not a loss, of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase in model organisms. They pointed out that C12ORF73 (BRAWNIN) could also be involved in the import of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase subunits or that it is involved in sensing nutrient availability and the energy status of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, to dissect these possibilities will require further investigations. The interactions with newly synthesized CYTB, UQCC1, and UQCC2 position both proteins in the very early steps of the assembly process. Assembly of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase has been poorly investigated in mammals but is considered to recapitulate the process in the yeast system based on the high similarity in structure and composition of the yeast and human complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez-Vizarra and Zeviani, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ndi et al., 2018</xref>). The assembly process initiates with the synthesis of CytB and the association of the translational regulators Cbp3 (human UQCC1) and Cbp6 (UQCC2). Subsequently, Cbp3 (UQCC3) joins CytB. SMIM4 and C12ORF73 interact predominantly with UQCC1 and UQCC2 but not with UQCC3. Accordingly, both proteins are involved in the early steps of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase assembly. Interestingly, SMIM4 and C12ORF73 are not conserved in yeast, indicating differences in cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase assembly between yeast and human. A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stephan and Ott, 2020</xref>) investigated the dimerization of complex III. The authors showed that complex III dimerization takes place early in the assembly process, when Cyt<italic>b</italic> maturation is completed and the protein is fully hemylated. However, if SMIM4 or C12ORF73 are required for dimerization processes within cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase assembly processes would require further investigation. In a recent analysis, the zebrafish homolog of C12ORF73, BRAWNIN (BR), was suggested to contribute to cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, depletion experiments did not reveal any assembly intermediates. Accordingly, BR was suggested to act prior to complex dimerization. On the other hand, BN- and SDS-PAGE analyses indicated that BR partially co-migrated with the dimerized form of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). In our study, siRNA-mediated depletion of C12ORF73 or SMIM4 caused a reduction of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase. In contrast to the reports on BR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), C12ORF73 does not interact with late complex constituents but rather shows exclusively an association with the early assembly factors UQCC1 and UQCC2. This observation positions SMIM4 and C12ORF73 to early assembly steps rather than to the late complex formation stages. This is further underlined by the fact that both proteins are only present in the UQCC1 and UQCC2 assembly intermediates.</p><p>In conclusion, we defined the interactome of the human mt-ribosome and identified three previously uncharacterized IMM proteins as mt-ribosome-associated factors. Importantly, we unravel their functions as cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase assembly factors that support the immediate assembly of newly synthesized proteins into further assembly intermediates. Functional characterization defined TMEM223 as essential for cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase maturation, while SMIM4/ C12ORF73 acting as cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase biogenesis factors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

MS survey scans were acquired at a mass range of <italic>m/z</italic> 370–1700 and a resolution of 120,000 (at <italic>m/z</italic> 400). The target value was 10<sup>6</sup> ions and the maximum injection time was 200 ms. Up to 15 (mL62<sup>FLAG</sup> complexes) or 25 (SMIM4<sup>FLAG</sup> complexes) of the most intense multiply charged peptide ions were selected for fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation in the linear ion trap at a normalized collision energy of 35%, an activation q of 0.25, and an activation time of 10 ms. The target value was set to 5000 ions, the maximum injection time to 150 ms, the isolation width to 2.0 <italic>m/z</italic>, and the dynamic exclusion time to 45 s.</p><p>MS raw data were analyzed with MaxQuant/Andromeda (version 1.4.1.2 for mL62<sup>FLAG</sup> and 1.5.5.1 for SMIM4<sup>FLAG</sup> data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cox et al., 2011</xref>) and searched against the UniProt human proteome set including isoforms (release versions 08/2014 for mL62<sup>FLAG</sup> and 08/2018 for SMIM4<sup>FLAG</sup> data) using default settings except that the minimum requirements for protein identification and relative quantification were set to one unique peptide and one SILAC peptide pair, respectively. Arg10 and Lys8 were set as heavy labels. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was considered as fixed, and N-terminal acetylation and oxidation of methionine as variable modifications. The options ‘match between runs’ and ‘requantify’ were enabled.</p><p>Experiments were performed in four biological replicates including label-switch.

There is also need to update several citations referring to CIV assembly (doi: 10.1016/j.semcdb.2017.08.055; doi: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.32572), as well as to mitochondrial translation (doi: 10.1016/j.tcb.2017.05.004) and to mitoribosome assembly (doi: 10.1016/j.tcb.2020.12.008; doi: 10.1002/1873-3468.14024).</p><p>– To allow reproducibility, the authors must detail in the Methods section the commercial sources and catalogue numbers of the antibodies used in this work.</p><p>– The authors must include a table describing the reference Genbank sequences used for the guide RNA sequence selection in TMEM223-/- cells, as well as the precise genomic mutations (indels) generated by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing in the different alleles and their expected impacts on mRNA and protein sequences.</p><p>– As a general comment, the mitoribosome interactome includes many assembly factors in addition to the two studied, such as the known COX20 (early COX2 assembly line) or COA1 (not so early COX1 assembly line). The authors could comment on whether this indicates that respiratory complex assembly starts on the mitoribosome platform and continues until a particular assembly stage for each complex.</p><p>– MITRAC12-C12ORF62 are frequently referred to in the literature as COA3 and COX14. The alias names should be stated to allow the reader to follow the manuscript better.</p><p>– TMEM223 is not essential for COX assembly. Does it play an overlapping role with any other assembly factor?</p><p>– Regarding SMIM4 and C12ORF73, the silencing experiments seem to indicate that the factors are not essential for CIII assembly. This concept could be further clarified.</p><p>– Major suggestion is that the authors should present quantifications of some experiments.</p><p>It is claimed for Figure 2D that COX4I1, COX6A, C12ORF62 and MITRAC12 are unaffected in TMEM223 minus cells. This is very difficult to see especially for C12ORF62 and MITRAC12. The levels of NDUFA9, SDHA, RIESKE, and ATP5B on the other hand are classified as constant. Again sometimes it is difficult to see that they behave differently to the first set of proteins. Densitometric scanning of triplicate blots could help here.</p><p>Same goes for Figure 3A it would make sense to quantify the extent of assembly inhibition in the TMEM223 minus cells, as has been done for Figure 3C. It would also be nice to see a loading control for the BN-PAGE gels, the Coomassie stain would be sufficient for this.</p><p>It seems to me there is an increase in the assembly of CYTB, this should be discussed.</p><p>Also the BN-PAGE blots in Figure 5D and 5E should be quantified. Especially for 5E it would help to know which complex is most affected. Moreover, it should be discussed why ablation of C12ORF73, in contrast to SMIM4, besides complex III also affects complex I and IV.<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this work, Dennerlein et al., dissect the interactome of the human mitochondrial ribosomes in HEK293T cells and identify two new mitochondrial inner membrane proteins, TMEM223 and SMIM4, as ribosome-associated proteins involved in the biogenesis of respiratory chain complexes IV and III, respectively. While TMEM223 seems to preferentially stimulate translation of COX1 mRNA through its interaction with early COX1 assembly intermediates, SMIM4 interacts with newly synthesized cytochrome b to support initial steps of complex III biogenesis in concurrence with three previously identified CIII assembly factors: UQCC1, UQCC2 and C12ORF73. These analyses thus reveal novel assembly factors for complex III and IV biogenesis that link early assembly stages to the mitochondrial translation machinery, and expand the number of genes potentially involved in mitochondrial diseases. Overall, the data presented in this manuscript are of high quality and the manuscript is well written. The new observations are extremely interesting, and add relevant new value compared with previous reports.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, Dennerlein and colleagues investigate the broad mitochondrial ribosome interactome. Among the many proteins identified, the authors focus on two new ribosome-associated proteins, SMIM4 and TMEM223, which are found to function as early assembly factors for the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes III and IV, respectively. Specifically, the manuscript collects in a well-organized and logical sequence substantial experimental evidence supporting the role of TMEM223 in early COX1 assembly and of SMIM4, together with C12ORF73, in the assembly of CYTB. These data add to the fields of mitochondrial respiratory complex biogenesis and the coordination of mitochondrial translation with respiratory complex assembly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript of Dennerlein et al., identifies that two human integral mitochondrial inner membrane proteins, TMEM233 and SMIM4, which are associated with the large mitoribosomal subunit, as early assembly factors for cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) or and cytochrome c reductase (complex III), respectively. TMEM233 is required for efficient translation of mitochondrially encoded Cox1 and associated with previously characterized early assembly intermediates of cytochrome c oxidase. SMIM4 is associated with C12ORF73, which has previously been implicated in cytochrome c reductase assembly, and downregulation of either of the two proteins results in destabilization of the other. Both ablation of either SIMM4 and C12ORF73 primarily affects assembly of complex III. This is in line with the observation that both SIMM4 and C12ORF73 interact with previously characterized early assembly factors of complex III but not with later ones. Finally, both proteins associate with the newly synthesize cytochrome b.</p><p>The manuscript is well written, has clear figures and the results are presented in a logical way. I find the approach of identifying early assembly factors by characterizing the interactome of the large mitoribosomal subunit an elegant one. The presented results are of high quality, convincing and support the conclusions drawn be the authors. Essentially all claims made by the authors are supported by more than one independent experimental approach. The only issue I have is that the phenotypes of the TMEM233 and SMIM4 depleted cells could be described in more quantitative terms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68213.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.
