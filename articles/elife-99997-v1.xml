How the brain handles the diverse streams of information processing remains poorly understood. Applying Hidden Markov Modeling to fMRI data obtained during spoken narrative comprehension, we reveal that the whole brain networks predominantly oscillate within a tripartite latent state space. These states are, respectively, characterized by high activities in the sensory-motor (State #1), bilateral temporal (State #2), and default mode networks (DMN; State #3) regions, with State #2 acting as a transitional hub. The three states are selectively modulated by the acoustic, word-level semantic, and clause-level semantic properties of the narrative. Moreover, the alignment with both the best performer and the group-mean in brain state expression can predict participants’ narrative comprehension scores measured from the post-scan recall. These results are reproducible with different brain network atlas and generalizable to two datasets consisting of young and older adults. Our study suggests that the brain underlies narrative comprehension by switching through a tripartite state space, with each state probably dedicated to a specific component of language faculty, and effective narrative comprehension relies on engaging those states in a timely manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>speech comprehension</kwd><kwd>brain dynamics</kwd><kwd>HMM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021171</institution-id><institution>Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2024A1515030046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Lanfang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32471100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Guosheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hidden Markov Modeling to fMRI data reveals how language comprehension arises from the dynamic interplay of large-scale brain networks.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When listening to a speech, one adaptively samples information from external sound streams, converting them to linguistic expressions stored in the mental lexicon, and integrating those mental expressions with the internalized ‘mental world’ to infer the semantic-pragmatic interpretations and intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berwick et al., 2013</xref>). Crucially, those cognitive processes do not occur one after another in a fixed sequence, but are interwoven and occur in a fluid, dynamic manner. At one moment, you might detect the auditory cues such as volume and pitch in the speech. At another, you might recall memories or knowledge in relation to certain words just heard. To effectively understand the speech, you must flexibly and adaptively switch among those cognitive processes. The neural mechanism behind it is still elusive.</p><p>An emerging view suggests that flexible and adaptive cognitive functions arise from the dynamic brain, which transiently activates and coordinates distributed neural circuits in response to the changes in the external environment and internal demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Honey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kelso, 2012</xref>). To capture the complex neural dynamics occurring across large-scale systems of the brain, researchers have conceptualized the brain’s activity as operating on a low-dimensional neural manifold. The dynamics of brain activity can then be modeled as a temporal trajectory within a latent state space, with each latent state characterized by a distinct pattern of brain activities and network connectivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Langdon et al., 2023</xref>). Employing statistical techniques for modeling dynamic systems such as Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM), recent studies have begun to explore the brain dynamics involved in narrative comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baldassano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Song et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tang et al., 2023</xref>) or movie viewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van der Meer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Song et al., 2023</xref>). It has been found that the whole brain systematically switches among a limited number of temporal clusters or latent states with distinct spatial features. Moreover, the switching of brain states was modulated by the time-varying stimuli features including event boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baldassano et al., 2017</xref>) and movie annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van der Meer et al., 2020</xref>), and subjective experience including engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van der Meer et al., 2020</xref>), attention fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Song et al., 2023</xref>), emotional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tan et al., 2022</xref>), and narrative integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Song et al., 2021</xref>). Those findings demonstrate the functional relevance of brain state dynamics. Nevertheless, how neural state dynamics contribute to the different streams of cognitive processing that ebb and flow with the unfolding of speech is still elusive.</p><p>In this study, we explored how language comprehension arises from the dynamic interplay of large-scale brain networks. According to the psycholinguistic theory, the basic design of language faculty mainly comprises three modules (components): an external sensory-motor module, an internal conceptual-intentional module, and a basic linguistic module which represents mental expressions formed by syntactic rules and connects the other two modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berwick et al., 2013</xref>). Built upon this theory, we hypothesize that brain dynamics underlying narrative comprehensions would predominantly oscillate within a tripartite latent state space, with each latent state primarily dedicated to a specific component of language faculty. Furthermore, we hypothesize that effective speech comprehension would rely on engaging these states in a timely manner.</p><p>To test the above tripartite-state-space hypothesis, we collected fMRI data from 64 young adults as they listened to 10 min real-life narratives. The HMM was applied to model the dynamics of whole-brain network activities. We expect the dynamics of whole-brain network activities would be optimally characterized by three latent states with distinct activity patterns. Specifically, one state would mainly activate the auditory and sensory-motor areas, contributing to the perceptual analyses of external sound streams. The second state would mainly activate the language network and frontal-parietal network, contributing to linguistic encoding and information integration. The third state would mainly activate the default mode networks (DMN), contributing to internalized semantic-conceptual processing. Moreover, according to the proposed architecture of language components, we expect both the externally-oriented and internally-oriented states would be more likely to transit to the second state than directly transiting between each other. To further validate the functional nature of the three states, we investigated how the dynamic changes of state expression probabilities would be modulated by the temporal variation of speech properties. Three speech properties were analyzed, each reflecting progressively longer timescales of linguistic information: sound envelope, word-level semantic coherence, and clause-level semantic coherence. Based on previous findings that the timescales of information accumulation vary hierarchically from early sensory areas to higher-order areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hasson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lerner et al., 2011</xref>), we expect the occurrence probabilities of three brain states would be selectively modulated by these speech properties corresponding to distinct timescales. Finally, to probe the behavioral significance of the timing of brain states, we examined whether the alignment of a participant with the best performer in the time courses of brain state expression could predict the participant’s narrative comprehension score. To validate the robustness of the results, we also conducted all the analyses using a replication dataset consisting of older adults.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The brain reliably and robustly switches through three latent states</title><p>We applied the HMM to infer hidden brain states in 64 participants as they listened to one of three 10 min narratives. The observed variables were BOLD signal time series of nine networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) obtained employing a state-of-the-art technique for cortical network communities detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). Two criteria were comprehensively considered to determine the optimal number of latent states for the HMM. The first was the effectiveness of a model in capturing and separating patterns in the data, which was assessed by the clustering performance of the model. The second was the degree to which it aligned with prior knowledge about the data, which was evaluated by the model’s ability to classify the three narratives. These dual criteria ensure that the selected model would be both statistically robust and cognitively sensible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pohle et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Across a range of candidate models with K from 2 to 10, the model’s clustering performance tended to decrease with larger K, whereas the accuracy in classifying narrative contents tended to increase.

Moreover, when examining the replication dataset wherein participants’ age, narrative contents, as well as scanning duration differed substantially from those of the main dataset, we again found the model with K = 3 to be optimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To this end, we applied a hierarchical clustering algorithm to the transition probability matrix derived from HMM models with 4, 10, and 12 states, and obtained three clusters for each. Those model orders were examined since they have been reported to be the optimal number in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van der Meer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Song et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Song et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vidaurre et al., 2017</xref>). In this approach, states assigned to the same cluster were more likely to switch within themselves than switching to states belonging to other clusters, and such clusters have been called metastates in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vidaurre et al., 2017</xref>). We then examined whether there was significant and exclusive correspondence between the clustered states and the three target states (from the HMM with K = 3). There was a clear and exclusive correspondence between clusters reconstructed from both the 4-state and 10-state models and the predefined target states in terms of activity patterns (r<sub>(6)</sub> ranges from 0.72 to 0.98) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The timing of state expression was also well aligned between the reconstructed model and the target model (more than 77% overlap across a total of 19, 200 time points for 64 participants). For the 12-state model, we also found two reconstructed clusters resembling State #1 and State #3. Probe on the cluster that deviated most from the target states showed that it consisted of nine states, possibly capturing too many nuanced patterns of neural dynamics. Indeed, when splitting this ‘big’ cluster into two smaller ones, one of them demonstrated significant similarity to State#2 (r<sub>(7)</sub>=0.75) . These findings suggest the tripartite-state organization is not trivial, but likely reflect some fundamental processes of brain dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Three latent brain states have distinct spatial features</title><p>For each state, the HMM estimated its activity loadings on the nine networks and a functional connectivity matrix between these networks. We found the three latent states exhibited distinct activity patterns corresponding to the neural substrates for the three language components as suggested by the theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berwick et al., 2013</xref>). The first state (State #1) was characterized by relatively high activities in the auditory and somatomotor networks, along with low activities in the DMN and the cognitive control network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This state seems to be associated with the external sensory-motor module of language faculty. The second state (State #2) was characterized by relatively high activities in the language and the frontal-parietal networks whereas low activities in the somatomotor and auditory networks, seemingly being associated with the basic linguistic component. The third state (State #3) was characterized by relatively high activities in the DMN and frontal-parietal networks whereas low activities in the auditory and language networks, seemingly being associated with the internal conceptual-intentional component.

Moreover, the brain occupied by State #2 would exhibit the highest degree of information integration.</p><p>To test the first prediction, we examined the between-state switching matrix inferred by the HMM, which showed the probabilities of a state at each timepoint transitioning to another or staying in the same state at the next timepoint. Consistent with our prediction, both State #1 and #3 were more likely to switch to State #2 than switching directly to each other, i.e., State #2 acted as a transitional hub. To confirm that this state-switching tendency was driven by meaningful processes rather than occurring by chance, we made surrogate data by having the nine-network time series circular shifted independently 1000 times. In each iteration, we carried out an HMM analysis with K = 3, and extracted the difference in transition probability if the inferred states exhibited a similar switching pattern as those from the experiment data.

The same pattern was found in the dwelling time, with a group mean of 15.29 s for State #2, 9.99 s for State #1, and 9.68 s for State #3.

This low correlation is likely due to the high level of noise inherent in fMRI data.

Additionally, the speech features we measured may account for only a small portion of the cognitive processes underlying the task.

Next, we tested the hypothesis that effective narrative comprehension would rely on engaging these states in a timely manner. To tackle this question, we measured the alignment of brain state fluctuation between each participant (except for the best performers) with that of the best performer(s). Then we used the inter-brain alignment index to relate to participants’ comprehension scores, which were measured from the post-scan recall of the stories scored by two independent raters. The best performers were the ones (or those) who achieved the highest comprehension score within the subgroup of participants exposed to the same narrative. The rationale is that, if effective comprehension relies on the brain to turn into specific patterns at the right times, the best performer would demonstrate the most ‘accurate’ pattern. Consequently, participants whose brain state fluctuations deviated more (or less alignment) from the ‘accurate’ pattern were anticipated to perform less effectively in the task.</p><p>As anticipated, alignments with the best performers in both the State #1 and State #2 were significantly correlated with participants’ comprehension scores (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic><sub>(54)</sub> = 0.31 and 0.37, respectively).

We examined whether the above association of inter-subject alignment in brain states with behavior was merely an epiphenomenon of overall task engagement. It is well known that continuous self-reports on task engagement may severely disrupt the ongoing processing of prolonged naturalistic stimuli. As an alternative, studies have demonstrated that head movement serves as a reliable time-resolved indicator for task engagement, with greater task engagement accompanied by decreased movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballenghein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greipl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaakinen et al., 2018</xref>). Leveraging this, we computed inter-subject correlations (ISC) in the trajectory of head movement (quantified by framewise displacement) during the fMRI scanning as a proxy for inter-subject similarity in task engagement.

However, in the dataset of older adults, we did not find significant positive correlations between inter-subject alignment in brain states and narrative comprehension. This may be due to substantial heterogeneity among older adults. Despite engaging in the same task, older adults exhibit considerable inter-subject variation in cortical morphology, function, and brain metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yu, 2024</xref>). These factors can diminish the inter-subject correlation of brain state dynamics — indeed, ISCs among older adults were significantly lower than those among younger adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) — and potentially reduce ISC’s sensitivity to individual differences in task performance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Comparison between conditions</title><p>The above results have revealed a tripartite latent space of whole-brain dynamics, with each state probably subserving a different cognitive component underlying narrative comprehension. Is this temporospatial organization a task-free, intrinsic organization of the dynamic brain, or mainly driven by language processing?

Here, we explored how the brain transiently activates and coordinates distributed neural networks to support the diverse cognitive streams underlying spoken narrative comprehension. Applying HMM, we found that the brain reliably and robustly switched through three latent states, which were characterized respectively by high activities in the sensory-motor (State #1), bilateral temporal-frontal (State #2), and DMN (State #3) regions. Among them, State #2 occurred most frequently, acted as a ‘transitional hub,’ and was characterized by the highest level of functional integration. Furthermore, the three states were selectively modulated by the perceptual, word-level semantic, and clause-level semantic properties of the speech. Importantly, participants’ alignments with both the best performers and the group-mean on the time courses of brain states expression predicted their narrative comprehension scores, indicating effective speech comprehension relies on engaging the specific brain states in a timely manner. Finally, by comparing the comprehension task with the resting and the unintelligible speech conditions, we demonstrated that the tripartite latent state space was mainly driven by language processing.</p><p>A set of results convergently suggests that the tripartite state space is not incidental, but likely reflects a fundamental principle governing the brain dynamics underlying narrative comprehension. First, among a range of candidate models with the number of states ranging from 2 to 10, the model with K = 3 performed the best in terms of separating patterns in the data and decoding narrative contents, being both statistically robust and cognitively sensible. Second, the tripartite latent state space was replicable with different network atlas and generalizable to different datasets. Especially, despite that the two datasets vary substantially in terms of participants (young versus older adults), the contents of narratives, and data length, the two groups still exhibited highly similar brain temporal organization that was best captured by the three latent states. Moreover, the spatial and temporal patterns of the tripartite state space can be hierarchically reconstructed from more nuanced state patterns, being ‘metastates’ of the brain.</p><p>Intriguingly, the characteristics of the three latent states align well with the theoretical framework concerning the basic design of language faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berwick et al., 2013</xref>). The State #1, which was featured by relatively high activities in the auditory and somatomotor networks and more likely to occur when speech sounds were louder, probably corresponds to the external sensory-motor component of language faculty. State #2, which was featured by relatively high activities in the bilateral temporal and the frontal-parietal networks and more likely to occur when the inputting word was semantically related to the word immediately before it, probably corresponds to the basic linguistic component. State #3, which was featured by relatively high activities in the DMN and frontal-parietal networks and more likely to occur when the inputting clause was semantically related to the clause immediately before it, probably corresponds to the higher-level semantic-conceptual component. Moreover, State #2 acted as a transitional hub, with both State #1 and State #3 were more likely to switch to it than switching directly within them. This directed switching pattern was not incidental, as the observed discrepancy in switching probability was greater than in most instances from the surrogate data. Additionally, when occupied by State #2, whole brain networks exhibited a higher level of information integration (quantified by global efficiency) than when occupied by the other two states. These patterns are also consistent with the theoretical prediction that the basic linguistic module is located in the middle of the external and internal modules, having direct interactions with the other two. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the specific relationship between the tripartite brain latent states and three critical components of language cognition, going beyond the account of arousal or attentional fluctuation for brain state dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van der Meer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Song et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Taghia et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The activity patterns of the brain’s latent states associated with each of the theoretical components of language faculty are consistent with the findings from earlier studies that have mainly focused on the averaged brain activities over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferstl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Price, 2012</xref>). Extending prior work, our study may provide novel insights about how the different streams of cognitive processing are temporally organized with the unfolding of speech. Specifically, the time-varying probabilities of latent states indicate that the associated cognitive processes underlying speech comprehension may not operate in parallel with equal priority or occur one after another. Instead, while all processes are simultaneously engaged, one process dominates over others and this dominance changes over time, taking the form of mode-switching. This is consistent with the emerging view that internal/external switching processes of neural circuits drive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Honey et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, we found it was the alignment with the best performer (and the group-mean) in the time courses of state expression, rather than the overall occupancy of latent states, that positively correlated with participants’ task performance, suggesting recruiting these states in a timely manner is the key to effective speech comprehension. These findings may provide a useful guide to understand the development of language ability as well as language disorders.</p><p>Our study provides a unifying perspective for two prevailing approaches aiming to understand how the brain produces cognition. The modular approach postulates the brain areas to act as independent processors for a specific aspect of complex cognitive functions, contributing to much of our current knowledge of the relationship between the brain and behavior. However, this approach has been criticized for ignoring the multifunctionality of brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuster, 2000</xref>). Alternatively, the network approach, which has been growing rapidly in recent years, posits that cognitive functions arise from dynamic interactions within and between distributed brain systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bressler and Menon, 2010</xref>). While revealing valuable insights into the operation rules of the brain, the network approach seems to only provide a general descriptive model. It lacks a mechanism that accounts for how the interactions of large-scale brain networks give rise to the different streams of information processing involved in a cognitive task. Here, by demonstrating the multistability of large-scale brain networks and establishing the close relationship between specific latent states to specific language components, our study raises a hypothesis that could reconcile the modular and the dynamic network approaches to understand the brain function. Specifically, for a given task, the brain follows modular organization where different regions specialize in specific functions. However, the importance of these regions dynamically changes in response to external environment and internal demands. Accordingly, goal-directed behaviors arise from the precise temporal coordination of different functional modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vyas et al., 2020</xref>). To test this possibility, future studies could combine fMRI and neuroregulation techniques and assess the change in state dynamics and behavioral performance as a result of an intervention.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In sum, our study reveals that the brain involved in narrative comprehension predominantly oscillates within a tripartite latent state space. The spatial and topological characteristics of these states correspond well to the three core components of language faculty as specified in the theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berwick et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, we demonstrate that effective speech comprehension relies on engaging these brain states in a timely manner. These results are largely reproducible with different brain network parcellation schemes, and generalizable to two replication datasets consisting of young and older adults. The findings establish the link of brain dynamics with both ongoing cognitive processing and behavioral outcomes, providing a mechanistic account of how language comprehension arises from the dynamic interplay of large-scale brain networks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants and experiment procedure</title><p>The main dataset consisted of 68 Chinese college students (33 males, aged 19–27 y) scanned with fMRI while listening to a 10 min narrative in Chinese.

These stories described her experiences with a graduate admission interview, a hiking trip, and her first time taking a flight.</p><p>The replication dataset came from 30 healthy older adults (12 males, aged 53–75 y) recruited from the residential community near the college. During fMRI scanning, each participant listened to two real-life stories presented with and without background noise. Those stories were told by a 62-year-old woman in a Chinese dialect, describing her experience in Thailand and riding a warship, respectively. After omitting 10 runs with large head movements (&gt;3 mm or 3 degrees), a total of 50 runs of fMRI scans were included for subsequence analyses.</p><p>For both datasets, the recordings were collected when the speakers were scanned with fMRI. To obtain audio recordings with good quality, we used a noise-canceling microphone (FOMRI-III, Optoacoustics Ltd., Or-Yehuda, Israel) positioned above the mouth of the speaker and further de-noised the audio recordings offline using Adobe Audition 3.0 (Adobe Systems Inc, USA).</p><p>After the scanning session, participants were asked to retell the story in detail. Following the free recall, experimenters asked additional questions from a prepared list about details not previously mentioned. The list contained 9–10 questions for each story, which addressed key events from different parts of the narrative (e.g. ‘Can you describe the preparations she made for the hike?’ or ‘What happened on her way to the hotel?’). Correct answers are needed to cover critical details, including actions, characters, locations, time, and motivations. Two independent raters listened to the recordings of participants’ free recall and their responses to the experimenters, assigning a score for each question based on the completeness of the key points provided. The comprehension score for each participant was calculated as a percentage of the total possible points. Given the high inter-rater reliability (Spearman’s r<sub>(62)</sub> = 0.74), the average score from both raters was used to quantify each participant level of story comprehension. The audio files of those stories, along with their corresponding transcriptions and sample questions used in the comprehension test, are available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/liulanfang11/Tripartite-brain-states/upload/main">https://github.com/liulanfang11/Tripartite-brain-states/upload/main</ext-link>.</p><p>This research was approved by the Reviewer Board of Beijing Normal University in China (ICBIR_A_0002_009).

Functional images were acquired employing a gradient echo-planar imaging sequence with the specified parameters: repetition time = 2000 ms, echo time = 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 90°, field of view = 220 mm<sup>2</sup>, matrix size = 64 × 64, 32 interleaved slice, voxel size = 3.44 × 3.44 × 3.99 mm<sup>3</sup>. Structural images were acquired using a MPRAGE sequence with the following parameters: repetition time = 2530 ms, echo time = 3.39 ms, ﬂip angle = 7°, FOV = 256 mm<sup>2</sup>, scan order = interleaved, matrix size = 256 × 256, and voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.33 mm<sup>3</sup>. The preprocessing pipeline included slice-timing correction, spatial realignment, co-registration to the individual participants’ anatomical maps, normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, resampling into a 3 × 3 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup> voxel size, and smoothing (FWHM = 7 mm). The resulting images underwent additional processing, including detrending, nuisance variable regression, and high-pass filtering (1/128 Hz).

Currently, most brain functional networks reported in the literature are made based on resting-state fMRI data. To better capture the brain network organization during the task, we conducted brain network parcellation applying a state-of-the-art method proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ji et al., 2019</xref>, using data from the 64 participants engaged in narrative comprehension. This method employs multiple quality control metrics to ensure the stability and reliability of the network partition, and most importantly, uses parameter optimization guided by well-established neurobiological principles (e.g. the separation of sensory and motor systems).</p><p>First, the mean time series of 246 regions defined by the Brainnetome atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fan et al., 2016</xref>) were extracted, and a functional connectivity (FC) matrix was computed for each participant and then averaged across them. This atlas covers both cortical and subcortical regions and is made based on both anatomical and FC patterns. Next, community detection was performed on the group-averaged FC matrix by applying the Louvain clustering algorithm in the Brain connectivity toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/">https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/</ext-link>). Three criteria were taken into account when determining the Gamma parameter in the algorithm, including (1) separation of primary sensory-motor network (visual, auditory and somatomotor) from all other networks (i.e. neurobiologically sensible); (2) high similarity of network partitions across nearby parameters (i.e. statistically stable); and (3) high within-network connectivity relative to between-network connectivity (i.e. high modularity).</p><p>A set of gamma values ranging from 1.2 to 2.5, with a step size of 0.01, were tested. For every tested gamma, we ran the algorithm 1000 times and measured how consistent a given partition was to every other partition using a z-rand score. Each z-rand score averaged across the iterations was then multiplied by its corresponding modularity score to find a modularity-weighted z-rand score. Finally, the gamma value of 2.5 was selected, as it corresponded to the peak of the modularity-weighted z-rand score and satisfied the three criteria, resulting in a plausible number of networks, including the primary sensory/motor networks. We implemented network detection using code published by a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The network detection approach identified a total of 11 networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Two networks were discarded due to comprising too few nodes (less than three) and thus nine networks were included for further analyses. By reference to the functional decoding results using NeuroSynth (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.neurosynth.org">https://www.neurosynth.org</ext-link>), we tentatively labeled the nine networks as the auditory, visual, somatomotor, bilateral language, medial temporal, frontal-parietal, ventral attention, subcortical, and default mode networks. To test the robustness of the findings, we also adopted the seven-network atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>) for whole-brain parcellation and reconducted the main analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Brain state inference using Hidden Markov Model</title><p>We applied the HMM to infer latent brain states during narrative comprehension using the HMM-MAR toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR">https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vidaurre and Higgins, 2025</xref>). The HMM assumes that the observed data is generated through a finite number of latent states, and each state can be characterized, respectively, by a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean and covariance. The BOLD time series was first standardized within each participant and each network. Then HMM was fitted using concatenated data from all participants, such that unified brain states could be obtained.</p><p>The number of latent states (represented by ‘K’) is a crucial aspect of the HMM, and it needs to be predetermined before fitting the model. Two criteria were considered to determine the optimal K. The first was a model’s clustering performance, which reflects how well the model can capture and separate different patterns in the data. The second criterion was how well the model aligned with existing knowledge about the data. This criterion was evaluated by the ability of a trained HMM model to decode the narrative content heard by unseen participants. This dual criterion ensures that the selected number of brain states (K) for the HMM is both statistically robust and cognitively meaningful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pohle et al., 2017</xref>). The clustering performance and prediction accuracy were assessed through a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. In this approach, we trained the HMM using data from all participants except one. For each candidate K, we repeated the training process 10 times, and the instance with the smallest free energy was selected for decoding the latent state sequence of the left-out participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Song et al., 2023</xref>). Utilizing the decoded latent state sequence, along with the participant’s network time series, we calculated the Calinski-Harabasz score as an indicator of the model’s clustering performance, with a higher score indicating better clustering performance. Furthermore, to assess the model’s decoding capability, we applied a K-nearest neighbor algorithm utilizing the decoded latent state sequences to classify which of the three narratives the left-out participant was listening to. A higher accuracy indicates the model has well captured the task information in the data. Both the Calinski-Harabasz score and narrative classification accuracy were acquired from each participant and then averaged across the group. To combine the two criteria, we first converted the Calinski-Harabasz score and narrative decoding accuracy independently to Z scores and then summed them up to create a single composite score.</p><p>We repeated the above cross-validation procedure across a range of K from 2 to 10. The K with the largest composite score was set to be the optimal number of HMM states representing the brain dynamics during the narrative comprehension task. Upon determining the optimal number of states, we reconducted the HMM on the data from all participants and chose the instance with the largest model evidence (lowest free energy) from 10 iterations as the final result.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Reconstruction of latent states using hierarchical clustering</title><p>To demonstrate that those hidden states identified by the above analyses were not trivial but potentially reflected several fundamental processes of the dynamic brain, we explored whether those states can be reconstructed from smaller, more nuanced patterns using hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vidaurre et al., 2017</xref>). To this end, we applied an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to the transition probability matrix derived from HMM with K = 4, 10, and 12, respectively, and obtained three clusters from each. Next, we compared the clusters with the target states (i.e. those resulting from the HMM with K = 3) in terms of similarities in activity patterns (spatial overlap) and the time course of state expression (temporal overlap).</p><p>To evaluate the spatial overlap, we first averaged the activation values across those states belonging to the same cluster, merging them into a single new state. Then we assessed the similarity in the activity patterns between the merged states and the target states using Pearson’s correlation. To evaluate temporal overlap, we first substituted states belonging to the same cluster with the newly formed one, then computed Jaccard Similarity between the sequences of the new states and the sequences of the targeted states.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Analyses of brain state properties</title><p>The HMM model generated, for each state, a group-level activation map and a functional connectivity matrix, as well as a between-state transition probability matrix. With these parameters, the probability of each state being active (or expressed) at each time point and the most likely sequence of states were estimated for each participant using the Viterbi algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rezek and Roberts, 2005</xref>). Based on the Viterbi path, the total time spent on each state over the entire duration (referred to as FO) and the duration for which a state continuously persisted before switching to another one (referred to as dwell time) were computed for each participant.</p><p>Next, we conducted a graph theoretical analysis to assess the degree of functional integration and segregation of the whole brain when occupied by a specific state. For each participant and each state, a weighted and undirected graph was constructed in which the nine networks were represented as nodes, and FCs estimated using network time series corresponding to the specific state were represented as edges. Employing the Brain Connectivity toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012</xref>), we computed network global efficiency as the measurement for functional integration. Functional segregation was measured by a network modularity score using the Louvain algorithm with a resolution parameter gamma = 1. Then t-tests were employed to examine the differences in these indices across the three states. For validation purposes, we additionally computed the two graph theoretical indices using the state-specific FC matrices estimated by the HMM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Surrogate data generation and permutation test</title><p>To ascertain that the trend in between-state transition was not by chance, we generated surrogate data by having the 9-network time series circular shifted independently. In this approach, the meaningful covariance between networks was disrupted while the temporal characteristics of the time series were retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Song et al., 2023</xref>). On each permutated data, we conducted an HMM analysis with the optimal K (i.e. K = 3). If there were two states where both showed a higher probability of transitioning to a third state compared to directly transitioning between them, this instance would be taken as exhibiting a similar switching pattern as to the experiment result. Then the associated differences in the transition probabilities were extracted and averaged between two pairs. Otherwise, the difference for this instance was set to zero. This step ensured that only meaningful differences in transition probabilities were considered. By repeating this procedure 1000 times, we obtained a null distribution for the discrepancy in state transition probabilities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Modulation of brain state activation by time-varying stimuli features</title><p>To gain more insights into the functional nature of brain dynamic states, we investigated how narrative properties would modulate the probability of a neural state being expressed in individuals. Specifically, we focused on three different stimuli properties which were assumed to reflect an increasingly ‘deeper’ level of information conveyed by the narrative, including the temporal changes in acoustic property, and semantic coherence at the word level and at the clause level.</p><p>To characterize the temporal variation of acoustic property, we derived the temporal envelope of each story using the Hilbert transform, which reflects the overall fluctuation of voice amplitude. The speech envelope was then convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and down-sampled to 0.5 Hz (the same resolution as the fMRI acquisition). To characterize the temporal variation of semantic coherence, we first transcribed the speech to texts and retrieved the semantic representations for each word by applying a large language model BERT that was pretrained on a large-scale Chinese corpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Devlin et al., 2018</xref>). The output from the last layer of the model was used as word embedding. To avoid overfitting, we further decomposed the high-dimensional embedding vectors (N = 768) with principal component analysis (PCA) and retained the first 50 PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldstein et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>). Next, a vector of word-level semantic coherence was generated for each narrative by computing the cosine similarity between the embeddings of every word and the word immediately before it. After aligning the onset time of words using Praat (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/">https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/</ext-link>), the semantic coherence vector was convolved with HRF and down-sampled to 0.5 Hz. Clauses were encoded by two researchers, each including 8–9 characters on average. The semantic representations for clauses were obtained by averaging the embedding vectors of words within a clause. Using the same method, a vector for clause-level semantic coherence was generated for each narrative.</p><p>We first computed Pearson’s correlation between the vector of narrative properties and the vector of state expression probability at the individual level. To infer significance, the group mean of correlation values across participants was compared to a null distribution generated by 5000 permutations. For each iteration, the time courses of brain state expression were randomly circular-shuffled, and the correlation between the narrative property vector and the shuffled time course of state expression was re-calculated and averaged over participants to create a random value. An empirical <italic>p</italic>-value was determined by the proportion of values from the 5000 iterations that were larger than the original group-mean value. FDR correction was used to account for multiple comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-7"><title>Correlation of latent state dynamics with behavior</title><p>To assess the importance of the timing of brain latent states to behavior, we examined whether the alignment of participant’s brain state fluctuations with that of the best performer could predict their narrative comprehension scores. The best performer was the one (or those) who scored the highest in the narrative recall task within the subgroup of participants exposed to the same narrative. For each narrative, if there were more than one best performer, we first assessed the alignment between a participant with each of them, and then got the average. For the non-best-performers (N = 56), their brain alignment with the best performer(s) was measured by Pearson’s correlation using the time course of state expression probability. After that, we computed a Pearson’s correlation between inter-brain alignments and participants’ comprehension scores.</p><p>In addition to the inter-brain alignments with the best performer, we also examined the alignment of each participant’s brain state fluctuations with the group mean, which is supposed to be representative of the systematic response to the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nastase and Gazzola, 2019</xref>). The inter-brain alignment was assessed by iteratively leaving out one participant and calculating the Pearson correlation between the time course of state expression probabilities for the left-out participant and the average time course for the remaining participants. All participants were engaged in the same narrative during this process.</p><p>As a comparison, we also investigated whether the overall engagement of a brain state was associated with task performance. For this purpose, we examined the correlation between participants’ FO and dwell time in each state and their comprehension scores.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-8"><title>Compare brain states across conditions</title><p>Finally, we investigated whether the temporal organization of brain dynamics observed during narrative comprehension was mainly driven by language processing, or instead an intrinsic organization of the dynamic brain. For this purpose, we analyzed the fMRI data from the same group of participants at rest and when listening to an unintelligible narrative told in a foreign language (Mongolian). The scanning parameters as well as the scanning length were identical to the main experiment. The HMM with K = 3 was conducted separately for the two conditions, and then the resulting three brain states were mapped to the corresponding states from the narrative comprehension condition by maximizing the similarity in state activity patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-9"><title>Establishing state correspondence between analyses</title><p>State correspondence between the two datasets and across different conditions was established based on spatial overlap. To assess this overlap, we first extracted each state’s activity values in the nine networks derived from the HMM in the main analyses. Then, for each state identified in other analyses (treated as a candidate state), we calculated its correlation with the three states from the main analyses (treated as the predefined states) in terms of network activity patterns. The predefined state that a candidate state most closely resembled was designated to be its matching state. For instance, if a candidate state showed the strongest correlation with State #1, it was labeled as State #1 accordingly. In cases where two candidate states showed the highest similarity to the same predefined state (e.g. State #1), the candidate state with the stronger correlation was labeled as State #1, and the other was assigned to the predefined state with the next highest correlation. A prime symbol (e.g. State #2') was used to indicate cases where such confusion occurred.</p><p>Given that the spatial layout of the 9-network atlas used in the main analysis does not align well with the Yeo-7 network atlas, we established state correspondence between the two parcellation schemes using evidence of temporal overlap. Specifically, we calculated Pearson’s correlation between each state derived from the Yeo-7 network scheme (treated as a ‘candidate state’) and the three predefined states from the main analysis, based on time courses of state expression probabilities. For each state, the time courses from all 64 participants were concatenated, resulting in 19,200 (300 × 64) time points. The predefined state most similar to each candidate state was designated as its corresponding state.</p><p>To assess the statistical significance of the spatial (and temporal) overlap, we utilized the HMM results from 1000 permutations, where participants’ BOLD time courses were circularly shifted and HMMs were conducted for each permutation. Applying the same state-correspondence strategy described above, we generated a null distribution representing the matches between candidate states and states in the surrogate data.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This research was approved by the Reviewer Board of Beijing Normal University in China.

The authors identified three brain states, characterized by specific patterns of activity and connectivity, that the brain transitions between during story listening. Drawing on a theoretical framework proposed by Berwick et al. (TICS 2023), the authors interpret these states as corresponding to external sensory-motor processing (State 1), lexical processing (State 2), and internal mental representations (State 3). States 1 and 3 were more likely to transition to State 2 than between one another, suggesting that State 2 acts as a transition hub between states.

Across tasks, however, the spatial regions associated with each state varied. For example, state 2 during narrative comprehension was similar to both states 2 and 3 during rest (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the organization of the three states was task dependent.</p><p>The three states identified in the manuscript correspond rather well to areas with short, medium, and long temporal timescales (see Hasson, Chen &amp; Honey, TiCs, 2015). Given the relationship with behavior, where State 1 responds to acoustic properties, State 2 responds to word-level properties, and State 3 responds to clause-level properties, a &quot;single-process&quot; account where the states differ in terms of the temporal window for which one needs to integrate information over may offer a more parsimonious account than a multi-process account where the states correspond to distinct processes. This possibility is mentioned briefly in the introduction, but not developed further.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99997.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Lanfang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Beijing Normal University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jiahao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Beijing Normal University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Hehui</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shenzhen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenzhen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Guosheng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Beijing Normal University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Liu and colleagues applied the hidden Markov model on fMRI to show three brain states underlying speech comprehension.

Additionally, it was unclear if the temporal correlation of the brain state expression was considered when generating the null distribution. It would be helpful to clarify whether the brain state expression time courses were circularly shifted when generating the null.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revision, we generated the null distribution by circularly shifting the state time courses. The results remain consistent with our previous findings: <italic>p</italic> = 0.002 for the speech envelope, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007 for word-level coherence, and <italic>p</italic> = 0.001 for clause-level coherence.</p><p>We note that in other studies which examined the relationship between brain activity and word embedding features, the group-mean correlation values are similarly low but statistically significant and theoretically meaningful (e.g., Fernandino et al., 2022; Oota et al., 2022). We think these relatively low correlations are primarily due to the high level of noise inherent in neural data. Brain activity fluctuations are shaped by a variety of factors, including task-related cognitive processing, internal thoughts, physiological states, as well as arousal and vigilance. Additionally, the narrative features we measured may account for only a small portion of the cognitive processes occurring during the task. As a result, the variance in narrative features can only explain a limited portion of the overall variance in brain activity fluctuations.</p><p>We will replace Figure 3 and the related supplementary figures with new ones, in which the null distribution is generated via circular shift. Furthermore, we will expand our discussion to address why the observed brain-stimuli correlations are relatively small, despite their statistical significance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) A strength of the paper is that the authors repeated the HMM analyses across different tasks (Figure 5) and an independent dataset (Figure S3) and found that the data was consistently best fit by 3 brain states. However, it was not entirely clear to me how well the 3 states identified in these other analyses matched the brain states reported in the main analyses. In particular, the confusion matrices shown in Figure 5 and Figure S3 suggests that that states were confusable across studies (State 2 vs. State 3 in Fig. 5A and S3A, State 1 vs. State 2 in Figure 5B). I don't think this takes away from the main results, but it does call into question the generalizability of the brain states across tasks and populations.</p></disp-quote><p>We identified matching states across analyses based on similarity in the activity patterns of the nine networks. For each candidate state identified in other analyses, we calculate the correlation between its network activity pattern and the three predefined states from the main analysis, and set the one it most closely resembled to be its matching state. For instance, if a candidate state showed the highest correlation with State #1, it was labelled State #1 accordingly.</p><p>Each column in the confusion matrix depicts the similarity of each candidate state with the three predefined states. In Figure S3 (analysis for the replication dataset), the highest similarity occurred along the diagonal of the confusion matrix. This means that each of the three candidate states was best matched to State #1, State #2, and State #3, respectively, maintaining a one-to-one correspondence between the states from two analyses.</p><p>For the comparison of speech comprehension task with the resting and the incomprehensible speech condition, there was some degree of overlap or &quot;confusion.&quot;</p><p>In Figure 5A, there were two candidate states showing the highest similarity to State #2. In this case, we labelled the candidate state with the strongest similarity as State #2, while the other candidate state is assigned as State #3 based on the ranking of similarity. This strategy was also applied to naming of states for the incomprehensible condition. The observed confusion supports the idea that the tripartite-state space is not an intrinsic, task-free property. To make the labeling clearer in the presentation of results, we will use a prime symbol (e.g., State #3') to indicate cases where such confusion occurred, helping to distinguish these ambiguous matches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The three states identified in the manuscript correspond rather well to areas with short, medium, and long temporal timescales (see Hasson, Chen &amp; Honey, TiCs, 2015).</p><p>Given the relationship with behavior, where State 1 responds to acoustic properties, State 2 responds to word-level properties, and State 3 responds to clause-level properties, the authors may want to consider a &quot;single-process&quot; account where the states differ in terms of the temporal window for which one needs to integrate information over, rather than a multi-process account where the states correspond to distinct processes.</p></disp-quote><p>The temporal window hypothesis provides a more fitting explanation for our results. Based on the spatial maps and their modulation by speech features, States #1, #2, and #3 seem to correspond to short, medium, and long processing timescales, respectively.

I've checked Liu et al. (2020), and the dataset contained 43 participants aged 20-75 years, whereas this study contained data from 64 young adults and 30 old adult samples. The previous dataset seems to have two stories, whereas this study seems to have three. Please be specific, given that the dataset does not seem the same. Could the authors also include more descriptions of what the auditory stories were? For example, what were the contents, and how were they recorded?</p></disp-quote><p>The citation is partially incorrect. The dataset of young adults is shared with our work published in (2022). The 64 participants listened to one of three stories told by a female college student in Mandarin, recounting her real-life experience of hiking, a graduate admission interview, and her first time taking a flight, respectively. The sample of older adults is from our work published in (2020), which includes 30 older adults and additionally 13 young adults. The stimuli in this case were two stories told by an older woman in a Chinese dialect, describing her experience in Thailand and riding a warship, respectively. Since we aim to explore whether the main results can be replicated on a different age group, we excluded the 13 young adults from the analysis.</p><p>All the stories were recorded during fMRI scanning using a noise-canceling microphone (FOMRI-III; Optoacoustics Ltd, Or-Yehuda, Israel) positioned above the speaker’s mouth. The audio recordings were subsequently processed offline with Adobe Audition 3.0 (Adobe Systems Inc, USA) to further eliminate MRI scanner noise.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have updated the citation, and provided a more detailed description of the stimuli in the supplementary material. We have also uploaded the audio files along with their corresponding transcriptions to GitHub.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I am curious about individual differences in comprehension scores. Did participants have less comprehension of the audio-narrated story because the story was a hard-tocomprehend narrative or because the audio quality was low? Could the authors share examples of comprehension tests?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe two factors contribute to the individual differences in comprehension scores. First, the audio quality is indeed moderately lower than in dailylife story-listening conditions. This is because those stories were recorded and played during fMRI scanning. Although a noise-canceling equipment was used, there were still some noises accompanying the speech, which may have made speech perception and comprehension more difficult than usual.</p><p>Second, the comprehension test measured how much information about the story (including both main themes and details) participants could recall. Specifically, participants were asked to retell the stories in detail immediately after the scanning session. Following this free recall, the experimenters posed a few additional questions drawn from a pre-prepared list, targeting information not mentioned in their recall. If participants experienced lapses of attention or did not store the incoming information into memory promptly, they might fail to recall the relevant content. In several studies, such a task has been called a narrative recall test. However, memory plays a crucial role in real-time speech comprehension, while comprehension affects the depth of processing during memory encoding, thereby influencing subsequent recall performance. To align with prior work (e.g., Stephens et al., 2010) and our previous publications, we chose to referred to this task as narrative comprehension.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have provided a detailed description about the comprehension test (Line 907-933) and share the examples on GitHub.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Regarding Figure 3, what does it mean for a state occurrence to follow semantic coherence? Is there a theoretical reason why semantic coherence was measured and related to brain state dynamics? A related empirical question is: is it more likely for the brain states to transition from one state to another when nearby time points share low semantic similarity compared to chance?</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed semantic coherence and sound envelope as they capture different layers of linguistic and acoustic structure that unfold over varying temporal scales. Changes in the sound envelope typically occur on the order of milliseconds to a few hundred milliseconds, changes in word-level semantic coherence span approximately 0.24 ± 0.15 seconds, and changes in clause-level semantic coherence extend to 3.2 ± 1.7 seconds. Previous theory and empirical studies suggest that the timescales of information accumulation vary hierarchically, progressing from early sensory areas to higher-order areas (Hasson et al., 2015; Lerner et al., 2011). Based on this work, we anticipate that the three brain states, which are respectively associated with the auditory and sensory motor network, the language network and the DMN, would be selectively modulated by these speech properties corresponding to distinct timescales.</p><p>Accordingly, when a state occurrence aligns with (clause-level) semantic coherence, it suggests that this state is engaged in processing information accumulated at the clause level (i.e., its semantic relationship). Higher coherence facilitates better accumulation, making it more likely for the associated brain state to be activated.</p><p>We analyzed the relationship between state transition probability and semantic coherence, but did not find significant results. Here, the transition probability was calculated as Gamma(t) – Gamma(t-1), where Gamma refers to the state occurrence probability. The lack of significant findings may be because brain state transitions are driven primarily by more slowly changing factors. Indeed, we found the average dwell time of the three states ranges from 9.66 to 15.29s, which is a much slower temporal dynamics compared to the relatively rapid shifts in acoustic/semantic properties.</p><p>In the revised version, we have updated the <italic>Introduction</italic> to clarify the rational for selecting the three speech properties and to explore their relationship with brain dynamics (Line 111-118)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) When running the HMM, the authors iterated K of 2 to 10 and K = 4, 10, and 12. However, the input features of the model consist of only 9 functional networks. Given that the HMM is designed to find low-dimensional latent state sequences, the choice of the number of latent states being higher than the number of input features sounds odd to me - to my speculation, it is bound to generate almost the exact same states as 9 networks and/or duplicates of the same state. I suggest limiting the K iterations from 2 to 8. For replication with Yeo et al.'s 7 networks, K iteration should also be limited to K of less than 7, or optionally, Yeo's 7 network scheme could be replaced with a 17network scheme.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand your concern. However, the determination of the number (K) of hidden states is not directly related to the number of features (in this case, the number of networks), but rather depends on the complexity of the time series and the number of underlying patterns. Given that each state corresponds to a distinct combination of the features, even a small number of features can be used to model a system with complex temporal behaviors and multiple states. For instance, for a system with n features, assuming each is a binary variable (0 or 1), there are maximally 2<sup>n</sup> possible underlying states.</p><p>In our study, we recorded brain activity over 300 time points and used the 9 networks as features. At different time points, the brain can exhibit distinct spatial configurations, reflected in the relative activity levels of the nine networks and their interactions. To accurately capture the temporal dynamics of brain activity, it is essential to explore models that allow for more states than the number of features. We note that in other HMM studies, researchers have also explored states more than the number of networks to find the best number of hidden states (e.g., Ahrends et al., 2022; Stevner et al., 2019).</p><p>Furthermore, Ahrends et al. (2022) suggested that “Based on the HCP-dataset, we estimate as a rule of thumb that the ratio of observations to free parameters per state should not be inferior to 200”, where free parameters per state is [𝐾 ∗(𝐾 −1)+ (𝐾 −1)+𝐾 ∗𝑁 ∗(𝑁 +1)/2]/𝐾. According to this, there should be above 10, 980 observations when the number of states (K) is 10 (the maximal number in our study) and the number of networks (N) is 9. In our group-level HMM model, there were 64 (valid runs) * 300 (TR) = 19200 observations for young adults, and 50 (valid runs) * 210 (TR) = 10500 observations for older adults. Aside from the older adults' data being slightly insufficient (4.37% less than the suggestion), all other hyperparameter combinations in this study meet the recommended number of observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 2, the authors write that the states' spatial maps were normalized for visualization purposes. Could the authors also show visualization of brain states that are not normalized? The reason why I ask is, for example, in Song, Shim, &amp; Rosenberg (2023), the base state was observed which had activity levels all close to the mean (which is 0 because the BOLD activity was normalized). If the activity patterns of this brain state were to be normalized after state estimation, the base state would have looked drastically different than what is reported.</p></disp-quote><p>We derived the spatial maps of the states using unnormalized activity patterns, with the BOLD signals Z-score normalized to a mean of zero. Under the speech comprehension task, the three states exhibited relatively large fluctuations in network activity levels. The activity ranges were as follows: [-0.71 to 0.51] for State #1, [-0.26 to 0.30] for State #2, and [-0.82 to 0.40] for State #3. For the resting state, we observed a state resembling the baseline state as described in Song, Shim, &amp; Rosenberg (2023), with activity values ranging from -0.133 to 0.09.</p><p>In the revision, we have replaced the states' spatial maps with versions showing unnormalized activity patterns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In line 297, the authors speculate that &quot;This may be because there is too much heterogeneity among the older adults&quot;. To support this speculation, the authors can calculate the overall ISC of brain state dynamics among older adults and compare it to the ISC estimated from younger adults.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the overall ISC of brain state dynamics, and found the ISC was indeed significantly lower among the older adults than that among the younger adults. We have revised this statement as follows:</p><p>These factors can diminish the inter-subject correlation of brain state dynamics— indeed, ISCs among older adults were significantly lower than those among younger adults (Figure S5)—and reduce ISC's sensitivity to individual differences in task performance (Line 321-326).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>(7) In Figure 4, the authors showed a significant positive correlation between head movement ISC with the best performer and comprehension scores. Does the average head movement of all individuals negatively correlate with comprehension scores, given that the authors argue that &quot;greater task engagement is accompanied by decreased movement&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We examined the relationship between participants' average head movement across the comprehension task and their comprehension scores. There was no significant correlation (r = 0.041, p = 0.74). In the literature (e.g. ,Ballenghein et al., 2019) , the relationship between task engagement and head movement was also assessed at the moment-by-moment level, rather than by using time-averaged data.</p><p>Real-time head movements reflect fluctuations in task engagement and cognitive state. In contrast, mean head movement, as a static measure, fails to capture these changes, and thus is not effective in predicting task performance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The authors write the older adults sample, the &quot;independent dataset&quot;. Technically, however, this dataset cannot be independent because they were collected at the same time by the same research group. I would advise replacing the word independent to something like second dataset or replication dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the phrase “independent dataset” with “replication dataset”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Pertaining to a paragraph starting in line 586: For non-parametric permutation tests, the authors note that the time courses of brain state expression were &quot;randomly shuffled&quot;. How was this random shuffling done: was this circular-shifted randomly, or were the values within the time course literally shuffled? The latter approach, literal shuffling of the values, does not make a fair null distribution because it does not retain temporal regularities (autocorrelation) that are intrinsic to the fMRI signals. Thus, I suggest replacing all non-parametric permutation tests with random circular shifting of the time series (np. roll in python).</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, the time course was literally shuffled. In the revised version, we circular-shifted the time course randomly (circshift.m in Matlab) to generate the null distribution. The results remain consistent with our previous findings: p = 0.002 for the speech envelope, p = 0.007 for word-level coherence, and p = 0.001 for clause-level coherence (Line 230-235).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) The p value calculation should be p = (1+#(chance&gt;=observed))/(1+#iterations) for one-tailed test and p = (1+#(abs(chance)&gt;=abs(observed)))/(1+#iterations) for twotailed test. Thus, if 5,000 iterations were run and none of the chances were higher than the actual observation, the p-value is p = 1/5001, which is the minimal value it can achieve.</p></disp-quote><p>Have corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) State 3 in Figure S2 does not resemble State 3 of the main result.

The one that the candidate state most closely resembled was set to be its corresponding state. For instance, if a candidate state showed the highest correlation with State #1, it was labelled State #1 accordingly.

First, a state activity value was assigned to each voxel across the whole brain (including a total of 34,892 voxels covered by both parcellation schemes). This is done for each brain state. Next, we calculated Spearman’s correlation between each candidate state obtained by the Yeo-7 scheme and the three predefined states obtained by the nine-network scheme in terms of whole-brain activities.

The spatial overlap between states was quantified by Pearson’s correlation using the activity values (derived from HMM) of the nine networks. For each candidate state identified in other analyses (for the Rest, MG and older-adult datasets), we calculate the correlation between its network activity pattern and the three predefined states from the main analysis (for the young-adults dataset), and set the one it most closely resembled to be its matching state. For instance, if a candidate state showed the highest correlation with State #1, it was labelled State #1 accordingly.</p><p>For the comparison between the young and older adults’ datasets (as shown below), the largest spatial overlap occurred along the diagonal of the confusion matrix, with high correlation values. This means that each of the three candidate states was best matched to State #1, State #2, and State #3, respectively, maintaining a one-to-one correspondence between the states from the two datasets. As the HMM is modelled at the level of networks which lack accurate coordinates, we did not apply the spin-test to assess the statistical significance of overlap. Instead, we extracted the state activity patterns from the 1000 permutations (wherein the original BOLD time courses were circularly shifted and an HMM was conducted) for the older-adults dataset. Applying the similar state-correspondence strategy, we generated a null distribution of spatial overlap. The real overlap of the three states was greater than and 97.97%, 95.34% and 92.39% instances from the permutation (as shown below).</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99997-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>For the comparison of main task with the resting and the incomprehensible speech condition, there was some degree of confusion: there were two candidate states showing the highest similarity to State #2. In this case, we labeled the most similar candidate as State #2. The other candidate was then assigned to the predefined state with which it had the second-highest correlation. We used a prime symbol (e.g., State #3') to denote cases where such confusion occurred. These findings support our conclusion that the tripartite-organization of brain states is not a task-free, intrinsic property.</p><p>When establishing the correspondence between the Yeo-7 network and the ninenetwork parcellation schemes, we primarily relied on evidence from temporal overlap measures, as a clear network-level alignment between the two parcellation schemes is lacking. Temporal overlap was quantified by calculating the correlation of state occurrence probabilities between the two schemes. To achieve this, we concatenated the time courses of 64 participants, resulting in a time series consisting of 19,200 time points (300 time points per participant) for each state. Each of the three candidate states from the Yeo-7 network scheme was best matched to State #1, State #2, and State #3 from the main analyses, respectively. To determine the statistical significance of the temporal overlap, we circular shifted each participant’s time course of state expression obtained from the Yeo-7network scheme for 1000 times. Applying the same strategy to find the matching states, we generated a null distribution of overlap. The real overlap was much higher than the instances from permutation.</p><fig id="sa3fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99997-sa3-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In the revision, we have provided detailed description for how the state correspondence is established and reported the statistical significance of those correspondence (Line 671-699).
