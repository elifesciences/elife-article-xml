tendons to stiff bones is solved by the formation of a unique transitional tissue. Here, we show that murine tendon-to-bone attachment cells are bi-fated, activating a mixture of chondrocyte and tenocyte transcriptomes, under regulation of shared regulatory elements and KrÃ¼ppel-like factors (KLFs) transcription factors. High-throughput bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing of humeral attachment cells revealed expression of hundreds of chondrogenic and tenogenic genes, which was validated by in situ hybridization and single-molecule ISH. ATAC sequencing showed that attachment cells share accessible intergenic chromatin areas with either tenocytes or chondrocytes. Epigenomic analysis revealed enhancer signatures for most of these regions. Transgenic mouse enhancer reporter assays verified the shared activity of some of these enhancers. Finally, integrative chromatin and motif analyses and transcriptomic data implicated KLFs as regulators of attachment cells. Indeed, blocking expression of both <italic>Klf2</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic> in developing limb mesenchyme impaired their differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>musculoskeletal system</kwd><kwd>cartilage</kwd><kwd>tendon</kwd><kwd>enthesis</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AR055580</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zelzer</surname><given-names>Elazar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HG003988</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Visel</surname><given-names>Axel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant No. 345/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zelzer</surname><given-names>Elazar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001658</institution-id><institution>Minerva Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant No. 713533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zelzer</surname><given-names>Elazar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>David and Fela Shapell Family Center for Genetic Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zelzer</surname><given-names>Elazar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Estate of Mr. and Mrs. van Adelsberge</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zelzer</surname><given-names>Elazar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005595</institution-id><institution>University of California</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEAC02-05CH11231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Osterwalder</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PCEFP3_186993</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Osterwalder</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The molecular identity of bi-fated tendon-to-bone attachment cells, which display a mixture of transcriptomes of two neighboring cell types, enables the formation of the unique transitional tissue of the enthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The function of the musculoskeletal system relies on the proper assemblage of its components, namely skeletal tissues (bone, cartilage, and joints), muscles, and tendons. However, the attachment of tissues composed of materials with large differences in their mechanical properties is highly challenging. In the musculoskeleton, elastic tendons, which have a Youngâs modulus (a measure of stiffness) in the order of 200 megapascal, are attached to the much harder bone, with a modulus in the order of 20 gigapascal. This disparity makes the connection between these two tissues a mechanical weak point, which is subject to higher incidence of tearing by both external and internal forces acting on the musculoskeleton during movement. The evolutionary solution to this problem is the enthesis, a transitional tissue that displays a gradual shift in cellular and extracellular properties from the tendon side through to the bone side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Genin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lu and Thomopoulos, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thomopoulos et al., 2003</xref>). Yet, despite its importance, the formation of this cellular gradient as well as the underlying molecular mechanism remain largely unknown.</p><p>In recent years, the initial events that lead to the formation of the embryonic attachment unit (AU), which serves as the primordium of the enthesis, have started to be investigated. These studies identified the progenitors of the AU and showed that they express both the chondrogenic and tenogenic transcription factors <italic>Sox9</italic> and scleraxis (<italic>Scx</italic>), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sugimoto et al., 2013</xref>). The patterning of the <italic>Sox9<sup>+</sup>/Scx<sup>+</sup></italic> progenitors along the skeleton is regulated by a genetic program that includes several transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eyal et al., 2019</xref>). Next, <italic>Sox9<sup>+</sup>/Scx<sup>+</sup></italic> progenitors differentiate to chondrocytes, which form a bone eminence on one side, or to tenocytes, which form the tendon on the other side, whereas the cells in between differentiate into <italic>Gli1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells that eventually will form the enthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Felsenthal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schwartz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwartz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Both molecular and mechanical signals regulate the AU. TGFÎ² signaling regulates the specification of AU progenitors, whereas BMP and FGF signaling as well as mechanical signals determine their fate and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blitz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roberts et al., 2019</xref>). Postnatal enthesis cells have been termed fibrocartilage cells based on their histological appearance, because they display morphological features that are shared with tenocytes and chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thomopoulos et al., 2010</xref>). In recent years, several studies have identified some of the genes that these cells express, including collagens type I, II, and X; Indian hedgehog (<italic>Ihh</italic>); parathyroid hormone-related peptide (<italic>Pthlh</italic>); patched 1 (<italic>Ptc1</italic>); runt-related transcription factor 2 (<italic>Runx2</italic>); tenascin C (<italic>Tnc</italic>); and biglycan (<italic>Bgn</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thomopoulos et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, these genes are also expressed by cells in the neighboring tissues, namely by chondrocytes or tenocytes. However, despite these advances, a comprehensive molecular signature of this tissue and the mechanism that enables its formation are still missing.</p><p>In this work, we aimed to decipher the identity of the fibrocartilage cells that form the attachment tissue between tendon and bone. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses of the attachment cells, which were validated by in situ hybridization (ISH) and single-molecule fluorescent ISH (smFISH), showed that these cells express a mix of the transcriptomes of chondrocytes and tenocytes. Chromatin analysis further verified the transcriptomic results and provided a mechanistic explanation for the bi-fated behavior of attachment cells, which share enhancers with their neighboring tenocytes or chondrocytes. Finally, we identify the transcription factors KLF2 and KLF4 as regulators of attachment cell differentiation. Overall, we provide the transcriptional as well as the epigenetic mechanism that allows attachment cells to activate a combination of cartilage and tendon transcriptomes and, thereby, the formation of the unique transitional tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Attachment cell transcriptome is a mix of chondrocyte and tenocyte transcriptomes</title><p>To date, the transcriptome of attachment cells has not been characterized thoroughly. We therefore analyzed the transcriptome of embryonic day (E) 14.5 attachment cells from the prominent deltoid tuberosity and greater tuberosity of the humerus. With the goal to isolate these cells specifically, we generated a compound mouse by crossing three mouse lines, namely <italic>Col2a1-Cre</italic>, <italic>R26R-tdTomato</italic>, and <italic>Scx-GFP</italic> (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sugimoto et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the fluorescent reporter tdTomato labeled <italic>Col2a1</italic>-expressing chondrocytes, whereas GFP fluorescently labeled <italic>Scx</italic>-expressing tenocytes. Unexpectedly, the two reporters failed to label the attachment cells that were located in between these two populations. This failure might be due to a missing regulatory element in one of the constructs that were used to produce each transgenic reporter. Nevertheless, the borders between tendon and attachment cells and between cartilage and attachment cells were clearly demarcated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We therefore used laser capture microdissection (LCM) to subdivide the attachment site into three cellular compartments, namely attachment cells, adjacent tenocytes, and adjacent chondrocytes. As controls, samples were also taken from two more compartments, remote tenocytes and remote chondrocytes. Initial analysis of the different transcriptomes using principal components analysis (PCA) showed that the transcriptomes of tenocytes and chondrocytes were clearly separated, whereas attachment cells were located between the two cell types, recapitulating their anatomical positions. This suggests that the attachment cell transcriptome is shared with both chondrocytes and tenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, PC1Â 31.66%).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptomic analysis of tendon-to-bone attachment site domains at E14.5.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â A scheme of tendon-to-bone attachment site of the murine deltoid tuberosity.

To identify such factors, we used Genomatix to analyze accessible elements that were associated with differentially expressed genes for over-representation of transcription-factor-binding sites (TFBS), selecting the top 50 TFBS families, and then mining our transcriptomic data for the expression of these TFBS families (see Materials and methods).

Next, we analyzed the enhancers that were shown by the bioinformatic analysis to be active in attachment cells and either tenocytes or chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Three of these enhancers had Klf2-binding sites in their sequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), further supporting a potential role for KLFs during attachment site development.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated that Klf2 and Klf4 are functionally redundant, as KLF4 hasÂ ~90% sequence similarity to KLF2 in its zinc finger DNA-binding domain, suggesting that these factors could have common target sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiplunkar et al., 2013</xref>).

Transverse histological sections through the deltoid tuberosity of E15.5 control mice showed that the attachment cells were packed together and surrounded by ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Daâ</xref>). In contrast, in the putative attachment site of <italic>Prx1-Klf2-Klf4</italic> double conditional knockout (dcKO) embryos, the cells were sparse with reduced ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Dbâ</xref>). By E18.5, this difference was more pronounced, as attachment cells failed to differentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Dcâ,dâ</xref>).

differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we describe the unique transcriptome that allows cells of the attachment between tendon and bone to act as a transitional tissue. The ability to activate a combination of chondrogenic and tenogenic transcriptomes is regulated by sharing enhancers with these cells. Finally, we identify the transcription factors KLF2/4 as regulators of these unique bi-fated cells.</p><p>The existence of borders between tissues that differ in cell type, extracellular matrix composition, structure, and function raises the question of how tissues are connected. The border can be sharp, as seen in blood vessels, where pericytes and endothelial cells are separated by a basement membrane, or between the esophagus and the stomach in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergers and Song, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">San Roman and Shivdasani, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, the border can be less defined histologically and molecularly, thus forming a transitional tissue. Examples for the latter are the borders between the sections of the small intestine and between tendon and boneÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Romih et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">San Roman and Shivdasani, 2011</xref>). From a broader perspective, as all organs and systems are made of different tissues, understanding the biology of border tissues is imperative. Moreover, some of these border tissues are involved in various pathologies. For example, gastric cancers may emerge from distinct anatomical areas, such as the esophagusâstomach boundaryÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chawengsaksophak, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDonald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">San Roman and Shivdasani, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In the case of the attachment between tendon and bone, the significance of this tissue is demonstrated by enthesopathies, a collective name for injuries and pathologies of the enthesis. For example, over 30% of the population over the age of 60 will injure their shoulderâs rotator cuff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lehman et al., 1995</xref>). Failure rates of surgical reattachment range from 20% for small tears to 94% for repair of massive tears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galatz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harryman et al., 1991</xref>). The high failure and recurrence rates of these procedures highlight the need for understanding the biology of this complex transitional tissue of the enthesis. This understanding may allow the development of new strategies to improve the treatment of enthesopathies.</p><p>There are two options to form a transitional tissue. The first strategy is by mixing cells from the two neighboring tissues, such as in the epithelia of the urinary tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Romih et al., 2005</xref>). Alternatively, the border cells can express a mixture of the transcriptomes of the two neighboring cell types. As we show here, the attachment cells represent the latter strategy well, as they express a high number of genes that are differentially expressed by either tenocytes or chondrocytes. These cells display morphological features that are shared with tenocytes and chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thomopoulos et al., 2010</xref>). Our results therefore provide a molecular explanation for the age-old histological definition of enthesis cells as fibrocartilage, which was based on their morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thomopoulos et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the finding of mixed matrix genes in the transcriptome of the attachment cells may provide a mechanism for the formation of a transitional tissue, which allows safe transfer of forces by the tendon between muscle and bone.</p><p>In addition to expression of chondrogenic and tenogenic genes, we identified genes that are uniquely expressed by attachment cells. These genes may provide another level of specificity to the regulation of the development of this unique tissue. Finally, our scRNA- seq of the attachment cells revealed heterogeneity, which was a consequence of varying levels of chondrogenic and tenogenic gene expression. This heterogeneity may represent the differentiation processes thatÂ the <italic>Sox9/Scx-</italic>positive progenitors undergo during development, ultimately leading to their terminal cell fate.</p><p>Our finding that attachment cells are bi-fated raises the question of the mechanism that underlies this fate. An immediate implication of our finding is that there must be an epigenetic mechanism that supports the bi-fated state. The observed chromatin accessibility at the sites of the promoters of most of the shared genes in all three cell types rules out the possibility of limited promoter accessibility as the main mechanism. By contrast, the high percentage of shared accessible intergenic sites between attachment cells and one group of flanking cells, thatÂ is chondrocytes or tenocytes, suggests that this is the main mechanism. Moreover, many of these shared sites correlated with putative enhancers in ENCODE datasets. Finally, we verified the ability of three different enhancers from that list to drive gene expression in attachment cells and in either tendon or cartilage. These findings strongly support our hypothesis that the regulatory mechanism is based on the ability of attachment cells to share enhancers with either chondrocytes or tenocytes in order to drive the mixed expression profile of these bi-fated cells. It is important to emphasize that we have also identified a group of intergenic elements that were accessible exclusively in attachment cells. These attachment-specific elements may act as enhancers that drive the expression of genes that are specific toÂ attachment cells. It is, of course, possible that they participate in the regulation of shared genes as well. Overall, both sets of putative enhancers, namely shared and attachment cell-specific, may play important roles in the genetic program that regulates the development of this unique tissue.</p><p>Sharing enhancers is not the only possible strategy for the generation of aÂ mixed transcriptome. A simple alternative would be a specific set of enhancers to be used by the attachment cells. A possible explanation for the sharing strategy is the common origin of all these cells, which is limb mesenchyme originating from lateral plate mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson and Tabin, 1997</xref>). It is possible that during development, limb mesenchymal progenitors display highly accessible chromatin; yet, during differentiation, this accessibility is restricted to prevent the expression of genes from alternate lineages. In contrast to this restriction process, in the bi-fated attachment cells the shared sites are maintained accessible to allow the expression of the mixed transcriptome. A mechanism for silencing of genes of alternate lineages was previously described. For example, polycomb-repressed chromatin leads to silencing of genes of alternate lineages, leading to the commitment to a specific cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aldiri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laugesen and Helin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, previous studies demonstrated the importance of chromatin repression in the developing limb, showing how deletion of <italic>Ezh2</italic>, which acts as the enzymatically active subunit of PRC2, leads to skeletal malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deimling et al., 2018</xref>). This obviously raises the question of the mechanism that prevents this silencing in attachment cells.</p><p>It is clear that we cannot exclude the possibility that an active mechanism, such as the SWI/SNF remodeling complexes, opens the chromatin structure in bi-fated cells to allow attachment cell dual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2011</xref>). However, such a mechanism cannot explain why the strategy of shared enhancers was selected. Finally, a mixed transcriptome is one of the hallmarks of stem cell pluripotency, as progenitor cells eventually chose one fate over the other upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings suggest a different strategy, where using both programs facilitates the establishment of a specific attachment tissue. Overall, our results reveal a novel function for chromatin state, which allows the activation of two sets of genes in a third cell type to create a new cell fate that forms a transitional tissue.</p><p>KLF2 and KLF4 are known to regulate several biological processes, such as promoting the differentiation of gut and skin (KLF4, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Segre et al., 1999</xref>]) as well as the immune system (KLF2, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuo et al., 1997</xref>]), maintaining pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (KLF2 and KLF4, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2008</xref>]), and, together with other factors, inducing pluripotency to generate iPSC by reprogramming (KLF4, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>]). Several works describe the involvement of KLF2 and KLF4 in the musculoskeletal system. In bones, <italic>Klf4</italic> over-expression in osteoblasts caused delayed bone development, in addition to impaired blood vessel invasion and osteoclast recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Michikami et al., 2012</xref>). Another study showed that KLF2/4 are expressed during chick limb development in tendons and ligaments as part of the genetic program that regulates connective tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orgeur et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies showed that KLF2 and KLF4 display high similarity in protein sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shields and Yang, 1997</xref>), suggesting that these factors could have common target sequences and may be functionally redundant. Indeed, loss of both KLF2 and KLF4 during embryogenesis led to abnormal blood vessel development and early lethality. This phenotype was more severe than what was observed in embryos that lost only KLF2 or KLF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiplunkar et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, previous work identified 313 target genes shared between KLF2 and KLf4, suggesting that they overlap in regulating gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orgeur et al., 2018</xref>). In this work, we show that KLF2/4 are central regulators of the attachment site. While the attachment did form initially in their absence, the subsequent differentiation failed, suggesting that KLF2/4 play a role at this stage. While we concentrated in this study on the attachment site, it is most likely that KLF2/4 play a role also in other musculoskeletal tissues such as the skeleton, tendon, and muscle. This possibility is supported by previous studies, where KLF2/4 were shown to be expressed in osteoblasts, chondrocytes, tenocytes, and muscle connective tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Michikami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orgeur et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies demonstrate the role of muscle-induced mechanical load in the development of attachment site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blitz et al., 2009</xref>). In that context, our finding that KLF2/4 regulate the differentiation of attachment cells is interesting, because previous works have shown that these factors are mechanically regulated. It was shown in mice that shear stress on the vessels induced by blood flow leads to upregulation of <italic>Klf2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). Additional in vitro studies showed that KLF2 and KLF4 are influenced by shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiplunkar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dekker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Villarreal et al., 2010</xref>). It is therefore possible that these factors are regulated by muscle forces, leading to the proper differentiation and maturation of the attachment site.</p><p>The ability of KLF2/4 to regulate gene expression in the attachment site is supported by our finding that many of the genes that were expressed by attachment cells had in their regulatory region KLF2/4 binding sites. Yet, it is clear that not all of them share this property, suggesting that these two factors are part of a larger transcriptional network. For example, our bioinformatic analysis identified other TF families such as GLIâs, RUNXâs, and NFIâs as regulators of the attachment sites. <italic>Gli1</italic> was previously reported as a marker for enthesis cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dyment et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Felsenthal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwartz et al., 2015</xref>). Since gene expression by attachment cells is regulated by sharing enhancers with chondrocytes or tenocytes, it is reasonable to assume that some regulators of these cells might be part of the network that regulates the attachment cells. Indeed, loss of the tendon regulator <italic>Scx</italic> in mice led to failure of attachment cells to differentiate. Additionally, loss of the chondrogenic regulator <italic>Sox9</italic> in <italic>Scx</italic>-expressing cells led to failure in attachment site formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blitz et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>To conclude, by characterizing the transcriptome and chromatin landscape of tendon-to-bone attachment cells, we provide a molecular understanding of the bi-fated identity of these cells. Moreover, by identifying the transcription factors KLF2/4 as central regulators and the strategy of sharing enhancers with either tenocytes or chondrocytes, we provide a mechanism that regulates these bi-fated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These findings present a new concept for the formation of a border tissue, which is based on the simultaneous expression of a mixed transcriptome of the two flanking cell types by the intermediate cells. This strategy allows the formation of a unique transitional tissue without developing de novo a dedicated genetic program that regulates a third, new cell fate.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of bi-fated tendon-to-bone attachment cells thatÂ are regulated by shared enhancers and KLF transcription factors.</title><p>Tenocytes (green, left) and chondrocytes (red, right) express tenogenic (i.e. Col1a1) or chondrogenic (i.e. Col11a1) genes, respectively, whereas attachment cells (yellow, middle) express both chondrogenic and tenogenic genes to form the attachment site. Attachment cells duality of gene expression is regulated epigenetically by intergenic chromatin areas, which are accessible in these cells and in either tenocytes or chondrocytes. Additionally, at the transcriptional level, the transcription factors KLF2/4 are expressed by attachment cells and regulate their differentiation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55361-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>For Key Resources Table, see Appendix.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The generation of floxed <italic>Klf2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2006</xref>), floxed <italic>Klf4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katz et al., 2002</xref>), <italic>Prx1-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Logan et al., 2002</xref>), <italic>Sox9-CreER</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Soeda et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Col2-CreER<sup>T</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakamura et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>Col2a1-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ovchinnikov et al., 2000</xref>), <italic>R26R-tdTomato</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>), and <italic>Scx-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pryce et al., 2007</xref>) mice have been described previously.</p><p>To create <italic>Col2a1-CreER</italic>, <italic>R26R-tdTomato</italic>, <italic>Sox9-CreER, R26R-tdTomato,</italic> and <italic>Col2a1-Cre, R26R-tdTomato</italic> reporter mice, all on the background of <italic>Scx-GFP</italic>, floxed <italic>R26R-tdTomato</italic> mice were mated with <italic>Col2a1-CreER</italic>, <italic>Sox9-CreER</italic> or <italic>Col2a1-Cre</italic> mice, respectively.

Embryos were sampled and stained at E14.5. Embryos were excluded from further analysis if they did not carry the reporter transgene. All mouse works were reviewed and approved by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Animal Welfare and Research Committee.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Nitzan Konstantin for expert editorial assistance, Dr. Douglas Lutz and service engineer Tal Alon (Getter Bio-Med, Zeiss) for LCM calibration, Neria Sharabi from the Department of Veterinary Resources, Weizmann Institute, and all Zelzer lab members for suggestions and advice.

a mixture of chondrocyte and tenocyte transcriptomes, under the regulation of shared regulatory elements and KLF transcription factors, notably KLF2 and KLF4. The report provides novel insights into the yet unknown molecular and cellular architecture of the tendon-to-bone attachments, and hence is seen to be both novel and medically relevant.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Bi-fated tendon-to-bone attachment cells are regulated by shared enhancers and KLF transcription factors&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript from Kult and colleagues focuses on the transcriptional regulation of a unique set of cells located between bone and tendon known as the attachment unit. Using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, the authors investigate shared and unique transcriptional programs and accessible genomic regions. The ATACseq and epigenome profiling reveals transcriptional enhancers, with overlapping intergenic areas between bifated and both fates. Transgenic enhancer reporters expose common enhancers for tenocytes and chondrocytes. <italic>Klf2</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic> were identified as critically required for differentiation. These findings lead the authors to propose that bi-fated attachment cells that connect tendon to bone. Previous studies showed that these cells express cartilage and tendon markers so the present study would need to clearly highlight the advances made compared to previous work. As a general note for example, the co-option of existing enhancers does not rule out the existence of de novo ones. This needs to be addressed clearly in the study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The test of enhancers by transgenesis is somewhat limited in scope (only 8 tested) and yields some surprising results that can be explored further. An important request would be to make sure of the reproducibility of experiments. It is said that 5 out of 8 selected elements drove expression in the forelimb, but not how many attempts were done for the negative ones. Moreover, as reported in the transparent report form, N=1 for <italic>Col1a1</italic> element, N=3 for <italic>Klf2</italic> element, N=2 for <italic>Sox9</italic> element, N=3 for Mgp element, N=4 for <italic>Col11a1</italic>. The reviewers understand that a site-directed approach is likely to be more reproducible that random insertion, it is recommended to examine at least 3 instances per element, to be certain of some surprising results. For example, although <italic>Sox9</italic> is not expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes, the <italic>Sox9</italic> element drives expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Moreover, <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Klf2</italic> elements drive expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes but not in AU cells. If these results are confirmed, they may cast doubt on the conclusion that co-option of enhancers is the (only) mechanism that regulates expression in AU cells.</p><p>2) The authors have not systemically looked for AU enhancers that are not shared with tenocytes or chondrocytes. Combined ATAC-seq dataset and published ChIP-seq of histone marks can potentially identify new enhancers. The authors could speculate or assess if those enhancers were acquired de novo and exclusive of AU cells.</p><p>3) Figure 1A, the authors present a PCA biplot : Can they be more specific on how the data were transformed prior the dimension reduction (FPKM, VST, Log transformed, CPMâ¦?). How many genes were taken into account in the PCA; All or as it is more commonly done on the 500 most variant ones ?</p><p>4) Figure 1 C â GO terms found are very generic, this information does not really seem to be useful. Can the authors can be more specific on the parameters they used in their GSEA analysis : test used and p-value correction (FDR q-value suggests a Benjamin and Hochberg correction, it that right ?</p><p>5) In general, one has to give the detail on the software version (including package version) and OS type used for the bioinformatic analysis, these informations are missing from the manuscript.</p><p>6) In the sentence: &quot;This suggests that the attachment cell transcriptome is largely shared with both chondrocytes and tenocytes (Figure 1A, PC1 52.47%)&quot;, the word largely is misleading.</p><p>7) The authors do not discuss the variation both on the first and the second PC and of the attachment samples. This is a big issue because there are only 2 samples for this category of cells in which the intra-group variability is very high. This leads to a poor statistical parameter estimation giving rise to poor statistical test outcome.</p><p>8) Legend of Figure 1: The term MARS-Seq is slightly misleading as it is usually associated with single cell RNAseq analysis. For clarity, please write instead bulk-MARS-Seq.</p><p>9) &quot;To further support our initial observation that the transcriptome of the attachment cells is a mixture of chondrocyte and tenocyte transcriptomes, we clustered the statistically significant differentially expressed genes between all samples into 5 clusters, using CLICK&quot;. Same remark as the use of contrasts in DESeq2.</p><p>10) In the sentence : &quot;From these two clusters, 374 genes, 320 of them tenogenic and 54 chondrogenic, were also found to be expressed by attachment cells.&quot; It is unclear what &quot;so found to be expressed by attachment cells&quot; mean? For instance, for the tenogenic markers, does this mean that in the attachment vs. chondrocytes comparison these genes are up-regulated in the attachment cells? In that case, how are the tenogenic markers defined, using the tenocytes vs chondrocytes comparison? Would it be possible to have a Venn diagram to help follow the process to define the different marker identifications? Has a simpler method using contrasts in DESeq2 been tested? If yes, do the results converge with the ones presented here? Are these &quot;statistically significant differentially expressed genes between all samples&quot; coming from a pairwise wald-test or a likelihood ratio test? the Materials and methods suggest that the wald-test was used. Please clarify.</p><p>11) In a previous study the authors investigated the emergence of the attachment unit (AU) with focus on bone eminence progenitors (co-expressing <italic>Sox9</italic> and SCX up to E12.5 and expressed Col2 after E12.5 according to Col2a1CreERT2 lineage tracing). Here, they focus on the transcriptome of E14.5 attachment cells from the deltoid tuberosity, however these appear to be different from tuberosity progenitors (adjacent chondrocytes) as described in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1. A better definition of what is defined as attachment unit in this paper vs previous papers and/or the AU subcompartments would help clarify the populations that are being examined.</p><p>12) Moreover, as the constitutive Col2a1Cre did not label the AU, but in the previous study did label the AU/bone eminence progenitors, it is unclear what the exact definition of AU is.</p><p>13) When using the Col2a1-Cre, R26R-tdTomato and Scx-GFP, the authors mention : Unexpectedly, the two reporters failed to label the attachment cells that were located in between these two populations. This failure might be due to a missing regulatory element in one of the constructs that was used to produce each transgenic reporter. However, in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1, subpopulation 5 seems to have SCX+ cells. Is this an error of labelling? What is the orientation of this section?</p><p>14) For FACS and ATACseq analysis the authors use Sox9CreERT2;tdTomato;SCX-GFP and Col2CreERT2;tdTomato;SCX-GFP. It is not clear why for FACS the Col2CREERT2 line is used while for LCM the constitutive one is used. Moreover, as previously reported, they isolate attachment cells as double positive <italic>SOX9</italic>/SCX cells. Here again, do the cells taken for analysis include those of the tuberosity itself? Col2CreERT2 with Tamox at E12.5 should be labeling the tuberosity too. It is unclear which cells from which Cre/reporter combination have been used for the ATACseq experiments of Figure 3.</p><p>15) For Figure 2, a scheme showing where exactly in the bone we are located and how it has been sectioned would be helpful. Also, it would be nice to perform single molecule FISH on top of Col2Cre:R26TOM:SCX lineage tracing to show the specificity of the colocalization in the &quot;double reporter-negative&quot; area. Also, including the KLF2/4 FISH at this point would help visualize distinctions between genes belonging to cluster 5 (unique to AU) vs genes referred as mixed transcriptome (Wwp2, Bgn).</p><p>16) The authors propose a role of <italic>Klf2/4</italic> in attachment differentiation. What is the temporality in expression of <italic>Klf2/4</italic> vs the putative downstream factors such as Gli1, Col5a1?</p><p>17) In ISH figures, some cells in the cartilage compartment also seem to coexpress tenocyte/cartilage markers. Can the authors comment on that?</p><p>18) How did the authors adapt MARS-Seq (a single cell RNA seq pipeline taking advantage of cell sorting) to a bulk analysis? More specifically, it isn't clear how laser capture technique was combined with the MARS-seq protocol.</p><p>19) The resolution on the single molecule FISH does not allow to really appreciate a large coexpression of the presented markers in the area.</p><p>20) Figure 4: Could the authors indicate more clearly the demarcation between cartilage and connective tissue where double labeling is found?</p><p>21) It would be interesting to know if the loss of the gene expression in Figure 5 results in a morphological abnormal attachment at later postnatal stages. If the authors have looked, it would be helpful to comment in the Discussion or include the data. How much of the intermediate gene expression program in the attachment site is dependent upon Klf regulation?</p><p>22) Is this transcriptional state-sharing permanent or transitional? Their work could be nicely contrasted and compared with some studies examining transcriptional heterogeneity/the co-expression of multiple cell fates as a mechanism cells used to transition from (multipotent) progenitor states to committed fates. Enthesis tissue would be an interesting and unique situation where possibly this intermediate shared transcriptional state is maintained to generate a new cell type. Possible references for transcriptional heterogeneity in progenitors include: Soldatov et al., 2019 and Johnson et al., 2015.</p><p>23) The section on the AEG/esophagus-stomach boundary should be better integrated with their own data or removed from the Discussion. It was not clearly stated how these two tissues are similar other than being border tissues. It is recommended to expand this section to include more specific examples how these regions (enthesis and esophagus) are related. Perhaps this esophageal boundary has also been shown to have a shared transcriptional/epigenetic state with neighboring tissues?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55361.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) The test of enhancers by transgenesis is somewhat limited in scope (only 8 tested) and yields some surprising results that can be explored further.

The paper that describes the new site-directed transgenic analysis method that we used (termed âenSERTâ, for âenhancer INSERTIONâ) has been published very recently (Kvon et al., 2020). This publication informs about the superior specificity and reproducibility of this new approach, as verified by extensive analyses in mouse embryos. This method, which uses CRISPR/Cas9 for site-directed integration (knock-in) of LacZ reporter transgenes at the <italic>H11</italic> safe-harbor locus, allows in vivo validation of enhancer activity with higher accuracy and specificity than previous, mostly random integration-based methods. Specifically, enSERT allows to achieve âan average transgenic rate of 50% for transgenes as large as 11 kb (based on &gt;1,200 transgenic mice resulting from the injection of &gt;150 independent transgenic constructs), compared to a 12% transgenic rate observed in conventional random transgenesis (based on &gt;3,000 independent transgenic constructs)â (Kvon et al., 2020).</p><p>In Kvon et al. (Figure S2), the reliable reproducibility of the method was confirmed at E11.5 in a wide range of embryonic tissues, e.g. limbs, brain and heart. Typically, site-specific multi-copy transgenic insertion events resulted in the most sensitive (and reproducible) patterns of enhancer activity (see Materials and methods subsection âTandem integration at H11â in Kvon et al.).</p><p>In our study, we leveraged the reliable nature of enSERT to validate in vivo multiple enhancer regions at E14.5 that had been predicted by our ATAC-seq experiments. The majority of tested regions indeed revealed in vivo enhancer activities with superior reproducibility in multiple tissues. For example, while mm1988 (<italic>Klf2</italic> element) displayed reproducible patterns in craniofacial tissues and limbs, mm1990 (Mgp element) had reproducible patterns specifically in limbs (n=3/3 for both).</p><p>Regarding the number of examined embryos, we updated and increased the number of repetitions. We examined at least 3 embryos per enhancer and, in some cases, between 6 and 11 repetitions were made. As the reviewers suggested, we have also added the transgenic reproducibility numbers (X/Y) to Figure 4. As is the standard in the field, we compare the number of embryos with sub-regionally reproducible LacZ staining (X) to the total number of transgenic embryos obtained per tested genomic element.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref>, while some of the elements, such as the <italic>Klf2</italic> element mm1988, displayed a high and extremely convincing reproducibly rate (N=3/3), limb-specific reproducible staining for the Col1 element mm1995 was observed in only 2 out of 9 embryos. Nevertheless, because we confirmed the limb-subregional reproducibility (on sections) in two independent biological replicates and because this element was selected based on our limb-specific ATAC-seq and ENCODE datasets of histone modification marks associated with enhancers and promoters (H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq), we have reasons to believe that this result is real and represents the activity of a Col1 enhancer in attachment and tendon cells.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="anchor"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><bold>Vista ID</bold></th><th><bold>N</bold></th><th><bold>Reproducible staining</bold></th><th><bold>Limb</bold></th><th><bold>Notes:</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><bold>mm1986</bold></td><td>3/6</td><td>Craniofacial</td><td>Negative</td><td/></tr><tr><td><bold>mm1995</bold></td><td>2/9</td><td>Limb</td><td>Positive*</td><td>* Scored as ârandom integrationâ (Kvon et al., Cell 2020).</td></tr><tr><td><bold>mm1988</bold></td><td>3/3</td><td>Various</td><td>Positive</td><td/></tr><tr><td><bold>mm1989</bold></td><td>4/7</td><td>Limb</td><td>Positive</td><td/></tr><tr><td><bold>mm1990</bold></td><td>3/3</td><td>Limb</td><td>Positive</td><td/></tr><tr><td><bold>mm1991</bold></td><td>11/11</td><td>Limb, other structures with less penetrance</td><td>Positive</td><td/></tr><tr><td><bold>mm1992</bold></td><td>0/6</td><td>None</td><td>Negative</td><td>2 embryos displayed non-reproducible or background LacZ staining</td></tr><tr><td><bold>mm1994</bold></td><td>0/9</td><td>None</td><td>Negative</td><td>5 embryos displayed non-reproducible or background LacZ staining</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>One explanation for the reduced reproducibility of Col1 element may be the temporal in vivo changes in enhancer usage during development. Previous studies have shown that enhancers exhibited tightly temporally restricted predicted activity windows (Nord et al., Cell 2013). It is therefore possible that mm1995 element activity at E14.5 exemplifies the start or end of this element activity window. We therefore agree that in order to establish mm1995 as an enhancer, additional repetitions are required. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 situation, we do not know when this will be possible. Therefore, if the reviewers approve, we would like to keep this result in our manuscript. Obviously, we clearly state its limitation.</p><p>We fully agree with the reviewers that de novo enhancers may play a role in the regulation of attachment cells in addition to co-option of enhancers (i.e. sharing of elements with tendon or cartilage cells). This issue is discussed in detail in our next answer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors have not systemically looked for AU enhancers that are not shared with tenocytes or chondrocytes.

It is important to emphasize that we do not exclude the possibility that attachment cells express a unique set of genes. However, our main purpose in this manuscript is to describe the dual fate of attachment cells. Yet, to accommodate the reviewerâs concern, we have included a list of genes that we identified to be expressed specifically in the AU. In addition, we also identified a group of intergenic elements that were accessible specifically in attachment cells. These elements may act as enhancers that drive gene expression in the attachment cells, thereby providing another level of specificity to the regulation of the development of this unique tissue. We have added a table listing these intergenic regions (newly added Supplementary file 1). Among the genes that are associated with AU-specific elements, we identified several transcription factors such as <italic>Klf4</italic>, <italic>Runx3</italic> and <italic>Nfia</italic>, in addition to ECM-associated genes such as <italic>Col11a1</italic> and <italic>Col1a1</italic>. As the reviewers suggested, we have added text to the Results and Discussion sections describing these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1A, the authors present a PCA biplot : Can they be more specific on how the data were transformed prior the dimension reduction (FPKM, VST, Log transformed, CPMâ¦?).

Briefly, the analysis included adapter trimming, mapping to the mm9 genome, collapsing of reads with the same unique molecular identifiers (UMI) of 4 bases (R2) and counting of the number of reads per gene with HTseq-count (Anders et al., 2015), using the most 3â 1000 bp of each RefSeqâs transcript.

Third, we averaged the normalized number of reads in attachment samples of each gene on this list and selected genes with 30 normalized reads or more.

In this work, the term AU refers to the tissue that forms between tendon and cartilage, as explained in the previous response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) When using the Col2a1-Cre, R26R-tdTomato and Scx-GFP, the authors mention : Unexpectedly, the two reporters failed to label the attachment cells that were located in between these two populations. This failure might be due to a missing regulatory element in one of the constructs that was used to produce each transgenic reporter. However, in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1, subpopulation 5 seems to have SCX+ cells. Is this an error of labelling? What is the orientation of this section?</p></disp-quote><p>The orientation of this section is transverse. When observing a series of transverse sections from E14.5 forelimbs, we identified in each section Col2+ labeled cells, Scx-GFP+ labeled cells and, between them, cells that were unlabeled. Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 is one of many collected sections in which subpopulation 5 is of unlabeled cells. Regarding GFP-labelled cells at the margins of the laser-captured area, to maximize the size of extracted tissue, we stretched the borders of the AU all the way to the flanking Scx-GFP+ cells. When the laser cuts the piece of tissue it burns the boundaries, so the RNA in cells located at the boundaries is degraded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) For FACS and ATACseq analysis the authors use Sox9CreERT2;tdTomato;SCX-GFP and Col2CreERT2;tdTomato;SCX-GFP. It is not clear why for FACS the Col2CREERT2 line is used while for LCM the constitutive one is used. Moreover, as previously reported, they isolate attachment cells as double positive SOX9/SCX cells. Here again, do the cells taken for analysis include those of the tuberosity itself? Col2CreERT2 with Tamox at E12.5 should be labeling the tuberosity too. It is unclear which cells from which Cre/reporter combination have been used for the ATACseq experiments of Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>When we initiated the LCM experiment, we assumed that Col2 would label the attachment cells. However, to our surprise, attachment cells were Col2-negative. Nevertheless, as the Scx and Col2 reporters clearly defined the boundaries between cell types, we could still use this line for LCM. This part is explained in detail in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Because for the ATAC-seq experiment we needed to isolate the cells using FACS, we had to change our labeling strategy. Therefore, we used a combination of <italic>Sox9</italic>-CreER and Scx-GFP mice. This indeed worked well for tendon and attachment cells, but the number of isolated chondrocytes was insufficient. Therefore, we used the Col2-CreER<sup>T</sup> line to label chondrocytes and isolate them. To clarify this issue, we have added text to the Results section.</p><p>As the reviewer noted, this labeling should also label the chondrocytes that compose the tuberosity. However, due to the large difference in cell numbers between the tuberosity and the rest of the cartilage that was collected, we think that this had a limited (if any) effect on our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) For Figure 2, a scheme showing where exactly in the bone we are located and how it has been sectioned would be helpful. Also, it would be nice to perform single molecule FISH on top of Col2Cre:R26TOM:SCX lineage tracing to show the specificity of the colocalization in the &quot;double reporter-negative&quot; area. Also, including the KLF2/4 FISH at this point would help visualize distinctions between genes belonging to cluster 5 (unique to AU) vs genes referred as mixed transcriptome (Wwp2, Bgn).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to Figure 1 a scheme showing how we sectioned the deltoid and great tuberosities for FISH. Using E14.5 ScxGFP-Col2Cre-tdTomato transverse sections for Bgn and Wwp2 double smFISH (conjugated to Quasar 670 and CAL Fluor Red 610, respectively) is problematic, since tdTomato (540nm-581nm) is a very strong reporter that may mask the signal of the Wwp2 probe coupled to Quazar 610 (590nm-610nm), due to a &quot;bleed through&quot; of the tdTomato into the Quazar610 filter.</p><p>As an alternative, to address the reviewerâs comment we performed a 10x genomics experiment on <italic>Sox9</italic>+Scx+ cells, where we could search for the transcripts of Bgn and Wwp2 in addition to expression of <italic>Klf2</italic>/<italic>Klf4</italic> in <italic>Sox9</italic>+Scx+ cells. Figure 2A,B summarizes this analysis. In short, this experiment exemplifies that <italic>Sox9</italic>+Scx+ cells indeed express both chondrogenic and tenogenic markers, in addition to KLFâs (Figure 5B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) The authors propose a role of Klf2/4 in attachment differentiation. What is the temporality in expression of Klf2/4 vs the putative downstream factors such as Gli1, Col5a1?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the temporality in gene expression, we performed transcriptome analysis (bulk MARS-Seq) of FACS-sorted attachment cells E13.5, when it is first possible anatomically to identify the attachment site (<italic>Sox9</italic>+Scx+ cells, n=3 for each gene; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable2">Author response table 2</xref>). Results showed that at that time point, both <italic>Klf2</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic>, as well as Col5a1 and Gli1, are already expressed. Since our analysis of the <italic>Klf2/4</italic> double mutants clearly showed a reduction (Figure 5) in expression of Gli1 and Col5a1, <italic>bona fide</italic> markers of the differentiating enthesis (Felsenthal et al., 2018; Schwartz et al., 2015), we concluded that <italic>Klf2</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic> are necessary for attachment cell differentiation.</p><table-wrap id="resptable2" position="anchor"><label>Author response table 2.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Gene</th><th>Bulk MARS-Seq normalized reads (mean)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Klf2</td><td>203.67</td></tr><tr><td>Klf4</td><td>384.75</td></tr><tr><td>Gli1</td><td>349.15</td></tr><tr><td>Col5a1</td><td>391.62</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) In ISH figures, some cells in the cartilage compartment also seem to coexpress tenocyte/cartilage markers. Can the authors comment on that?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that in some cases, at the borders the expression patterns of tendon and cartilage markers are not sharply segregated. This is mainly because during development, the borders between the different tissues that compose the attachment site are not sharp and clear, as the process of compartmentalization is still underway. Nevertheless, we believe that in general, expression of ISH markers followed the expected spatial patterns. The scRNA-seq results further support this conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) How did the authors adapt MARS-Seq (a single cell RNA seq pipeline taking advantage of cell sorting) to a bulk analysis? More specifically, it isn't clear how laser capture technique was combined with the MARS-seq protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>MARS-Seq was indeed originally developed as a FACS-based method for single-cell RNA sequencing [69] (Jaitin et al., 2014; Keren-Shaul, 2019). Due to the low RNA input in scRNA-seq, the authors further developed a bulk MARS-seq protocol, which is an adaptation of the single-cell MARS-seq. The input for bulk MARS-seq is clean RNA and hence it can be used for expression profiling by purifying RNA from LCM-isolated samples, FACS-sorted cells and more.</p><p>As explained in detail in the Materials and methods subsection âLaser capture microdissectionâ, following LCM of E14.5 cryo-sections of the attachment site, we purified the RNA using an RNA purification kit (RNeasy FFPE Kit, Qiagen). The resulting RNA was the input for the bulk MARS-seq protocol. Briefly, RNA from each sample was barcoded during reverse transcription and pooled. Following Agencourct Ampure XP beads cleanup (Beckman Coulter), the pooled samples underwent second strand synthesis and were linearly amplified by T7 in vitro transcription. The resulting RNA was fragmented and converted into a sequencing-ready library by tagging the samples with Illumina sequences during ligation, RT, and PCR. Libraries were quantified by Qubit and TapeStation as well as by qPCR for actb gene as previously described (Jaitin et al., 2014; Keren-Shaul et al., 2019). Sequencing was done on a Hiseq 2500 SR50 cycles kit (Illumina).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) The resolution on the single molecule FISH does not allow to really appreciate a large coexpression of the presented markers in the area.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2C, showing the smFISH of biglycan and <italic>Wwp2</italic> in E14.5 attachment cells, was increased in resolution to easily appreciate the coexpression of the markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) Figure 4: Could the authors indicate more clearly the demarcation between cartilage and connective tissue where double labeling is found?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added clearer demarcation between cartilage and connective tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) It would be interesting to know if the loss of the gene expression in Figure 5 results in a morphological abnormal attachment at later postnatal stages. If the authors have looked, it would be helpful to comment in the Discussion or include the data. How much of the intermediate gene expression program in the attachment site is dependent upon Klf regulation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers. However, due to postnatal lethality, our analysis of E18.5 is the latest time point that can be studied in this mouse line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) Is this transcriptional state-sharing permanent or transitional? Their work could be nicely contrasted and compared with some studies examining transcriptional heterogeneity/the co-expression of multiple cell fates as a mechanism cells used to transition from (multipotent) progenitor states to committed fates. Enthesis tissue would be an interesting and unique situation where possibly this intermediate shared transcriptional state is maintained to generate a new cell type. Possible references for transcriptional heterogeneity in progenitors include: Soldatov et al., 2019 and Johnson et al., 2015.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have added a paragraph to the Discussion regarding this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23) The section on the AEG/esophagus-stomach boundary should be better integrated with their own data or removed from the Discussion. It was not clearly stated how these two tissues are similar other than being border tissues. It is recommended to expand this section to include more specific examples how these regions (enthesis and esophagus) are related. Perhaps this esophageal boundary has also been shown to have a shared transcriptional/epigenetic state with neighboring tissues?</p></disp-quote><p>This part of the Discussion was edited to fit with the reviewer requirements.</p></body></sub-article></article>
