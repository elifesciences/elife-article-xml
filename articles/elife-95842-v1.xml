Here, we show that collagen-I fibril assembly required a functional endocytic system that recycles collagen-I to assemble new fibrils. Endogenous collagen production was not required for fibrillogenesis if exogenous collagen was available, but the circadian-regulated vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) 33b and collagen-binding integrin Î±11 subunit were crucial to fibrillogenesis. Cells lacking VPS33B secrete soluble collagen-I protomers but were deficient in fibril formation, thus secretion and assembly are separately controlled. Overexpression of VPS33B led to loss of fibril rhythmicity and overabundance of fibrils, which was mediated through integrin Î±11Î²1. Endocytic recycling of collagen-I was enhanced in human fibroblasts isolated from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, where VPS33B and integrin Î±11 subunit were overexpressed at the fibrogenic front; this correlation between VPS33B, integrin Î±11 subunit, and abnormal collagen deposition was also observed in samples from patients with chronic skin wounds. In conclusion, our study showed that circadian-regulated endocytic recycling is central to homeostatic assembly of collagen fibrils and is disrupted in diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>collagen</kwd><kwd>fibrosis</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>integrin</kwd><kwd>fibrillogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/W016796/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Joan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kadler</surname><given-names>Karl E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>203128</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kadler</surname><given-names>Karl E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>204957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>High</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Norwegian Centre of Excellence</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>223250</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gullberg</surname><given-names>Donald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008730</institution-id><institution>Norwegian Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>223052</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gullberg</surname><given-names>Donald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NasjonalfÃ¶reningen for folkhelsen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gullberg</surname><given-names>Donald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>204796</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name><name><surname>Reid</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>209741/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name><name><surname>Reid</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The fibrils can exceed centimeters in length and are organized into elaborate networks to provide structural support for cells. It is unclear how the fibrils are formed and how this process goes awry in collagen pathologies, such as fibrosis. A key mechanism, cell surface-mediated fibrillogenesis, has been suggested to occur via indirect binding to fibronectin fibrils, or via direct assembly by collagen-binding integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kadler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Musiime et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zeltz et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, fibrils can be reconstituted in vitro from purified collagen (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kadler et al., 1996</xref>) but the assembly process is not controlled to the extent seen in vivo in terms of number, size, and organization; this suggests a much tighter cellular control over the process. Additional support for tight cellular control of collagen fibril formation comes from electron microscope observations of collagen fibrils at the plasma membrane of embryonic avian and rodent tendon fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Trelstad and Hayashi, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birk and Trelstad, 1986</xref>), where the end (tip) of a fibril is enclosed within a plasma membrane invagination termed a fibripositor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canty et al., 2004</xref>). Previously, we identified vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) 33B (a regulator of SNARE-dependent membrane fusion in the endocytic pathway) as a circadian clock-regulated protein involved in collagen homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2020</xref>). VPS33B forms a protein complex with VIPAS39 (VIPAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hunter et al., 2018</xref>), and mutations in the <italic>VPS33B</italic> gene cause arthrogryposis-renal dysfunction-cholestasis syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gissen et al., 2004</xref>). Here, death usually occurs within the first year of birth, accompanied with renal insufficiency, jaundice, multiple congenital anomalies, and predisposition to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nezelof et al., 1979</xref>). One proposed disease-causing mechanism is abnormal post-Golgi trafficking of lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3, <italic>PLOD3</italic>), which catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagen to form hydroxylysine residues. It also has hydroxylysyl galactosyltransferase and galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase activities, which creates attachment sites for carbohydrates that is crucial in stabilizing intramolecular and intermolecular crosslinks within the collagen structure, and thus is essential for collagen homeostasis during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banushi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Salo et al., 2006</xref>). All these observations point to a central role for the endosome, situated in proximity of the plasma membrane and acting as a hub for a complex assortment of vesicles, in sorting collagen molecules to different fates.</p><p>Previous studies of collagen endocytosis have focused on collagen degradation and signaling, identifying additional collagen-binding proteins such as Endo180 and MRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Madsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Madsen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Madsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rainero, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), as well as a role for non-integrin collagen receptors involved in mediating signaling activities such as DDR1/DDR2 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leitinger, 2014</xref>). Here, we showed that collagen uptake by fibroblasts is circadian rhythmic. Importantly, instead of degrading endocytosed collagen, cells utilize endocytic recycling of exogenous collagen-I to assemble new fibrils, even in the absence of endogenous collagen production. Further, we showed that the secretion of soluble collagen protomers is separate from, and can occur independently to, collagen fibril assembly. We identified VPS33B and integrin Î±11 subunit (part of the collagen-binding integrin Î±11Î²1 heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Musiime et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tiger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zeltz and Gullberg, 2016</xref>]) as central molecules specific to fibril formation. Finally, we showed that in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a life-threatening disease with unknown trigger/mechanism where lung tissue is replaced with collagen fibrils, integrin Î±11 subunit, and VPS33B are located at the invasive fibroblastic focus where collagen fibril rapidly accumulates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herrera et al., 2019</xref>); IPF fibroblasts also have elevated endocytic recycling of exogenous collagen-I, despite having similar collagen-I expression level to normal fibroblasts. Together, these results provide novel insights into the importance of the circadian clock-regulated endosomal system in normal fibrous tissue homeostasis, where fibrillogenesis occurs with both endogenous collagen and/or recycled scavenged exogenous collagen. This work also highlights that collagen utilization, rather than production (i.e. assembled into fibrils vs. protomeric secretion), is central to the maintenance of homeostasis, and dysregulation leads to disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Collagen-I is taken up into punctate structures within the cell, and reassembled into fibrils</title><p>To study collagen-I endocytosis and the fate of endocytosed collagen, we made Cy3- or Cy5-labeled collagen-I (Cy3-colI, Cy5-colI) from commercial rat tail collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doyle, 2018</xref>). We confirmed the helicity of these collagens with an expected molecular weight corresponding to a heterotrimeric mature collagen-I without the propeptides, and showed that the process of fluorescence labeling did not alter the collagen trimer secondary structure or stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). We incubated Cy3-colI with explanted murine tail tendons for 3 days, then imaged the core of the tendon. Cells in tendon (nuclei marked with Hoechst stain) showed a clear uptake of Cy3-colI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, yellow box, indicated by yellow arrowheads). Interestingly, fibrillar Cy3 fluorescence signals that extend across cells were also observed, suggestive of these being extracellular fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, gray box, indicated by white arrows). Pulse-chase experiments were performed where Cy3-colI was added to the tendons for 3 days, and then removed from the media. This was followed by 5FAM-colI for a further 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). The results showed distinct areas where only Cy3-colI was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>, yellow box); this persistence indicated that not all collagen endocytosed by cells is directed for degradation. 5FAM-positive and 5FAM/Cy3-positive fibril-like structures were also observed, confirming that collagen-I taken up by tissues is reincorporated into the matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>, gray boxes). To confirm these findings in 2D cultures, we incubated immortalized murine tail tendon fibroblast cultures (iTTFs) with labeled Cy3-colI. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that most cells had taken up Cy3-colI after overnight incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Further time course analyses revealed a time-dependent and concentration-dependent increase of collagen-I uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Cells incubated with Cy3-ColI for 1 hr followed by trypsinization were then analyzed using flow cytometry imaging (flow imaging), revealing that collagen-I is endocytosed by the cells into distinct puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similar results were obtained using Cy5-labeled collagen-I, indicating that the fluorescence label itself did not alter cellular response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplements 6</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref>). To confirm that the labeled collagen-I is in fact endocytosed into the fibroblasts and not only associated with the cell surface when cells are still attached, we performed live imaging on cells incubated with Cy3-colI. Time lapse images showed Cy3-colI congregate in structures within the cell, as indicated with white arrows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1âfigure supplement 9</xref>). Additionally, we transduced iTTF with GFP-tagged Rab5 and confirmed co-localization of Cy5-colI with Rab5-positive intracellular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, yellow arrows). We then incubated iTTFs with Cy3-colI for 1 hr, before trypsinizing and replating the cells to ensure any Cy3-colI signal detected hereon originated from the endocytosed pool. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining indicated co-localization of endogenous collagen-I with Cy3-labeled collagen-I in extracellular fibrillar structures after 72 hr, compared to a striking lack of extracellular collagen-I (endogenous or labeled) at 18 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1âfigure supplement 9</xref>).

Prior research identified macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nazemi et al., 2024</xref>), which can be modeled with high-molecular weight dextran. We hypothesized that there will be co-localization of labeled collagen-I and labeled 70 kDa dextran within the cell if they are entering through the same route, however surprisingly we see little co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We then performed a receptor saturation experiment, where unlabeled collagen-I was added in excess to labeled collagen-I (10:1) during the 1 hr incubation, before flow imaging analysis of the fibroblasts. Flow imaging showed that labeled collagen was at the cell periphery and not intracellular when saturation occurs, suggestive of a receptor-mediated process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we used Dyngo4a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCluskey et al., 2013</xref>) to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis, where Dyngo4a treatment (20 ÂµM) leads to ~60% reduction in Cy3-colI uptake relative to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>), without affecting cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). We then investigated the effects of Dyngo4a treatment on the ability of wild-type (WT) fibroblasts to assemble collagen fibrils. Cells were treated with Dyngo4a for 48 hr before fixation and IF against collagen-I antibody. A significant reduction (average 60%) in the number of collagen-I fibrils assembled was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicative of endocytosis playing a key role in collagen-I fibrillogenesis. Conditioned media (CM) from these treated cells were also collected and assessed. To our surprise, the amount of soluble collagen-I secreted was also greatly reduced, with minimal impact on total secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses revealed that <italic>Col1a1</italic> mRNA was significantly reduced in Dyngo4a-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6</xref>), suggesting a potential feedback mechanism between endocytosis and collagen-I synthesis, secretion, and fibrillogenesis. Interestingly, while fibronectin (FN1) mRNA was significantly lower in Dyngo4a-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6</xref>), and the intensity of FN1 signal appears lower, the amount of FN1 fibrils deposited (as determined by the area occupied by fibrils) was not significantly impacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, these results showed that inhibiting endocytosis in fibroblasts does not lead to accumulation of soluble collagen-I protomers in the extracellular space.

The observation of fibrillar Cy3 signals in siCol1a1 cells showed that the cells can repurpose collagen into fibrils without the requirement for intrinsic collagen-I production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, red arrow). The cells were also probed for collagen-I using an anti-collagen-I antibody with a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, second row).

To assess whether collagen-knockout fibroblasts were able to assemble a collagen fibril, Cy3-colI was incubated with cells before the cells were released by trypsin and replated, to ensure that Cy3 signals arose only from Cy3-colI endocytosed by cells. Within 3 days, Cy3-positive collagen fibers could be observed in both CKO- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left column) and CKO+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right column). The observation of fibrillar Cy3 signals in CKO+ cells showed that the cells can repurpose collagen into fibrils without the requirement for intrinsic collagen-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, red arrows). The cells were also probed for collagen-I using an anti-collagen-I antibody with a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, second row). In CKO- cells we detected a diffuse signal over the entire cell and an indication of fibrillar structures. In the CKO+ cells we detected fibrillar structures at the periphery of the cell, and the same diffuse signal seen in CKO- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, white arrows). We suspect that the diffuse signal observed in CKO+ cells is due to incomplete labeling of collagen-I in our preparation of Cy3-colI, as complete labeling of lysine residues would cause collagen-I to be unable to form fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doyle, 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, Dyngo4a treatment led to a lack of Cy3-colI fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right panel and quantification plot); thus, these results demonstrated that fibroblasts can effectively form fibrils from exogenous collagen alone.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>VPS33B controls collagen fibril formation but not protomeric secretion</title><p>VPS33B is situated in a post-Golgi compartment where it is involved in endosomal trafficking with multiple functions including extracellular vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2021</xref>), modulation of p53 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2019</xref>), and maintenance of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), dependent on cell type. We previously identified VPS33B to be a circadian-controlled component of collagen-I homeostasis in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2020</xref>). As a result, we decided to further investigate its role in endosomal recycling of collagen-I.</p><p>We confirmed our previous finding that CRISPR knockout of VPS33B (VPSko, as verified by western blot analysis and qPCR analysis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>) in tendon fibroblasts led to fewer collagen fibrils without impacting proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>), as evidenced by both electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and IF imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Decellularized matrices showed that VPSko fibroblasts produced less matrix by mass than control, which was mirrored by a reduction in hydroxyproline content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We then stably overexpressed VPS33B in fibroblasts (VPSoe), as confirmed by western blot, qPCR analyses, and flow cytometry of transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplements 4</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">6</xref>). IF staining indicated a greater number of collagen-I fibrils in VPSoe cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), although the mean total matrix and mean total hydroxyproline in VPSoe cultures was not significantly higher than control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). As VPSoe cells showed equivalent proliferation to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5âfigure supplement 7</xref>), this suggests VPSoe specifically enhanced the assembly of collagen fibrils. We then performed time-series IF on synchronized cell cultures to quantify the number of collagen fibrils formed. Tendon fibroblasts exhibited an ~24 hr rhythmic fluctuation in collagen-I fibril numbers, whereas VPSoe cells continuously deposited collagen-I fibrils over the 55 hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). MetaCycle analyses indicated that fluctuation of fibril numbers in control and VPSoe cultures occurred at a periodicity of 22.7 hr and 28.0 hr respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s8">Figure 5âfigure supplement 8</xref>), indicating that continuous expression of VPS33B leads to loss of collagen-I fibril circadian homeostasis. Interestingly, when assessing the levels of secreted soluble collagen-I protomers from control and VPSoe cells, VPSoe CM have lower levels of soluble collagen-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In addition, when VPS33B is knocked down using siRNA, there is an elevation of soluble collagen-I secreted; siVPS33B on VPSoe cells also increased the levels of collagen-I in CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s9">Figure 5âfigure supplements 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s10">10</xref>), while VPS33B levels are not correlated with <italic>Col1a1</italic> expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s11">Figure 5âfigure supplement 11</xref>). This finding indicates that VPS33B is specifically involved in collagen-I fibril assembly, and not secretion or translation. The reduction of secreted soluble collagen-I in VPSoe cells further supports that VPS33B directs collagen-I toward fibril assembly.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>VPS33B controls collagen fibril formation at the plasma membrane in a rhythmic manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electron microscopy images of fibroblasts plated on ACLAR and grown for a week before fixation and imaging.

Here, a GFP signal will be present if VPS33B co-traffics with collagen-I. We, and others, have previously demonstrated that insertion of tags at the N-terminus of proÎ±2(I) or proÎ±1(I) chain does not interfere with collagen-I folding or secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McCaughey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calverley et al., 2020</xref>). To determine which terminus of the VPS33B protein GFP1-10 should be added, we performed computational ÎG analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hessa et al., 2007</xref>), which predicts that VPS33B contains two regions of extended hydrophobicity toward its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The first region (residues 565â587, denoted TMD1) has a ÎG of â0.62 kcal/mol, consistent with a single pass type IV transmembrane domain (TMD), known as a tail-anchor. This arrangement locates the short C-terminus of VPS33B inside the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and subsequently within the endosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rabu et al., 2009</xref>). The second region (residues 591â609, denoted HR1) is significantly less hydrophobic, with a ÎG of +2.61 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Its presence raises the possibility that VPS33B may contain two TMDs that, depending on their relative membrane topologies, result in either a luminal or cytosolic C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To define the topology of VPS33B, we used a well-established in vitro system where newly synthesized and radiolabeled proteins of interest are inserted into the membrane of ER-derived canine pancreatic microsomes, and created constructs with ER luminal modification of either endogenous N-glycosylation sites (N54, N545 in VPS33B), or artificial sites in an appended OPG2 tag (N2, N15 in residues 1â18 of bovine rhodopsin, UniProt: P02699) as a robust reporter for membrane protein topology in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">OâKeefe et al., 2022</xref>). Due to the N-terminal region of VPS33B being highly aggregation-prone in our in vitro system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">5</xref>), we created three additional chimeric proteins comprised of different regions of VPS33B and Sec61Î² to investigate the topology of VPS33B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6âfigure supplement 6</xref>). While a small proportion of each chimera continued to pellet when synthesized in the absence of ER-derived microsomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6âfigure supplement 7</xref>, lanes 3, 6, 9), N-glycosylated species were now clearly identifiable for each of the chimeras tested.</p><p>In chimera 1, given the respective efficiency of membrane insertion of the tail-anchored region and N-glycosylation of the C-terminal OPG tag of Sec61Î²OPG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6âfigure supplement 7</xref>, lanes 1â2), we attribute the N-glycosylated species to the C-terminal translocation of OPG2 tag, although it is evident that the remaining short stretch of VPS33B (residues 414â564) still impedes efficient membrane insertion, likely due to aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6âfigure supplement 7</xref>, lanes 3â5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">OâKeefe et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zong et al., 2019</xref>). For chimera 2, the efficient modification of its distal N-glycosylation site (N15 of the OPG2 tag) but inefficient use of the proximal site (N2 of the OPG2 tag) reflects the latter residuesâ close proximity to the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nilsson and von Heijne, 1993</xref>), and supports the bona fide membrane insertion of the VPS33B TMD1 and thus translocation of the C-terminal OPG2 tag into the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6âfigure supplement 7</xref>, lanes 6â8). Interestingly, the inclusion of HR1 to the C-terminus of TMD1 in chimera 3 results in a substantial qualitative reduction in the amount of protein that is N-glycosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6âfigure supplement 7</xref>, lanes 7 and 10). Further, for the fraction of chimera 3 that is modified, the majority is doubly N-glycosylated; most likely due to the extra length provided by HR1, resulting in both N-glycosylation sites on the OPG2 tag (N2 and N15) now being efficiently modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nilsson and von Heijne, 1993</xref>).</p><p>The clear reduction in the proportion of N-glycosylated species obtained with chimera 3 compared to chimera 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6âfigure supplement 7</xref>) indicates that only a small proportion of HR1 and the appended OPG2 tag are successfully translocated into the ER lumen. This is likely due to a combination of the low proportion of hydrophobic residues and the presence of several charged and polar amino acids in HR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whitley et al., 2021</xref>). We thus propose that, for a minority of VPS33B, TMD1 is inserted into the ER membrane as a tail-anchored region with a luminal HR1 that most likely remains associated with the inner leaflet of the bilayer (N-cytosolic, C-luminal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right). In contrast, the majority of VPS33B likely assumes a âhairpinâ like conformation in the ER membrane where both its N- and C-termini remain in the cytosol (N-cytosolic, C-cytosolic) with either: (1) a partially membrane inserted TMD1, with HR1 associated with the outer leaflet of the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, left); or (2) a fully membrane inserted TMD1 followed by the marginally hydrophobic HR1 which may span the membrane through the formation of stabilizing hydrogen bonds with TMD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, middle; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meindl-Beinker et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Procollagen-I and VPS33B localize to the same compartments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting the proposed membrane topologies of VPS33b.

IF staining of endogenous VIPAS39 (a known VPS33B-interacting partner; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hunter et al., 2018</xref>) also revealed co-localization of VIPAS39 with collagen-I in intracellular punctate structures, where in some of the co-localized puncta, the signal of VIPAS39 is strongest surrounding collagen-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, zoom), suggesting that VIPAS39 is encasing collagen-I, not within the lumen but present in proximity with the external membrane of these structures.

Incubation of iTTFs expressing only the VPS-barrel with CM collected from iTTFs expressing only GFP11-proÎ±1(I) revealed that the GFP signal was detected only in intracellular structures and not along the periphery of the cells, where endocytosis takes place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Flow cytometry analyses of fluorescently labeled-colI endocytosed by control, VPSko, and VPSoe fibroblasts also revealed no consistent change in uptake by VPSko or VPSoe cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that VPS33B interacts with endocytosed collagen-I within the cell and trafficks with collagen-I to the extracellular space, and is not involved with collagen-I endocytosis. VPSko cells replated after Cy5-colI uptake have conspicuously fewer fibrils when compared to control.

Conspicuously, collagen Î±1(I) and Î±2(I) chains were detected at a reduced level at the surface of VPSko cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The reduction of Î±1(V) and Î±2(V) chains (which constitute type V collagen) from the cell surface supports the long-standing view that collagen-V nucleates collagen-I containing fibrils. GO pointed to integral components of the plasma membrane, which included several integrins. While many integrins were detected in all samples, there was an absence of integrin Î±1 and integrin Î±11 subunit in VPSko cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). It is well established that integrins are cell surface molecules that interact extensively with the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Humphries et al., 2006</xref>), with integrin Î±11Î²1 functioning as a major collagen binding integrin on fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zeltz and Gullberg, 2016</xref>), which is expressed during development, and is upregulated in subsets of myofibroblasts in tissue and tumor fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zeltz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zeltz and Gullberg, 2023</xref>). Importantly, while the level of integrin Î²1 chain detected was also reduced in VPSko cultures, it was not as drastic as the reduction of integrin Î±11 chain. This is likely due to the promiscuous nature of integrin Î²1 subunit, that is being able to partner with other Î± subunits for functions other than collagen-I interaction. The absence of integrin Î±11 subunit from VPSko cells suggested a link between VPS33B-mediated collagen fibrillogenesis and integrin Î±11Î²1.</p><p>VPS33B was conspicuous by its absence from cell surface labeling studies of control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We have previously struggled to detect VPS33B protein using mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2020</xref>) and postulate that its absence could be due to low abundance. Regardless, VPS33B was detected at the cell surface in VPSoe samples along with PLOD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), a lysyl hydroxylase involved in stabilizing collagen and previously identified to be delivered by VPS33B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banushi et al., 2016</xref>). Complementary western blot analysis of total cell lysates showed that expression of integrin Î±11 subunit is significantly reduced in VPSko cells and is elevated in VPSoe cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This correlation between VPS33B and integrin Î±11 expression levels was confirmed at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), inferring a link between VPS33B, collagen fibril, and integrin Î±11 abundance. We verified this by siRNA knockdown of <italic>Itga11</italic> in control and VPSoe fibroblasts, where knockdown efficiency is confirmed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). siItga11 in both control and VPSoe cells reduced the number of collagen-I fibrils in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Thus, even with elevated levels of VPS33B, integrin Î±11 subunit is required for collagen-I fibrillogenesis. Interestingly, knocking down integrin Î±11 subunit increased exogenous collagen-I uptake as demonstrated by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Thus, we propose that both VPS33B and integrin Î±11 are involved in directing collagen-I protomers to the formation of collagen-I fibrils, and not mediators of collagen-I endocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Integrin Î±11 subunit is localized to the fibroblastic focus of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</title><p>We next investigated if VPS33B and integrin Î±11 are involved in human fibrotic diseases, where accumulation of collagen fibrils is a disease hallmark.

We also found that IPF fibroblasts endocytosed significantly more Cy5-labeled exogenous collagen-I when compared to control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, left); uptake of Cy3-labeled exogenous collagen-I was also elevated, albeit not significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, right). Subsequent culture of cells that have taken up exogenous collagen-I revealed that IPF fibroblasts made significantly more fluorescently labeled collagen fibrils, indicating enhanced recycling of endocytosed collagen-I to generate new fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The relationship between VPS33B, ITGA11, and endocytic recycling of collagen-I for fibrillogenesis was further confirmed using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>), where knockdown of either proteins led to a significant decrease in recycling of exogenous Cy5-ColI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This in vitro observation was also represented in IPF pathology, where patient-derived lung samples showed enrichment of collagen-I which overlaps with both integrin Î±11 subunit and VPS33B within the IPF hallmark lesion (termed the fibroblastic focus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herrera et al., 2019</xref>], encircled by red dotted line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

These results indicate that the proteins required for assembly of collagen into fibrils (i.e. integrin Î±11, VPS33B) are present at the fibrotic fronts of IPF, and that enhanced endocytic recycling of collagen-I by fibroblasts may be a disease-potentiating mechanism in IPF.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Fibroblasts derived from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients have higher collagen endocytic recycling capacity that is mediated by VPS33B and ITGA11.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of patient-derived fibroblasts isolated from control (ctrl) or IPF lungs.

In complex environments, e.g., a wound, degradation of damaged collagen molecules, and recycling of structurally sound collagen molecules could be beneficial. A caveat in this present study is the use of Dyngo4a to inhibit endocytosis. It was demonstrated that there may be non-dynamin targeting effects with Dyngo4a when comparing the effects of dynamin triple knockout and drug treatment (e.g. fluid-phase endocytosis and membrane ruffling) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2013</xref>) here, we have shown that collagen uptake is likely through receptor-mediated and not fluid-phase endocytosis, although whether periphery membrane ruffling alters collagen deposition remains to be investigated. As total secretion did not appear to be affected by Dyngo4a treatment, as indicated by Ponceau stain on western blots of CM, we take this to suggest that Dyngo4a in this study is not affecting overall secretion and is mostly acting on endocytosis. Further studies targeting multiple endocytosis routes, either through genetic manipulation or drug treatments, will help shed light on how collagen uptake is controlled, and if different forms of collagen (i.e. protomers, fibril) require different mechanisms. Nonetheless, the requirement of VPS33B for fibril assembly confirms the previously observed rhythmicity of collagen fibril formation by fibroblasts, in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2020</xref>). Our discovery that the endosomal system is involved in fibril assembly explains how collagen fibrils can be assembled in the absence of endogenous collagen synthesis, namely, if collagen can be retrieved from the extracellular space. We also observed a delay between maximum uptake and maximum fibril numbers. A possible function of this delay may be to increase the concentration of collagen-I in readiness for more efficient fibril initiation. This is supported by our findings that fibroblasts can utilize a solution of Cy3-colI lower than the 0.4 Âµg/mL critical concentration for fibril formation to assemble fibrils. Of note, the comparison between uptake and fibril numbers are not directly from the same experiments due to experimental limitations; the Cy3/Cy5-colI uptake we observed did not reflect total collagen-I levels, as endogenous collage-I was present as well. Nonetheless, we postulate that the fates of the collagen-I that was taken up by fibroblasts are likely: (1) recycled for fibril formation, (2) re-secreted as protomers, or if they are damaged, (3) degradation. Future research will be required to determine the molecular mechanisms that determines these fates. Surface biotin-labeling in fibroblasts identified two integrin Î± subunits (Î±1 and Î±11) to be absent in VPSko cells which could not make collagen fibrils. There are four known collagen-binding integrins (Î±1Î²1, Î±2Î²1, Î±10Î²1, Î±11Î²1), where Î±2Î²1 and Î±11Î²1 have affinity for fibrillar collagens and are expressed in fibroblasts in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zeltz and Gullberg, 2016</xref>). Î±1Î²1, in contrast, has been demonstrated in vitro to display higher affinity for collagen-IV than collagen-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eble et al., 1993</xref>) it has a wide expression pattern in vivo, including basement membrane-associated smooth muscle cells, strongly suggesting that collagen-IV is the major ligand for Î±1Î²1 integrin instead. Thus, we focused on the effects of integrin Î±11 subunit. Interestingly, both Î±1 and Î±11 subunits were also reduced in VPSoe cells as detected by mass spectrometry; however, validation by western blots indicated that protein levels of integrin Î±11 follows VPS33B and collagen fibril numbers. We postulate that this discrepancy detected through MS might be due to integrin dynamics at the plasma membrane. Regardless, VPS33B and integrin Î±11Î²1 are essential for targeting collagen-I to fibril assembly and not for the secretion of soluble triple helical collagen-I molecules (i.e. protomers); there is also no evidence to support an active role for VPS33B or Î±11Î²1 in collagen endocytosis. We have also demonstrated involvement of VPS33B and integrin Î±11 subunit in IPF, particularly at sites of disease progression (fibroblastic foci). The presence of integrin Î±11 subunit confirms a recent study utilizing spatial proteomics to decipher regions of IPF tissues, where in addition to integrin Î±11 the authors also identified proteins involved in collagen biogenesis specific to the fibroblastic foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herrera et al., 2022</xref>). Crucially, in our study, levels of <italic>Col1a1</italic> transcript were unchanged between control and IPF fibroblasts, and IHC demonstrated that collagen-I and VPS33B were prevalent in control lungs. This highlights that the production of collagen-I does not equate to fibril formation; indeed, here VPS33B is required for normal collagen homeostasis in the lung, and it is the combination of VPS33B and integrin Î±11 subunit, coupled with elevated endocytic recycling of exogenous collagen at the fibroblastic focus, that promotes excess collagen-I fibril assemblies, which is a hallmark of fibrosis. Furthermore, this relationship between excessive collagen-I, VPS33B, and integrin Î±11 is also observed in chronic skin wounds, where, similar to lung fibrosis, there is a chronic unresolved wound-healing response; this is suggestive of a common pathological molecular pathway between the two organs, based on enhanced endocytic recycling of collagen-I protomers directed to fibrillogenesis.</p><p>The discovery that VPS33B is required for collagen fibril formation but not collagen protomer secretion highlights an important distinction between âcollagen secretionâ and âcollagen fibrillogenesisâ, especially in the context of collagen pathologies (e.g. fibrosis, cancer metastasis). In this context, it is crucial to keep in mind that elevated collagen levels (i.e. collagen transcripts or protomer levels) does not equate to the formation of an insoluble fibrillar network. This distinction was also suggested in a recent study on <italic>Pten-</italic>knockout mammary fibroblasts, where SPARC protein acts via fibronectin to affect collagen fibrillogenesis but not secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2021</xref>). Of note, while SPARC and fibronectin were detected in our previously reported time-series mass spectrometry analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2020</xref>), they were not circadian clock rhythmic in tendon.</p><p>The nucleation of a collagen-I fibril is expected to involve collagen-V, a minor fibril-forming collagen that is necessary for the appearance of collagen-I fibrils in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wenstrup et al., 2011</xref>). Another long-standing view is that fibronectin may tether collagen to a fibronectin-binding integrin and thereby function as a proteolytically cleavable anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Musiime et al., 2021</xref>). While the present study did not focus on the role of fibronectin, there is a slight indication that fibronectin is decreased when collagen-I is knocked down, although IF staining suggested that collagen-I and fibronectin do not completely overlap, and that inhibition of endocytosis did not affect fibronectin fibril numbers. Further, biotin-surface labeling mass spectrometry analysis in the present study indicated that the levels of the major fibronectin-binding integrins (integrins Î±5Î²1, Î±VÎ²3) were not drastically altered between control, VPSko, and VPSoe fibroblasts, suggesting that VPS33B controls collagen fibrillogenesis via a fibronectin-independent route. We have recently demonstrated that integrin Î±11Î²1 localizes to fibrillar adhesions and contributes to collagen assembly in a mechano-regulated and tensin-1-dependent manner, independent of Î±5Î²1 and fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Musiime et al., 2024</xref>). In these studies, the Î±11Î²1-mediated collagen assembly did not appear to depend on endocytosis. In the future it will be important to establish which factors govern endocytosis-dependent and endocytosis-independent Î±11Î²1-mediated collagen fibrillogenesis. Interestingly, in fibronectin knockout liver cells, exogenous collagen-V could be added to initiate collagen-I fibrillogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moriya et al., 2011</xref>), which suggests that other matrix proteins could also be recycled in a similar manner as collagen-I. While collagen Î±1(V) could only be detected in surface biotin-labeled control but not VPSko or VPSoe cells, collagen Î±2(V) was only detected in VPSoe cells. Of note, we have previously shown that collagen Î±2(V) protein was rhythmic and in phase with collagen Î±1(I) and collagen Î±2(I). Whether collagen-V co-traffics with collagen-I in VPS33B-compartments to fibrillogenic sites at the cell periphery, or collagen-V is directed to the nucleation site by another route, is an important question to address in future studies. Indeed, endocytic recycling of other factors required for collagen fibrillogenesis (e.g. other nucleation factors such as collagen-V, collagen-XI, integrins), in addition to collagen-I protomers, may be required for fibril assembly by fibroblasts.</p><p>Previous research has demonstrated that collagen-I can be secreted within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canty et al., 2004</xref>), while other studies have demonstrated a relatively slow emergence of collagen-I fibrils over days in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pickard et al., 2018</xref>). The delay in assembly of fibrils could be due to the requirement to reach the threshold concentration of collagen needed for fibrillogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kadler et al., 1987</xref>). Procollagen-I can be converted to collagen-I within the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canty et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canty-Laird et al., 2012</xref>) in a process that requires giantin for intracellular N-terminal processing of procollagen-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stevenson et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it is possible that triple helical collagen-I protomers destined for fibril formation are: (1) directed straight to a VPS33B-positive compartment from the Golgi apparatus, or (2) quickly secreted and then recaptured, via endocytosis, prior to recycling for fibrillogenesis. Such a mechanism would provide the cell with additional opportunities to determine the number of fibrils, the rate at which they are to be initiated, and their required growth in the ECM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). We have not identified the specific proteins that mediate collagen-I uptake into the cell, however as inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis did not completely inhibit collagen endocytosis, it is likely that collagen-I has multiple routes to enter the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Madsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rainero, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leitinger, 2014</xref>). With regard to the fibrillogenesis route, although a recent model of VPS33B/VIPAS39 protein complexes does not consider the possibility that VPS33B can associate directly with vesicular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2023</xref>), our in vitro studies suggest its hydrophobic C-terminal region can act as a tail-anchor domain. Importantly, the proposed model by Liu et al. of the VPS33B/VIPAS39 complex suggests the C-terminus of VPS33B would be available for membrane association, consistent with our in vitro findings. Further studies will be required to establish whether differences between our models reflect alternative experimental systems (i.e. yeast vs. mammalian), and/or the behavior of VPS33B alone vs. in complex with VIPAS39. We found that endogenous VIPAS39 encases collagen-I in intracellular puncta, consistent with a model where VPS33B and VIPAS39 co-traffic with collagen-I at the same endosomal compartment (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). Our data suggest two membrane-bound populations of VPS33B, the majority with a hairpin-like structure and cytosolic C-terminus and a minority that spans the membrane with the C-terminus inside the lumen. Whether or not alternative topologies of VSP33B are associated with different biological functions remains to be determined. Nonetheless, here we have identified a previously unknown role for endocytosis in collagen fibrillogenesis, which is exploited in collagen pathologies.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Proposed working model of collagen homeostasis in fibroblasts.</title><p>Endogenous collagen is either secreted as protomers (soluble secretion route, not circadian rhythmic) or made into fibrils (fibril assembly route, circadian rhythmic).

Ehrlichâs reagent (500 Î¼L; 1.5 g 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde diluted in 10 mL N-propanol:perchloric acid (2:1)) was added to each reaction tube and incubated at 65Â°C for 10 min and then the absorbance at 558 nm was measured for 100 Î¼L of each sample in a 96-well plate format.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, incubation and washes after EM fixation were done at room temperature. Cells were plated on top of ACLAR films and allows to deposit matrix for 7 days. The ACLAR was then fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde/100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for at least 2 hr and washed in ddH<sub>2</sub>O 3Ã5 min. The samples were then transferred to 2% osmium (vol/vol)/1.5% potassium ferrocyanide (wt/vol) in cacodylate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.2) and further fixed for 1 hr, followed by extensive washing in ddH<sub>2</sub>O. This was followed by 40 min of incubation in 1% tannic acid (wt/vol) in 100 mM cacodylate buffer, and then extensive washes in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, and placed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 40 min. This was followed by extensive washes in ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Samples were incubated with 1% uranyl acetate (aqueous) at 4Â°C for at least 16 hr, and then washed again in ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Samples were then dehydrated in graded ethanol in the following regime: 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% (all vol/vol in ddH<sub>2</sub>O) for 8 min at each step. Samples were then washed 4Ã8 min each in 100% ethanol, and transferred to pure acetone for 10 min. The samples were then infiltrated in graded series of Agar100Hard in acetone (all vol/vol) in the following regime: 30% for 1 hr, 50% for 1 hr, 75% for overnight (16 hr), 100% for 5 hr. Samples were then transferred to fresh 100% Agar100Hard in labeled moulds and allowed to cure at 60Â°C for 72 hr. Sections (80 nm) were cut and examined using a Tecnai 12 BioTwin electron microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Surface biotinylation-pulldown mass spectrometry</title><p>Cells were grown in six-well plates for 72 hr prior to biotinylating. Briefly, cells around 90% confluence were kept on ice and washed in ice-cold PBS, following with incubation with ice-cold biotinylating reagent (prepared fresh, 200 Âµg/mL in PBS, pH 7.8) for 30 min at 4Â°C gently shaking. Cells were then washed twice in ice-cold TBS (50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), and incubated in TBS for 10 min at 4Â°C. Cells were then lysed in ice-cold 1% Triton-X (in PBS, with protease inhibitors) and lysates cleared by centrifugation at 13,000Ã<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4Â°C. Supernatant was then transferred to a fresh tube and 1/5 of the lysates were kept as a reference sample. Streptavidin-Sepharose beads was aliquoted into each sample and incubated for 30 min at 4Â°C rotating. Beads were then washed 3Ã in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% Triton-X, followed by one final wash in ice-cold PBS and boiled at 95Â°C for 10 min in 2Ã sample loading buffer, followed by centrifugation at 13,000Ã<italic>g</italic> for 5 min followed by sample preparation for mass spectrometry analysis. The protocol used for sample preparation was as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herrera et al., 2020</xref>). Mass spectrometry results files were exported into Proteome Discoverer for identification and spectral counting. All searches included the fixed modification for carbamidomethylation on cysteine residues resulting from IAA treatment to prevent cysteine bonding. The variable modifications included in the search were oxidized methionine (monoisotopic mass change, +15.955 Da); hydroxylation of asparagine, aspartic acid, proline, or lysine (monoisotopic mass change, +15.955 Da); and phosphorylation of threonine, serine, and tyrosine (79.966 Da). A maximum of two missed cleavages per peptide was allowed. The minimum precursor mass was set to 350 Da with a maximum of 5000. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance was 0.02 Da, and minimum peptide length was 6. Peptides were searched against the Swissprot database using Sequest HT with a maximum false discovery rate of 1%. Proteins required a minimum FDR of 1% and were filtered to remove known contaminants and to have at least two unique peptides. Missing values were assumed to be due to low abundance. For spectral counting, enriched samples were normalized and spectral matches were compared. Peptide spectral matches were only included if they were calculated to have a q-value of less than 0.01. Mass spectrometry data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD034394.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Imaging and IF</title><p>For fluorescence live imaging of Cy3-colI internalization, iTTF cells were seeded for 24 hr onto Ibidi Âµ-plates and stained using CellMask Green Plasma Membrane Stain (Invitrogen C37608) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Cy3-colI was added to cells and images were collected in a 37Â°C chamber using a Zeiss 3i spinning disk (CSU-X1, Yokagowa) confocal microscope with a Ã63/1.40 Plan-Apochromat oil objective. 7.5 Âµm z-stacks with a step size of 0.5 Âµm were captured at 2 min intervals using 488 nm (100 power, 150 ms exposure) and 561 nm (100 power, 100 ms exposure) lasers with SlideBook 6.0 software (3i) and a front illuminated Prime sCMOS camera. Imaris 9.9.1 software was then used to generate 3D reconstructions.</p><p>For fixed IF imaging, cells plated on coverslips or Ibidi Î¼-plates were fixed with 100% methanol at â20Â°C and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X in PBS. Primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit pAb collagen-I (1:400, Gentaur OARA02579), rabbit pAb VIPAS (1:50, Proteintech 20771-1-AP), mouse mAb FN1 (1:400, Sigma F6140 or Abcam ab6328). Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 647, Cy3, and Cy5 were used (Thermo Scientific), and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted using Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech). Images were collected using a Leica SP8 inverted confocal microscope (Leica) using an Ã63/0.50 Plan Fluotar objective. The confocal settings were as follows: pinhole, 1 Airy unit; scan speed, 400 Hz bidirectional; format 1024Ã1024 or 512Ã512. Images were collected using photomultiplier tube detectors with the following detection mirror settings: DAPI, 410â483; Alexa Fluor 488, 498â545 nm; Cy3, 565â623 nm; Cy5, 638â750 nm using the 405 nm, 488 nm, 540 nm, 640 nm laser lines. Alternatively, images were collected using EVOS M7000 (Thermo Fisher) using Ã40/1.3 NA oil objective. Images were collected in a sequential manner to minimize bleed-through between channels.</p><p>For fluorescence live imaging with Rab5-GFP, cells were plated onto Ibidi Î¼-plates and imaged using Zeiss LSM880 NLO (Zeiss). For split-GFP experiments, cells were seeded for 24 hr onto Ibidi Î¼-plates before imaging with an Olympus IXplore SpinSR (Olympus) with Ã100 oil magnification. Prior to imaging, media was changed to FluoroBrite media with the appropriate supplements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Human lung samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE). 5 Î¼m FFPE sections were obtained and mounted onto Superfrost Plus (Thermo Scientific) slides and subjected to antigen heat retrieval using citrate buffer (Abcam, ab208572), in a pre-heated steam bath for 20 min, before cooling to room temperature in a water bath for 20 min. Slides were then treated with 3â4% hydrogen peroxide (Leica Biosystems RE7101) for 10 min, blocked in SuperBlock (TBS) blocking buffer for a minimum of 1 hr (Thermo Scientific; 37581), and probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4Â°C in 10% SuperBlock solution in Tris Buffered Saline Tween 20 solution (TBS-T, pH 7.6).

ColI is endocytosed by fibroblasts, prior to exocytosis and formation of fibrils, which can include a mixture of endogenous/nascent ColI chains and exogenous ColI. ColI uptake and fibrillogenesis are regulated by circadian rhythm as described by the authors in 2020, thanks to the dependence of this pathway on circadian-clock-regulated protein VPS33B. Cells are capable of forming fibrils with recently endocytosed ColI along when nascent chains are not available. Previously identified VPS33B is demonstrated not to have a role in endocytosis of ColI, but to play a role in fibril formation, which the authors demonstrate by showing the loss of fibril formation in VPS33B KO, and an excess of insoluble fibrils - along-side a decrease in soluble ColI secretion - in VPS33B overexpression conditions. A VPS33B binding protein VIPAS39 is also shown to be required for fibrillogenesis and to colocalise with ColI. The authors thus conclude that ColI is internalised into endosomal structures within the cell, and that ColI, VPS33B and VIPA39 are co-trafficked to the site of fibrillogenesis, where along with ITGA11, which by mass spectrometric analysis is shown to be regulated by VPS33B levels, ColI fibrils are formed. Interestingly, in involved human skin sections from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients, ITGA11 and VPS33B expression is increased compared to healthy tissue, while in patient-derived fibroblasts, uptake of fluorescently-labelled ColI is also increased. This suggests that there may be a significant contribution of endocytosis-dependent fibrillogenesis in the formation of fibrotic and chronic wound-healing diseases in humans.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is an interesting paper that contributes an exciting novel understanding of the formation of fibrotic disease, which despite its high occurrence, still has no robust therapeutic options. The precise mechanisms of fibrillogenesis are also not well understood, so a study devoted to this complex and key mechanism is well appreciated. The dependence of fibrillogenesis on VPS33B and VIPA39 is convincing and robust, while the distinction between soluble ColI secretion and insoluble fibrillar ColI is interesting and informative.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are a number of limitations to this study in its current state. Inhibition of ColI uptake is performed using Dyngo4a, which although proposed as an inhibitor of Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is known to be quite un-specific. This may not be a problem however, as the endocytic mechanism for ColI also does not seem to be well defined in the literature, in fact, the principle mechanism described in the papers referred to by the authors is that of phagocytosis. It would be interesting to explore this important part of the mechanism further, especially in relation to the intracellular destination of ColI. The circadian regulation does not appear as robust as the authors last paper, however, there could be a larger lag between endocytosis of ColI and realisation of fibrils. The authors state that the endocytic pathway is the mechanism of trafficking and that they show ColI, VPS33B and VIPA39 are co-trafficked. However, the only link that is put forward to the endosomes is rather tenuously through VPS33B/VIPA39. There is no direct demonstration of ColI localisation to endosomes (ie. immunofluorescence), and this is overstated throughout the text. Demonstrating the intracellular trafficking and localisation of ColI, and its actual relationship to VPS33B and VIPA39, followed by ITGA11, would broaden the relevance of this paper significantly to incorporate the field of protein trafficking. Finally, the &quot;self-formation&quot; of ColI fibrils is discussed in relation to the literature and the concentration of fluorescently-tagged ColI, however as the key message of the paper is the fibrillogenesis from exocytosed colI, I do not feel like it is demonstrated to leave no doubt. Specific inhibition of intracellular trafficking steps, or following the progressive formation of ColI fibrils over time by immunofluorescence would demonstrate without any further doubt that ColI must be endocytosed first, to form fibrils as a secondary step, rather than externally-added ColI being incorporated directly to fibrils, independent of cellular uptake.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95842.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Chang et al. investigated the mechanisms governing collagen fibrillogenesis, firstly demonstrating that cells within tail tendons are able to uptake exogenous collagen and use this to synthesize new collagen-1 fibrils. Using an endocytic inhibitor, the authors next showed that endocytosis was required for collagen fibrillogenesis and that this process occurs in a circadian rhythmic manner. Using knockdown and overexpression assays, it was then demonstrated that collagen fibril formation is controlled by vacuolar protein sorting 33b (VPS33b), and this VPS33b-dependent fibrillogenesis is mediated via Integrin alpha-11 (ITGA11). The authors also demonstrated increased expression of VPS33b and ITGA11 at the gene level in fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and greater expression of these proteins in both lung samples from IPF patients and in chronic skin wounds, indicating that endocytic recycling is disrupted in fibrotic diseases. Finally, the authors performed knockdown assays in patient derived IPF fibroblasts to confirm that silencing of VPS33b and ITGA11 results in a decrease in recycling of exogenous collagen-1</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have performed a comprehensive functional analysis of the regulators of endocytic recycling of collagen, providing compelling evidence that VPS33b and ITGA11 are crucial regulators of this process, and that this endocytic recycling becomes disrupted in fibrotic diseases.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

The dependence of fibrillogenesis on VPS33B and VIPA39 is convincing and robust, while the distinction between soluble ColI secretion and insoluble fibrillar ColI is interesting and informative.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are a number of limitations to this study in its current state. Inhibition of ColI uptake is performed using Dyngo4a, which although proposed as an inhibitor of Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is known to be quite un-specific. This may not be a problem however, as the endocytic mechanism for ColI also does not seem to be well defined in the literature, in fact, the principle mechanism described in the papers referred to by the authors is that of phagocytosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Macropinocytosis or phagocytosis could be modelled using high molecular weight dextran, and we have used fluorescently-labelled dextran to investigate potential co-localisation with exogenous collagen to investigate the involvement of these mechanisms in addition to endocytosis, and showed very little co-localisation (revised Figure S2B, lines 123-126). Further, we have performed a competition experiment where unlabelled collagen was added in excess at the same time as labelled collagen and showed that excess unlabelled collagen led to a retention of labelled collagen at the cell periphery (revised Figure S2C, lines 126-129). This is suggestive of collagen-I uptake utilises a different pathway to dextran (i.e. fluid-phase endocytosis) and is a receptor-mediated process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be interesting to explore this important part of the mechanism further, especially in relation to the intracellular destination of ColI.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the intracellular destination of ColI is very interesting, which is what the current Chang lab is investigating, although we believe the research findings fall out of scope for the revised manuscript here. However, we have included additional immunofluorescence data to support that collagen is indeed taken up into endosomal compartments using GFP-tagged Rab5 constructs (revised Figure 1D, Figure S6A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The circadian regulation does not appear as robust as the authors' last paper, however, there could be a larger lag between endocytosis of ColI and realisation of fibrils.</p><p>The authors state that the endocytic pathway is the mechanism of trafficking and that they show ColI, VPS33B, and VIPA39 are co-trafficked. However, the only link that is put forward to the endosomes is rather tenuously through VPS33B/VIPA39.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that we meant the post-Golgi compartment. We did not mean VPS33b/VIPAS39 as an endosome marker; however as we see collagen entering the cell in intracellular compartments, which is then recycled, we take that as convention, the endosome would be involved. This is further supported that we see some colocalisation with the classic Rab5 endosome marker.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no direct demonstration of ColI localisation to endosomes (ie. immunofluorescence), and this is overstated throughout the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment and have modified overstatements in the revised manuscript as appropriate. As stated above, we have included additional immunofluorescence data to support that collagen is indeed taken up into endosomal compartments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Demonstrating the intracellular trafficking and localisation of ColI, and its actual relationship to VPS33B and VIPA39, followed by ITGA11, would broaden the relevance of this paper significantly to incorporate the field of protein trafficking. Finally, the &quot;self-formation&quot; of ColI fibrils is discussed in relation to the literature and the concentration of fluorescently-tagged ColI, however as the key message of the paper is the fibrillogenesis from exocytosed colI, I do not feel like it is demonstrated to leave no doubt. Specific inhibition of intracellular trafficking steps, or following the progressive formation of ColI fibrils over time by immunofluorescence would demonstrate without any further doubt that ColI must be endocytosed first, to form fibrils as a secondary step, rather than externally-added ColI being incorporated directly to fibrils, independent of cellular uptake.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concern raised here. This is precisely why we trypsinised and replated cells as part of the workflow, so we can make sure that there is no residual exogenous collagen which is not endocytosed being incorporated onto pre-existing fibrils. We have new data using flow imaging, which showed that cells that donât endocytose exogenous collagen has accumulation of said collagen at the periphery of the cells, which is greatly reduced after trypsinisation. This new data is in a more detailed methodology-based study which is under preparation, which will allow future studies to further dissect the collagen intracellular trafficking process, and thus is not included in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors describe a mechanism, by which fluorescently-labelled Collagen type</p><p>I is taken up by cells via endocytosis and then incorporated into newly synthesized fibers via an ITGA11 and VPS33B-dependent mechanism.

The ponceau stain suggests that Dyngo4a treatment did not affect global secretion and thus the effects are specific to collagen-I (Fig 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors use commercial rat tail collagen, it is unclear to me which state the collagen is in when it's endocytosed. Is it fully assembled as collagen fiber or are those single heterotrimers or homotrimers?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the confusion and will clarify in our revision. These would be single helical trimers from acid-extracted rat tail collagen. We have performed additional light scattering and CD spectra to confirm the molecular weight and helicity, and confirm that adding fluorescent tags did not alter the readout. We have included this in the revised manuscript (revised Figure S1A-C, manuscript lines 82-86).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Cy-labeled collagen is clearly incorporated into new fibers, but I'm not sure whether the collagen is needed to be endocytosed to be incorporated into the fibers or if that is happening in the extracellular space mediated by the cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concern raised here, which is also raised by reviewer 1.

To fully understand this mechanism is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the siRNA transfection, a control blot for efficiency would be great to estimate the effect size. To me it is not clear where the endocytosed collagen and VPS33B eventually meet in the cells and whether they interact.

We have conducted experiments with Col1-GFP11 containing conditioned media incubated with VPS33b-barrell in the revised paper, which showed that they interact within the cell and not at the cell periphery (revised Figure 6G, lines 293-296), again highlighting that VPS33b is not involved in the endocytosis step but interacts with endocytosed collagen-I intracellularly. We have attempted colocliasation studies using the split GFP approach with VPS33B and ITGA11 to investigate where they interact, but as the ITGA11 construct we used did not localise to the cell surface as expected, we are not confident that this system is appropriate for investigating how/if VPS33B interacts with ITGA11, and there are simply no good antibody for VPS33B for staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show an upregulation of ITGA11 and VPS33B in IPF patients-derived fibroblasts, which can be correlated to an increased level of ColI uptake, however, it is not clear whether this increased uptake in those cells is due to the elevated levels of VPS33B and/or ITGA11.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify here that we do not think collagen-I uptake is due to VPS33B and/or ITGA11, as siITGA11 and VPS33B in fibroblasts showed no consistent changes in uptake as determined by flow cytometry, which was included in the original manuscript (now revised Figure 6H, 7I). VPS33B and ITGA11 are involved in the âoutwardâ arm of recycled collagen-I, i.e. directing to fibrillogenesis route. We agree that the inclusion of additional functional studies using IPF patient-derived patient fibroblasts would add to the manuscript, and have performed siRNA against VPS33B and ITGA11 on IPF fibroblasts, and demonstrated a late of endocytic recycling events (revised Figure 8D, S6B, lines 351-353).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Chang et al. investigated the mechanisms governing collagen fibrillogenesis, firstly demonstrating that cells within tail tendons are able to uptake exogenous collagen and use this to synthesize new collagen-1 fibrils. Using an endocytic inhibitor, the authors next showed that endocytosis was required for collagen fibrillogenesis and that this process occurs in a circadian rhythmic manner. Using knockdown and overexpression assays, it was then demonstrated that collagen fibril formation is controlled by vacuolar protein sorting 33b (VPS33b), and this VPS33b-dependent fibrillogenesis is mediated via Integrin alpha-11 (ITGA11). Finally, the authors demonstrated increased expression of VPS33b and ITGA11 at the gene level in fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and greater expression of these proteins in both lung samples from IPF patients and in chronic skin wounds, indicating that endocytic recycling is disrupted in fibrotic diseases.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have performed a comprehensive functional analysis of the regulators of endocytic recycling of collagen, providing compelling evidence that VPS33b and ITGA11 are crucial regulators of this process.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Throughout the study, several different cell types have been used (immortalised tail tendon fibroblasts, NIHT3T cells, and HEK293T cells). In general, it is not clear which cells have been used for a particular experiment, and the rationale for using these different cell types is not explained. In addition, some experimental details are missing from the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the lack of clarity, and have filled in missing information in the methods. HEK293T cells were used for virus production for the VPSoe system, and we have clarified the cell types used in figure legends (predominantly iTTF). We have also provided justification when NIH3T3 cells were used (revised lines 290-291).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is also a lack of functional studies in patient-derived IPF fibroblasts which means the link between endocytic recycling of collagen and the role of VPS33b and ITGA11 cannot be fully established.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, which was also raised by reviewer 2 above. We agree that the inclusion of additional functional studies using IPF patient-derived patient fibroblasts would add to the manuscript and have performed siRNA against VPS33B and ITGA11 on IPF fibroblasts, and demonstrated a late of endocytic recycling events (revised Figure 8D, S6B, lines 351-353).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors inhibit Clathrin-dependent endocytosis with dyngo4a. It is well known that this inhibitor is not highly specific for this pathway. It is also not explained why the authors only inhibit the Clathrin uptake pathway, and not pinocytosis or Clathrin-independent endocytosis too. The authors refer to papers that describe pinocytosis for collagen endocytosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this question. Based on the fact that inhibition of clathrin-dependent pathway does not completely abrogate endocytosis of collagen-I, we anticipate that other pathways are involved in mediating collagen-I uptake, although additional data suggested this is unlikely through fluid-phase endocytosis, and is receptor mediated (revised Figure S2B, C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Where does the ColI go in the cell? Depending on the uptake pathway, it is likely to pass through endocytic carriers to endosomes, where it may be recycled to the PM or degraded. From the start, the authors describe the ColI as being in vesicular structures, however, the imaging data that this is based on is not co-labelled with anything to determine the potential structure/localisation. This is not done at any point in the paper, until IF is shown of ColI with VIPA39, however without the relevant controls, this IF is unconvincing, as the general pattern of ColI and VIPA39 as an endosomal marker are not classically recognisable. Additionally, VPS33B is described as a late endosome/lysosome marker, which would have different connotations on ColI trafficking or destination than other types of endosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the weaknesses in our original IF. We have included new confocal images showing labelled collagen co-localisation with GFP-tagged Rab5 through transient transfection, which is a more traditional endosome marker (revised Figure 1D, Figure S6A).</p><p>We are currently characterising the compartments to where ColI is trafficked to, which is being prepared as part of a methodology-based manuscript. We believe that this characterisation would be too detailed to be included in a revised version of this manuscript. The Kadler lab also have data suggesting that the lysosome is involved in collagen fibrillogenesis instead of its canonical degradation function, which is in another submitted manuscript (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1336021/v1">https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1336021/v1</ext-link>). It was not included in this manuscript due to our focus (i.e. endocytic-recycling).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5H, the pattern of Cy5-ColI staining looks like it could even be ER/Golgi in the VPSKO zoom panel, but in the absence of co-labelling, we cannot conclude anything. In order for the authors to conclude that ColI is within the endosomes, co-labelled If should be performed to demonstrate ColIendosomal colocalization. Likewise for the role of VPS33B in ColI fibrillogenesis: dependence of the process is demonstrated, but the relationship is not defined. This could be clarified using IF. This would also support the authors' statements of co-trafficking between ColI, VPS33B, and VIPA39, which as the paper stands, is not demonstrated.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that our hypothesis is that the endosome controls how collagen is being deposited outside the cell, i.e. whether itâs protomeric secretion or fibrillogenesis, and that the decision of whether an endocytosed collagen is recycled or degraded lies in this compartment. The reviewer is correct that it may not be just the endosome that endocytosed collagen-I ends up in, as we have new data suggesting involvement of other intracellular compartment, although the detailed mechanism is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Nonetheless, we have included new data showing co-localisation of endocytosed collagen with Rab5 in this revised manuscript (revised Figure 1D, Figure S6A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The basis of this paper is that endocytosis of ColI must occur before re-exocytosis as fibrillar ColI. The authors show this through pulse-chase experiments, with a trypsinisation step to remove any externally bound ColI. The authors also show nice time progression by flow cytometry, but it would truly demonstrate this point if they showed 0 timepoint, or low timepoint of IF to show progressive lengthening of ColI fibrils. This is used early on in Figure 1D, although the presentation here is not very clear. This is especially important as the authors address the self-seeding capabilities of Collagen in cell-free conditions in Figure 1F.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion. From previous endogenously tagged collagen data, we know that the appearance of collagen fibrils is rather rapid, thus it may not be a gradual lengthening as expected, but rather a depletion of endocytosed collagen in the initial seeding/growth step (please see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1336021/v1">https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1336021/v1</ext-link>). We have included an image of replated fibroblasts after 18 hours showing no appearance of extracellular collagen, endogenous or otherwise (revised Figures S2A, line 110).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, although the involvement of ITGA11 is interesting, it is not well described, and its role is not well demonstrated. This could likely be clarified by an additional introduction to ITGA11 and its role in collagen exocytosis/fibrillogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing this out and have included additional sentences to specifically introduce ITGA11 and its role in fibrillogenesis (see lines 320, 321; 446-450).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific points:</p><p>Line 73: You haven't compared reuse vs production, so you can't say that reuse is central rather than production. They may be both as important or production still may be the most crucial, maybe it depends on cell/collagen type. Using the ColI KD or CHX to block nascent synthesis, you could directly compare the impact of both.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that we are not referring to reuse/recycling here. We meant that production of collagen (i.e. single hetero/homotrimer molecules within the cell) is not as crucial as the utilisation (i.e. are these being secreted as protomers, or assembled into fibrils) of these building blocks by the cells, which was supported by our finding that production (as suggested by mRNA levels) of IPF fibroblasts are similar to that in control fibroblasts (now revised Figure 8A). We have conducted ColI siRNA to block nascent synthesis in the original manuscript and showed that fibroblasts can efficiently make new fibrils by recycling exogenous collagen (Figure 3B, C), although we appreciate that siRNA may not completely inhibit endogenous production. Thus, we have also included new data using collagen-I knockout cells to support our hypothesis that without endogenous production, fibroblasts can still effectively make collagen fibrils if they can reuse what is available in the extracellular space (revised Figure 4, Figure S3C, D; lines 178-199).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 83-87: The rationale for this experiment is not clear. Cy3-ColI is added, taken up into cells, and incorporated into fibrils coming from cells. 5FAM-ColI is added at a later stage, then at 2 days (when incorporation is demonstrated in Fig 1B), it is also incorporated into cells as expected. Why does this comment on ColI not being degraded any more than Cy3-ColI alone?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the pulse chase experiment using the differently tagged collagen demonstrated a dimension of dynamics that is not demonstrated with Cy3-ColI alone. In this case, Cy3-ColI was initially added, and removed after 3 days; 5FAM-ColI is then added and incubated for 2 more days. Thus after 5 days since the initial pulse, the Cy3-ColI persisted and was not degraded.

This is clear in the image but no explanation/reference is given.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the dynamic and complex nature of ECM, it is unsurprising if there is a knockon effect when knocking down one matrix protein. However, we have quantified the amount of fibronectin fibril deposited by scr and siCol1a1 fibroblasts, and showed that there was in fact no significant change between the two treatments (revised Figure 3A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3A: Need labels for which colour/protein is shown.

Does the ColI antibody recognise the exogenous ColI?</p></disp-quote><p>In our hands the ColI antibody does not recognise exogenous ColI, as the cell-free Cy3-ColI images were also stained with ColI antibody to ensure the two experimental conditions were treated exactly the same.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This conclusion could only be made in the true absence of collagen: either in knock-out cells, or where collagen production/trafficking has been blocked (ie knockout of ColI chaperone or ERES block), or in a cell type that produces collagens but not ColI. Alternatively, if there are any fibrils seen that are completely negative, they should be shown in the figure and quantified (number of Cy3-ColI+-ColI+ vs Cy3-ColI+-ColI-).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have included new data from collagen knock-out fibroblasts in this revision (revised Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S4A: the quality of this blot isn't very high, the result is not very clear and the high intensity (unspecific?) band below confounds the interpretation.

It would be nice to include a clearer blot, maybe from the other repeats.</p></disp-quote><p>This is the only blot that we used to select which knockout clones to use for our previous paper, which is why the quality is not as high. Knockout clones were all verified with additional western blots, and we do not think that endogenous VPS33b is expressed at high levels (also verified by MS analyses). Fig S4D is overexpression of VPS33b, which is much easier to detect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S4D: This blot is much clearer, it would be useful to include a high gain to show the VPS33B band in CT to be able to understand the true increase.</p></disp-quote><p>From the qPCR data one can see that the increase at mRNA is 20+ fold increase; weâve always had problems trying to detect endogenous VPS33b using western blot or mass spectrometry analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4A: The fibrils here in the CT are not obvious, and the difference between CT and KOs is not appreciable.

These are cell-derived matrices in culture and thus lower magnification may not show as many collagen fibrils as one would expect. We are not confident that lower magnification will provide more information as the characteristic D-banded collagen pattern will be lost.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 167/Figure 4B: It looks like there is more internal ColI in KO, but the images are not good enough to tell.

E must also measure other ECM matrix proteins, which do you expect to be secreted by these cells? Could this confound the data if they too are affected by VPSoe?</p></disp-quote><p>IF is showing specifically collagen-I. Hydroxyproline detects multiple collagens, and shows a trend of increase (although not significant due to one outlier). Matrix mass is a very generic measurement of total ECM deposited based on decellularized ECM weight. The reviewer is correct that VPSoe may also affect other ECM deposition, however here we are focussing specifically with its effect on collagen-I. How VPSoe changes other types of ECM deposition would be something that could be addressed in future studies and is not within scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the results in E paired?</p></disp-quote><p>Individual values between control and VPSoe in each separate experiments are paired.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4F: Is quantification from IF shown in D?

VPS33B is thought to be at the late endosome/lysosome. However, these images do not look like classic endosomes or lysosomes, or other normal organelle IF phenotypes. The fluorescent intensity looks saturated, and it is difficult to conclude anything from these images. It is unclear where in the cell the largest blob in the zoom would be localised and in which cell. I would suggest that this image is replaced and proper controls included (IgG controls and single channels) as well as using different markers for other potential intracellular structures.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers comment with regards to the classification of VPS33b localisation in the endosome compartment. We did not mean to use VPS33b as an endosome marker, as the focus of our studies are the function of VPS33b in directing endogenous or exogenous collagen to fibrillogenesis. With live imaging we could see endocytosed collagen moving in intracellular compartments, and have conducted additional staining to show co-localisation with Rab5 (revised Figure 1), which we take to indicate, through convention, that it is occupying an endosome compartment.

At this resolution, VP2ko looks like the col is ER, in one of the cells in the zoom, it looks like it is at Golgi.
