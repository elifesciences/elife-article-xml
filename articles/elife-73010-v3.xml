A commensal bacterium, <italic>Paracoccus aminovorans,</italic> was previously identified in high abundance in stool collected from individuals infected with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> when compared to stool from uninfected persons. However, if and how <italic>P. aminovorans</italic> interacts with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> has not been experimentally determined; moreover, whether any association between this bacterium alters the behaviors of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to affect the disease outcome is unclear. Here, we show that <italic>P. aminovorans</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> together form dual-species biofilm structure at the air–liquid interface, with previously uncharacterized novel features. Importantly, the presence of <italic>P. aminovorans</italic> within the murine small intestine enhances <italic>V. cholerae</italic> colonization in the same niche that is dependent on the <italic>Vibrio</italic> exopolysaccharide and other major components of mature <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm. These studies illustrate that multispecies biofilm formation is a plausible mechanism used by a gut microbe to increase the virulence of the pathogen, and this interaction may alter outcomes in enteric infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Paracoccus aminovorans</italic></kwd><kwd>biofilm</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>infectious disease</kwd><kwd>pathogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI121337</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ng</surname><given-names>Wai-Leung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI123494</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weil</surname><given-names>Ana A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2GM146253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25 GM066567</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rivera Seda</surname><given-names>Abigail</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1015763.02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A specific gut microbe <italic>Paracoccus aminovorans</italic> enhances host colonization of the human pathogen <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> by forming dual-species biofilm structures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> (<italic>Vc</italic>) causes an estimated 3 million infections and 120,000 deaths each year, and larger and more deadly outbreaks have increased during the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Camacho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luquero et al., 2016</xref>). A wide range of clinical outcomes occur in persons exposed to <italic>Vc</italic>, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe secretory diarrhea. It is nearly certain that many behaviors of <italic>Vc</italic> in the aquatic environment and inside the host are significantly affected by the presence of other microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weil and Ryan, 2018</xref>), and recent studies provide evidence that the gut microbiota may impact the severity of cholera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alavi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Levade et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Midani et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Several functions of the gut microbiota influence the growth or colonization of enteric pathogens, including production of antimicrobial compounds, maintenance of the intestinal barrier, regulation of the host immune response, and modulation of available nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McKenney and Pamer, 2015</xref>). Gut microbes have been shown to have an important role in <italic>Vc</italic> infection in various animal models. For instance, disruption of the commensal microbiota with antibiotics is required to allow successful <italic>Vc</italic> colonization in adult rodent models. Starvation and streptomycin treatment are needed to reduce the intestinal normal flora to allow <italic>Vc</italic> infection to occur in the cecum and the entire bowel in guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freter, 1955</xref>). In another case, streptomycin treatment is needed to allow <italic>Vc</italic> colonization, mainly in the cecum and large intestine, of adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nygren et al., 2009</xref>). Conversely, <italic>Vc</italic> actively employs a type VI secretion system to attack host commensal microbiota to enhance colonization of the gut in infant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, specific microbial species have a profound impact on <italic>Vc</italic> colonization. Pre-colonization with <italic>Blautia obeum</italic>, an anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium, in adult gnotobiotic mice decreases the <italic>Vc</italic> counts in the feces after infection. <italic>B. obeum</italic> is thought to produce a signaling molecule that induces <italic>Vc</italic> into a high cell-density quorum sensing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsiao et al., 2014</xref>) in which virulence gene expression is repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watve et al., 2020</xref>). Certain microbiota species reduce <italic>Vc</italic> colonization in germfree adult and suckling mice by producing the enzyme bile salt hydrolase that degrades the host-produced virulence-activating compound taurocholate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alavi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsiao et al., 2014</xref>). Through metabolizing host glycans into short-chain fatty acids that suppress <italic>Vc</italic> growth, a prominent commensal species, <italic>Bacteroides vulgatus,</italic> reduces <italic>Vc</italic> proliferation within the intestine of germfree adult mice and typical laboratory infant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">You et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While the above studies exemplify how a single microbe or a group of microbes can protect the host from <italic>Vc</italic> infection, the mechanisms used by certain gut microbes to promote <italic>Vc</italic> virulence, thereby increasing the likelihood of individuals developing cholera and worsening disease outcomes, are less well understood. We have previously studied household contacts of cholera patients to understand how gut microbes impact on susceptibility to cholera, and we identified bacteria associated with increased or decreased susceptibility to <italic>Vc</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Levade et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Midani et al., 2018</xref>). We also observed that the gut microbial species <italic>Paracoccus aminovorans</italic> (<italic>Pa</italic>) was more abundant in the gut microbiota during <italic>Vc</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Midani et al., 2018</xref>). This association between <italic>Pa</italic> and <italic>Vc</italic> is unusual because most of the native gut microbiota is typically displaced by secretory diarrhea during cholera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">David et al., 2015</xref>). To determine the underlying mechanisms driving these correlative clinical findings, we evaluated the relationship between <italic>Pa</italic> and <italic>Vc</italic> in co-culture and determined the effects of <italic>Pa</italic> on <italic>Vc</italic> infection outcomes with in vivo models. Here, we show that <italic>Pa</italic> interacts directly with <italic>Vc</italic> to form dual-species biofilm structures with previously uncharacterized features. Moreover, <italic>Vc</italic> colonization inside the animal host is enhanced by the presence of <italic>Pa</italic> in the small intestine, and this effect is dependent upon <italic>Vc</italic> biofilm production. Our findings demonstrate a plausible mechanism by which a gut microbe specifically associates with <italic>Vc,</italic> and this reinforces our microbiome analysis in humans that identified <italic>Pa</italic> as highly associated with infected individuals. Our findings also demonstrate that interactions between these two species have the potential to directly impact <italic>Vc</italic> pathogenesis and alter outcomes in human <italic>Vc</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>P. aminovorans</italic> is differentially abundant in individuals with active <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infection</title><p><italic>Paracoccus</italic> is a genus of soil microbes found in low abundance in the gut microbiome of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Urakami et al., 1990</xref>). Our previously published analysis of stool gut microbes from household contacts of cholera patients identified <italic>Pa</italic> as an unexpectedly abundant gut microbe during active <italic>Vc</italic> infection, and this organism was rarely found in uninfected participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Midani et al., 2018</xref>). In this prior study, we used a support vector machine (SVM) model with recursive feature elimination to learn patterns of relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that distinguished infected (defined as <italic>Vc</italic> DNA detected in stool or a stool culture with <italic>Vc</italic> growth) from uninfected persons (<italic>Vc</italic> DNA undetected in stool and <italic>Vc</italic> stool culture negative). The model was trained on a subset of study participants and tested on another subset in a hold-out validation. Here, we have extracted data from this prior study to examine separately the <italic>Pa</italic> OTUs in infected compared to uninfected persons. <italic>Pa</italic> abundance was significantly higher as a proportion of the total sequencing reads in the stool of infected household contacts (6/22, 27%) compared to only 5.6% (2/36) of uninfected individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, p=0.009 by Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test). The ratio of <italic>Pa</italic> to <italic>Vc</italic> abundance present during infection was variable and averaged 1:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These findings were particularly interesting because typically there is a drastic reduction of nearly all gut microbes during active <italic>Vc</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">David et al., 2015</xref>) due to secretory diarrhea, oral rehydration solution ingestion, and <italic>Vc</italic> infection itself, and yet here <italic>Pa</italic> was found in an increased abundance in some actively infected participants. The <italic>Vc</italic> count in <italic>Pa</italic>-colonized infected household contacts compared to non-<italic>Pa</italic> colonized household contacts was modestly higher (approximately threefold) in this study; however, statistically the difference was not significant (Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test, p=0.1474), which is likely due to small sample size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that <italic>Pa</italic> may be resistant to displacement from the gut during infection. While our previous study demonstrates a positive correlation between <italic>Pa</italic> in human stool and <italic>Vc</italic> infection, a causal relationship between this gut microbiota species and <italic>Vc</italic> infection had not been previously established.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Paracoccus aminovorans</italic> (<italic>Pa</italic>) is more abundant in persons with <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> (<italic>Vc</italic>) infection compared to uninfected persons.</title><p>In a prior study of household contacts of cholera patients in Bangladesh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Midani et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>Pa</italic> was identified as differentially abundant using a support vector machine model with recursive feature elimination in order to discriminate patterns of microbial taxa relative abundance that distinguished infected from uninfected persons.

Although we do not fully understand the exact composition and growth dynamics of <italic>Vc</italic> and <italic>Pa</italic> inside the human gut, the pre-colonization/infection scheme was aimed to closely simulate the ratio of <italic>Pa</italic> to <italic>Vc</italic> observed in the gut microbiota of <italic>Vc</italic>-infected humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>).

Using this infection model, similar to human infection, the <italic>Vc:Pa</italic> ratio inside the mouse intestine at the early stage of infection (6 hr after <italic>Vc</italic> infection, 18 hr after the last <italic>Pa</italic> inoculation) was variable, but was approximately 10:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Our findings highlight the importance of coupling mechanistic studies (in vitro and animal models) with human microbiome data analysis to pinpoint the relevant species and interactions involved in enteric infections.</p><p>Here, we show that the presence of a human gut microbe <italic>Pa</italic> promotes <italic>Vc</italic> host colonization, which is consistent with our prior human study in which <italic>Pa</italic> was more likely to be present in persons infected with <italic>Vc</italic>. This raises the possibility that uncharacterized interactions between <italic>Vc</italic> and members of the gut microbiota may exacerbate <italic>Vc</italic> virulence and contribute to increased morbidity. While our previous study showed that <italic>Vc</italic> has a better growth yield in the conditioned medium (CM) harvested from stationary culture of <italic>Pa</italic> than in the CM harvested from stationary culture <italic>Vc</italic>, the growth yield of <italic>Vc</italic> in the CM harvested from stationary culture of <italic>Pa</italic> does not reach as high as <italic>Vc</italic> in fresh medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Midani et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Pa</italic> does not actively secrete any molecules that enhance <italic>Vc</italic> growth. Most likely, the limited growth yield increase of <italic>Vc</italic> in the CM harvested from <italic>Pa</italic> is due to the presence of a trace amount of nutrients that have been exhausted in the CM harvested from <italic>Vc</italic>. In contrast, this study establishes a plausible mechanism used by <italic>Pa</italic>, and perhaps other gut microbes, to increase the virulence of <italic>Vc</italic> through induction of biofilm formation, a physiological state in which <italic>Vc</italic> is known to increase expression of other virulence factors critical for human infection and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tamayo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallego-Hernandez et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Vc</italic> biofilms have also been demonstrated to deform and even damage tissue-engineered soft epithelia mimicking the host tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cont et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that in vivo-formed biofilm structures could negatively impact host gut physiology.</p><p>While VPS and other biofilm components are not usually considered critical host colonization factors, we found that these macromolecular structures were essential for the enhancement of <italic>Vc</italic> host colonization induced by <italic>Pa</italic>. Whether these components mediate other <italic>Vc</italic>-gut microbe interaction has not been studied. Interestingly, many gut microbes appear to exist in the form of mixed-species biofilms on mucosal surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sadiq et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that microbiota-induced biofilm enhancement could play a major role in modulating virulence of other pathogens. Many structural components, regulatory factors, and signaling transduction pathways that control biofilm formation in <italic>Vc</italic> have been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Teschler et al., 2015</xref>), and these factors could be targeted for manipulation by other gut microbes that modulate <italic>Vc</italic> virulence. For example, 3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-ol (DPO) was recently discovered as a new class of <italic>Vc</italic> QS autoinducer that binds to the transcription factor VqmA to activate expression of <italic>vqmR</italic>, which encodes a small regulatory RNA that downregulates <italic>Vc</italic> biofilm formation. The VqmA-VqmR system can be activated both in vitro by <italic>E. coli</italic> and in vivo by <italic>B. obeum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papenfort et al., 2017</xref>), and results in suppression of biofilm formation. Interestingly, <italic>Pa</italic> demonstrates the opposite tendency by promoting <italic>Vc</italic> biofilm formation, with implications for the enhancement of <italic>Vc</italic> colonization, in contrast to other commensal bacteria.</p><p>Many aspects of the <italic>Vc</italic>/<italic>Pa</italic> interaction are still unclear. What is the selective advantage that fosters the formation of dual-species biofilm? Investigation of the structure–function relationship in other multispecies biofilms, such as dental biofilms, demonstrates a coordinated organization of each species that allows for optimal nutrient and oxygen usage, as well as mechanical stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Christensen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mark Welch et al., 2016</xref>). While we did not observe any growth yield enhancement in the planktonic phase of the co-culture, there was a significant increase of <italic>Vc</italic> and <italic>Pa</italic> abundance in the co-culture pellicle at the air–liquid interface. Thus, a possible driving force of this interaction could be the optimization of nutrient sharing and distribution, or removal of toxic metabolites accumulated during growth. Biofilm formation also changes the biophysical properties of the microbial community that could facilitate host adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). The exact mechanism used by these two species to detect and coordinate with each other remains unclear. Secreted small molecules produced by <italic>Pa</italic> do not appear to impact <italic>Vc</italic> as evidenced by our prior studies in which <italic>Vc</italic> cultured in <italic>Pa</italic> spent-cell supernatant did not result in increased biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Midani et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we surmised that the close physical association between <italic>Vc</italic> and <italic>Pa</italic> cells in space in the co-culture pellicles is required for the enhanced biofilm formation. This hypothesis is supported by our microscopy analysis. The <italic>Vc–Pa</italic> interaction has two reciprocal aspects: first, <italic>Pa</italic> activates the production of VPS in <italic>Vc</italic> cells, leading to enhanced pellicle formation. Future characterizations of <italic>Pa</italic> could potentially elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of this effect <italic>Pa</italic> has on <italic>Vc</italic>. Second, in order to be integrated into the pellicle structure, <italic>Pa</italic> cells seem to physically adhere to <italic>Vc</italic> cells or alternatively to the extracellular matrix that <italic>Vc</italic> cells secrete. Future biochemical and biophysical studies to investigate this relationship may provide new insights about the interactions between <italic>Pa</italic> and <italic>Vc</italic> biofilm, and about pathogen–gut microbe interactions in general. Other members of the <italic>Paracoccus</italic> genus are known to form biofilms and encode adhesins to facilitate surface attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Srinandan et al., 2010</xref>), and the potential role of these adhesins in facilitating interaction with <italic>Vc</italic> remains to be studied.</p><p>In addition to VPS, the main structural component of <italic>Vc</italic> biofilms, we have shown that matrix proteins, including RbmA, Bap1, and RbmC, are also critical for the enhancement of <italic>Vc</italic> biofilm by <italic>Pa</italic> in the neonatal mouse colonization model. Specifically, we showed that cell–cell adhesion, conferred by RbmA, is more important than cell–surface adhesion conferred by RbmC/Bap1. Previous work established that RbmA is responsible for maintaining dense, structurally robust biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absalon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we contemplate that the Δ<italic>rbmA</italic> mutant biofilm may be mechanically impaired and become destroyed in the gut environment by physical forces such as peristaltic flow, food particle collision, and others. Likewise, such physical forces could impede biofilm colonization when biofilm adhesins are absent, which explains the slight defect in colonization of the Δ<italic>rbmC</italic>Δ<italic>bap1</italic> mutant. Indeed, recently <italic>Vc</italic> cells have been visualized in the mouse gut and the biofilm population has been shown to be located primarily at the tip of the villi, where fluid shear is strongest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallego-Hernandez et al., 2020</xref>). These relationships may be further revealed by additional imaging of the distribution of the <italic>Vc</italic> and <italic>Pa</italic> cells and potentially other commensal bacteria in the new mouse model presented here.</p><p>In conclusion, we describe a novel interaction between <italic>Vc</italic> and a gut microbe found in high abundance in <italic>Vc-</italic>infected persons that leads to a significant change in <italic>Vc</italic> biofilm behaviors, as well as an increase in the virulence of the pathogen. Our findings are also consistent with other observations that rare gut microbial species can have significant impacts on microbial ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jousset et al., 2017</xref>). This study adds to the growing number of pathogen–gut microbial species interactions that may impact outcomes in human diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Prior published study sample collection and analysis</title><p>In a prior study, we enrolled household contacts of persons hospitalized with cholera at the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Midani et al., 2018</xref>).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Impact of a human gut microbe on <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> host colonization through biofilm enhancement&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Based on this consultation, it was concluded that additional data are required to support the claim of the study, namely that <italic>Paracoccus aminovorans</italic> enhances biofilm production by <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>. In this context, the experts are keen to see transcriptional and/or protein-level data shat show changes in expression of the vps genes or those genes that encode for the accessory proteins (RbmA, RbmC, Bap1 etc). Furthermore, transcriptional or protein-level data of canonical virulence factors-encoding genes (ctx, tcp)/ proteins (CTX by ELISA or TcpA by WB for instance) should be provided, as those data would support the notion on increased virulence of Vc in the presence of Pa.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide data to show that Pa increases biofilm production through transcriptional or protein-level data. Indeed, as Midani et al. (2018) showed that conditioned medium from <italic>P. aminovorans</italic> significantly increased growth of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, it seems essential for your study to distinguish between increased growth (and hence more biofilm in the pellicles) versus biofilm enhancement, as claimed in your manuscript.</p><p>2) Please evaluate the impact of Pa on the production of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>'s main virulence factors.</p><p>3) Please provide a reanalysis of the data shown in Figure 1 to show the abundance/normalized abundance of P.a. and V.c.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– In Figure 1A, the authors could determine the relative abundance of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> in the 22 infected individuals to demonstrate that there a positive correlation between the abundance of <italic>P. aminovorans</italic> and the abundance of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> in the 6 individuals with a significantly higher proportion of <italic>P. aminovorans</italic>. The authors could also determine the &quot;Normalized Abundance&quot; of <italic>P. aminovorans</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> in these samples.</p><p>– The authors could also determine CFU of <italic>P. aminovorans</italic> in their suckling mouse model of infection to determine whether there is a correlation between the abundance of <italic>P. aminovorans</italic> and the abundance of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> during infection of these mice. This would also allow them to determine whether the ratio of abundance in mice is also 1:1 as observed in human samples.</p><p>– In Supplemental Figure 1, the authors could analyze their microbiota sequencing data to determine whether members of the Proteobacteria Phylum are being displaced by <italic>P. aminovorans</italic> at the Family level.</p><p>– The authors could measure the expression of a <italic>V. cholerae</italic> virulence factor (such as tcpA) by qPCR to determine whether there is an increase in virulence factor expression in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> in the presence of <italic>P. aminovorans</italic> (Figure 2B and Figure 2C).</p><p>– In Lines 166-168, the authors state, &quot;Our findings also illustrate that our approach to microbiome studies in humans (6, 7) can be used as a predictive tool to identify gut microbes that alter Vc virulence.&quot; The authors should replace the word &quot;virulence&quot; with &quot;colonization&quot; which seems more appropriate for the data shown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Based on the results shown in Figure xx the authors are proposing that <italic>P. aminovorans</italic> increases the ability of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to produce VPL (Vibrio polysaccharides). I think this is an interesting point towards the mechanistic understanding by which <italic>P. aminovorans</italic> can enhances biofilm formation of this pathogens. I think it would be nice to further obtain support for this hypothesis using a transcription reporter fusion to a vpl-associated promoter to obtain further support for this proposal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The introduction would be greatly improved by being specific about the model in which previous studies were done, where <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is found within the intestine in each model, and how the association between <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and the microbe of interest was established in the study (i.e. stool cultures vs intestinal tissue). When discussing concordant vs discordant observations, these details are very important (eg line 141).</p><p>2) Figure 2: Figure 2A: Here the authors show the results of a colonization assay in which Pa is inoculated into mice every 12 hours for 48 hours. Were the measurements taken at 24 and 48 hrs performed before or after the 24- and 48-hour inoculations, respectively. This should be clarified. If taken immediately after inoculation, this may not demonstrate colonization. Figure 2B: Here is Vc inoculated directly after the 48h inoculation of Pa? If so, have the authors tested whether the earlier inoculations are relevant or necessary?</p><p>3) Line 227-245 and Figure 6: Because WGA is not specific for VPS and Pa are not specifically labeled, conclusions from these studies must be tempered.</p><p>4) Line 356-259: The conclusion that Pa activates production of VPS would be greatly strengthened if transcriptional activation of the vps genes could be shown. If transcriptional activation is not observed, there is a concern that increased WGA staining in biofilms is not sufficient to support this claim.</p><p>5) Figure 2B: This strain of V<italic>. cholerae</italic> is well-known to undergo spontaneous mutations that result in QS-incompetence and increased biofilm production.

Indeed, as Midani et al. (2018) showed that conditioned medium from P. aminovorans significantly increased growth of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, it seems essential for your study to distinguish between increased growth (and hence more biofilm in the pellicles) versus biofilm enhancement, as claimed in your manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Figure 5C which shows <italic>vpsL</italic> expression results from <italic>Vc</italic> grown in coculture with <italic>Pa</italic> and <italic>Vc</italic> alone. qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that the relative transcript levels of <italic>vpsL</italic> (the first and a representative gene in the <italic>vps</italic>II operon) are higher in <italic>Vc</italic> cocultured with <italic>Pa</italic> than in <italic>Vc</italic> monoculture. In addition, in the new Figures 6C and D, we have used a P<italic><sub>vpsL</sub>-mNeonGreen</italic> reporter to show the activation of the <italic>vps</italic>II operon in the co-culture pellicle, compared to the <italic>Vc</italic> monoculture pellicle.</p><p>We also want to clarify the results in the previous study (Midani 2018). In that study, <italic>Vc</italic> yield was higher in the conditioned medium (CM) harvested from <italic>Pa</italic> than <italic>Vc</italic> yield in CM harvested from <italic>Vc</italic>. However, the growth yield of <italic>Vc</italic> in the CM harvested from <italic>Pa</italic> was never as high as <italic>Vc</italic> in fresh medium. Indeed, <italic>Vc</italic> growth is higher in CM from <italic>Pa</italic> harvested at low cell-density than in CM from <italic>Pa</italic> harvested at high cell-density (our unpublished results), suggesting that the growth enhancement observed in the previous study is due to growth-limiting nutrients present in the CM harvested from <italic>Pa</italic> which were exhausted in CM harvested from <italic>Vc</italic>. This is the underlying reason that our prior results seem to contrast with our current findings. This was confirmed in our measurement of the planktonic growth yield of <italic>Vc</italic> monoculture which is comparable to <italic>Vc</italic> growth yield in the <italic>Vc-Pa</italic> coculture (Figure 3A). Importantly, biofilm formation is not enhanced when <italic>Vc</italic> is grown in CM harvested from <italic>Pa</italic>. We have added this discussion to the revised manuscript to clarify.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please evaluate the impact of Pa on the production of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>'s main virulence factors.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new Figure 7—figure supplement 1 showing the relative transcript levels of <italic>ctxA</italic> and <italic>tcpA</italic> in <italic>Vc</italic> monoculture and <italic>Vc-Pa</italic> co-culture.</p><p>We measured virulence gene expression in regular LB medium (identical to the conditions used in the biofilm coculture experiments). Here, we noted that under these growth conditions the relative transcript levels of these virulence genes were low (e.g., compared to the relative levels of <italic>vpsL</italic> shown in Figure 5C). These results suggest that these are not ideal conditions for virulence gene expression measurement, based on prior knowledge, it is known that virulence-inducing conditions typically requires specific growth conditions (AKI) and with a shaking phase. However, shaking in AKI medium prevents proper interaction between the two species. Nonetheless, we found that <italic>ctxA</italic> and <italic>tcpA</italic> transcript levels are slightly higher in coculture (although only the <italic>ctxA</italic> comparison is statistically significant). We have edited the manuscript to include this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please provide a reanalysis of the data shown in Figure 1 to show the abundance/normalized abundance of P.a. and V.c.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified in the manuscript that Figure 1 shows normalized abundance data, and we have added new Supplementary file 1 (containing two excel tables of raw data), which include the raw and normalized abundance for <italic>Pa</italic>, and for <italic>Vc</italic> in <italic>Vc</italic>-infected persons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– In Figure 1A, the authors could determine the relative abundance of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> in the 22 infected individuals to demonstrate that there a positive correlation between the abundance of P. aminovorans and the abundance of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> in the 6 individuals with a significantly higher proportion of P. aminovorans. The authors could also determine the &quot;Normalized Abundance&quot; of P. aminovorans and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> in these samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified that the data shown in Figure 1 is normalized relative abundance, and we have shown the full raw and normalized data in the new Supplementary file 1.

The <italic>Pa</italic> counts decreased over the next 24 hours and the rate of decrease is independent of the presence of <italic>Vc</italic>. At the early onset of the infection when <italic>Pa</italic> was still detectable (6 hrs after <italic>Vc</italic> infection), the ratio between <italic>Vc</italic> and <italic>Pa</italic> is variable but close to 10:1. We have included these new data in the revised Figure 2—figure supplement 2. Although we did not observe the 1:1 ratio, which is likely due to the difference in intestinal physiology between human and mouse, we believe our model is still sufficient to show the effect of the presence of <italic>Pa</italic> inside the small intestine on <italic>Vc</italic> host colonization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Supplemental Figure 1, the authors could analyze their microbiota sequencing data to determine whether members of the Proteobacteria Phylum are being displaced by P. aminovorans at the Family level.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Panel C in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ((original Supplemental Figure 1) which shows the order-level taxonomic impact of <italic>Pa</italic> colonization) within the Proteobacteria phylum.

Based on the results shown in Figure xx the authors are proposing that P. aminovorans increases the ability of V. cholerae to produce VPL (Vibrio polysaccharides). I think this is an interesting point towards the mechanistic understanding by which P. aminovorans can enhances biofilm formation of this pathogens. I think it would be nice to further obtain support for this hypothesis using a transcription reporter fusion to a vpl-associated promoter to obtain further support for this proposal.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s request, we have obtained a strain harboring <italic>P<sub>vpsl</sub>-mNeonGreen</italic> and we have repeated the pellicle imaging in the updated Figure 6C-D. Interestingly, subpopulations of <italic>Vc</italic> cells have elevated <italic>vpsL</italic> level when co-cultured with <italic>Pa</italic>. These data are consistent with our new qRT-PCR results showing higher <italic>vpsL</italic> expression (Figure 5C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The introduction would be greatly improved by being specific about the model in which previous studies were done, where V. cholerae is found within the intestine in each model, and how the association between V. cholerae and the microbe of interest was established in the study (i.e. stool cultures vs intestinal tissue). When discussing concordant vs discordant observations, these details are very important (eg line 141).</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to include the recommended additional information on the models discussed in the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2: Figure 2A: Here the authors show the results of a colonization assay in which Pa is inoculated into mice every 12 hours for 48 hours. Were the measurements taken at 24 and 48 hrs performed before or after the 24- and 48-hour inoculations, respectively. This should be clarified. If taken immediately after inoculation, this may not demonstrate colonization. Figure 2B: Here is Vc inoculated directly after the 48h inoculation of Pa? If so, have the authors tested whether the earlier inoculations are relevant or necessary?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the ambiguity. To clarify, the animals were inoculated with four doses of <italic>Pa</italic> at 0, 12, 24, and 36-hour time points. In some animals, after two doses of <italic>Pa</italic> inoculation, the <italic>Pa</italic> count in the small intestine was determined at the 24-hr (i.e., 12 hrs after the second <italic>Pa</italic> inoculation). The <italic>Pa</italic> count was also determined after four doses of <italic>Pa</italic> inoculation at 48-hr (i.e., 12 hrs after the last <italic>Pa</italic> inoculation). <italic>Vc</italic> infection was performed 12 hrs after the last <italic>Pa</italic> inoculation, and we have shown that <italic>Pa</italic> was detectable in the small intestine at that time point prior to <italic>Vc</italic> infection. We have revised the text and figure legends to clarify.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Line 227-245 and Figure 6: Because WGA is not specific for VPS and Pa are not specifically labeled, conclusions from these studies must be tempered.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s question, we have added negative controls (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1) showing that <italic>Pa</italic> cells alone or <italic>Vc</italic> Δ<italic>vpsL</italic> mutant does not show WGA staining under the current conditions. While it is true that WGA stains GlcNAC residues, for Gram-negative bacterial cells including <italic>Vc</italic> and <italic>Pa</italic>, the WGA lectin molecules do not pass through the outer membrane. Only when the outer membrane is significantly impaired will one see strong WGA signal. Indeed, we always observe dead cells with strong WGA signal but those are easily distinguished from the VPS signal.</p><p>Regarding the labeling of <italic>Pa</italic> cells, currently we do not have good genetic tools to express fluorescent proteins in <italic>Pa</italic>; therefore, we relied on the universal membrane labeling of FM 4-64 to detect their presence in the co-culture biofilm.

In the updated Figure 6A-B, we have provided clearer zoom-in image, in which <italic>Pa</italic> cells can be clearly distinguished from <italic>Vc</italic> cells by both the absence of SCFP3A signal and the characteristic cocci shape.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Line 356-259: The conclusion that Pa activates production of VPS would be greatly strengthened if transcriptional activation of the vps genes could be shown.
