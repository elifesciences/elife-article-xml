resistant (MDR) organisms. We identified two novel orally active inhibitors, PTC-847 and PTC-672, that exhibit a narrow spectrum of activity against <italic>Ng</italic> including MDR isolates. By selecting organisms resistant to the novel inhibitors and sequencing their genomes, we identified a new therapeutic target, the class Ia ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). Resistance mutations in <italic>Ng</italic> map to the N-terminal cone domain of the α subunit, which we show here is involved in forming an inhibited α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> state in the presence of the β subunit and allosteric effector dATP. Enzyme assays confirm that PTC-847 and PTC-672 inhibit <italic>Ng</italic> RNR and reveal that allosteric effector dATP potentiates the inhibitory effect. Oral administration of PTC-672 reduces <italic>Ng</italic> infection in a mouse model and may have therapeutic potential for treatment of <italic>Ng</italic> that is resistant to current drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neisseria gonorrhoeae</kwd><kwd>gonorrhea</kwd><kwd>ribonucleotide reductase</kwd><kwd>multidrug resistance</kwd><kwd>2-pyridone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>097753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Branstrom</surname><given-names>Arthur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM126982</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drennan</surname><given-names>Catherine L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM007287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levitz</surname><given-names>Talya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017246757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levitz</surname><given-names>Talya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM29595</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stubbe</surname><given-names>JoAnne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drennan</surname><given-names>Catherine L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007229</institution-id><institution>Harvard University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Chang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM047274 in Nocera lab</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Chang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Novel small molecule inhibitors act against Neisseria including multi-drug resistant isolates by uniquely targeting RNR thereby enabling single pathogen therapy whilst sparing the microbiome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Increasing resistance to current therapeutics against many pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walsh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerasyuto et al., 2018</xref>) requires new treatment options with unique mechanism(s) of action. Recently, we reported the discovery of a series of fused indolyl-containing 4-hydroxy-2-pyridones that inhibited bacterial DNA synthesis by targeting mutant DNA topoisomerases (gyrase, topoisomerase IV) and improved in vitro antibacterial activity against a range of fluoroquinolone resistant Gram-negative strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerasyuto et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The interesting activities of a subset of 4-hydoxy-2-pyridones provided the impetus for synthesis of additional chemotypes with this core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and their evaluation for effectiveness against additional pathogenic strains including <italic>Ng</italic> and <italic>N. meningitidis (Nm</italic>). One of the global challenges of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">WHO, 2012</xref> focused on <italic>Ng</italic> isolates. They reported 78 million <italic>Ng</italic> infections worldwide with 90% of infections in low- and middle-income countries. In the US, during 2017–2018,, the rate of reported <italic>Ng</italic> infections increased 5% (583,405 US reported cases in 2018 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">CDC, 2019a</xref>), and the rate increased among both sexes, in all regions of the US, and among all ethnicity groups. <italic>Ng</italic> was reported to be the second most prevalent notifiable sexually transmitted infection in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">CDC, 2019a</xref>). The Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), established by the CDC in 1986, has and continues to monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities of <italic>Ng</italic> strains in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kirkcaldy et al., 2016</xref>). Based on reported resistance of <italic>Ng</italic> strains, the CDC currently prescribes a two antibiotic protocol using ceftriaxone (a β-lactam) and azithromycin (a macrolide). Increased reports of resistant isolates have prompted an appeal by the CDC to researchers in the public and private sectors to intensify efforts to develop effective new treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">CDC, 2019b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structures of PTC-847 and PTC-672 with 4-hydroxypyridone nucleus.</title><p>Three methylene units link the 4-hydroxy-2-pyridone core through the indole C-5 and C-4 position yielding two fused seven-membered ring regioisomers with restricted conformations, shown as compounds A and B.

However, isolation of the <italic>Ng</italic> gyrase and topoisomerase IV reported herein revealed little inhibition by these compounds, in contrast to the related analogs in this class we previously reported (PTC-565, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In an effort to identify the target(s) of PTC-847 and PTC-672, we thus decided to select resistant <italic>Ng</italic> organisms to these compounds and to sequence their entire genomes.</p><p>Sequencing of several resistant strains revealed single nucleotide changes and amino acid substitutions, all located within the N-terminus of the large subunit (α) of the <italic>Ng</italic> class Ia RNR. RNRs catalyze the de novo conversion of the nucleoside diphosphates adenosine (A), guanosine (G), cytidine (C), and uridine (U) (collectively NDPs) to deoxynucleoside diphosphates (dNDPs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). RNRs are essential in all organisms for DNA biosynthesis because of their role in controlling the relative ratios and amounts of dNTP pools.

They all share a common active site located in a structurally homologous protein (α, light and dark blue) and a common mechanism of NDP reduction. RNR classification is based on their essential and unique metallo-cofactors in β subunit, or one with DOPA radical, a non-metal cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greene et al., 2020</xref>) that initiate the complex radical chemistry in α subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eklund et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nordlund and Reichard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cotruvo and Stubbe, 2011</xref>). <italic>Ng</italic> possesses only one RNR, classified as a class Ia enzyme, that requires a diferric tyrosyl radical cofactor located in its subunit β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> [orange, red], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eklund et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2020</xref>). Class I RNRs use α and β, two structurally homologous subunits, that are thought to form an active α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The α subunit contains the catalytic site (C-site) and two allosteric effector sites, one involved in the regulation of substrate specificity (S-site) and the other in general enzymatic activity (A-site) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eriksson et al., 1997</xref>). The β subunit contains the metallo-cofactor required to initiate catalysis upon each NDP reduction event. What is most remarkable about the class Ia RNRs is that the metallo-cofactor in β must initiate complex reduction chemistry covering a 32 Å distance (Y<sub>122</sub> β to C<sub>439</sub> α) on each turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>).</p><p>Some of the Class Ia RNRs, including the human enzyme, can form α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> active structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and are known to be inhibited by dATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nordlund and Reichard, 2006</xref>). The inhibited states, however, are distinct for the <italic>Ec</italic> and human class Ia RNRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, respectively). The key to the structures of the inactive states is the <italic>N</italic>-terminal cone domain of subunit α (green, dotted circles in black).

Using mass photometry to evaluate oligomeric states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), we find an increase in the number of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> rings in the presence of PTC-672/GDP/TTP compared to GDP/TTP alone, but fewer rings than in the dATP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Recently, biochemical and cell-culture studies have revealed that clorfarabine (ClF), a nucleoside therapeutic used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemias, subsequent to its phosphorylation to a di- or trinucleotide (ClFDP, ClFTP) binds to the α subunit of human Ia RNR and potentiates formation of the α<sub>6</sub> inhibited state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aye and Stubbe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brignole et al., 2018</xref>).

Taken together, these results suggest that treatment with PTC-847, PTC-672 or related analogs exhibiting an acceptable safety profile may be more selective, better tolerated, and lessen the emergence of resistance compared with current therapies.</p><p>Resistance of life-threating bacterial infections to most types of antibiotics has been globally emerging over recent years due in part to overprescribing. One possible strategy is to restrict broad-spectrum antibiotic use to treatment of serious MDR infections and to develop novel single-pathogen agents for treating low prevalence infections. However, there is some concern that, given the low annual incidence of infections, single-pathogen agents might not yield a sufficient return on investment to support the development costs. A recent study examined the cost effectiveness of a novel, pathogen-specific agent targeting carbapenem-resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (CRAB) in comparison with the standard-of-care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spellberg and Rex, 2013</xref>). The analysis based on annual incidence of sensitive versus resistant infections, cost of treatments, and mortality of infections showed that a single-pathogen agent could provide benefit at a cost well below the traditional benchmarks used to define cost effective therapy.

Female ovariectomized Balb/c mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were obtained at 3 weeks of age and acclimatized for ~1 week prior to initiation of a fitness or efficacy study. Day 0 was defined as the day mice were inoculated vaginally with ~1 × 10<sup>9</sup> bacteria suspended in 20 µL saline. A single 17-β-estradiol pellet (0.5 mg, 21day release) was then implanted in mice with a trochar on Day –2. Mice were then treated with three antibiotics to control commensal flora induced by the estradiol. Vancomycin HCl (0.6 mg) and streptomycin sulfate (0.3 mg) were administered intraperitonealy and trimethoprim sulfate (0.8 mg) was administered by oral gavage twice daily from Day –2 to Day 1 of study. On Day 2 of the study the administration of all antibiotics except streptomycin sulfate was stopped.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide additional structural or biochemical evidence to support the conclusion that the inhibitor induces inhibited RNR tetramer formation and/or to identify the inhibitor binding site.</p><p>2) The claims about pathogen selectivity and evasion of drug resistance must also be revised or more appropriately justified by additional experimental data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific suggestions for improvement:</p><p>The introduction is very detailed and could be better tailored to a general audience.</p><p>In general, the microbiology findings and the biochemical/structural work could be more fully integrated. For example, is there a molecular-level explanation for why a mechanism of action involving potentiation of inhibited tetramers would be selective for the Ng pathogen – and nontoxic to humans?</p><p>It would also be nice to see a comparison to existing drugs or other drug candidates for MIC and resistance frequency values. Additionally, more explanation of methods for microbiology assays is needed. A reference is provided for a standard protocol, but I think it is important to state exactly how the experiments were performed (# replicates, error analysis, etc) to allow a reader to reproduce the experimental work.</p><p>The basis for concluding that resistance is less likely to occur with these inhibitors than with other drugs is not clear. In general, how can one draw this conclusion about drug resistance in humans based on work done in bacterial culture or in animal models?</p><p>The conclusion that commensal bacteria are not affected by the inhibitor is not sufficiently supported. It seems that only four selected anaerobic gut microbiome constituents were tested – and these likely have different RNRs than Ng. It would be ideal to look at vaginal microbiome organisms or other aerobic bacteria known to rely on class I RNR enzymes.</p><p>Finally, information about exactly how the drug interacts with Ng RNR is lacking. A structure of the enzyme bound to the inhibitor would both fill in missing gaps about how the drug works and enable expansion to other systems or elaboration to more effectively target Ng and minimize resistance.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67447.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide additional structural or biochemical evidence to support the conclusion that the inhibitor induces inhibited RNR tetramer formation and/or to identify the inhibitor binding site.</p></disp-quote><p>In this paper, we are putting forward the proposal that these compounds inhibit RNR through stabilization of the inactive tetrameric form of the enzyme. We agree that we do not have the data needed to draw a conclusion about the mechanism of inhibition at this time. We apologize if our phrasing suggested otherwise. We have rewritten the corresponding sections to make it clear what we know and what we do not know. We have also provided additional data that further probe the mechanism of action of these compounds. Importantly, we present data showing that the compounds work synergistically with dATP, enhancing the inhibitory effects of dATP. These new data support the proposal that the formation of the dATP-inhibited tetramer ring state is a part of the mechanism of inhibition. However, we also show new data that RNR variants that are unable to form the tetrameric ring state are still inhibited by these compounds. Collectively these data indicate that multiple mechanisms of inhibition may be play at least in vitro. Sorting out the details of these multiple mechanism will take further studies. For this paper, we have added new data figures S7-S9 and rewritten the results and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The claims about pathogen selectivity and evasion of drug resistance must also be revised or more appropriately justified by additional experimental data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included supplemental Table S5 highlighting a representative panel of commensal organisms that are not inhibited by the novel PTC analogs. Table S2 highlights the frequency of resistance for the compounds using <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> compared to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Examining the experiments for competitive infection, both the in vitro data (Figure 8) and the in vivo data (Figure 9) demonstrate that the <italic>Ng</italic> PTC-672<sup>H25R</sup> strains are less fit to compete with isolates having wildtype RNRs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific suggestions for improvement:</p><p>The introduction is very detailed and could be better tailored to a general audience.</p></disp-quote><p>The introduction has some minor edits to help with the understanding of the various complex topics covered in this manuscript. One of the challenges noted is that the paper covers several aspects of drug discovery, including chemical structure SAR, mechanism of action elucidation, biochemical analysis of the <italic>Ng</italic> RNR, antibacterial testing, and animal efficacy. This is a true multi-disciplinary effort and brings novel information to the scientific community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, the microbiology findings and the biochemical/structural work could be more fully integrated. For example, is there a molecular-level explanation for why a mechanism of action involving potentiation of inhibited tetramers would be selective for the Ng pathogen – and nontoxic to humans?</p></disp-quote><p>This question and statement are not quite accurate. The authors don’t claim that potentiation of the inactive tetrameric state of RNR is selective for <italic>Ng</italic> pathogens. It is possible that other bacterial class Ia RNRs could be inhibited through tetrameric state potentiation as well. However, many bacteria have multiple classes of RNRs such that they are not dependent on their class Ia RNR for survival. Neisseria has only one RNR, a class Ia enzyme, which could explain its sensitivity to these compounds. Antibacterial MICs data indicate that organisms with multiple RNRs have elevated MICs (Supplemental Tables S5 and S7). In terms of why these compounds do not potentiate formation of inactive tetramers in the case of human RNR.

Table S3 depicts the MIC values for a complete panel of antibiotics against the wild-type and PTC-847<sup>R</sup> isolates. No cross-resistance was observed with any of the antibiotics tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, more explanation of methods for microbiology assays is needed. A reference is provided for a standard protocol, but I think it is important to state exactly how the experiments were performed (# replicates, error analysis, etc) to allow a reader to reproduce the experimental work.</p></disp-quote><p>Details have been added to more thoroughly indicate how the microbiology assays were performed. We believe those outside the field of study should now be able to perform the assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The basis for concluding that resistance is less likely to occur with these inhibitors than with other drugs is not clear. In general, how can one draw this conclusion about drug resistance in humans based on work done in bacterial culture or in animal models?</p></disp-quote><p>Historically, frequency of resistance and bactericidal determinations are good predictors for drug success in humans. Clinical trials are the only definitive way to validate success. However, antibacterial drug discovery is one of the few fields where the antibacterial activity in animal models directly correlates with human data (along with corresponding DMPK data). Our preclinical data suggest that an isolate that becomes resistant to the PTC analogs has less probability to become multi-drug resistant because those variants are at a competitive disadvantage relative to organisms lacking the RNR mutation. In drug development, it is known that any antibiotic that makes it into the clinic will have organisms that become resistant. The question is not “if”, but “when” resistance will occur. The frequency of resistance numbers are favorable, as are the data for fitness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusion that commensal bacteria are not affected by the inhibitor is not sufficiently supported. It seems that only four selected anaerobic gut microbiome constituents were tested – and these likely have different RNRs than Ng. It would be ideal to look at vaginal microbiome organisms or other aerobic bacteria known to rely on class I RNR enzymes.</p></disp-quote><p>Data have been included in Table S5 showing the MICs against commensals compared to solithromycin. In this table, you will note that ALL the isolates were inhibited by solithromycin, and NONE were inhibited by PTC-672 except the <italic>Neisseria</italic> species. Table S7 indicates the known RNRs in various bacteria listed by genus. These data are only correlative suggesting drug sensitivity is associated with the presence of only RNR Ia. Further experimentation will be necessary to elucidate the exact resistance mechanism in other species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, information about exactly how the drug interacts with Ng RNR is lacking. A structure of the enzyme bound to the inhibitor would both fill in missing gaps about how the drug works and enable expansion to other systems or elaboration to more effectively target Ng and minimize resistance.</p></disp-quote><p>Structural studies are in progress. They are nontrivial and will be the subject of a future manuscript if we are successful.</p></body></sub-article></article>
