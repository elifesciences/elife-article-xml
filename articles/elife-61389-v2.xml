It is now clear, however, that p53 regulates a growing list of other biological processes, including metabolism, stem cell division, immunity, and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levine, 2019</xref>). Vertebrate genomes encode two other p53 paralogs, p63 and p73, which also have diverse functions in stress response and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jost et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dötsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Candi et al., 2014</xref>). Adding to this complexity, each of these three p53 paralogs encode a large number of isoforms which can form homo- or hetero-complexes, both within and among gene paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fujita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoubala et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joruiz and Bourdon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anbarasan and Bourdon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujita, 2019</xref>). However, the function of only a small subset of these isoform complexes have been defined. In this study, we use the <italic>p53</italic> gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a simplified genetic system to examine the function of p53 isoforms and find that they have critical overlapping and distinct functions during oogenesis.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome has a single p53 family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ingaramo et al., 2018</xref>). Similar to human p53 (TP53), it has a C terminal oligomerization domain (OD), a central DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an N terminal transcriptional activation domain (TAD), and functions as a tetrameric transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ollmann et al., 2000</xref>). This single <italic>p53</italic> gene expresses four mRNAs that encode three different protein isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ingaramo et al., 2018</xref>). A 44 kD p53A protein isoform was the first to be identified and is the most well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jin et al., 2000</xref>). Later RNA-Seq and other approaches revealed that alternative promoter usage and RNA splicing results in a 56 kD p53B protein isoform, which differs from p53A by a 110 amino acid longer N-terminal TAD that is encoded by a unique p53B 5’ exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ingaramo et al., 2018</xref>). Because the p53A isoform differs from p53B by a shorter N terminus, p53A is also known as ΔNp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dichtel-Danjoy et al., 2013</xref>). A p53C transcript starts at a different promoter than p53A but is predicted to encode the same 44 kD protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A short p53E mRNA isoform is predicted to encode a protein of 38 kD that contains the DNA-binding domain but lacks the longer N-terminal TADs of p53A and p53B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The p53B protein isoform is expressed in the germline where it colocalizes with p53A in nuclear bodies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53 mRNA and protein isoforms.

To promote apoptosis, p53 induces transcription of several proapoptotic genes at one locus called H99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sogame et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou, 2019</xref>). Early analyses of p53 function in apoptosis focused on the p53A isoform because the others had yet to be discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ollmann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sogame et al., 2003</xref>). Using BAC rescue transgenes that were mutant for either p53A or p53B, we previously showed that in larval tissues it is the shorter p53A, and not p53B, that is both necessary and sufficient for the apoptotic response to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, when each isoform was overexpressed, p53B was much more potent than p53A at inducing proapoptotic gene transcription and the programmed cell death response, likely because of the longer p53B TAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dichtel-Danjoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Other evidence suggests that p53B may regulate tissue regeneration and has a redundant function with p53A to regulate autophagy in response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dichtel-Danjoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Robin et al., 2019</xref>). It is largely unknown, however, why the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes a separate p53B isoform and what its array of functions are.</p><p>The p53 gene family is ancient with orthologs found in the genomes of multiple eukaryotes, including single-celled Choanozoans, which are thought to be the ancestors of multicellular animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rutkowski et al., 2010</xref>). Evidence suggests that the ancestral function of the p53 gene family was in the germline, with later evolution of tumor suppressor functions in the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gebel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levine, 2020</xref>). In mammals, p63 mediates a meiotic pachytene checkpoint arrest in response to DNA damage or chromosome defects, and also induces apoptosis of a large number of oocytes with persistent defects, thereby enforcing an oocyte quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Giacomo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Suh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gebel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rinaldi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rinaldi et al., 2020</xref>). It has been shown that in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline p53 regulates stem cell divisions, responds to programmed meiotic DNA breaks, and represses mobile elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wylie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wylie et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we have uncovered that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53A and p53B isoforms have overlapping and distinct functions during oogenesis to protect genome integrity and mediate the meiotic pachytene checkpoint arrest, with parallels to the germline function of mammalian p53 family members in oocyte quality control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The p53B isoform is more highly expressed in the germline</title><p>Our previous results indicated that p53B does not mediate the apoptotic response to radiation in larval imaginal discs and brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). One explanation for this lack of function was that p53B protein is expressed at very low levels in those somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Given the ancestral germline function of the p53 gene family, we considered the possibility that p53B may be expressed and function in the germline. To address this question, we evaluated p53 isoform expression and function in the ovary. During <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis, egg chambers migrate down a structure called the ovariole as they mature through 14 morphological stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">King, 1970</xref>). Each egg chamber is composed of an oocyte and 15 sister germline nurse cells, all interconnected by intercellular bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Spradling, 1993</xref>). The nurse cells become highly polyploid through repeated G / S endocycles during stages 1–10 of oogenesis, which facilitates their biosynthesis of large amounts of maternal RNA and protein that are deposited into the oocyte. The germline cells are surrounded by an epithelial sheet of somatic follicle cells that divide mitotically up until stage 6, and then undergo three endocycles from stages 7 to 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calvi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jia et al., 2015</xref>). Both germline and somatic follicle cell progenitors are continuously produced by germline and somatic stem cells that reside in a structure at the tip of the ovariole known as the germarium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">King, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drummond-Barbosa, 2019</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate p53A and p53B expression during oogenesis, we used fly strains transformed with different p53 genomic BAC transgenes in which the p53 isoforms are tagged on their unique N-termini. In one strain, GFP is fused to p53A (GFP-p53A), while in another strain mCherry is fused to p53B (mCh-p53B), with each expressed under control of their normal regulatory regions in these genomic BACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). To enhance detection, we immunolabeled these strains with antibodies that recognize GFP and mCherry. Immunofluorescent analysis of the somatic follicle cells revealed that GFP-p53A localized to nuclear bodies, ranging in size from ~0.25 to 1 μm, often in close proximity to the DAPI bright pericentric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–C’</xref>). The expression of mCh-p53B, however, was only rarely detected in somatic follicle cells ( &lt; 1 / 50,000 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–D’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, similar to our previous results in larval tissues, p53A is expressed at much higher levels than p53B in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, both GFP-p53A and mCh-p53B bodies were detected in all germline cells. Early stage nurse cells had one to a few p53 bodies, whereas later stage nurse cells had more bodies that were regionally distributed in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–D’</xref>). This dynamic pattern suggests that p53 bodies, like some other nuclear bodies, may associate with the polytene chromatin fibers that become dispersed in these nurse cells after stage 4 of oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dej and Spradling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">White et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). The oocyte nucleus also had both GFP-p53A and mCh-p53B nuclear bodies, often appearing as one large (~1 μm) and several smaller (~0.25 μm) bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D’</xref>). In addition to distinct nuclear bodies, there were low levels of GFP-p53A and mCh-p53B dispersed throughout the nuclei of nurse cells and the oocyte.</p><p>We examined females with both GFP-p53A and mCh-p53B to address if they colocalize to the same nuclear bodies. In some cells, co-expression of GFP-p53A reduced the expression of mCh-p53B, perhaps a manifestation of a protein trans-degradation effect that we had described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, the results indicated that GFP-p53A and mCh-p53B colocalize to the same subnuclear bodies of both nurse cells and oocytes, although the ratio of these two isoforms differed somewhat among bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>). mCh-p53B also co-localized with GFP-p53A in those rare follicle cells that expressed mCh-p53B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). Examination of the testis indicated that GFP-p53A and mCh-p53B are also expressed and localized to nuclear bodies in the male germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-B'</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mauri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Monk et al., 2012</xref>). Altogether, these results indicated that while the p53A isoform is expressed in both somatic and germline cells, the p53B isoform is primarily expressed in the germline.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>p53A is necessary and sufficient for the apoptotic response to ionizing radiation in somatic follicle cells</title><p>We next asked which of the p53 isoforms mediate the apoptotic response to DNA damage in the ovary. We had previously addressed this question in larval imaginal discs and brains using mutant BAC rescue transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). For this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create isoform-specific mutants at the endogenous <italic>p53</italic> locus.

A possible caveat, however, is that both the <italic>p53<sup>A2.3</sup></italic> and <italic>p53<sup>B41.5</sup></italic> alleles also delete part of a non-coding RNA of unknown function (CR46089), which overlaps the 5’ end of <italic>p53</italic> and is transcribed in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thurmond et al., 2019</xref>).

We found that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53B protein isoform is more highly expressed in the germline where it colocalizes with a shorter p53A isoform in subnuclear bodies. Despite this p53B germline expression, it is the p53A isoform that was necessary and sufficient for the apoptotic response to IR in both the germline and soma. Although apoptosis is repressed in meiotic oocytes and endocycling nurse cells, we found that both p53 isoforms are required in these cells for the timely repair of meiotic DNA breaks. The role of the p53 isoforms in DNA repair was cell type specific, with p53B playing the most prominent role in the nurse cells, whereas both p53B and p53A were required in the oocyte. Our data has also uncovered a requirement for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53A isoform in the meiotic pachytene checkpoint response to unrepaired DNA breaks. Overall, these data suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53 isoforms have evolved overlapping and distinct functions to mediate different responses to different types of DNA damage in different cell types. These findings are relevant to understanding the evolution of p53 isoforms, and have revealed interesting parallels to the function of mammalian p53 family members in oocyte quality control.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>p53 localizes to subnuclear bodies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans</title><p>p53 isoforms colocalized to subnuclear bodies in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male and female germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This finding is consistent with a previous study that reported p53 bodies in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline, although that study did not examine individual isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Monk et al., 2012</xref>).

Evidence suggests that trafficking of human p53 protein through PML bodies mediates p53 post-translational modification and function, although the relationship between nuclear trafficking and the functions of different p53 isoforms has not been fully evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fogal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, we observed a decline in abundance of p53B within p53 bodies in germarium region 2a, followed by a restoration of p53B within bodies in region 3. This fluctuation of p53B in bodies temporally correlates with the onset of meiotic DNA breaks in region 2a and their repair in regions 2b - 3. These observations are consistent with the idea that nuclear trafficking of p53B out of bodies may mediate its response to meiotic breaks, although it is also possible that p53B is degraded and rapidly resynthesized during this 24 hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Future analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53 bodies will help to define how p53 isoform trafficking mediates the response to genotoxic and other stresses.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model: <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53 isoforms colocalize to nuclear bodies and have DNA lesion and cell type specific functions in the germline genotoxic stress response.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The p53A (green) and p53B (red) isoforms are concentrated in p53 bodies of germline nuclei (blue).

It is interesting to note that while germline cystocytes in germarium region one apoptosed after IR, their ancestor GSCs and descendent meiotic cells did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

How meiotic cells repress apoptosis is not known, although it is crucial that they do so because they have programmed DNA breaks.

The results for the <italic>p53<sup>A2.3</sup></italic> (A-B+) mutant were not informative, however, because in that mutant <italic>hid-GFP</italic> expression was constitutively higher than wild type beginning in early region 1 of the germarium. We did not observe γ-H2Av labeling before late region 1/ region 2 a indicating that this low-level activity of p53B is not a response to DNA breaks. While further experiments are required to define the mechanism, a cogent hypothesis is that in the absence of the p53A subunit p53B homotetramers have somewhat higher basal activity. This hypothesis is consistent with our previous evidence that the p53B isoform with a longer transactivation domain is a much stronger transcription factor than p53A, and that p53A and p53B can form heterocomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).

It is important to note, however, that while <italic>hid</italic> expression was higher in the p53A mutants than in wild type, it was not associated with apoptosis. Overall, while the <italic>hid-GFP</italic> reporter evidence suggests that p53A responds to meiotic DNA breaks, it is unclear whether this low-level activation of p53A transcription factor activity is related to its role in meiotic DNA break repair or checkpoint activation, which we discuss further below.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>p53 isoforms have overlapping and distinct requirements to prevent germline DNA damage</title><p>Our evidence suggests that both p53 isoforms are required for the timely repair of meiotic DNA breaks in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> female germline. <italic>p53</italic> null and isoform-specific mutants had a persistent germline DNA break phenotype that was dependent on the creation of double-strand DNA breaks by Mei-W68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Further consistent with a role in meiotic DNA break repair, <italic>p53</italic> mutants had an increased number of cells with γ-H2Av foci beginning in germarium stage 2a, the time when Mei-W68 induces programmed meiotic DNA breaks.

Both p53A and p53B were required in the oocyte, whereas p53B played the more prominent role in nurse cells, even though nurse cells express both p53A and p53B isoforms. This differential requirement for p53 isoforms may reflect differences in how meiotic breaks are repaired in nurse cells versus oocytes. While it is not known whether DNA repair pathways differ between nurse cells and oocytes, evidence suggests that the creation of meiotic breaks does, with breaks in pro-oocytes but not pro-nurse cells depending on previous SC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</xref>). Important questions motivated by our results are how distinct responses to DNA damage in different cells are determined by different types of DNA lesions, checkpoint signaling and repair pathways, and p53 isoform structure.</p><p>The consequences of <italic>p53</italic> null and isoform-specific alleles for oogenesis were also similar to <italic>okr</italic>a mutants in that they caused reduced female fertility and defects in eggshell patterning and synthesis.

Thus, although the p53 and okra null mutants had similar levels of germline DNA damage, the severity of their maternal-effect on egg patterning and embryo viability differ, suggesting that some of their pleiotropic effects on oogenesis are distinct.

Primary antibodies, sources, and concentrations used were rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen) 1:500, rabbit anti-dsRed (Clontech) 1:200, mouse anti dsRed (Clontech) 1:200, mouse anti Hts1B1 (DSHB) 1:20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zaccai and Lipshitz, 1996</xref>), mouse anti-γH2Av (DSHB) 1:1,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lake et al., 2013</xref>), and mouse anti-Orb 4H8 isotype IgG1 (DHSB) 1:500.

For strains expressing both GFP-p53A and mCh-p53B, the ratio of GFP-p53A: mCh-p53B was quantified within each body. For those expressing a single tagged isoform, the ratios of intensities in germarium regions 1:2 or 2:3 among different bodies was calculated, all within the same germarium to control for technical variation. For all experiments, germline cells were identified by labeling with either anti-Hts, anti-Vasa, or anti-Orb.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: R Scott Hawley (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have generated new and useful p53 reagents, which they have employed in four functional assays – apoptosis (TUNEL after 40 Gy irradiation (Figure 2-3)), transcriptional induction (monitored by hid-GFP (Figure 4-5)), double stranded DNA breaks (DSB) (monitored by gammaH2AV (Figure 7-8)) and activation of pachytene checkpoint (monitored by synaptonemal complex protein C(3)G (Figure 8F-K)).</p><p>The main findings are:</p><p>(1) the apoptotic response to ionizing radiation (IR) depends on p53A</p><p>(2) expression of hid-GFP in region 2a-2b germ cells requires p53B</p><p>(3) DSBs occur at higher rates in both the p53A and the p53B mutants</p><p>(4) p53B can repair of meiotic breaks in nurse cells but in not oocytes</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Despite the generation of high-quality, new reagents, this paper is currently fairly descriptive. Of 8 figures, two show the expression pattern of the tagged p53 isoforms in various parts of the germarium (Figures1 and 6). Some of the observations based on functional assays remain unexplained and need further experiments, including points 1 and 2 below.</p><p>1) The authors conclude that the p53 isoforms respond to meiotic DNA breaks, but there are no experiments which lead to this conclusion. If the authors want to conclude this, they need (a) to analyze hid-GFP expression a mei-W68 mutant and (b) stain the germarium with both HID and gammaH2AV. The authors should also examine meiotic breaks in p53A+B+, p53A-B-, p53A-B+ and p53A+B- in a background that is also mei-W68 mutant.</p><p>2) The authors are missing a more detailed analysis of the interesting observation that hid-GFP is stronger in region 1 of p53A-B+ than in the wild type p53A+B+. This observation cannot be explained by meiotic DSBs (which occurs in region 2), but the authors do not provide a mechanism. Is this due to transposable elements? The authors need to supply new data to provide a mechanistic understanding of this observation.</p><p>3) The authors are encouraged to provide better data to support the conclusion that the DNA damage phenotypes of p53 and okra mutants are comparable. The images in Figures 7, 8B and B' are not sufficient to assess this. The authors could quantify the number of gammaH2AV foci or intensity (rather than measure the number of positive cells). Related to this, it is surprising that p53 mutants lack the DV defects seen in okra mutants, particular since defects in DSB repair should cause nondisjunction. Okra mutants are sterile. The authors should comment upon the fertility of p53 mutants.</p><p>4) Some experiments have only 2 biological replicates (Figures 4 and 8K). Figures 7 and 8 have &quot;2-3 replicates&quot;. The authors need to state specifically for each experiment how many replicates were scored. Ideally, they should have at least 3 replicates for each experiment or explain why that is not necessary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Chakravarti et al. build on the previous work from the Calvi lab characterizing specific roles for the p53A isoform. In their 2015 paper Zhang et al. showed, using isoform specific loss of function mutants, that p53A is primarily responsible for mediating the apoptotic response to ionizing radiation in the soma and that p53B is very lowly expressed in the cell types studied. They speculated that p53B might function in germline specific roles, such as meiotic checkpoints and DNA repair, identified in mammalian p53 studies.</p><p>Here Chakravarti et al., have further characterized the functions of the p53A and B isoforms in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In the ovary, p53A mediates the apoptotic response to IR and is also required for meiotic checkpoint activation. p53B is both necessary and sufficient for repair of meiotic breaks in nurse cells but not oocytes. p53B is required for expression of a hid-GFP reporter in region 2a-2b cells which may be related to a loss of p53B detection in p53A/B nuclear bodies at that stage.</p><p>There are no substantive concerns with this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes multiple p53 isoforms. P53 is an important factor in maintaining genome integrity and having multiple isoforms in flies raises an interesting evolutionary concept because humans have a gene family of p53 members. In this paper, the expression and function of the isoforms is compared in the germ line. There are two significant findings based on investigating these two isoforms. First, the apoptotic response depends on the A form, and both have roles in the response to meiotic DSBs. These results represent a significant and important extensions of previous work from another group that showed p53 suppresses transposon activity.</p><p>With one important exception, the data are solid and support the conclusions. The data regarding the apoptotic response is based on TUNEL and a hid-GFP reporter. This data shows that irradiation induces a response in the mitotic region but not later regions. Conversely, there is a milder induction in the meiotic region (region 2a). Both could be in response to DSBs. But it is amazing that there is no HID induction following IR in these meiotic regions. Thus, there is a satisfying correlation between the apoptosis and HID responses to IR, and both are diminished in the meiotic region.</p><p>The most significant concern with this paper is that conclusions that the p53 isoforms respond to meiotic DNA breaks. Indeed, this is the title of the section starting at the end of pg 7, but there are no experiments which lead to this conclusion. Similarly, the sentence &quot;To determine whether p53A or p53B isoforms responds to meiotic DNA breaks&quot; (pg 8), is followed by an experiment which does not do that (it compares HID expression in different p53 genotypes). The data in the paper are correlations between p53 expression and where DSBs occur in the germarium. Two experiments are needed. First, and most important, hid-GFP expression needs to be analyzed in a mei-W68 mutant. In addition, the germarium should be stained for both HID and gH2AV, the latter being the antibody the authors use in later Figures. It would also be satisfying to see the genotypes in Figure 7 performed in a mei-W68 mutant background, to determine if the persistent DNA damage in the p53 mutants depends on meiotic breaks.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Chakravarti and colleagues analyzed the functions of several p53 isoforms in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline. They created novel isoform-specific alleles by CRISPR/Cas9 to untangle the functions of p53A and p53B isoforms. They made use of a Phid-GFP reporter line to follow p53 transcriptional activity. The role of p53 in the development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline has been published several times before with a focus on the silencing of retro-transposons (TEs) and meiotic DNA breaks response (Lu, 2010; Wylie, 2014; Wylie, 2016). Despite this published literature, the authors created novel and very valuable tools, which allowed them to make several novel and interesting observations. My main criticism is that most of these observations remain unexplained and the manuscript feels descriptive as it stands. However, this manuscript has great potential if it could follow up some of these novel observations.</p><p>Some examples are the following:</p><p>1) On Figure 5C, the authors made the interesting observation that hid-GFP was stronger in region 1 of p53A-B+ than in the wild type p53A+B+. This activity of p53 cannot be explained by meiotic DSBs as previously published, since meiotic DSBs only occur later in region 2.

Progress was slowed by a large number of challenges during this last trying year. These challenges included departure of the first author from the lab and U.S., and medical challenges of the other lab member who picked up the project. In addition, we lost and had to rebuild a number of the compound genotype strains that were required for the experiments. Since the initial submission, I have worked closely with lab members on this project and personally conducted a number of the experiments myself. During the course of these experiments, we realized that we had inadvertently used data for the mutant p53Bac rescue instead of the stated p53B CRISPR allele for the hid-GFP reporter experiments. We apologize for that mistake. Upon rebuilding those strains and repeating the experiment multiple times, we have found that the hid-GFP expression is not reduced 50% in the p53B mutant without IR; and thus, there is currently no evidence for activation of p53B transcription factor activity by meiotic breaks. We have, therefore, de-emphasized those experiments in the current version of the manuscript. The data, now shown in a new Figure 4, do continue to support that p53A is necessary and sufficient for activation of proapoptotic gene expression in response to IR, and is also activated to a lesser extent by meiotic breaks. As we more fully explain in the manuscript and below, that hid-GFP data is fairly tangential to our main findings. That is, it is unclear whether the low-level activation of p53A transcription factor activity by meiotic breaks is related to its role in DNA repair. Therefore, our major novel findings and conclusions remain the same: (1) p53B expression is biased to the germline, (2) p53A is required for the germline apoptotic response to IR, (3) both p53A and p53B are required for the timely repair of meiotic DNA breaks, and (4) p53A is required for the meiotic pachytene checkpoint. We have added new important data that support and extend these conclusions (see below). We believe that our new findings, represented in seven new supplementary figures, increase the rigor and scope of our study.</p><p>Before a point-by-point response to previous reviews, I thought it would be helpful to summarize the major changes to the manuscript.</p><p>(1) We removed the previous Figure 5 that had higher laser power images of hid-GFP expression in the absence of IR. As discussed above, the hid-GFP results are now consolidated into Figure 4. We have also edited the manuscript to reflect the new result with p53A+B- hid-GFP that indicates that the expression in region 2a is not reduced by 50%.</p><p>(2) New Figure 4—figure supplement 1 shows results for <italic>mei-W68; hid-GFP</italic> that indicate that the <italic>hid-GFP</italic> reporter expression in region 2 is dependent on meiotic breaks.</p><p>(3) New Figure 6—figure supplement 1 shows images and quantification of the frequency of g-H2Av labeling in stage 1 nurse cells and oocytes, the latter now marked with anti-Orb. These experiments also led to the new finding that one of the pro-oocytes that becomes a nurse cell often has more DNA damage than other nurse cells, consistent with a failure to repair meiotic breaks (Figure 6—figure supplement 1H).</p><p>(4) New Figure 6—figure supplement 2 shows new data that quantifies g-H2Av intensity in stage 1 nurse cells and oocytes from p53 and okra single and double mutants, which is consistent with our previous data for frequency of labeling in different stages of oogenesis.</p><p>(5) New Figure 6—figure supplement 3 shows that the persistent DNA damage in the p53 mutants is dependent on creation of meiotic DNA breaks by Mei-W68, and, therefore, that the persistent DNA damage in p53 mutants is the result of a failure to repair meiotic DNA breaks.</p><p>(6) New Figure 7—figure supplement 1 shows images of eggs and our new finding that p53 mutants have ventralized and defective eggshells, similar to <italic>okra</italic>.</p><p>(7) New Figure 7—figure supplement 2 is a graph that quantifies eggshell defects from <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>okra</italic> single and double mutant mothers. The p53 null and isoform-specific mutant mothers produce eggs with different mutant severities, which are enhanced to different extents in the <italic>okra; p53</italic> double mutants.</p><p>(8) New Figure 7—figure supplement 3 quantifies hatch rates of eggs from <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>okr</italic> single and double mutant mothers. All <italic>p53</italic> alleles have a maternal-effect that significantly reduces egg hatch rate relative to wild type. The okra single and all <italic>okra; p53</italic> double combinations have a hatch rate of zero, consistent with Trudi Schupbach’s previous finding that <italic>okra</italic> null mothers are completely sterile.</p><p>(9) In response to reviewer’s requests, figures now have added panels that show fluorescent channels without DAPI.</p><p>(10) Because old Figures 4, 5 are now consolidated into a new Figure 4, the old Figures 6-9 are now Figures 5-8.</p><p>Changes to figures and text are described further below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Despite the generation of high-quality, new reagents, this paper is currently fairly descriptive. Of 8 figures, two show the expression pattern of the tagged p53 isoforms in various parts of the germarium (Figures1 and 6). Some of the observations based on functional assays remain unexplained and need further experiments, including points 1 and 2 below.</p><p>(1) The authors conclude that the p53 isoforms respond to meiotic DNA breaks, but there are no experiments which lead to this conclusion. If the authors want to conclude this, they need (a) to analyze hid-GFP expression a mei-W68 mutant and (b) stain the germarium with both HID and gammaH2AV. The authors should also examine meiotic breaks in p53A+B+, p53A-B-, p53A-B+ and p53A+B- in a background that is also mei-W68 mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted both of these suggested experiments.</p><p>(a) Figure 4—figure supplement 1 shows that the low level hid-GFP expression we see in region 2 of the germarium is abolished in a <italic>mei-W68</italic> (Spo11) mutant, and, therefore, that hid-GFP is indeed a reporter for meiotic DNA breaks.</p><p>(b) Figure 6—figure supplement 3 shows that the persistent g-H2Av repair foci that we observe in <italic>p53</italic> mutants is abolished in <italic>mei-W68; p53</italic> double mutants. We agree that this is an important result because it strongly supports the model that <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53 isoforms are required for the timely repair of programmed meiotic DNA breaks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors are missing a more detailed analysis of the interesting observation that hid-GFP is stronger in region 1 of p53A-B+ than in the wild type p53A+B+. This observation cannot be explained by meiotic DSBs (which occurs in region 2), but the authors do not provide a mechanism. Is this due to transposable elements? The authors need to supply new data to provide a mechanistic understanding of this observation.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed whether higher transposon and resultant DNA breaks could be the reason that the p53A mutant has higher <italic>hid-GFP</italic> in region 1 of the germarium. However, we did not observe an increase in g-H2Av labeling in stem cells, cystoblasts and region 1 cyst cells. This result is inconsistent with the transposon model. In contrast, the increased <italic>hid-GFP</italic> expression in the <italic>p53A</italic> mutant is consistent with our previous observations that p53A and p53B protein isoforms can form heterotetramers, and that p53B isoform is a stronger transcription factor (Zhang et al. 2015). Together with similar evidence from humans, this leads us to suggest that p53B homotetramers in the p53A isoform mutant induce a higher basal activity of the hid-GFP reporter. It should be stressed, however, that although the hid-GFP expression without IR in the p53A isoform mutant is higher than in p53 wild type, it is much lower than that seen after IR of wild type (see Figure 4), and is not associated with cell death. Although the elevated <italic>hid-GFP</italic> in p53A mutants is an intriguing observation, we believe that not knowing its precise mechanism does not alter the major conclusions of the present study - (1) That p53A is necessary and sufficient for apoptosis and (2) That p53A and p53B are required for repair of meiotic breaks and (3) That p53A is required participates in the pachytene checkpoint.</p><p>We have edited the results and discussion in an effort to clarify these points and acknowledge that we have not provided evidence for the mechanism of the elevated hid-GFP in the p53A mutants. (pg 7, para 2; pg 12, para 1 and 2)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors are encouraged to provide better data to support the conclusion that the DNA damage phenotypes of p53 and okra mutants are comparable. The images in Figures 7, 8B and B' are not sufficient to assess this. The authors could quantify the number of gammaH2AV foci or intensity (rather than measure the number of positive cells).</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the g-H2Av labeling multiple times for all the genotypes and have now quantified total g-H2Av intensity per nucleus in oocytes and nurse cells (Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 2). This new quantification is consistent with the previous phenotypic characterization that showed that <italic>p53</italic> null cells have persistent DNA damage that is comparable to <italic>okr</italic> mutants. It also bolsters our original observations that the p53A-B+ strain has less damage in nurse cells than other mutant genotypes. Thus, we have now quantified both the timing and level of DNA damage in different cell types during oogenesis, both of which support our initial conclusions that p53 isoforms have overlapping and distinct functions for timely repair of meiotic DNA breaks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, it is surprising that p53 mutants lack the DV defects seen in okra mutants, particular since defects in DSB repair should cause nondisjunction. Okra mutants are sterile. The authors should comment upon the fertility of p53 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for prompting us to explore these questions. Figure 7—figure supplements 1-3 are images and quantification of our new analysis of eggshell morphology and fertility in the <italic>okr</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> single and double mutants. The results indicate that <italic>p53</italic> null and isoform-specific alleles all have reduced female fertility and eggshell dorsal-ventral patterning and synthesis defects. Moreover, the eggshell phenotypes are enhanced in <italic>okr; p53*</italic> double mutants. The enhanced eggshell phenotype is consistent with the enhanced DNA damage seen in the <italic>okr; p53*</italic> double mutants. Altogether, we have now significantly advanced our analysis of the biological impact of DNA repair defects on egg morphology and female fertility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some experiments have only 2 biological replicates (Figures 4 and 8K). Figures 7 and 8 have &quot;2-3 replicates&quot;. The authors need to state specifically for each experiment how many replicates were scored. Ideally, they should have at least 3 replicates for each experiment or explain why that is not necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion. We have now more clearly indicated the number of replicates for each experiment in the figure legends. Supplementary file 1 has p values for frequency of g-H2Av labeling for oocytes and nurse cells in different stages of oogenesis. We have also now quantified and statistically analyzed g-H2Av intensity in oocyte and nurse cells in stage 1, the results of which are consistent with our previous results and interpretation (new Figures 6—figure supplements 1 and 2, Supplementary file 2 for p values).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes multiple p53 isoforms. P53 is an important factor in maintaining genome integrity and having multiple isoforms in flies raises an interesting evolutionary concept because humans have a gene family of p53 members. In this paper, the expression and function of the isoforms is compared in the germ line. There are two significant findings based on investigating these two isoforms. First, the apoptotic response depends on the A form, and both have roles in the response to meiotic DSBs. These results represent a significant and important extensions of previous work from another group that showed p53 suppresses transposon activity.</p><p>With one important exception, the data are solid and support the conclusions. The data regarding the apoptotic response is based on TUNEL and a hid-GFP reporter. This data shows that irradiation induces a response in the mitotic region but not later regions. Conversely, there is a milder induction in the meiotic region (region 2a). Both could be in response to DSBs. But it is amazing that there is no HID induction following IR in these meiotic regions. Thus, there is a satisfying correlation between the apoptosis and HID responses to IR, and both are diminished in the meiotic region.</p><p>The most significant concern with this paper is that conclusions that the p53 isoforms respond to meiotic DNA breaks. Indeed, this is the title of the section starting at the end of pg 7, but there are no experiments which lead to this conclusion. Similarly, the sentence &quot;To determine whether p53A or p53B isoforms responds to meiotic DNA breaks&quot; (pg 8), is followed by an experiment which does not do that (it compares HID expression in different p53 genotypes). The data in the paper are correlations between p53 expression and where DSBs occur in the germarium. Two experiments are needed. First, and most important, hid-GFP expression needs to be analyzed in a mei-W68 mutant. In addition, the germarium should be stained for both HID and gH2AV, the latter being the antibody the authors use in later Figures. It would also be satisfying to see the genotypes in Figure 7 performed in a mei-W68 mutant background, to determine if the persistent DNA damage in the p53 mutants depends on meiotic breaks.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted both of the suggested experiments. Analysis of <italic>hid-GFP</italic> expression in a <italic>mei-W68</italic> mutant background indicates that it responds to meiotic breaks (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). The persistent DNA breaks that we observed in the <italic>p53</italic> mutant were eliminated in a <italic>mei-W68; p53</italic> double mutant background (Figure 6—figure supplement 3), which supports the model that p53 is required for the timely repair of meiotic DNA breaks (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Chakravarti and colleagues analyzed the functions of several p53 isoforms in the Drosophila germline.

With a close inspection of the wild type panels of Figure 6 and 7, you can see these small foci of heterochromatic g-H2AV labeling in wild type. In contrast to wild type, however, the p53 mutants have many more g-H2Av foci that are spread throughout the nucleus. These pan-nuclear repair foci are not seen in <italic>mei-W68; p53</italic> double mutants supporting that they are unrepaired meiotic breaks and not collapsed replication forks in difficult to replicate regions.
