A few hours after a high-fat diet (HFD), hypothalamic microglia shift to an inflammatory phenotype, and prolonged fat consumption leads to the recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to the hypothalamus. However, the transcriptional signatures and functions of these cells remain unclear. Using dual-reporter mice, this study reveals that CX3CR1-positive microglia exhibit minimal changes in response to a HFD, while significant transcriptional differences emerge between microglia and CCR2-positive recruited myeloid cells, particularly affecting chemotaxis. These recruited cells also show sex-specific transcriptional differences impacting neurodegeneration and thermogenesis. The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is emphasized for its role in chemotaxis, displaying notable differences between recruited cells and resident microglia, requiring further investigation. Central immunoneutralization of CXCL10, a ligand for CXCR3, resulted in increased body mass and decreased energy expenditure, especially in females. Systemic chemical inhibition of CXCR3 led to significant metabolic changes, including increased body mass, reduced energy expenditure, elevated blood leptin, glucose intolerance, and decreased insulin levels. This study elucidates the transcriptional differences between hypothalamic microglia and CCR2-positive recruited myeloid cells in diet-induced inflammation and identifies CXCR3-expressing recruited immune cells as protective in metabolic outcomes linked to HFD consumption, establishing a new concept in obesity-related hypothalamic inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>fatty acids</kwd><kwd>glucose</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013 07607-8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Velloso</surname><given-names>Licio A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017/22511-8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mendes</surname><given-names>Natalia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021/00443-6</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mendes</surname><given-names>Natalia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A subset of myeloid cells expressing CXCR3 is recruited to the hypothalamus and protects against the metabolic abnormalities generated in diet-induced obesity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity affects over 600 million people worldwide and projections are pessimistic indicating that over a billion people will be diagnosed with obesity by the year 2030 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.worldobesity.org/">https://www.worldobesity.org/</ext-link>). Obesity develops as a consequence of a chronic state of anabolism in which caloric intake overcomes energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Theilade et al., 2021</xref>). Both, experimental and human studies have indicated that, at least in part, the chronic anabolic state leading to obesity develops as a consequence of a defective hypothalamic regulation of whole-body energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavadas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sonnefeld et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van de Sande-Lee et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Experimental studies have shown that the consumption of large amounts of saturated fats triggers an inflammatory response in the hypothalamus affecting the function of key neurons involved in the regulation of food intake, energy expenditure, and systemic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Souza et al., 2005</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Milanski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Milanski et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, human studies using magnetic resonance imaging have identified hypothalamic gliosis in adults and children with obesity, providing clinical evidence for the existence of an obesity-associated hypothalamic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van de Sande-Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thaler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sewaybricker et al., 2019</xref>). Microglia are key cellular components of this inflammatory response undergoing structural and functional changes that develop early after the introduction of a high-fat diet (HFD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tapia-González et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Valdearcos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fernández-Arjona et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valdearcos et al., 2017</xref>). Distinct strategies used to inhibit hypothalamic microglia resulted in impaired diet-induced hypothalamic inflammation, increased leptin sensitivity, reduced spontaneous caloric intake, and improved systemic glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Valdearcos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morari et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, elucidating the mechanisms involved in the regulation of microglial response to dietary factors may provide advance in the definition of the pathophysiology of obesity, and potentially identify new targets for interventions aimed at treating obesity and its metabolic comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mendes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mendes and Velloso, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Valdearcos et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Microglia are derived from the yolk sac primitive hematopoietic cells and populate the neuroepithelium at embryonic day 9.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ginhoux et al., 2010</xref>). Under baseline conditions, in the absence of infections, trauma or other types of potentially harmful stimuli, these cells remain rather quiescent; however, under stimulus, they undergo rapid morphological and functional changes aimed at confronting the threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saijo and Glass, 2011</xref>). In the hypothalamus, differently from most parts of the brain, microglia are responsive to fluctuations in the blood levels of nutrients and hormones involved in metabolic control, such as leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Valdearcos et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, a simple meal can promote considerable changes in hypothalamic microglia indicating the involvement of these cells in the complex network of cells that regulate whole-body metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). Under the consumption of a nutritionally balanced diet, meal-induced changes in hypothalamic microglia are cyclic and completely reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). However, under consumption of a HFD, microglia present profound changes in morphology and function; moreover, upon prolonged consumption of this type of diet, there is recruitment of bone marrow-derived myeloid cells that will compose a new landscape of hypothalamic microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Valdearcos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Valdearcos et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the considerable advance in the understanding of how hypothalamic microglia are involved in diet-induced obesity (DIO), it is currently unknown what are the transcriptional landscapes of resident microglia and recruited myeloid cells and what specific functions they exert in the context of obesity and metabolic control.</p><p>In this study, we first elucidated the transcriptional differences between resident CX3CR1+ hypothalamic microglia and CCR2+ recruited myeloid cells in DIO, identifying chemokines as a relevant subset of genes undergoing regulation. Next, we identified a subset of recruited myeloid cells expressing CXCR3, which exerts a protective role against DIO.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Elucidating the transcriptional signatures of hypothalamic resident microglia and recruited myeloid cells in DIO</title><p>Dual-reporter mice CX3CR1<sup>GFP/+</sup>CCR2<sup>RFP/+</sup> were obtained by the crossing of CX3CR1<sup>GFP</sup> and CCR2<sup>RFP</sup> homozygous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). At the age of 8 weeks, female and male were randomly selected for either chow or HFD feeding for 28 days, and then specimens were harvested for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In flow cytometry, cells expressing CCR2 were detected in the hypothalamus of mice fed on HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), whereas in the white adipose tissue (WAT), virtually all cells expressing CX3CR1 were also expressing CCR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Conversely, in both female and male mice fed on HFD, the ratio of CCR2 myeloid cells to CX3CR1 resident microglia was approximately 1:10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Histological analysis confirmed the results obtained by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>); furthermore, it was shown that CD169, which is classically regarded as a marker of bone marrow-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chávez-Galán et al., 2015</xref>), is in fact expressed both in resident microglia and CCR2 recruited myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), confirming data published elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Valdearcos et al., 2019</xref>). Next, to prepare the samples for RNA-sequencing, we sorted hypothalamic microglia expressing either CX3CR1 and recruited myeloid cells expressing CCR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The quality of sorting was confirmed by determining the positivity for CX3CR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) and CCR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), and by determining the positivity for several markers of resident microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–m</xref>) and of bone marrow-derived cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2n–x</xref>). The elucidation of the transcriptional landscapes of CX3CR1 and CCR2 cells was performed using bioinformatic tools to compare transcript expression levels in distinct cell types and conditions. The results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) revealed that either diet or sex exerted only minor differences in the expression of transcripts in CX3CR1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a, b</xref>); nevertheless, sex exerted major differences in CCR2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a, b</xref>). The direct comparisons between CX3CR1 and CCR2 obtained from mice fed on the HFD, revealed the vast differences in the transcriptional landscapes of either female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) or male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) mice. Furthermore, the direct comparisons between female and male mice revealed a considerable degree of sexual dimorphism in the transcriptional landscapes of recruited CCR2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). In CX3CR1 cells, the consumption of the HFD impacted on IL17, lipids, toll-like receptor signaling, tumor necrosis factor signaling and chemokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>); whereas in CCR2 cells, the consumption of the HFD impacted on lipids, toll-like receptor signaling, tumor necrosis factor signaling, chemokines, neurotrophins signaling, reactive oxygen species, thermogenesis, and pathways related to neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Next, we asked what functions related to chemotaxis were predominantly regulated in CCR2 cells of mice fed on the HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b, c</xref>). As cell chemotaxis emerged as an important function in both females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) and males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), we looked with greater detail into the expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Virtually all the transcripts evaluated showed diametrically opposite expression between CX3CR1 and CCR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CCR2-positive cells infiltrate the hypothalamus of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) CX3CR1<sup>GFP/+</sup>CCR2<sup>RFP/+</sup> dual-reporter mutant mice generation.

We showed that hypothalamic microglia undergo minor transcriptional changes when mice are fed on HFD; however, there are vast differences when confronting resident CX3CR1 microglia versus recruited CCR2 myeloid cells transcriptomes. Moreover, there is a considerable degree of sexual dimorphism in the transcriptomes of recruited CCR2 myeloid cells in mice fed a HFD. Upon exploration of the differences between resident microglia and recruited immune cells, we identified the chemokine receptor CXCR3 as an interesting candidate for intervention as it was highly expressed in recruited cells. The inhibition of CXCR3 resulted in increased body mass gain, worsening of glucose intolerance, and increased mRNA expression of hypothalamic <italic>Npy</italic>. Thus, the study is the first to identify a subset of recruited myeloid cells that has a protective role against the deleterious outcomes of DIO, therefore establishing a new concept in obesity-associated hypothalamic inflammation.</p><p>Early studies in this field have shown that dietary fats, particularly long-chain saturated fatty acids, trigger an inflammatory response in the mediobasal hypothalamus that emerges a few hours after the introduction of a HFD and progresses to chronicity if the consumption of the HFD persists for long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Souza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Milanski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Microglia play an important role in this inflammatory response, and studies have shown that during the course of a prolonged consumption of HFD, there is the recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to compose a new hypothalamic microglia landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thaler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Valdearcos et al., 2019</xref>). However, it was previously unknown what are the transcriptional signatures of hypothalamic microglia and recruited bone marrow-derived cells in DIO.</p><p>To elucidate the transcriptional landscapes of hypothalamic microglia and recruited myeloid cells, we initially prepared a dual-reporter mouse for CX3CR1 and CCR2. CX3CR1 encodes for the fractalkine receptor and is highly expressed in resident microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greter et al., 2015</xref>). The creation of CX3CR1 reporter mice was regarded as an important step toward the characterization of resident microglia, and several studies in the field employ this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yona et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, CCR2 is highly expressed in bone marrow-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mildner et al., 2007</xref>). The quality of our model was proven good as markers of resident microglia were present only in CX3CR1 cells, whereas markers of recruited myeloid cells were present only in CCR2 cells. Moreover, as previously described, we could find no CCR2 cells in the hypothalamus of mice fed chow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valdearcos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Valdearcos et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The first important, and previously unknown finding emerged from the comparison of the transcriptomes of hypothalamic microglia in mice fed chow versus mice fed HFD. In females, there were only 34 transcripts undergoing significant changes between the two dietary conditions, whereas in males, the number was greater, 412, but still quite small considering the whole transcriptome of resident microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Young et al., 2021</xref>). In a study evaluating the single-cell transcriptomics of hypothalamic cells, the consumption of a HFD resulted in minor changes in the so-called macrophage-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>); however, the detailed transcriptional landscape of these cells was not explored in depth, so it is uncertain if it contained both resident microglia and recruited immune cells. In an experimental model of Alzheimer’s disease, which evaluated male and female mice, there were hippocampal resident microglial transcriptional changes of the same magnitude as the one we found in the hypothalamus, affecting approximately 300 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rivera-Escalera et al., 2019</xref>). In an experimental model of cerebral hemorrhage evaluating only males, the impact on microglia transcriptome was also small, affecting only 10% of the evaluated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, in a study evaluating transcriptional changes of resident microglia during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2023</xref>), there were also important differences between female and male mice; and, the magnitude of the transcriptional changes occurring during aging was about the same as we see in the dietary intervention. Thus, it seems that in different brain regions and under distinct interventions, the magnitude of resident microglia transcriptional changes is quite small; however, the number of studies evaluating this question is not expressive; thus, further studies are needed to provide a definitive view regarding the actual magnitude of plasticity of resident microglia. Despite the small number of transcripts undergoing changes in our model, greatest impact occurred in the expression of genes related to IL-17 signaling, lipid metabolism, toll-like receptor signaling, tumor necrosis factor signaling and chemokine signaling, which strongly supports the role of dietary lipids in the induction of an inflammatory response by the resident microglia, supporting previous studies in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Milanski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thaler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Valdearcos et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, IL17 signaling emerged as a major pathway modulated by DIO. In a recent study, we have shown that IL17 can act upon proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons promoting a reduction in calorie intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nogueira et al., 2020</xref>). The current finding of a transcriptional modulation of IL17-related genes in resident microglia opens a new perspective in the understanding of how inflammatory signals modulate the function of the hypothalamus in obesity, which should be explored in the future.</p><p>Next, we confronted the transcriptomes of hypothalamic resident microglia and recruited myeloid cells, and in this case, there were huge differences, reaching over 7000 transcripts. Per se, this finding reveals a striking difference between resident microglia and recruited immune cells in the hypothalamus of mice fed on HFD. Nevertheless, despite this is a new information regarding the hypothalamus, similar findings were reported in other brain regions submitted to distinct interventions, such as in an experimental model of glioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ochocka et al., 2021</xref>), in flavivirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spiteri et al., 2023</xref>), and in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwabenland et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hartmann et al., 2024</xref>). The evaluation of the main pathways differentially expressed in the two cell subsets revealed major differences in lipids, toll-like receptor signaling, tumor necrosis factor signaling, chemokines, neurotrophins signaling, reactive oxygen species, thermogenesis, and pathways related to neurodegeneration. The impact of the consumption of a HFD on the regulation of lipid-related pathways, toll-like receptor, and tumor necrosis factor signaling has been widely explored in many previous studies, and interventions in these systems are known to mitigate the harmful effects of the diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Milanski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thaler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Valdearcos et al., 2019</xref>). However, little has been done regarding the characterization of the mechanisms of chemotaxis that drive the recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to the hypothalamus. Therefore, we looked with greater detail into the main chemokines and chemokine receptors differentially expressed in the two subsets of cells. We elected CXCR3 because it was highly expressed in CCR2 cells and presented low expression in CX3CR1 cells. CXCR3 is a chemokine receptor that is involved in the recruitment of distinct types of bone marrow-derived monocytic cells, such as plasmacytoid monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cella et al., 1999</xref>), synovial tissue monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Katschke et al., 2001</xref>), and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Padovan et al., 2002</xref>). In the brain, CXCR3-expressing cells have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and other age-dependent cognitive dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jorfi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schroer et al., 2023</xref>), multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bogers et al., 2023</xref>), epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liang et al., 2023</xref>), and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cai et al., 2022</xref>). However, no previous study has evaluated CXCR3 in the hypothalamus in the context of obesity.</p><p>First, we asked if the known ligands for CXCR3, and <italic>Ifng</italic>, which is induced in response to the activation of CXCR3, were present in either subset of cells. We found <italic>Cxcl11</italic> in neither cell subset; <italic>Cxcl9</italic> was expressed only in CX3CR1 microglia; <italic>Cxcl10</italic> was expressed in both cell types, with greater expression in CCR2 recruited cells; and Ifng was expressed only in CCR2 cells. Moreover, there was a considerable engagement of IFN-γ-related pathways in CCR2 cells of both female and male mice fed a HFD. Thus, we considered CXCR3 as a promising target for intervention.</p><p>Next, we intervened in one of the ligands for CXCR3, CXCL10. For that, we performed ICV injections of an immunoneutralizing antibody, which resulted in smaller numbers of CCR2 cells in the hypothalamus. However, the intervention promoted minimal changes in the hypothalamic expression of transcripts encoding for several components of the chemotaxis machinery. Nevertheless, in females, the inhibition of CXCL10 resulted in increased body mass gain, reduction of hypothalamic <italic>Agrp</italic>, trends to reduce hypothalamic <italic>Il1b</italic> and <italic>Il6</italic>, and a trend to reduce blood insulin. In males, the phenotype was much milder, leading to minimal changes in hypothalamic <italic>Npy</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, and <italic>Il6</italic>. Little is known about the involvement of CXCL10 in hypothalamic physiology and pathology. In a model of caloric restriction, there was an increase in the hypothalamic expression of CXCL10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matthews et al., 2017</xref>), and this was regarded as a component of the mechanism of neuroprotection induced by caloric restriction. In addition, in a model of hypothalamic inflammation elicited by exogenous LPS, CXCL10 emerged as one of the transcripts undergoing the greatest increase in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reyes et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>As CXCR3 can be engaged by distinct chemokines, we decided to use a broader intervention, pharmacologically inhibiting CXCR3. AMG487 is a chemical inhibitor of CXCR3 with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 8.0 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). Upon treatment with AMG487, there was a reduction of the migration of CCR2 cells to the hypothalamus, which was accompanied by minimal changes in the expressions of chemokines and chemokine receptors. Under inhibition of CXCR3, both female and male mice presented increased body mass gain, which was accompanied by increased blood leptin, increased fasting glucose, increased hypothalamic <italic>Npy</italic> transcript, and reduction in markers of hypothalamic inflammation. There were no changes in caloric intake, however, there were reductions in energy expenditure during some periods during the 24 hr of recording.</p><p>These findings reveal that, at least one subset of recruited myeloid cells, has a protective rather than a harmful role in DIO-associated hypothalamic inflammation. This is a completely new concept in the field because all previous studies evaluating hypothalamic microglia in DIO reported that, once active in response to dietary fats, either resident microglia or recruited immune cells exerted inflammatory actions that impacted negatively energy balance and glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tapia-González et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Valdearcos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fernández-Arjona et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morari et al., 2014</xref>). This concept has been recently explored in depth in a study that used elegant models to either activate or inactivate microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valdearcos et al., 2017</xref>) and the results confirm that, whenever manipulating microglia using approaches that are not specific for a given subset of cells, the net result is worsening of the metabolic phenotype when microglia is activated and improvement of the metabolic phenotype when microglia is inactivated. Thus, we believe that the subset of recruited myeloid cells herein identified plays a regulatory role in hypothalamic inflammation.</p><p>We acknowledge that the study could be strengthened if, in addition to pharmacological and antibody-based interventions, we used gene-targeted approaches as well.</p><p>In conclusion, this study elucidated the transcriptional landscapes of hypothalamic resident microglia and recruited myeloid cells in DIO. In resident microglia, the consumption of a HFD resulted in small changes in transcript expression, whereas the confrontation of the transcriptional landscapes of resident microglia versus recruited immune cells revealed broad differences that encompass lipids, toll-like receptor signaling, tumor necrosis factor signaling, chemokines, neurotrophins signaling, reactive oxygen species, thermogenesis, and pathways related to neurodegeneration. In addition, the study revealed a considerable sexual dimorphism in the transcriptional landscape of both hypothalamic resident microglia and recruited immune cells. The study also identified a subset of recruited immune cells, expressing the chemokine receptor CXCR3 that has a protective role against the harmful metabolic effects of the HFD; thus, providing a new concept in DIO-associated hypothalamic inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care and diets</title><p>All animal care and experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Brazilian College for Animal Experimentation and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (CEUA 5497-1/2020 and 6210-1/2023).

Specifically, the authors first revealed that although transcriptional changes in hypothalamic resident microglia following exposure to high-fat feeding are minor, there are compelling transcriptomic differences between resident microglia and microglia recruited to the hypothalamus, and these are sexually dimorphic. Using independent loss-of-function studies, the authors also demonstrate an important role of CXCR3 and hypothalamic CXCL10 in the hypothalamic recruitment of CCR2+ positive cells on metabolism following exposure to high-fat diet-feeding in mice. This manuscript puts forth conceptually novel evidence that inhibition of chemotaxis-mediated immune cell recruitment accelerates body weight gain in high-fat diet-feeding, suggesting that a subset of microglia which express CXCR3 may confer protective, anti-obesogenic effects.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The work is exciting and relevant given the prevalence of obesity and the consequences of inflammation in the brain on perturbations of energy metabolism and ensuant metabolic diseases. Hypothalamic inflammation is associated with disrupted energy balance, and activated microglia within the hypothalamus resulting from excessive caloric intake and saturated fatty acids are often thought to be mediators of impairment of hypothalamic regulation of metabolism.

Specifically, the authors reveal that although transcriptional changes in hypothalamic resident microglia following exposure to high-fat feeding are minor, there are compelling transcriptomic differences between resident microglia and microglia recruited to the hypothalamus, and these are sexually dimorphic. Using independent loss-of-function studies, the authors also demonstrate an important role of CXCR3 and hypothalamic CXCL10 in the hypothalamic recruitment of CCR2+ positive cells on metabolism following exposure to high-fat diet-feeding in mice. This manuscript puts forth conceptually novel evidence that inhibition of chemotaxis-mediated immune cell recruitment accelerates body weight gain in high-fat diet-feeding, suggesting that a subset of microglia that express CXCR3 may confer protective, anti-obesogenic effects.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The work is exciting and relevant given the prevalence of obesity and the consequences of inflammation in the brain on perturbations of energy metabolism and ensuant metabolic diseases. Hypothalamic inflammation is associated with disrupted energy balance, and activated microglia within the hypothalamus resulting from excessive caloric intake and saturated fatty acids are often thought to be mediators of impairment of hypothalamic regulation of metabolism. The present work reports a novel notion in which immune cells recruited into the hypothalamus that express chemokine receptor CXCR3 may have a protective role against diet-induced obesity. In vivo studies reported herein demonstrate that inhibition of CXCR3 exacerbates high-fat diet-induced body weight gain, increases circulating triglycerides and fasting glucose levels, worsens glucose tolerance, and increases the expression of orexigenic neuropeptides, at least in female mice.</p><p>This work provides a highly interesting and needed overview of preclinical and clinical brain inflammation, which is relevant to readers with an interest in metabolism and immunometabolism in the context of obesity.</p><p>Using flow cytometry, cell sorting, and transcriptomics including RNA-sequencing, the manuscript provides novel insights into transcriptional landscapes of resident and recruited microglia in the hypothalamus.

The comments were timely and constructive and guided us toward preparing a new version of the article which contains novel data that strengthened the overall quality of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Experiments with ovariectomized female mice with (and without) estrogen replacement would help to address the physiological basis of the observed sexdependent effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed an experiment with female C57BL/6J Unib, subdivided into Sham, OVX, and OVX+EST groups, which were exposed to HFD for 4 weeks. We monitored the weekly evolution of body weight and food intake. At the end of the protocol, the animals fasted for 4 hours. Then, we measured fasting blood glucose and estradiol; and extracted tissues (hypothalamus andWAT). In the hypothalamus samples, we evaluated, by RT-qPCR, the expression of chemokines, chemokine receptors, and some pro-inflammatory cytokines and neuropeptides. We evaluated the body mass relative WAT weight. The new results are presented in Supplementary Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Indirect calorimetric analysis of energy expenditure will benefit from ANCOVA analysis using body weight as a covariate. Moreover, locomotor activity should be also controlled.</p></disp-quote><p>All statistical analysis regarding energy expenditure is corrected by body mass, thus, there is no need for ANCOVA, we clarified this in the text. The determination of locomotor activity is now included in Supplementary Figures 2 and 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A deeper analysis of hypothalamic inflammation and ER stress pathways would strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed new experiments to determine the expression of hypothalamic inflammation and ER stress pathaways. This is shown in Suppl. Fig. 2 and 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mechanistic inhibition of CXCR3 was performed by CXCL10 immunoneutralization and CXCR3 antagonism. Those approaches are correct and well-performed, however considering the experience of the group in hypothalamic studies, I miss a virogenetic-based knockdown. Do the authors have any data on that?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a great point. Unfortunately, we did not succeed in obtaining mice Cre lineages that would be needed for the proposed experiments. We included this as a weakness of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>There are a few typographical errors for correction:</p><p>- Page 4, line 157: CCL10 to CXCL10.</p><p>- Page 6, line 226: makers to markers.</p><p>- Page 7, lines 283 and 287, Figure 6C: INF to IFN.</p></disp-quote><p>All errors were corrected, as recommended.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Parts of the manuscript may be difficult for readers without knowledge of transcriptomics to interpret; thus, further description of several of the figures (e.g. Figure 3 and 4) may be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded the text in Results to clarify this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors comment on the choice of peripheral administration of CXCR3 antagonist as opposed to central (e.g. icv) administration? Indeed, systemic inhibition of CXCR3 produced significant alterations in body weight gain and glucose tolerance in female mice given high-fat diets and reduced CCR2 and CXCR3 immunostaining in the hypothalamus.

In HFD, these are recruited from the periphery to the CNS, so, we believe ICV treatment with AMG487 would not reduce recruitment to the hypothalamic parenchyma. With the same animals in which we performed the locomotor activity, we performed RT-qPCR of WAT and liver and analyzed the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. This is now in Supplementary Figures 2 and 3. We included a comment in the text to explain our rationale for this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Besides hypothalamic mRNA levels of chemokines and chemokine receptors, does systemic CXCR3 antagonism affect other aspects linked to diet-induced impairments of hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis, like inflammation, ER stress and/or mitochondrial dynamics/function?

In the hypothalamus of females there were no changes in the expression of transcripts encoding proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and mitochondrial turnover, whereas in males there was a reduction of Ddit3 and Mfn1. Moreover, in females the inhibition of CXCR3 promoted no changes in the liver expression of lipidogenic and gluconeogenic genes, and no changes in the white adipose tissue expression of lipidogenic genes. In the liver of males, there was a reduction in the expression of Fasn and an increase in the expression of G6pc3. As for the females, in males, there were no changes in the white adipose tissue expression of lipidogenic genes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
