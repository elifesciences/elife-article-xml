ecologically important polyketides and lipopeptides in other microbes. They do so by bypassing the ubiquitous coenzyme A-dependent activation and rely on the acyl carrier protein-tethered 4′-phosphopantetheine (<italic>holo</italic>-ACP). The molecular basis of how FAALs strictly reject chemically identical and abundant acceptors like coenzyme A (CoA) and accept <italic>holo</italic>-ACP unlike other members of the ANL superfamily remains elusive. We show that FAALs have plugged the promiscuous canonical CoA-binding pockets and utilize highly selective alternative binding sites. These alternative pockets can distinguish adenosine 3′,5′-bisphosphate-containing CoA from <italic>holo</italic>-ACP and thus FAALs can distinguish between CoA and <italic>holo</italic>-ACP. These exclusive features helped identify the omnipresence of FAAL-like proteins and their emergence in plants, fungi, and animals with unconventional domain organizations. The universal distribution of FAALs suggests that they are parallelly evolved with FACLs for ensuring a CoA-independent activation and redirection of fatty acids towards lipidic metabolites.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fatty acyl-AMP ligases</kwd><kwd>polyketide synthases</kwd><kwd>nonribosomal peptide synthetases</kwd><kwd>coenzyme A</kwd><kwd>fatty acids</kwd><kwd>acyl carrier protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patil</surname><given-names>Gajanan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mondal</surname><given-names>Sudipta</given-names></name><name><surname>Sankaranarayanan</surname><given-names>Rajan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001501</institution-id><institution>University Grants Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shambhavi</surname><given-names>Sakshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>J.

These enzymes are involved in the production of both primary metabolites such as acyl-CoA and secondary metabolites such as antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sieber and Marahiel, 2005</xref>), complex lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gokhale et al., 2007</xref>), cyclic peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Walsh, 2004</xref>), and lipopeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hemmerling et al., 2018</xref>). Basic metabolic pathways such as β-oxidation, membrane biogenesis, post-translational modifications, etc., use primary metabolites such as acyl-CoA. The secondary metabolites such as complex lipids that function as virulent molecules in <italic>Mycobacteria</italic> and bioactive molecules in several microbes that help tide over unfavorable conditions and establish themselves in their niches. Such diverse metabolites are produced by the members of the ANL superfamily through a two-step catalytic mechanism. It begins with the activation of carboxylate moiety containing substrates such as fatty acids or amino acids by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and finally transferring it to an acceptor such as CoA or <italic>holo</italic>-ACP. Multiple structural and biochemical studies show that members of the superfamily such as FACLs and A-domains employ a common pocket for the chemically identical CoA and the 4'-PPant moieties attached to the <italic>holo</italic>-ACP, respectively, for the final transfer. It was later demonstrated that the A-domains can cross-react with CoA to form aminoacyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Linne et al., 2007</xref>), which points to the liabilities of utilizing a common pocket for binding chemically identical moieties. Promiscuity towards the final acceptor has now been noted in different classes of ANL superfamily members where luciferases are shown to catalyze fatty acyl-CoA formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oba et al., 2003</xref>) and FACLs producing bioluminescence with molecular oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oba et al., 2009</xref>). While fatty acid/amino acid substrate promiscuity is well studied and exploited in combinatorial biosynthesis of bioactive molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Winn et al., 2020</xref>), the origin and basis of acceptor promiscuity is relatively less understood.</p><p>FAALs are atypical enzyme systems of the ANL superfamily as these show a narrow preference for <italic>holo</italic>-ACP and not CoA, where they transfer the activated fatty acyl-AMP to the 4'-PPant of <italic>holo</italic>-ACP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trivedi, 2004</xref>). FAALs rejecting the small, diffusible, and abundant CoA while accepting the ACP-tethered to a 4'-PPant moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>) is puzzling as they are chemically identical. In a previous study, it was proposed that the FAAL-specific insertion (FSI), an additional stretch of amino acids found only in the N-terminal domain of FAALs, prevents reaction with CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arora, 2009</xref>). However, the deletion or destabilization of the FSI failed to convert FAALs as efficient producers of acyl-CoA as there is only a weak ability to react with CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arora, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goyal et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, it is also unclear how such a mechanism operates and distinguishes the two chemically identical acceptors, particularly when CoA is an abundant metabolite. These observations prompted us to hypothesize that FAALs have either evolved novel appendages or other modes for binding the acceptor to allow strict rejection of CoA.</p><p>In the present study, we have used structural, mutational, and biochemical analyses to identify the mechanistic basis of how FAALs can distinguish between near identical acceptors for the acyl transfer reaction. We show that, unlike other members of the superfamily, FAALs achieve acceptor fidelity by avoiding the usage of a promiscuous canonical CoA-binding pocket and utilizing a discriminatory pocket that is distinct from the canonical CoA-binding pocket. Loss- and gain-of-function mutations were generated by identifying the structural determinants that nullify the canonical CoA-binding pocket. Interestingly, we found that the non-functional canonical CoA-binding pocket and the unique discriminatory alternative pocket are unique features of FAALs, which is conserved in all forms of life including plant, fungi, and animals. The identification of such a conserved rejection mechanism across organisms has larger implications in determining the redirection of cellular flux of fatty acids towards synthesis of diverse metabolites across organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The promiscuous canonical CoA-binding pocket is inaccessible and redundant in FAALs</title><p>The structural features of a canonical CoA-binding pocket that allow the proper recognition of CoA/4'-PPant in different ANL superfamily members were compared and contrasted with the analogous structural positions in FAALs. A comprehensive analysis of the canonical CoA-binding pocket in the 26 structures (59 protomers) of the CoA/4'-PPant-bound ANL superfamily members (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) revealed important aspects of CoA/4'-PPant recognition. It is observed that ligand interacts with the protein through three categories of interactions but none of the structures show the CoA/4'-PPant ligands bound in identical positions or orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>). The three categories of interactions are (i) the hydrogen bonds mediated by the A8-motif of the C-terminal domain, (ii) the water-mediated contacts through the N-terminal helices H10 and H14 (notation based on <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> FAAL, abbreviated as <italic>Ec</italic>FAAL; PDB: 3PBK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), and (iii) the interactions with the phosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gulick et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kochan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mitchell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li and Nair, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hughes and Keatinge-Clay, 2011</xref>) of the adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate moiety through the positively charged residues (Arg/Lys) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) in the loop connecting H23 and β26 (notation based on <italic>Ec</italic>FAAL).</p><p>A comparative analysis of the structurally analogous CoA-binding pocket of FAALs (11 structures constituting 23 protomers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arora, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goyal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guillet, 2016</xref>) sheds light on why FAALs cannot accept CoA. The analysis reveals an absence of selection from the positively charged residues (Arg/Lys) known to assist in CoA binding in the other members of the ANL superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, the CoA-binding pocket of FAALs shows the presence of bulky residues F279, W224, and M231 (in <italic>Ec</italic>FAAL) at the base and a unique FAAL-specific helix (FSH) (T252-R258 in <italic>Ec</italic>FAAL) at the entrance of the pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). These elements are highly conserved in other FAALs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) and restrict the space available for the incoming 4'-PPant arm of both CoA and <italic>holo</italic>-ACP. The superposition of CoA- and 4'-PPant-bound structures with FAALs revealed that the overcrowded pocket along with the FSH at the entrance of the pocket is unlikely to accommodate either CoA or 4'-PPant of <italic>holo</italic>-ACP by hindering their entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). There are at least seven atoms of the N-terminal domain of FAALs at a distance less than 2.5 Å from the atoms of CoA in its various conformations found in the different CoA-bound FACL structures. On the contrary, the N-terminal domain of FACLs shows only one atom at 2.5 Å from the multiple CoA conformations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The distance-based assessment clearly indicates the potential clashes an incoming CoA would face in the canonical pocket of FAALs. Moreover, the absence of positively charged residues will naturally be unfavorable for CoA from being appropriately oriented in the pocket. These observations lead to the hypothesis that the canonical CoA-binding pocket is rendered non-functional because of the inaccessibility in FAALs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The presence of conserved negative selection elements and absence of positive selection elements in canonical coenzyme A (CoA)-binding pocket of fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAALs) can prevent CoA binding.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The CoA-interacting residues in fatty acyl/aryl-CoA ligases (FACLs) (<italic>Hs</italic>FACL, <italic>Aa</italic>4CBL, <italic>Nt</italic>CCL, and <italic>Se</italic>ACS) and the structurally analogous residues in FAALs (<italic>Ec</italic>FAAL, <italic>Ms</italic>FAAL32, and <italic>Lp</italic>FAAL) are tabulated.

Such a differential activity is despite two critical similarities; first, the overall structural similarity (N-terminal domain in green; C-terminal domain in orange connected by the A8-motif in violet), except an insertion in FAALs (cyan). Second, the differential activity is despite the chemical identity of the substrates that react during the second step, where coenzyme A (CoA) used by FACLs is used to post-translationally modify <italic>apo</italic>-ACP to <italic>holo</italic>-ACP (light green) that is utilized by FAALs.

Current results indicate that mutations in the canonical pocket alone are sufficient to introduce CoA production ability in FAALs. A comparison of acyl-CoA production of the ΔFSI with FSH deletion mutant (ΔFSH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>) reveals that <italic>Rs</italic>FAAL<sub>ΔFSH</sub> produces 2-fold excess acyl-CoA as compared to <italic>Rs</italic>FAAL<sub>ΔFSI</sub> while <italic>Ms</italic>FAAL32<sub>ΔFSH</sub> produces 10-fold excess acyl-CoA as compared to <italic>Ms</italic>FAAL32<sub>ΔFSI</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). Therefore, it can be concluded that the FSH and other CoA- rejection elements around the canonical CoA-binding pocket significantly deter acyl-CoA production, which supersedes the inhibition of acyl-CoA production by FSI in FAALs. Overall, these observations lead to the conclusion that the available space in the canonical CoA-binding pocket of FAALs is very small to accommodate even the 4'-PPant moiety. Mutations that increase the pocket space enhance the acyl-CoA production in FAALs, while the opposite is observed in the case of FACLs. Therefore, the bulky residues in the putative canonical CoA-binding pocket of FAALs itself act as a negative selection gate to sterically exclude CoA. The rejection mechanism operational at the canonical CoA-binding pocket in FAALs is relatively more effective in rejecting CoA than the FSI-based rejection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Identification of an alternative 4'-PPant-binding pocket in FAALs</title><p>The steric occlusion of the 4'-PPant binding in the canonical pocket would not only result in prevention of CoA-binding but also restrict the access to the 4'-PPant tethered <italic>holo</italic>-ACP.

The approach towards the active site in both cases is not on the same plane, but they coincide near the active site near the β-alanine of the 4'-PPant. The longest length along this pocket is aligned at ~25° to the canonical CoA-binding pocket. The canonical pocket is mainly formed after the rotation of the C-terminal domain in the thioesterification state (T-state) bringing the A8-motif near the active site. The space generated between the A8-motif (from the C-terminal domain) and the subdomain-B of the N-terminal domain constitutes the canonical CoA-binding pocket. In contrast, the newly identified pocket is the space between the loops in subdomain-A and the FSH region of subdomain-B of FAALs. These loop regions are highly variable in length but rich in prolines (occasionally threonine or serine) some of which are conserved in FAALs such as P226 and P107 in <italic>Ec</italic>FAAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), while the FSH has a unique secondary structure characteristic of FAALs.

The mutations of residues guarding the alternative pocket to bulkier residues in the <italic>Ms</italic>FAAL32-<italic>Ms</italic>PKS13<sub>1-1042</sub> system also resulted in diminished acyl-transfer ability. These results indicate that blocking the entrance of the alternative pocket prevents the entry of the incoming 4'-PPant arm tethered to ACP. Therefore, in FAALs, the identified alternative pocket is fully functional and distinct from the non-functional canonical pocket. Such a unique pocket facilitates the entry of the 4'-PPant arm of the ACP to approach the active site and catalyze the acyl-transfer reaction, a feature absent in other members of the superfamily.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A universal mechanism for rejection of highly abundant CoA in the alternative pocket</title><p>The primary attribute of a functional alternative pocket in FAALs is to discriminate and reject CoA from the chemically identical 4'-PPant of <italic>holo</italic>-ACP. Therefore, the pocket should allow the entry of 4'-PPant into the tunnel but not the additional ‘head group,’ adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate moiety, containing CoA. Structural analysis of eight CoA-bound protein structures (constituting 14 protomers) of the ANL superfamily reveals the variability or degrees of freedom available for adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate moiety (head group). The analysis reveals that the 4'-PPant arm remains largely rigid in an extended form and the major source of variability is the conformational freedom around the 4'-phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Such a variability has previously been used to classify the conformations of CoA as extended conformations (e.g., <italic>Se</italic>ACS, <italic>Hs</italic>FACL) or bent conformations (e.g., <italic>Aa</italic>4'-CBL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen, 2017</xref>). Limited variabilities in the conformations of the adenine ring and ribose are clustered in a small zone and therefore can be ignored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The length of the 4'-PPant arm is around 18–20 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leibundgut et al., 2007</xref>) while it is around 15–16 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mitchell et al., 2012</xref>) as seen in the crystal structures of various ANL superfamily members, which is comparable to the length of predicted pockets (17–18 Å). The biochemical evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) along with length considerations indicates that the 4'-PPant arm can be accommodated within the predicted pocket. In the absence of structural information, the orientation of the 4'-PPant arm is random but limited to space with the identified pocket such that the 4'-phosphate is at the entry of the tunnel and the thiol near the active site.</p><p>Based on the above considerations, a CoA molecule in ANL superfamily members can be visualized as ‘flag hoisted on a mast.’ The extended 4'-PPant arm can be considered as the ‘mast’ and the adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate moiety as the ‘flag.’ The rotation of the ‘flag’ around the ‘mast’ placed within the pocket is comparable to the degree of freedom available for the ‘flag’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). We, therefore, rotated the ‘flag’ around the ‘mast’ to generate conformations at an angular sampling rate of 1° per conformation for each of the four known conformations of CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). It was found that main-chain atoms and Cβ atoms of the FAAL protein, irrespective of the conformation of the C-terminal domain (A-state or T-state), show an average of 28 clashes (van der Waals overlap &gt;0.25 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>). The adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate or the ‘flag’ would encounter severe clashes because the entry of the alternative pocket is deeply embedded within the subdomain-A and -B of the N-terminal domain. It is unlike the entry of the canonical pocket, which is entirely open with the subdomain-B forming the base of the pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, the N-terminal domain of FAALs itself forms a strong deterrent for accommodating adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and hence prevents CoA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Interestingly, the structural elements resisting the adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate are unique to FAALs such as the FSH (T252-R258 in <italic>Ec</italic>FAAL) and the loop harboring proline residues that guard the opening of the tunnel. Therefore, a strong negative selection and the absence of any positive selection make accommodation of adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate containing CoA unlikely. In contrast, the adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate lacking 4'-PPant of <italic>holo</italic>-ACP can easily access the pocket and participate in the acyl-transfer reaction. This essentially forms the structural basis for the CoA-rejection mechanism in FAALs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The alternative pocket in fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAALs) is highly selective, and its unique architecture negatively selects for coenzyme A (CoA).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A ‘mast’ (the 4’-PPant arm) is aligned along the longest length of the predicted pocket (blue: mesh representation) and the ‘flag’ (adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate) is rotated to generate theoretical orientations of the ‘flag.’ These conformations of <italic>Hs</italic>FACL (PDB: 3EQ6) are shown (yellow: stick format) at 45° intervals.

The superposition reveals that CoA structures are bound to ANL superfamily members mainly in an extended conformation (adenine ring away from the 4'-PPant arm) and rarely in bent conformation (adenine ring in proximity to 4'-PPant arm). The difference is due to the conformational freedom around the phosphodiester bonds; however, despite the variations, the phosphates tend to spatially organize in the similar positions available for the phosphate clamping arginine or lysine residues. The bent conformation has an additional contact point, ring clamp, where the adenine ring is held through aromatic amino acids, while the adenine ring is free in the extended conformation of CoA with orientations of adenine ring having a degree of variability but restricted to a small zone. The 4'-PPant arm is presented in a fully extended form in both the subsets of CoA and the PPant clamp atoms presented for hydrogen bonding with the A8 motif and water molecules. (<bold>b</bold>) In the absence of any structural information on how the 4'-PPant may be accommodated in the pocket, it is safe to assume the 4'-PPant is accommodated within the identified pocket analogous to the ‘mast’ of the flag.

The plot for <italic>Ec</italic>FAAL in A-state and T-state is comparable in the zones of least resistance, which is also true for <italic>Ms</italic>FAAL32 T-state, suggesting that these are conformation-independent. This observation indicates that the clashes can primarily be attributed to the N-terminal itself and the unique location of the pocket.

The conformations of the head group from 220° to 280°, where only a few (2–10) clashes are observed, particularly the region spanned between 240° and 260°. The zone of least resistance is largely owing to a vacant space between N- and C-terminal domains without any residues to hold the phosphates or adenine ring. The space occupied by these conformations is close to the typical structural site for CoA accommodation in fatty acyl/aryl-CoA ligases (FACLs) except that the adenine ring is oriented away from the protein. The typical Arg/Lys residues that bind phosphates are absent in FAALs, and hence these conformations cannot be expected to be stabilized by phosphate clamps. The orientations with inward-facing adenine ring resemble the bent conformation of CoA, a rare conformation in ANL superfamily members, where the adenine ring is held by a conserved tryptophan as seen in <italic>Aa</italic>CBL (PDB: 3CW9). The conserved tryptophan residue is absent in most ANL superfamily members including FAALs and FACLs, and hence these conformations cannot be expected to be stabilized by stacking interactions with adenine. Therefore, in the 220°–280° region even though the rejection by negative selection is weak, there is no scope of positive selection that renders the region incompatible with CoA binding.

A lack of sequence conservation in the FSI and only a single structural template for further analysis complicated the search procedure. Therefore, early genome mining efforts resulted in a sparse identification of FAALs in lineages of actinobacteria, cyanobacteria, and proteobacteria along with some eukaryotes such as humans and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goyal et al., 2012</xref>). The conserved sequence features from this study such as FSH, a blocked canonical pocket, and a proline-lined 4'-PPant binding pocket led to the identification of FAAL-like proteins with greater confidence. The analysis revealed a ubiquitous distribution of FAALs across different forms of life including bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals, except archaea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). The phylogenetic analysis reveals that all the FAAL-like proteins diverge and cluster away from FACLs or A-domains. FAAL-like proteins show three subgroups, viz., bacterial/plant FAALs group, fungal FAAL-like protein group, and animal FAAL-like protein group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Typical FAALs are bacterial FAALs, which are always found in a genomic context with PKS and PKS/NRPS hybrid genes either as a stand-alone domain or as a didomain fused to ACP or multidomain fused to the entire PKS/NRPS gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Occasionally, the stand-alone bacterial FAALs are found to be interspersed with additional domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>), mainly with dehydrogenases and oxygenases. Most plant FAAL-like domains resemble the bacterial FAALs from their sequence identity and domain organization. However, unique domain organizations are also found in plant FAAL-like domains, where an uncharacterized protein has FAAL-like domains sandwiched between HemY domains and catalase domains or amino acid oxidase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

The evolution of acceptor promiscuity spectrum may have been driven based on their participation in bulk metabolic reactions.

Despite their lower sequence identity, the FSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>) supported by a hydrophobic patch and the FSH and CoA-rejecting features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>) are clearly identifiable. Such conserved FAAL-specific features indicate that FAAL-like modules are recruited in eukaryotes for specific metabolic processes owing to their unique ability to reject CoA. Interestingly, fungal and animal FAAL-like domains share a highly conserved three-domain architecture, and such an architecture is not seen in any of the prokaryotes and plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The conserved three-domain protein consists of a N-terminal DMAP1-binding domain followed by a tandemly fused two FAAL-like domains as found in fungi to animals. The eukaryotic metabolic context for avoiding a reaction with CoA through these FAAL-like domains and their unique domain organization remains to be explored. Based on these observations, FAAL-like domains are more widespread than previously anticipated and their omnipresence is comparable to the universally present FACLs. Therefore, we propose that FAALs may not have descended from FACLs and they rather share a parallel evolutionary history. The ancestral ANL fold could have diverged as non-promiscuous FAAL-like members and promiscuous nonFAAL-like members simultaneously in the last universal common ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study uncovers the mechanistic basis of how FAALs strictly reject CoA, which is highly abundant and almost chemically identical to their actual substrate, <italic>holo</italic>-ACP. The rejection mechanism relies on a discriminatory 4'-PPant-accepting pocket while avoiding the promiscuous canonical CoA-binding pocket that is rendered non-functional. It has been achieved through bulky hydrophobic residues in the pocket and a unique secondary structural element, FSH, at the entrance. The discriminatory 4'-PPant-accepting pocket in FAALs, on the other hand, has a unique architecture that negatively selects adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate moiety and also lacks Arg/Lys residues for positive selection. Interestingly, these rejection criteria are not only conserved in bacteria but also in all forms of life (excluding archaea). The unique remodeling of pockets to ensure acceptor discrimination probably allowed the evolutionary recruitment of FAAL-like domains in metabolic crossroads for redirecting the fate of molecules to specific pathways. Such a widespread conservation of FAAL-like proteins puts the evolutionary origin of FAALs parallel with FACLs in the last universal common ancestor and not as a subset of FACLs.</p><p>The scaffold of the ANL superfamily of enzymes is known to be promiscuous not only for the substrates they act on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arora et al., 2005</xref>), but also the final acceptor of the acyl adenylates. Surprisingly, billions of years of evolution have not prevailed upon the substrate-promiscuity problem as well as the acceptor-promiscuity problem. The probability of acceptor promiscuity influencing the erroneous product formation is high as some of the acceptors such as CoA and pantetheine are the most abundant molecules in the cell. The problem is greatly amplified as it can redirect the fate of metabolites from one pathway to another such as primary metabolism to secondary metabolism. Our analysis shows that the CoA-bound structures of ANL superfamily members exhibit non-conformity in the binding mode of 4'-PPant or the adenosine 3',5’-bisphosphate moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zahn, 2019</xref>). The variability in the 4'-PPant binding is also true for the A-domain:ACP complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mitchell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sundlov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sundlov and Gulick, 2013</xref>). The variability could be resulting from highly divergent residues lining the CoA-binding site in FACLs and their analogous sites in FAALs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), which possibly explains the observed differential activity of certain loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Hence, it is evident that a defined CoA-binding pocket is lacking in ANL superfamily members, which is commensurate with the failure to identify the pocket in FACLs using various pocket search algorithms. Therefore, a promiscuous access to the active site without any selection determinants is the likely cause for the lack of discrimination for final acceptors in these enzymes.</p><p>It is not clear if the observed spectrum of latent activities in these enzymes’ design is an evolutionary relic or has any physiological relevance in a specific cellular context. The persistence of acceptor promiscuity can only have two explanations: viz., the cross-reaction products are beneficial, or pocket modification is not possible without compromising the basic function. In this context, FAALs are surprisingly high-fidelity enzymes representing the extreme end of the promiscuity spectrum, offering no cross-reaction with CoA as acceptors of the acyl adenylates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trivedi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arora, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goyal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Priyadarshan and Sankaranarayanan, 2018</xref>). A functional and discriminatory 4'-PPant binding in FAALs has established them as an alternative enzymatic bridge between FA synthesis, exogenous fatty acids import, and PKS/NRPS machinery that produce diverse bioactive natural products such as bacillomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koumoutsi, 2004</xref>), mycosubtilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duitman, 1999</xref>), daptomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wittmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baltz, 2021</xref>), phenylnannolone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouhired, 2014</xref>), alkylresorcylic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayashi et al., 2011</xref>), caryoynencin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ross et al., 2014</xref>), vioprolide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auerbach et al., 2018</xref>), taromycin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamanaka, 2014</xref>), tambjamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marchetti et al., 2018</xref>), ambruticin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hemmerling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Julien et al., 2006</xref>), , to name a few (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The relevance of the lack of acceptor promiscuity in FAALs has been demonstrated in <italic>Mycobacteria</italic> as being responsible for dictating the fate of free fatty acids in producing virulent lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arora, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The conserved sequence and structural features of bacterial FAALs enabled better identification of FAAL-like domains across all forms of life, except archaea. FAALs may have been recruited to specifically ‘load’ fatty acids on PKS/NRPS but the possibility of lack of promiscuity in FAALs driving their over-representation cannot be ignored. Their characteristic absence in archaea perhaps can be explained by the abysmal frequency or absence of PKS or NRPS systems. FAAL-like domains of bacteria and plants exhibit remarkable sequence similarity, which is expected because of the presence of canonical PKS/NRPS enzymology in both systems. A few of the identified FAAL-like domains in bacteria show unique domain organizations such as a fusion with lysophospholipid acyltransferases and alpha aminoadipate reductases or found interspersed in operons with dehydrogenases, decarboxylase, and ketoacyl synthases. Unique domain architectures are also found in plants, where FAAL-like domains are sandwiched between HemY and catalase domains and the function of these conserved proteins remain unknown. These unique architectures are evolutionary instances of the recruitment of FAAL-like domains for PKS/NRPS-independent functions.</p><p>Interestingly, unique domain architectures are found in FAAL-like domain-containing proteins of fungi and animals, the majority of which are largely PKS/NRPS-free systems. In these organisms, two tandemly fused FAAL-like domains are found at the C-terminus and a DMAP-1-binding domain at the N-terminus of a highly conserved protein. These proteins are annotated and characterized as the virulent factor CPS1 in few fungal pathogens such as <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang, 2016</xref>), <italic>Cochliobolus heterostrophus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu, 2003</xref>), and <italic>Coccidioides posadasii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Narra, 2016</xref>). Therefore, they are proposed as a target for potential fungicides and as a vaccine candidate in plant and animal pathogens, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Narra, 2016</xref>). In invertebrates and vertebrates, these are known as DIP2 and are important for proper axon bifurcation and guidance, suggesting their physiological importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nitta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Noblett, 2019</xref>). Recently, we showed that the mice lacking one of the eukaryotic FAAL-like proteins, DIP2A, show a diet-dependent growth anomaly such as obesity pointing to their importance in eukaryotic lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kinatukara, 2020</xref>). The precise molecular and biochemical details of these proteins are yet to be elucidated. Given the extent of sequence divergence in various motifs of eukaryotic FAAL-like domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3a–d</xref>), it is difficult to predict the processes they may be involved in. However, the presence of several elements of the CoA-rejection mechanism and their close identity to FAALs allow us to put forth the hypothesis that eukaryotic FAAL-like domains were recruited for their high acceptor-fidelity property. It is also possible that these divergences have some functional relevance in the context of eukaryotic metabolism, which may represent an additional member in the spectrum of biochemical activities represented in the ANL superfamily.</p><p>The current work identifying FAAL-like enzymology using a universal CoA rejection mechanism may form the platform for further studies to delineate why they have been recruited in fungal and animal systems. The study provides new structural and sequence attributes to confirm the identity of FAALs, many of which remain misannotated and uncharacterized. The study opens new avenues in combinatorial engineering of PKS/NRPS by using FAALs as a unique module to load fatty acids or use preexisting knowledge to engineer them to load unique molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2018</xref>) with exceptional fidelity. Thus, FAALs can be exploited to produce novel bioactive molecules by virtue of their unique acceptor-fidelity property.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cloning, expression, and purification of proteins</title><p><italic>Ec</italic>FAAL (A0A0H2VDD9), <italic>Ec</italic>ACP (A0A2X1NC35), <italic>Ec</italic>FACL (P69451), <italic>Ms</italic>FAAL32 (A0R618), <italic>Ms</italic>PKS13 (A0R617; 1–1042 residues), <italic>Rs</italic>FAAL (Q8XRP4), <italic>Rs</italic>ACP (Q8XRP0), <italic>Af</italic>FACL (O30147), <italic>Mx</italic>FAAL (Q1CXX0), <italic>Mx</italic>ACP (Q1CXW9), and <italic>Mt</italic>FACL13 (P9WQ37) were amplified by PCR from their respective genomic DNA using Phusion polymerase (Thermo Scientific) using specific primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This study addresses the structural basis of the ability of fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAAL) to exclude condensation of activated fatty acids with coenzyme-A and facilitate the reaction with other 4-phosphopantetheine linked acceptors. This issue is of significant interest with regard to understanding how certain fatty acids are channelled to specific metabolic fates. This work will contribute significantly to our current knowledge of how distinct classes of enzymes divert fatty acids to virulent lipids in mycobacteria, and it will be more broadly of interest for metabolic engineering.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A universal pocket in FAALs ensures redirection of fatty acid pool away from CoA-based activation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Satish K. Nair (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. In your manuscript you have highlighted a number of residues within the putative binding site for the 4'-pantatheine moieties in the FAAL enzymes that likely preclude the binding of this portion of the substrate. You have subsequently mutated these residues in the FAAL enzymes from three different organisms and have shown in certain instances that the mutated enzymes are now able to functionally activate CoA (Figure 2c). For example, why does the F284A/M233A mutant of MsFAAL32 function so differently than the corresponding mutant of RsFAAL? You need to explain why some of the FAALs behaved differently than others.</p><p>2. You have provided further support for the inability of the apparent canonical site in the FAAL enzymes to be functional by mutating the residues within the active sites of certain FACL enzymes to the bulkier ones found in the FAAL enzymes. Many of the constructs resulted in the loss of function and their ability to activate CoA. However, the loss of function was not uniform across the three FACL enzymes chosen. For example, the A276F/A232M mutant of AfFACL is devoid of CoA activity, but the corresponding mutants of MtFACL13 and EcFACL are fully functional. You need to explain why some of the FACLs behaved differently than others.</p><p>3. The discussion on the evolution of this system needs to be improved. You should enhance your discussion by looking at the genomic neighborhoods of bacterial FAALs for the presence of PKS/NRPS gene clusters. This analysis would bolster some of the evolutionary claims.</p><p>4. It is imperative that the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes be shown as chemical structures for substrates and products (ChemDraw).</p><p>5. There are a number of references (see reviewer #3) that should be included.</p><p>6. The experimental details for some of the reactions are missing or quite difficult to find. For example, what is the specific fatty acid that is used in your assays?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript would have been significantly enhanced if further structural evidence for the newly identified binding pocket in the FAAL enzymes could have been obtained. My suggestion is that the authors use 4-phosphopantetheine itself as an additional substrate for their gain- and loss-of-function mutants and they also use this compound in crystallization trials with the FAAL enzymes to ascertain whether or not the new putative binding site is real or not.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would endorse publication pending a stronger analysis to bolster the evolutionary claims made by the authors. With this additional information, this would be a strong publication that would inform across the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I got confused by some of the language, maybe it is just me, the other reviewers may be OK. e.g. Line 46 &quot;they completely lack acceptor promiscuity&quot;….please change this to they display a narrow substrate preference for holo-ACP and not CoASH.</p><p>Please start the paper with a chemical, stepwise pathway – e.g. use ChemDraw – to draw out the steps as I described above.</p><p>A new review I like which the authors MUST cite is by Winn et al., Harnessing and engineering amide bond forming ligases for the synthesis of amides.

In your manuscript you have highlighted a number of residues within the putative binding site for the 4'-pantatheine moieties in the FAAL enzymes that likely preclude the binding of this portion of the substrate. You have subsequently mutated these residues in the FAAL enzymes from three different organisms and have shown in certain instances that the mutated enzymes are now able to functionally activate CoA (Figure 2c). For example, why does the F284A/M233A mutant of MsFAAL32 function so differently than the corresponding mutant of RsFAAL? You need to explain why some of the FAALs behaved differently than others.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for providing us the opportunity to clarify why there are differences in the performance of different mutants of FAALs.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>A snapshot of residues (stick representation) in FAALs at 4-5 Å distance from Coenzyme A (black colour outlined in red) bound to <italic>Se</italic>ACS (PDB: 1PG4)<bold>.</bold></title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70067-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>A tabulation of residues in representative FAALs at 4-5 Å distance from Coenzyme A bound to <italic>Se</italic>ACS (PDB: 1PG4).</title><p>The stick representation of CoA (yellow) is shown along the table with the entry of the pocket and active site marked.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70067-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Here, we present a comparative analysis of canonical CoA-binding sites by structural superposition of the N-terminal domains of FAALs (<italic>Mt</italic>FAAL28, 3E53; <italic>Ms</italic>FAAL32, 5ICR; <italic>Ec</italic>FAAL, 3PBK; <italic>Rs</italic>FAAL, homology model generated using MODELLER) with the N-terminal domains of coenzyme A-bound FACLs (<italic>Hs</italic>FACL, 3EQ6 and <italic>Se</italic>ACS, 1PG4).

However, the ability to form acyl-CoA is also dependent on how well the 4'-phosphopantetheine arm is accommodated and poised for catalysis. The effect of variations in residues of the pocket can alter the accommodation of the incoming 4'-phosphopantetheine arm, which is difficult to predict. Such variations of residues in the pocket may possibly allow differential accommodation of 4'-phosphopantetheine arm.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>A snapshot of residues (stick representation) in <italic>Ms</italic>FAAL32 (blue) and <italic>Rs</italic>FAAL (cyan) at 4-5 Å distance from Coenzyme A (black colour outlined in red) bound to <italic>Se</italic>ACS (PDB: 1PG4).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70067-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In the case of the specific mutation pointed out by the referee, F284A/M233A in <italic>Ms</italic>FAAL32 (blue) and F265A/M217A in <italic>Rs</italic>FAAL (cyan), the residues adjacent to these sites are those which show variability.

Therefore, the differences in orientations of 4'-phosphopantetheine arm entering the pocket arising from subtle variations in the pocket could be responsible for the differences in activity of a common site mutation in different FAALs.</p><p>We have now added a summary of the explanation on page-12. The tabulation of residues is now included in the supplementary file-5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. You have provided further support for the inability of the apparent canonical site in the FAAL enzymes to be functional by mutating the residues within the active sites of certain FACL enzymes to the bulkier ones found in the FAAL enzymes. Many of the constructs resulted in the loss of function and their ability to activate CoA. However, the loss of function was not uniform across the three FACL enzymes chosen. For example, the A276F/A232M mutant of AfFACL is devoid of CoA activity, but the corresponding mutants of MtFACL13 and EcFACL are fully functional. You need to explain why some of the FACLs behaved differently than others.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for pointing out this aspect, and similar to the earlier question, this aspect is also now addressed elaborately.</p><p>The likely reason for the differential activity in FACLs is same as described in the earlier question. We performed structural superposition of the N-terminal domains of FACLs (<italic>Hs</italic>FACL, 3EQ6; <italic>Se</italic>ACS, 1PG4; <italic>Mt</italic>FACL13, 3R44; <italic>Af</italic>FACL, 3G7S; <italic>Ec</italic>FACL, homology model from AlphaFold Protein Structure Database) to identify residues from these FACLs in the vicinity (&lt; 4.5 Å) of 4'-phosphopantetheine arm. The residues from different FACLs surrounding the 4'-phosphopantetheine arm in the crystal structures of <italic>Hs</italic>FACL (3EQ6) and <italic>Se</italic>ACS (1PG4), are tabulated in Supplementary file 5A.</p><p>The tabulation of residues reveals that unlike FAALs, FACLs have even greater number of divergent residues lining the CoA-binding site. It indicates that accommodation of CoA within the site is likely to be quite different for different FACLs, which is further supported by the different conformations of CoA in the multiple crystal structures of CoA-bound FACLs (Figure 5—Figure Supplement 1a). Thus, the effect of such variations in accommodating the incoming 4'-phosphopantetheine arm possibly plays a role in orienting the CoA differently leading to differential activity.</p><p>We have now added a summary of the explanation in page12.

You should enhance your discussion by looking at the genomic neighborhoods of bacterial FAALs for the presence of PKS/NRPS gene clusters. This analysis would bolster some of the evolutionary claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion of the reviewer, and such an analysis has been carried out by multiple groups for several PKS/NRPS biosynthetic clusters that produce important metabolites. We have collected all the available literature where FAALs have been shown to be important for the biosynthesis of those bioactive metabolites. It is important to note here that not all FAALs from bacteria are in the genomic neighborhoods of a PKS/NRPS cluster. They are sometimes associated with a stand-alone acyl carrier protein domain or fused to other domains such as dehydrogenases, acyl transferases, reductases etc. The known examples of these are seen in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> (J Mol Biol. 2011;406(2):313-24).</p><p>The information is tabulated and included as a supplementary file-3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The experimental details for some of the reactions are missing or quite difficult to find. For example, what is the specific fatty acid that is used in your assays?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for pointing this out. The experimental methodology is rewritten with detailing the specific compositions as follows:</p><p>Acyl-CoA formation assay: The acyl-CoA formation assay involves separation of the products on a thin-layer chromatography, which are then detected using 1-<sup>14</sup>C labelled fatty acids. 5 μM of enzyme was used for both FAALs and FACLs except <italic>Mx</italic>FAAL and <italic>Rs</italic>FAAL where 7.5 μM was used. The reaction was carried out in a 15 μL reaction volume with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 8 mM MgCl2, 176 μM fatty acid and 24 μM 1-<sup>14</sup>C fatty acid. Lauric acid (C12) was used for all enzymes except MsFAAL32 where palmitic acid (C16) was used as the substrate. 2 mM CoASH was included for assessing the formation of acyl-CoA (product of second step) and omitted in reactions where acyl-AMP (product of first step) was assessed. 2 mM ATP was used to initiate the reaction and incubated at 30°C for 15 min on the water bath. The reaction was quenched using 5 μL of 10% acetic acid. The entire 20 μL reaction mixture was directly spotted on a silica gel 60 F<sub>254</sub> TLC plate and allowed to dry for 2 hours. Subsequently the products were resolved using n-butanol/acetic acid/water (80:25:40; v/v) solvent system at 4°C. The TLC was quantified by densitometry using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad; version 5.2.1) after scanning the phosphorimage plate exposed for 12-15 hrs. The intensity of each band was quantified as a fraction of total radioactivity in the given lane. Each reaction was in triplicates and the mean for each band intensity was calculated. The percentage of acyl-AMP converted to acyl-CoA was used in the plot.</p><p>Acyl-ACP formation assay: The acyl-ACP formation assay involved the identification of the acyl-ACP on a modified radio-Urea PAGE using 1-<sup>14</sup>C labelled fatty acids. The protein concentrations for the pair of FAAL and ACP were 1 μM:20 μM of EcFAAL:EcACP, 5 μM:20 μM of RsFAAL:RsACP and 4 μM:8 μM of MxFAAL:MxACP. The reaction was carried out in a 15 μL reaction volume in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) Tween-20, 0.003% DMSO and 9 μM 1-<sup>14</sup>C fatty acid. Lauric acid (C12) was used for all enzymes. In case of MxFAAL and RsFAAL, DMSO was omitted and 50mM Tris (pH 8.0) was used as the buffer in the reaction. 2 mM ATP was used to initiate the reaction and incubated at 30°C for 2 hours on water bath. The reaction was quenched by adding an equal volume of 2X loading buffer containing 25 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 1.25 M urea, 20% glycerol and 0.08% Bromophenol blue. The entire 30 μL reaction mixture was then loaded to 15% PAGE containing 2.5 M urea. In the case of MsFAAL32:MsPKS13∆C, a protein concentration of 1 μM:12.5 μM was used along with all reaction components identical to others except that 1-<sup>14</sup>C palmitic acid (C16) was used. MsFAAL32:MsPKS13∆C reactions were assayed using 8% SDS-PAGE, run at 125 V in the cold room. Gels were dried using gel drier and exposed to phosphor imager screen overnight.</p><p>We have rewritten our Materials and methods section to include specific information as indicated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript would have been significantly enhanced if further structural evidence for the newly identified binding pocket in the FAAL enzymes could have been obtained.

We agree with reviewer that the ACPs have a negatively charged surface which could dock on the positively charged patch near the canonical binding site as seen in the crystal structures of the A-domain: ACP complexes. However, the absence of the positive patch in FAALs rules out the possibility of such a docking and moreover the canonical site is blocked. Therefore, it becomes difficult to place the 4'-phosphopantetheine in the new site if the ACPs were docked in the canonical site. The approach of ACP against this new pocket is still unknown and requires further investigation. Moreover, the analysis will be further complicated because it is unclear how the C-terminal domain of FAAL is going to be oriented when the ACP docks against this new pocket. Therefore, our submission is that it is extremely difficult to predict the interface residues or mapping the mutations against the ACP in this study. This would require experimental data like structure of the complex etc. which will be a focus of our future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is quite a long conclusion which covers evolution and origin of diversity – this should be edited.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the suggestion, we have modified the Discussion section on pages 12, 13 and 14.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, I think this could be a useful and interesting paper to the field once it is has been edited and over hauled.</p><p>Please focus on explaining the biochemical data in a much clearer way.</p><p>I suggest accept after major changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the observations and suggestions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
