cytoskeletal dynamics during cell migration. Adhesion activates phosphorylation of integrin-associated signaling proteins, including Cas (p130Cas, BCAR1), by Src-family kinases. Cas regulates leading-edge protrusion and migration in cooperation with its binding partner, BCAR3. However, it has been unclear how Cas and BCAR3 cooperate. Here, using normal epithelial cells, we find that BCAR3 localization to integrin adhesions requires Cas. In return, Cas phosphorylation, as well as lamellipodia dynamics and cell migration, requires BCAR3. These functions require the BCAR3 SH2 domain and a specific phosphorylation site, Tyr 117, that is also required for BCAR3 downregulation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These findings place BCAR3 in a co-regulatory positive-feedback circuit with Cas, with BCAR3 requiring Cas for localization and Cas requiring BCAR3 for activation and downstream signaling. The use of a single phosphorylation site in BCAR3 for activation and degradation ensures reliable negative feedback by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>phosphotyrosine</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steenkiste</surname><given-names>Elizabeth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM109463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steenkiste</surname><given-names>Elizabeth M</given-names></name><name><surname>Berndt</surname><given-names>Jason D</given-names></name><name><surname>Pilling</surname><given-names>Carissa</given-names></name><name><surname>Simpkins</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Jonathan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA015704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steenkiste</surname><given-names>Elizabeth M</given-names></name><name><surname>Berndt</surname><given-names>Jason D</given-names></name><name><surname>Pilling</surname><given-names>Carissa</given-names></name><name><surname>Simpkins</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Jonathan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Epithelial cells coordinate integrin signaling with protrusion via a two-protein module, with one protein defining localization and downstream signaling, the other serving as a phosphorylation switch and providing negative feedback.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animal cells migrate by adhesive crawling or amoeboid blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Trepat et al., 2012</xref>). During crawling, transmembrane receptors called integrins provide attachment to the extracellular matrix and organize the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bachir et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Legate et al., 2009</xref>). Integrin engagement stimulates protrusion of a dynamic leading lamellipodium. Inside the lamellipodium, rearward flowing actin engages with integrin-associated proteins such as talin and vinculin, forming catch bonds, clustering the integrins, and recruiting additional regulatory and scaffold proteins to form transient structures called nascent adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Case and Waterman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">del Rio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galbraith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Partridge and Marcantonio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Puklin-Faucher and Sheetz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>). Most nascent adhesions are short-lived, but some mature into focal adhesions at the base of the lamellipodium, anchoring actin stress fibers and resisting the rearward actin flow to increase lamellipodium protrusion. While many aspects of cell migration can be explained by biomechanics, integrin adhesions also activate biochemical signaling molecules, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src-family kinases (SFKs), and small GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burridge et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyamoto et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schaller et al., 1992</xref>). Some FAK and SFK-dependent phosphorylations regulate adhesion assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pasapera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stutchbury et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2007</xref>), while others coordinate adhesion with lamellipodium dynamics and other aspects of cell biology, such as cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitra and Schlaepfer, 2006</xref>).</p><p>One important adhesion-regulated signaling protein is Cas (Crk-associated substrate, also called p130Cas or BCAR1), which plays critical roles in lamellipodium protrusion, membrane ruffling, adhesion assembly, adhesion turnover, resistance to anoikis, and malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Honda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanders and Basson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sharma and Mayer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Webb et al., 2004</xref>; reviews: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Defilippi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tikhmyanova et al., 2010</xref>). Cas is activated when SFKs catalyze tyrosine phosphorylation (pY) of multiple YxxP sites in an unstructured region near the N terminus, known as the ‘substrate domain’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> for a diagram of Cas structure). Phosphorylation recruits adaptor proteins Crk and CrkL together with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), C3G and DOCK180, that activate Rap1 and Rac1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fonseca et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hasegawa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiyokawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klemke et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakai et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakai et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tanaka et al., 1994</xref>). After activation, Rap1 increases talin recruitment to integrins to promote adhesion maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boettner and Van Aelst, 2009</xref>), while Rac1 stimulates polymerization of branched actin structures by WAVE, leading to lamellipodial protrusion and ruffling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheresh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeMali et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ridley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ridley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stradal et al., 2004</xref>). Cas also stimulates focal adhesion turnover as the cell moves forwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ren et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rottner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Webb et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, Cas is part of a self-reinforcing cycle in which actin polymerization stimulates Cas phosphorylation, which leads to more actin polymerization, lamellipodium protrusion, membrane ruffling, and focal adhesion turnover.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CRL5 regulates BCAR3 protein turnover.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cas and BCAR3 structures.

Cas phosphorylation requires integrin-dependent actin polymerization and an intact actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vuori et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vuori and Ruoslahti, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). In vitro, Cas phosphorylation by SFKs is increased when the substrate domain is physically extended, suggesting that Cas may be a mechanosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hotta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sawada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tamada et al., 2004</xref>). Cas contains N- and C-terminal domains that associate with integrin adhesions and could be involved in extending the substrate domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braniš et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harte et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamoto et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nojima et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vuori and Ruoslahti, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). At the N terminus, an SH3 domain binds adhesion proteins vinculin and FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harte et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janoštiak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Polte and Hanks, 1995</xref>), while at the C-terminus, a CCH domain binds to adhesion proteins paxillin and ajuba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pratt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yi et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, the Cas SH3 domain binds to N-WASP via FAK, and N-WASP stimulates actin polymerization and Cas phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kostic and Sheetz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, Cas may be activated by actin flow or when the substrate domain is extended by forces acting on the Cas N- and C-terminal domains.</p><p>Cas is also subject to negative feedback. Phosphorylation of a YDYV sequence near the CCH domain mediates pY-Cas degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>). This phosphosite binds to the SH2 domain of SOCS6 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 6), recruiting CRL5 (Cullin 5-RING-ligase) and targeting Cas to the ubiquitin-proteasome system. SOCS6 co-localizes with pY-Cas in adhesions at the leading edge of migrating cells where it inhibits adhesion disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Teckchandani and Cooper, 2016</xref>). Mutation of the YDYV sequence or knockdown of SOCS6 or the CRL5 scaffold, Cullin 5 (Cul5), stabilizes Cas and increases adhesion disassembly, lamellipodia protrusion and ruffling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Teckchandani and Cooper, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, while YxxP phosphorylation activates Cas, YDYV phosphorylation provides negative feedback, restraining leading edge dynamics and stabilizing adhesions.</p><p>Cas receives additional regulatory input from NSP family proteins, including BCAR3 (breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 3, also called AND-34, NSP2, Sh2d3b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wallez et al., 2012</xref>). Cas forms a complex with BCAR3, with the Cas CCH domain bound to a CDC25H domain in BCAR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). BCAR3 and Cas cooperate in many biological assays, with each protein requiring the other. For example, BCAR3 increases Cas phosphorylation and Cas-dependent membrane ruffling, adhesion disassembly, cell migration, cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cross et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Riggins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roselli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schrecengost et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schuh et al., 2010</xref>). Like Cas, BCAR3 protects estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells from inhibitory actions of anti-estrogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Agthoven et al., 1998</xref>). However, it remains unclear how Cas and BCAR3 cooperate. Several lines of evidence suggest that BCAR3 may be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. First, it contains an SH2 domain that binds pY proteins, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oh et al., 2008</xref>) and PTPRA (RPTPα), a protein phosphatase that activates SFKs and Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">von Wichert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>). Second, BCAR3 tyrosine phosphorylation is stimulated by adhesion or serum, although the significance of the phosphorylation is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 1999</xref>). These studies suggest that BCAR3 interacts with tyrosine kinases and is phosphorylated, but leave open whether BCAR3 phosphorylation is involved in Cas activation.</p><p>Here, we report that we detected BCAR3 in a screen for pY proteins that are down-regulated by CRL5 and the proteasome. We identified BCAR3 Y117 as a phosphorylation site that recruits SOCS6 and leads to CRL5-dependent degradation. In addition, we found that BCAR3 is needed for single-cell migration and invasion, and for the increased lamellipodial ruffling and collective migration of Cul5-deficient cells. Using gene silencing and mutant analysis, we find that Cas localizes to adhesions independent of BCAR3 but BCAR3 localization to adhesions requires association with Cas. In the adhesion, BCAR3 activates SFKs, Cas phosphorylation, membrane ruffling and cell migration, dependent on both Y117 and the SH2 domain. BCAR3 and Cas thus form a signaling hub that localizes to active integrins and coordinates actin dynamics under negative control by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CRL5 regulates BCAR3 protein turnover</title><p>We previously reported that CRL5 inhibits Src activity and Src-dependent transformation of MCF10A epithelial cells, in part by targeting pY proteins such as pY-Cas for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>). Because overexpression of Cas alone did not phenocopy CRL5 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>), we infer that CRL5 down-regulates additional pY proteins that become limiting when Cas is over-expressed. We sought to identify such pY proteins by screening for pY peptides whose abundance increases when Cul5 is inhibited. To this end, control and Cul5-deficient MCF10A cells were lysed under denaturing conditions, proteins were digested with trypsin, and peptides were labeled with isobaric TMT tags for quantitative pY proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). In one experiment, samples were prepared from control and Cul5-deficient cells that were starved for epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 0, 24, or 72 hr. Starvation time had no systematic effect on peptide abundance, so, in a second experiment, we prepared biological triplicate samples from growing control and Cul5-deficient cells. Sixteen pY peptides increased significantly in Cul5-deficient cells in both experiments, including pY128 from Cas and pY117 and pY266 from BCAR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary File 1</xref>).

However, RNA levels were unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), consistent with altered protein synthesis or degradation.

These results suggest that CRL5 regulates BCAR3 turnover by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that the increase in BCAR3 pY117 and pY266 in Cul5-deficient cells is likely due to an increased availability of BCAR3 protein for phosphorylation rather than, or in addition to, an increase in kinase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>BCAR3 regulates epithelial cell migration</title><p>BCAR3 is required for the migration of cancer cells and fibroblasts in single-cell assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cross et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schrecengost et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sun et al., 2012</xref>) but its importance in single and collective epithelial cell migration is unknown.

We considered that BCAR3 may activate Cas. To monitor Cas activity, we used antibodies to pY165, one of the repeated YxxP motifs in Cas that recruit Crk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fonseca et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakai et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Songyang et al., 1993</xref>). Cas pY165 in leading edge adhesions was abolished by SFK inhibition or Cas depletion, consistent with Cas activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, Cas activity was inhibited when BCAR3 was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2a</xref>). As expected, BCAR3<sup>WT</sup> and BCAR3<sup>F4</sup> rescued Cas activity in BCAR3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a,c</xref>). However, Cas activity was not rescued by BCAR3<sup>Y117F</sup>, BCAR3<sup>R177K</sup>, or BCAR3<sup>EE</sup>, even though Cas was still present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). Cas activation in adhesions correlated with the rescue of ruffling and migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). This suggests that BCAR3 not only has to be bound to Cas but also needs Y117 and its SH2 domain to activate Cas and promote downstream signaling. To test whether BCAR3 activates Cas specifically or phosphorylation more generally, we also stained for FAK pY397 and pY861. The former is a FAK autophosphorylation site and the latter is phosphorylated by SFKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitra and Schlaepfer, 2006</xref>). We found that BCAR3 depletion did not inhibit FAK autophosphorylation at pY397 but did inhibit FAK pY861 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2b and c</xref>), consistent with a general role of BCAR3 in stimulating SFKs in adhesions. Taken together, these results suggest that BCAR3 is brought to integrin adhesions by binding to Cas, where it uses its Y117 and SH2 domain to activate SFKs, Cas and downstream signaling, leading to lamellipodial ruffling and migration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cell migration requires biophysical and biochemical signaling between the leading edge and adhesion complexes to coordinate adhesion dynamics with actin polymerization, anchorage of stress fibers and generation of traction forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Trepat et al., 2012</xref>). Our results address one aspect of this complicated process: the linkage between integrin engagement and lamellipodial extension. Previous studies have found that Cas and BCAR3 synergize for lamellipodium ruffing and cell migration, but they also synergized for protein expression, making the mechanism unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cross et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Riggins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schrecengost et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wallez et al., 2014</xref>). Here, using loss-of-function approaches, we find that there is positive feedback between Cas and BCAR3 phosphorylation, and dual negative feedback on both proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.</p><p>Our results support a multi-step model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). First, Cas associates with active integrin adhesion complexes near the leading edge of migrating cells through localization signals in its N and C termini. Next, BCAR3 is recruited to adhesions by Cas. Since most BCAR3 in the cell is complexed with Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cross et al., 2016</xref>), the two proteins are likely recruited jointly, via localization signals on Cas. BCAR3 then stimulates SFKs and Cas phosphorylation in a mechanism that requires BCAR3 SH2 and Y117 but not four other phosphorylation sites. Cas phosphorylation then drives membrane ruffling, presumably utilizing the well-documented mechanisms involving Crk, DOCK180, and Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheresh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klemke et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakai et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanders and Basson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schaller and Parsons, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sharma and Mayer, 2008</xref>). Thus, the BCAR3 Y117 and SH2 provide a critical switch to activate Cas. Our results also suggest that phosphorylation at Y117 promotes SOCS6 binding and targets BCAR3 for ubiquitination and degradation by the CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase. pY-Cas is similarly targeted by CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> binding to its pYDYV motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>). Ubiquitination of Cas likely occurs within the adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Teckchandani and Cooper, 2016</xref>), and BCAR3 may also be ubiquitinated in the adhesion. Ubiquitination and degradation of either protein is expected to terminate signaling until new Cas and BCAR3 molecules are recruited from the cytosol, providing double insurance against excess activity.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model showing inter-dependence of Cas and BCAR3 for localization and activation.</title><p>Step 1: A pre-formed BCAR3-Cas complex translocates to integrin adhesions through localization signals in the N and C terminal domains of Cas. Step 2: BCAR3, phosphorylated at Y117 by an unknown kinase, stimulates Cas phosphorylation in a process that also requires the SH2 domain, leading to activation of signaling pathways that stimulate lamellipodial protrusion and ruffling. Step 3: Signaling is terminated by the CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup>-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of BCAR3 and Cas, phosphorylated in their respective phosphodegrons. Remaining questions include the identity of the kinase that phosphorylates BCAR3 Y117, the timing of Y117 phosphorylation, and the mechanism by which BCAR3 pY117 and SH2 domain stimulate Cas phosphorylation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67078-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Where is Y117 phosphorylated and how does it activate SFKs? We have been unable to generate a phospho-specific antibody with the sensitivity and specificity to localize pY117 BCAR3 in cells. However, we suspect that phosphorylation may occur in adhesions, because BCAR3<sup>EE</sup>, which does not localize to adhesions, is not subject to pY117-dependent turnover by CRL5. After Y117 is phosphorylated, we infer that BCAR3 activates SFKs in adhesions to phosphorylate Cas and FAK. Indeed, previous studies reported SFK activation by BCAR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Riggins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schuh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). One potential mechanism involves pY-PTPRA binding to the BCAR3 SH2 domain and bringing the BCAR3-Cas complex to adhesions where Cas is phosphorylated by SFKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Since PTPRA is able to activate SFKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ponniah et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Su et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>), this is an attractive model. However, in our studies, the BCAR3 SH2 domain is not needed to localize either BCAR3 or Cas, suggesting that Cas-BCAR3 would bring PTPRA to adhesions rather than vice versa. In addition, PTPRA depletion does not inhibit Cas Y165 phosphorylation (data not shown). An alternative is that pY117 binds the SH2 domain of an SFK or an unidentified protein that activates SFKs. The Y117 sequence is conserved across vertebrates and a homologous residue is present in Shep1, a second NSP family protein that activates Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roselli et al., 2010</xref>). However, the sequence does not suggest which SH2 domain may bind other than SOCS6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krebs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simó and Cooper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zadjali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The presence of a positively charged residue two residues after the phosphosite is predicted to inhibit binding to SFKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Songyang et al., 1993</xref>). Therefore, pY117 may bind another SH2 protein that activates SFKs, or may stimulate Cas phosphorylation by an allosteric mechanism or by altering binding to other charged molecules, such as membrane phospholipids.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Sequence alignment of SOCS6-binding sites.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th>Protein</th><th>Residue</th><th>Sequence<sup>*</sup></th><th align="center" colspan="3">Evidence (reference)</th></tr><tr valign="top"><th/><th/><th/><th>peptide†</th><th>mutant‡</th><th>biology<sup>§</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Kit</td><td>pY568</td><td><monospace>gnn<underline><bold>Y</bold></underline><bold>VYI</bold>dptq</monospace></td><td>(1,2)</td><td>(1)</td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>PDGFR</td><td>pY579</td><td><monospace>ghe<underline><bold>Y</bold></underline><bold>IYV</bold>dpmq</monospace></td><td>(2)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Flt3</td><td>pY591</td><td><monospace>eyf<underline><bold>Y</bold></underline><bold>V</bold>d<bold>F</bold>reye</monospace></td><td>(3)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(3)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Flt3</td><td>pY919</td><td><monospace>eei<underline><bold>Y</bold></underline><bold>I</bold>i<bold>M</bold>qscw</monospace> </td><td>(3)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(3)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Cas</td><td>pY664</td><td><monospace>med<underline><bold>Y</bold></underline>d<bold>YV</bold>hlqg</monospace></td><td/><td>(4)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Dab1</td><td>pY198</td><td><monospace>dpv<underline><bold>Y</bold></underline>q<bold>YI</bold>vfea</monospace> </td><td/><td>(5)</td><td>(5-6)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>BCAR3</td><td>pY117</td><td><monospace>tve<underline><bold>Y</bold></underline><bold>V</bold>k<bold>F</bold>sker</monospace></td><td/><td>(7)</td><td>(7)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Spot array¶</td><td/><td><monospace>xxx<underline><bold>Y</bold></underline><bold>VYI</bold>xxxx</monospace> <break/><monospace>xxx<bold>YIFF</bold>xxxx</monospace> <break/><monospace>xxx<bold>YMWM</bold>xxxx</monospace> <break/><monospace>xxx<bold>YWVV</bold>xxxx</monospace></td><td>(8)</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>* Local sequence aligned to phosphotyrosine (Y).

This means that BCAR3 activation triggers BCAR3 degradation in a negative feedback loop.

Mutating the SOCS-binding site in BCAR3 or Dab1 generates a non-functional protein that accumulates at higher level.

Post-translational regulation of protein degradation means that BCAR3 protein levels may not correlate with RNA levels in patient samples. In addition to the phosphorylation-dependent mechanism investigated here, a previous study showed that TGFβ stimulates proteasomal degradation of BCAR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2014</xref>), and over-expressed BCAR3 and Cas appear to stabilize each other in breast cancer cells, dependent on their mutual binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wallez et al., 2014</xref>). Changes in BCAR3 protein stability or phosphorylation state might influence BCAR3 activity in patients, but such regulation at the protein level might not be accounted for when correlating patient outcomes with gene expression. Thus, further study is required to understand mechanisms of BCAR3 regulation and how mis-regulation may contribute to disease progression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>pMXpuroII and pMXpuroII-shCul5 plasmids were made as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>). pLKO.1-nontarget small hairpin RNA (shRNA) control vector (SHC002) and pLKO.1-shSOCS6 (TRCN0000284351) were purchased (Sigma Aldrich). pCAG-T7-mSOCS1, pCAG-T7-mSOCS2, pCAG-T7-mSOCS3, pCAG-T7-mSOCS4, pCAG-T7-mSOCS5, pCAG-T7-mSOCS6, pCAG-T7-mSOCS7, and pCAG-T7-mCisH were made as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simó and Cooper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>).

Proteins were reduced, alkylated and digested with trypsin as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Peptide labeling with iTRAQ reagents (TMT 6plex, Themo Fisher Scientific) was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using 400 μg of each sample. After reaction, the six samples were combined and concentrated under vacuum. For immunoprecipitation, protein G agrarose (60 μl, Millipore) was incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (12 μg 4G10 [Millipore], 12 μg PT66 [Sigma] and 12 μg PY100 [Cell Signaling Technology] for 8 hr at 4°C with rotation, then washed with 400 μl IP buffer [100 mM Tris HCl, 100 mM NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4]). The TMT-labeled peptides were resuspended in 400 μl IP buffer and pH adjusted to 7.4, then mixed with the antibody-conjugated protein G agarose overnight at 4°C with rotation.

The parameters for full scan MS were: resolution of 70,000 across 350–2000 <italic>m/z</italic>, AGC 3e<sup>6</sup>, and maximum IT 50 ms. The full MS scan was followed by MS/MS for the top 10 precursor ions in each cycle with a NCE of 34 and dynamic exclusion of 30 s. Raw mass spectral files (.raw) were searched using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo) and Mascot version 2.4.1 (Matrix Science). Mascot search parameters were: 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions; 15 mmu for fragment ion mass tolerance; two missed cleavages of trypsin; fixed modifications were carbamidomethylation of cysteine and TMT 6plex modification of lysines and peptide N-termini; variable modifications were methionine oxidation, tyrosine, serine, and threonine phosphorylation. TMT quantification was obtained using Proteome Discoverer and isotopically corrected per manufacturer’s directions, and normalized to the mean relative protein quantification ratios obtained from the total protein analysis (0.2% of the unbound peptides from the phosphotyrosine peptide immunoprecipitation). Mascot peptide identifications, phosphorylation site assignments and quantification were verified manually with the assistance of CAMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curran et al., 2013</xref>).

A mixture of 50 pmol siRNA, 1.25 μl Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Optimem medium (Invitrogen) was added to the newly plated MCF10A cells and left for the cells to attach overnight. The next day the media was changed to fresh growth media. A second siRNA transfection was done 48 hr after the first transfection using the same protocol scaled up to use a six-well plate (125 pmol siRNA) or scaled down to use a 96-well plate (for migration assays). One day later, cells from the six-well dish were transferred to 4-well plates containing 12 mm coverslips for microscopy, or 12-well plates for protein analysis.

Using the threshold tool on ImageJ, paxillin-containing adhesions were identified and mean intensity of SNAP or other antigens (pY-Cas, Cas, pY397-FAK, pY-861-FAK and paxillin) was measured. The relative abundance of each antigen in adhesions was calculated by dividing the mean antigen intensity by the mean intensity of paxillin. Because expression of SNAP-V5-BCAR3 varied slightly cell by cell, we corrected for expression level as follows. SNAP intensity was measured in the leading edge adhesions (SNAP<sub>ad</sub>) and rear (SNAP<sub>rear</sub>) of dox-induced cells and in non-induced cells (SNAP<sub>bg</sub>). Corrected SNAP intensity in adhesions (SNAP<sub>ad</sub>-SNAP<sub>bg</sub>)/(SNAP<sub>rear</sub>-SNAP<sub>bg</sub>) was divided by the mean paxillin intensity.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are most grateful to Forest White for advice on quantitative phosphotyrosine proteomics and Amanda Del Rosario of the Koch Institute Proteomics Core for running the analysis.

It sheds new light on the regulation and function of a signaling network comprised of the adaptor molecules Cas and BCAR3 that functions to control cell motility. The quite complex data presented in the manuscript are generated through rigorous experimentation, frequently with the use of multiple approaches to arrive at the strong stated conclusions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A Cas-BCAR3 co-regulatory circuit controls lamellipodia dynamics&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Sheetz (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study focuses on the formation of adaptor protein complexes at adhesion sites and their links to in vitro membrane ruffling and cell movement. Specifically, the authors study the role of the adaptor BCAR3 protein which is regulated by post-translational mechanisms (ubiquitin degradation and tyrosine phosphorylation). Experiments are generally performed using transiently-transfected MCF10A or Hela cells to knock down (mainly via siRNA) or over-express tagged proteins. Using proteomics, a new phosphorylation site was identified (BCAR3 Y117) under conditions of pervanadate stimulation or in EGF-containing MCF10A growth media. Mutagenesis showed that BCAR3 Y117 is potentially important for enhancement of in vitro cell movement under conditions where the cullin-5 E3 ligase has also been reduced by siRNA expression. The authors propose a &quot;co-regulatory&quot; model whereby the recruitment of BCAR3 to adhesions acts to modulate p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation and cell migration.</p><p>If the case is strengthened as suggested below, would extend our understanding of molecular regulation of cell migration and should be of interest to cell and cancer biologists. The data are consistent with the conclusions, but overall the case for cause and effect is not yet considered compelling by all reviewers, and the cell motility experiments are not causally connected to a specific signaling event.</p><p>There are some unresolved issues where new data, or further explanations, will improve support for the central claims of the paper.</p><p>1. The cell phenotypes are only been shown when cullin-5 (CUL5) is knocked down or BCAR3 (mutants) are overexpressed, both of which obviously result in non-physiological levels of expression. CUL5 loss will almost certainly alter multiple aspects of cell signalling (see point 5 below).</p><p>2. If it is true that a &quot;single phosphorylation site in BCAR3 for activation and degradation&quot;, then would the expression of this mutant be expected to have a dominant-negative or activating phenotype? Experiments overexpressing BCAR3 mutations at this site are lacking comparisons with other BCAR3 Y to F mutants that retain &quot;activity&quot; – all BCAR3 mutants shown are loss of function. What about comparison with the 4F mutant, for example?</p><p>3. As multiple protein domains and post-translational modifications are involved in the BCAR3-p130Cas complex, the authors have not completely established a convincing mechanistic linkage between the newly-identified BCAR3 Y117 phosphorylation, SOCS6 binding, and a CUL5-dependent cell phenotype.</p><p>4. Some of the experimental conditions (+/- EGF in growth media) are not optimal to make connections with EGFR activation and signalling downstream.</p><p>5. Is tyrosine phosphorylation of Y117 an EGF-stimulated event or just detected after phosphatase inhibition with pervanadate? The activation of Abl kinase (ABL1 increase at Y393, an activation site) in CUL5 deficient cells is possibly indicative of multiple signaling pathway activation and not necessary a Src effect.</p><p>6. The introduction / use of the BCAR3 L744E/R748E mutant needs further discussion/explanation. Could this mutation not have effects other than disrupting p130Cas binding? Figure 3 and connections to SOCS6 are confusing; the authors state that &quot;SOCS6 binds BCAR3 and Cas independently&quot; (bottom of page 7). However, while they show that the EE BCAR3 mutant binds to SOCS6 under conditions when it does not bind to Cas, they do not show the reciprocal interaction in this paper. In the data shown in Figure 5B, BCAR3-EE mutant expression is relatively low and this makes the loss of binding conclusion weak.</p><p>7. Regarding Figure 7, can the authors comment on potential reasons for why their data with regards to the inability of the EE mutant of BCAR3 to localize to focal adhesions may differ from other published data showing that a similar BCAR3 mutant was seen to efficiently localize to adhesions where it exhibited differences in the dynamics of BCAR3 dissociation from the adhesions (Cross et al., Oncogene. 2016)?</p><p>8. The use of the pY165-Cas antibody to measure changes in p130Cas activation at adhesions (Figure 8) needs further controls as the signal is relatively weak. Missing is the total p130Cas levels at paxillin-containing adhesions. How do the authors interpret the negative effects of the BCAR3 R177K or BCAR3-EE mutants on p130Cas phosphorylation? These experiments are correlative and not a strong mechanistic cause-effect ending for the paper.</p><p>9. Is it known whether it is the phosphorylation at Y165 within the pool of Cas that is localized to adhesions that is reduced in the presence of Y117F, R177K, or the EE mutants of BCAR3?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67078.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This study focuses on the formation of adaptor protein complexes at adhesion sites and their links to in vitro membrane ruffling and cell movement.

Experiments are generally performed using transiently-transfected MCF10A or Hela cells to knock down (mainly via siRNA) or over-express tagged proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We did indeed use transient transfection to over-express tagged proteins in HeLa cells for the binding experiments in Figures 3 and 4, but were at pains to carefully titrate expression levels using doxycyline-inducible lentiviral MCF10A cell lines in the functional assays. We will address expression levels further in response to point 1 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Using proteomics, a new phosphorylation site was identified (BCAR3 Y117) under conditions of pervanadate stimulation or in EGF-containing MCF10A growth media.</p></disp-quote><p>The proteomics was done on cells cultured either in EGF-containing growth media or the standard MCF10A assay media, which lacks EGF. No pervanadate was used. We will address the role of EGF further in response to points 4 and 5 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mutagenesis showed that BCAR3 Y117 is potentially important for enhancement of in vitro cell movement under conditions where the cullin-5 E3 ligase has also been reduced by siRNA expression. The authors propose a &quot;co-regulatory&quot; model whereby the recruitment of BCAR3 to adhesions acts to modulate p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation and cell migration.</p><p>If the case is strengthened as suggested below, would extend our understanding of molecular regulation of cell migration and should be of interest to cell and cancer biologists. The data are consistent with the conclusions, but overall the case for cause and effect is not yet considered compelling by all reviewers, and the cell motility experiments are not causally connected to a specific signaling event.</p><p>There are some unresolved issues where new data, or further explanations, will improve support for the central claims of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that the reviewers agree that our study has the potential to extend our understanding of regulation of cell migration, but disappointed that the cause and effect were not brought out well. In revising the paper, we have taken extra care with the Abstract, Introduction and Discussion to better explain the previous publications and highlight the new insights afforded by our research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The cell phenotypes are only been shown when cullin-5 (CUL5) is knocked down or BCAR3 (mutants) are overexpressed, both of which obviously result in non-physiological levels of expression. CUL5 loss will almost certainly alter multiple aspects of cell signalling (see point 5 below).</p></disp-quote><p>In the initial submission, we reported that BCAR3 is needed for collective migration only when Cul5 is absent (Figure 2d). Our subsequent experiments used Cul5-deficient cells to assay rescue of collective migration by BCAR3 mutants (Figure 6c). In these conditions, the ectopic BCAR3 was over-expressed 2- to 3-fold. We agree this may be non-physiological. However, we also showed in Figure 2b that single cell migration requires BCAR3 whether or not Cul5 is present. This provides us with an assay for BCAR3 function that does not require Cul5 knockdown. In the revised manuscript, we have added results showing rescue of single-cell migration by BCAR3 mutants in Cul5-containing cells (Figure 6b). The results confirm that the domains and residues of BCAR3 required for collective migration in the absence of Cul5 (Figure 6c) are also required for single-cell migration when Cul5 is present (Figure 6b). We thank the reviewers for bringing this to our attention. Adding the single cell migration data strengthens the case that BCAR3 functions require Tyr 117, the SH2 domain, and Cas binding. In addition, please note that all the immunofluorescence in the old paper (and new immunofluorescence experiments in the revised paper) were done without Cul5 knockdown or BCAR3 over-expression. Therefore we are confident that the mechanisms described here are physiologically relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. If it is true that a &quot;single phosphorylation site in BCAR3 for activation and degradation&quot;, then would the expression of this mutant be expected to have a dominant-negative or activating phenotype? Experiments overexpressing BCAR3 mutations at this site are lacking comparisons with other BCAR3 Y to F mutants that retain &quot;activity&quot; – all BCAR3 mutants shown are loss of function. What about comparison with the 4F mutant, for example?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now performed experiments with the 4F mutant and added the results to Figure 5c, Figure 5 —figure supplement 1, Figure 6 (all panels), Figure 8, and Figure 8 —figure supplement 3. In all cases F4 behaves like wildtype. This shows that the other four tyrosine phosphorylation sites play little if any role in regulating BCAR3 degradation, localization or function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. As multiple protein domains and post-translational modifications are involved in the BCAR3-p130Cas complex, the authors have not completely established a convincing mechanistic linkage between the newly-identified BCAR3 Y117 phosphorylation, SOCS6 binding, and a CUL5-dependent cell phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope the revised text and new experiments make the molecular mechanism clearer, but agree that we don’t completely understand the mechanism at this time. The challenge is that Y117 has positive and negative effects, activating Cas and cell motility on the one hand but also inducing BCAR3 turnover on the other. In addition, Cul5 has other substrates. Indeed, Cul5 and SOCS6 target both Cas and BCAR3. This makes it challenging to design experiments that would isolate effects of Cul5 on BCAR3 from effects on other substrates. A full understanding of molecular mechanism may require a full structural analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Some of the experimental conditions (+/- EGF in growth media) are not optimal to make connections with EGFR activation and signalling downstream.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not know whether EGFR regulates BCAR3. We initially detected BCAR3 Y117 phosphorylation by phosphoproteomics of MCF10A cells grown in either EGF-containing growth media or EGF-deficient assay media (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). In addition, Cul5 regulated BCAR3 protein but not RNA levels in both assay and growth media (Figure 1c). Since Cul5-mediated turnover of BCAR3 requires pY117, this is consistent with phosphorylation of Y117 whether EGF is present or absent. However, we have not identified the kinase and cannot rule out the EGFR (discussed in paragraph starting at foot of page 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Is tyrosine phosphorylation of Y117 an EGF-stimulated event or just detected after phosphatase inhibition with pervanadate?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above (point 4), EGF appears not to regulate Y117 phosphorylation. Phosphatase inhibition with pervanadate was not needed to detect pY117 in the phosphoproteomics experiments (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1) or to detect coprecipitation of SOCS6 and BCAR3 (Figure 4a). However, pervanadate was used to increase SOCS6-BCAR3 co-immunoprecipitation in Figure 3 and 4b-d.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The activation of Abl kinase (ABL1 increase at Y393, an activation site) in CUL5 deficient cells is possibly indicative of multiple signaling pathway activation and not necessary a Src effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We were also intrigued by the increase in Abl pY393, as well as phosphosites in the activation loop of the insulin/IGF1 receptor, in Cul5-deficient cells. These sites are all known Src-family kinase sites as well as autophosphorylation sites. Follow up experiments revealed that the steady state levels of Abl and IGF1R did not change when Cul5 is removed. Inhibiting Abl with STI571/Gleevec did not inhibit the increased migration of Cul5-deficient cells, implying that BCAR3 Y117 was still phosphorylated. However, at this stage, we are not confident ruling in or out some kind of kinase relay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The introduction / use of the BCAR3 L744E/R748E mutant needs further discussion/explanation. Could this mutation not have effects other than disrupting p130Cas binding?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the EE mutant could have other effects. Other investigators have found that this mutation inhibits binding to Cas and has the same effect on cell proliferation as mutating the interacting residues in Cas (Wallez et al., 2014). The fact that the EE mutation and Cas knockdown both prevent BCAR3 localization to adhesions is most consistent with BCAR3 localizing to adhesions by binding to Cas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 and connections to SOCS6 are confusing; the authors state that &quot;SOCS6 binds BCAR3 and Cas independently&quot; (bottom of page 7). However, while they show that the EE BCAR3 mutant binds to SOCS6 under conditions when it does not bind to Cas, they do not show the reciprocal interaction in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we did not show that Cas binds SOCS6 in the absence of BCAR3. This was an extrapolation from our previous identification of a SOCS6-binding site in Cas that is distinct from the BCAR3-binding site (Teckchandani et al., 2014). However, in the absence of a direct test, we have changed the text in the Results and Discussion, omitting “independently” when referring to Cas degradation. We have also changed the title of the Results section on page 7 from: “CRL5 separately targets BCAR3 and Cas through SOCS6” to “CRL5 directly targets BCAR3 through SOCS6”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the data shown in Figure 5B, BCAR3-EE mutant expression is relatively low and this makes the loss of binding conclusion weak.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree Figure 5b was not convincing due to low expression of BCAR3<sup>EE</sup>. We have therefore repeated the co-immunoprecipitations and the lack of binding to Cas is more obvious. The new result has been moved to Figure 5 —figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Regarding Figure 7, can the authors comment on potential reasons for why their data with regards to the inability of the EE mutant of BCAR3 to localize to focal adhesions may differ from other published data showing that a similar BCAR3 mutant was seen to efficiently localize to adhesions where it exhibited differences in the dynamics of BCAR3 dissociation from the adhesions (Cross et al., Oncogene. 2016)?</p></disp-quote><p>We would prefer not to speculate. The absence of BCAR3<sup>EE</sup> from adhesions agrees with the absence of BCAR3 from adhesions when Cas is knocked down. Perhaps the difference is due to cell type. (Cross et al., 2016) found that GFP-tagged BCAR3<sup>EE</sup> co-localized with Cas in adhesions in BT549 cells. However, (Wallez et al., 2014) found that BCAR3<sup>EE</sup> did not co-localize with Cas in membrane ruffles on MCF7 cells. Prior papers used single mutants that did not effectively inhibit BCAR3-Cas binding. We all agree that BCAR3 needs to bind Cas for biological activity. The BT549 cells are aggressive breast cancer cells and MCF10A cells are normal. Perhaps other proteins recruit BCAR3<sup>EE</sup> to adhesions in BT549 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The use of the pY165-Cas antibody to measure changes in p130Cas activation at adhesions (Figure 8) needs further controls as the signal is relatively weak.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we need extra controls to show pY165-Cas antibody specificity for immunofluorescence. New Figure 8 —figure supplement 1 shows that pY165-Cas fluorescence signal is inhibited when Cas is knocked down or when Src family kinases are inhibited. We get similar results with a pY410-Cas antibody, which recognizes another pYxxP motif in Cas, but did not include the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Missing is the total p130Cas levels at paxillin-containing adhesions.</p></disp-quote><p>When we initially submitted the paper, we had tested two different total Cas antibodies and neither was useful for immunofluorescence. We have now purchased a different anti-Cas antibody and get good signals for Cas in paxillin-containing adhesions. Using this antibody, we have confirmed our conclusion that BCAR3 is not needed for Cas localization to adhesions. The previous experiment made use of EYFP-Cas (previous Figure 7a). The new Figure 7a shows that endogenous Cas localizes to adhesions in the absence of BCAR3. We also added Figure 8 —figure supplement 3, showing that endogenous Cas localization to adhesions is not altered when endogenous BCAR3 is removed and BCAR3 wildtype or mutants are re-expressed. Unfortunately, both the pY165-Cas and total Cas antibodies are rabbit so we cannot stain for both at the same time, but the pY165-Cas/paxillin and Cas/paxillin ratios make it clear that the loss-of-function BCAR3 mutants affect Cas phosphorylation, not localization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How do the authors interpret the negative effects of the BCAR3 R177K or BCAR3-EE mutants on p130Cas phosphorylation? These experiments are correlative and not a strong mechanistic cause-effect ending for the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The lack of rescue by BCAR3<sup>EE</sup> is easy to explain since it does not bind Cas and is absent from adhesions, so has no effect. It’s true that we don’t know why BCAR3<sup>R177K</sup> is inactive. We assume it interferes with SH2 domain function but do not know the ligand. Obvious candidates are the EGFR and PTPRA. (Oh et al., 2008) reported that BCAR3 co-immunoprecipitates with EGFR and (Jones et al., 2006) reported that the BCAR3 SH2 domain binds a ErbB2 pY1139 phosphopeptide with K<sub>d</sub> ~ 1 uM. Sun et al. showed co-precipitation of full length BCAR3 and RPTPA from transfected cells that was abolished by mutation of the BCAR3 SH2 domain or mutation of an pY site in PTPRA. However, we probed SNAP-V5-BCAR3 immunoprecipitates with antiphosphotyrosine, anti-EGFR and anti-PTPRA antibodies to look for possible co-precipitating bands and saw none. We’ve also tried making the BCAR3 SH2 domain according to (Oh et al., 2008) and it was insoluble.</p><p>To avoid ending the paper on a negative note, we have added a new result. We found that BCAR3 is needed not only to phosphorylate Cas Y165 but also to phosphorylate FAK Y861, another SFK phosphorylation site in integrin adhesion complexes. FAK autophosphorylation at Y397 was unaffected (Figure 8 —figure supplement 2). The implication is that BCAR3 regulates SFKs in adhesions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Is it known whether it is the phosphorylation at Y165 within the pool of Cas that is localized to adhesions that is reduced in the presence of Y117F, R177K, or the EE mutants of BCAR3?</p></disp-quote><p>In the absence of acute stimulation, the fraction of Cas that is phosphorylated at Y165 is very small and not affected by BCAR3 depletion. We don’t know the status of Cas phosphorylation in the cytoplasm, but our data in Figure 8 shows that phosphorylation stoichiometry of the important population of Cas in adhesions is regulated by BCAR3 dependent on Y117, R177 and the Cas-binding site on BCAR3. We think that the focus on Cas in adhesions is more relevant to the biology.</p></body></sub-article></article>
