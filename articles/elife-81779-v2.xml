dysfunctions, among which blindness, diabetes, and neurological deficits are the most prominent. <italic>WFS1</italic> encodes for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident transmembrane protein wolframin with multiple functions in ER processes. However, the <italic>WFS1</italic>-dependent etiopathology in retinal cells is unknown. Herein, we showed that <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant mice developed early retinal electrophysiological impairments followed by marked visual loss. Interestingly, axons and myelin disruption in the optic nerve preceded the degeneration of the retinal ganglion cell bodies in the retina. Transcriptomics at pre-degenerative stage revealed the STAT3-dependent activation of proinflammatory glial markers with reduction of the homeostatic and pro-survival factors glutamine synthetase and BDNF. Furthermore, label-free comparative proteomics identified a significant reduction of the monocarboxylate transport isoform 1 (MCT1) and its partner basigin that are highly enriched on retinal glia and myelin-forming oligodendrocytes in optic nerve together with wolframin. Loss of MCT1 caused a failure in lactate transfer from glial to neuronal cell bodies and axons leading to a chronic hypometabolic state. Thus, this bioenergetic impairment is occurring concurrently both within the axonal regions and cell bodies of the retinal ganglion cells, selectively endangering their survival while impacting less on other retinal cells. This metabolic dysfunction occurs months before the frank RGC degeneration suggesting an extended time-window for intervening with new therapeutic strategies focused on boosting retinal and optic nerve bioenergetics in WS1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>eye</kwd><kwd>retinal development</kwd><kwd>glial cell</kwd><kwd>astrocytes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003196</institution-id><institution>Italian Ministry of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF2019-12370396</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mauri</surname><given-names>PierLuigi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Elixir Implementation Study Proteomics 2021-23</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EISP-23-072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mauri</surname><given-names>PierLuigi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002426</institution-id><institution>Telethon Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#1350</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Broccoli</surname><given-names>Vania</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein wolframin regulates MCT1 protein levels in retinal glial cells controlling the shuttling of energy metabolites to both somata and axons of retinal ganglion cells and, thus, supporting their fitness and survival.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wolfram syndrome 1 (WS1) is a rare and multisystemic genetic disease. In most cases the first clinical sign is the development of non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus (DM) during infancy followed by optic atrophy (OA) which leads to progressive visual loss in adolescence progressing relentlessly to blindness in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wolfram and Wagener, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett et al., 1995</xref>). While DM symptoms are clinically treatable with antidiabetic therapies, interventions to arrest or delay the loss of sight are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Urano, 2016</xref>). Although concurrent DM and OA are pathognomonic for WS1, patients might develop additional serious neurological illnesses, most commonly hearing loss, ataxia, epilepsy, and peripheral neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Minton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chaussenot et al., 2011</xref>). Serious psychiatric disturbances have also been described in WS1 patients including psychosis, episodes of severe depression, and impulsive/aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Swift et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Swift and Swift, 2005</xref>). OA is caused by the selective loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons in the optic nerve with a pattern of degeneration that mainly interests the central part of the optic tract rather than the periphery and is accompanied by different degrees of demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zmyslowska et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barboni et al., 2022</xref>). Noteworthy, neuroimaging studies revealed diffuse alterations in the gray and white matters of the brain with significant loss of volume of the brainstem and microstructure abnormalities and signs of degeneration of myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lugar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Samara et al., 2019</xref>). The gene mutated in WS1 is <italic>WFS1</italic> which encodes for a multi-transmembrane protein and resident in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) named wolframin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inoue et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Strom et al., 1998</xref>). Mounting evidence suggests that <italic>WFS1</italic> gene loss induces ER stress-mediated apoptosis of insulin producing pancreatic β-cells with disruption of cellular calcium homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fonseca et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fonseca et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Riggs et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamada et al., 2006</xref>). In particular, wolframin is able to increase the Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake within the ER, partially through the regulation of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase SERCA pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zatyka et al., 2015</xref>). As a consequence, wolframin loss results in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> leakage from the ER with a simultaneous increase of its cytosolic concentration, activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protease calpain which, in turn, activates programmed apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takei et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, recent findings have suggested that wolframin is required for the proper release of both insulin and neurotransmitters from the ER and their delivery to the cell periphery through assisted vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Increasing reports have described dysfunctional ER-mitochondria communication caused by wolframin loss. In fact, <italic>WFS1</italic> deficiency deranges the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)-mediated release by destabilizing the NCS1 protein and, thereby, leading to reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by the mitochondria with consequent functional impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schlecker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cagalinec et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angebault et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, a recent study unveiled an enriched localization of wolframin at the MAM sites and in WS1 patient fibroblasts, wolframin deficiency correlated with MAMs loss and, therefore, with defective Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from the ER to the mitochondria and their related dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">La Morgia et al., 2020</xref>). Remarkably, pharmacological activation of the sigma-1 receptor (S1R), an ER-resident protein involved in calcium ion transfer, was shown to counteract the functional alterations of MAMs due to wolframin deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crouzier et al., 2022a</xref>). Altogether, these results highlight mitochondrial dysfunctions as a relevant pathogenetic event triggered by wolframin and leading to cell death. However, most of these findings were obtained using cell lines and patients’ fibroblasts, and, therefore whether these pathogenetic alterations have the same relevance in neural cells and represent the main and only cause of neurodegeneration remain to be further investigated. Different <italic>Wsf1</italic> targeted mutant mouse and rat lines have been generated and showed to recapitulate the main cardinal pathological traits of the WS1 patients. Furthermore, zebrafish mutant lines for the two homologue genes wfs1a and wfs1b have been recently produced showing retinal abnormalities and behavioral visual dysfunctions associated with ER stress and impaired UPR response in both strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cairns et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crouzier et al., 2022b</xref>). Between the mouse models, the neurological and behavioral alterations of the <italic>Wfs1</italic><sup>exon8del</sup> targeted mice have been extensively characterized showing diabetic glucose intolerance and anxious-like behaviors upon stressful environment exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luuk et al., 2008</xref>). Visual impairment in these mice is less characterized with only a histopathological study that reported some thinning of the retinal tissue with lower retinal thickness/longitudinal diameter ratio in 4 months old <italic>Wfs1</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Waszczykowska et al., 2020</xref>). More recently, a mutant rat line was obtained through <italic>Wfs1</italic> exon 5 disruption showing the hallmarks of WS1, with diabetes, optic atrophy, and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Plaas et al., 2017</xref>). The increase of ER stress levels was detected in mutant retina, brainstem and pancreas, coupled with a volumetric decrease in all these districts. These features made it very useful to test the efficacy of the pharmacological treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Plaas et al., 2017</xref>). Prolonged administration of the glucagon like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1-R) agonists have demonstrated beneficial effects in preventing diabetes, excitotoxicity, and ER stress in aged rats and delaying disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toots et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seppa et al., 2019</xref>). Very recently the synergistic effects of GLP1-R agonist and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor mimetic 7,8-DHF co-treatment have shown neuroprotective capacity on rats’ visual pathway rescuing visual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seppa et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, chronic ER stress and autophagy alterations caused by <italic>Wfs1</italic> loss results in the acceleration of Tau protein aggregation and relative pathology in mouse hippocampus suggesting a novel mechanism by which wolframin deficiency can lead to neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delpech et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, rodent models of <italic>Wfs1</italic> deficiency offers pivotal systems where to dissect and further validate the pathogenetic basis of this disease. Herein, we employed the <italic>Wfs1</italic><sup>exon8del</sup> mutant mice to better characterize the progressive impairments of visual physiology and activity over time and identify novel molecular and biochemical alterations by genome-wide transcriptomics and proteomics on isolated retinal tissues. These targeted analyses reveal neuroinflammation and bioenergetic substrate loss as plausible causes for the selective vulnerability of RGCs and their degeneration in WS1 mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Progressive visual impairments in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant mice</title><p>To determine RGCs functionality and visual signal conduction to the brain in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant mice, we exploited whole field photopic electroretinogram (pERG), which measures action potentials produced by the retina when it is stimulated by light of adequate intensity and it is the composite of electrical activity from the photoreceptors, inner retina, and RGCs. In photopic conditions, the negative response (PhNR) wave represents the RGC spiking activity originating from light-adapted cones and allows the detection of RGC-specific alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gotoh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kinoshita et al., 2016</xref>). Whilst pERG measurements were comparable between wild-type and <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant mice at 2 months of age (<italic>WT</italic>: 68±5; <italic>Wfs1-</italic>KO: 72±6; p&lt;0.05), a prolonged implicit time, which refers to the interval between the stimulation and the peak of the negative response, was detected in 4 months old <italic>Wfs1</italic>-deficient animals (<italic>WT</italic>: 76±5; <italic>Wfs1-</italic>KO: 82±6; p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This early indication of RGC abnormalities became increasingly more pronounced in 8 (<italic>WT</italic>: 73 ± 6; <italic>Wfs1-</italic>KO: 83 ± 9; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and 12 (<italic>WT</italic>: 76 ± 5; <italic>Wfs1-</italic>KO: 85 ± 5; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) months old mutant mice, with the latter group that showed, beside a delayed response , also a significant PhNR amplitude decrease (<italic>WT</italic>: 11±2; <italic>Wfs1-</italic>KO: 8±2, p&lt;0.0001) at the latest time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To further deepen our neurophysiological evaluation, we sought to investigate light-induced electric conduction from the retina to the brain visual cortex by flash visual evoked potential (fVEP) recordings. These measurements represent a direct readout of the optic nerve functional activity by providing two important parameters: the latency, which measures the propagation speed of the visual stimulus along the nerve fibers until its central detection; the amplitude, that represents the potential difference generated after administration of the visual stimulus, allowing quantification of the power of the electrical signal produced in the optic nerve. VEP trace typically consists of three waves, a first positive wave (P1), followed by both a negative (N1) and a second positive wave (P2). We measured the latency of N1 and the peak-to-peak amplitude of the N1-P2 complex to assess the optic nerve function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While 2 and 4 months old mutant mice did not display detectable VEP alterations, 8-month-old mutant mice displayed increased latencies (<italic>WT</italic>: 46±4; <italic>Wfs1-</italic>KO: 51±2, p&lt;0.001), indicative of slower transmissions along the visual pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, both VEP parameters were significantly affected as mouse age progressed to 12 months (VEP amplitude <italic>WT</italic>: 40±14; <italic>Wfs1-</italic>KO: 28±2; p&lt;0.001; VEP latencies <italic>WT</italic>: 47±2; <italic>Wfs1-</italic>KO: 52±3, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then asked if these neurophysiological deficits correlate with manifested loss of visual acuity as recorded by the optomotor reflex response (OMR) based on tracking the unconditioned compensatory head movements of the animal while trying to stabilize the image of the moving environment (rotating vertical stripes). <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant mice showed a progressive reduction in visual acuity with undetectable differences at 2 and 4 months of age while a significant loss was recorded at 8 months which markedly worsened 4 months later (4 months - <italic>WT</italic>: 0.40±0.5; <italic>Wfs1-</italic>KO 0.36±0.8 c/deg, 8 months - <italic>WT</italic>: 0.39±0.4; <italic>Wfs1-</italic>KO: 0.30±0.3 c/deg, p&lt;0.05, 12 months - <italic>WT</italic>: 0.38±0.6; <italic>Wfs1-</italic>KO: 0.19±0.5 c/deg, p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results imply that the initial visual impairment in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant mice is represented by RCG alterations in the retinal tissue followed by a delay of the visual stimulus along the nerve fibers suggesting a progressive optic nerve damage. Subsequently, RGC functions are extensively altered causing a drastic loss of visual acuity at 12 months of age.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant mice show progressive and severe impairment of visual activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative pERG and fVEP waveforms at 4, 8, and 12 months of age in wild-type (WT) and <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant (KO) animals.</p><p>PhNR amplitude and implicit time are quantified by ERG measurements (n=15, *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001, Student <italic>t</italic>-test).

At first, we evaluated the gross retinal architecture in 8 months old mice by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography (FA), in terms of both morphology and neovascularization. FA assessment was necessary to exclude confounding effects due to diabetic retinopathy (DM), which represents one of the major eye complications of DM but whose causative mechanisms are highly different from those in WS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hilson et al., 2009</xref>). The collected images did not reveal any signs of retinal vasculature dysfunction in either group of animals. Indeed, OCT-angiography did not highlight any significant difference in the eye fundi or perfusion and vessel length density and tortuosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, we also assessed the thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and no significant differences were disclosed by structural OCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since mutant elderly mice often displayed corneal haze, with consequent poor quality images, we managed to sample only three 12 months old clear-lensed eyes that still did not show big abnormalities in RNFL thickness at OCT segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To investigate the cellular dysfunctions underlying the neurophysiological recordings, we performed transmission electron microscopy analyses (TEM) of transversal optic nerve sections of <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant and littermate control mice at the same timepoints (8 and 12 months). Post-hoc TEM imaging analysis enabled us to estimate average RGC axonal densities (mean axon count/area), average myelin area/field also quantifying the empty space (i.e. uncovered by axons) and g-ratio (axonal area divided by axonal area including that of myelin sheets). These elaborations revealed that 8 months old <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant optic nerves presented incipient myelin thinning (g-ratio - <italic>WT</italic>: 0.52±0.18; <italic>Wfs1-</italic>KO: 0.54±0.14, p&lt;0.05) with reduced myelin area and a higher proportion of empty space, but without axonal count discrepancies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). TEM imaging in elderly mutant animals (12 months of age) unveiled signs of more severe myelin degeneration (g-ratio - <italic>WT</italic>: 0.42±0.18; <italic>Wfs1-</italic>KO: 0.50±0,18, p&lt;0.05) with pathological features and degenerating fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In particular, we observed a significant reduction of axonal density and area occupied by myelin together with evident signs of axonal damage with increased g-ratio (<italic>WT</italic>: 0.41±0.04; <italic>Wfs1-</italic>KO: 0.51±0.003, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results provide evidence that myelin alterations and axonal thinning are the first pathological signs followed by manifested myelin degeneration and axonal loss in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant optic nerves. This pathological progression is perfectly matching the timeline of the visual functional deficits previously uncovered by electrophysiological recordings and the optomotor analysis. To assess whether optic axonal damage was occurring with simultaneous alterations in RGC cell bodies within the retinal tissue, we performed a detailed count of RGC number by immunocytochemical staining using the pan-RGCs marker RBMPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Unbiased stereology counting did not reveal significant RGC number changes in 8 months old <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, 4 months later the loss of the RGC population became evident and statistically relevant (28% ± 6% loss in <italic>Wfs1</italic>-KO vs WT retinas) indicating a progressive loss of RGC somata over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results illustrate that axonal damage and myelin degeneration anticipate the frank loss of RGC cell bodies in the retinas, even if within a relative delayed time frame a severe loss of RGCs can be also detectable in the <italic>Wfs1</italic>-deficient retinas.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Progressive demyelination in the <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant optic nerves.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative EM images of optic nerve cross-sections of wild-type (WT) and <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant mice at 8 months of age showing increased space among the axons (red asterisks).

To investigate prodromic events that anticipate the morphological changes, we performed RNA-seq analysis on tissues from 8 months old mice. RNAs were extracted from whole retinas of three different mice per group (WT vs <italic>Wfs1</italic>-KO) and subjected to global gene expression analysis. t-SNE analysis of the RNA-seq datasets confirmed the expected closer similarity and correlation between all mutant retinas in comparison to the analogous wild-type samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Computational analysis identified 396 genes differentially expressed (DEGs) in mutant retinas compared to the control counterparts, with a similar proportion of either up- or downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting not profound transcriptome alterations but rather selective changes in mutant samples at this stage. Interestingly, gene enrichment analysis (Gene Ontology, GO) revealed many deregulated genes related to pathways like cell death, UPR response and protein folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Intriguingly, all these pathways were down-regulated in the mutant retinas, in line with the general assumption from literature that wolframin loss impairs the cellular stress-coping capacities. On the contrary, mutant retinas upregulated key genes of neuroinflammatory pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) as those associated with reactive glial cells like, <italic>Gfap</italic>, <italic>Lcn2</italic>, <italic>Edn2</italic>, <italic>Alpk1,</italic> and <italic>C4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Linnerbauer et al., 2022</xref>). We, next, performed immunocytochemical analysis confirming the aberrant activation of the ER stress effectors ATF6 (<italic>WT</italic>: 0.5±0.3; <italic>Wfs1</italic>-KO: 1.5±0.2) and CHOP (<italic>WT</italic>: 0.2±0.01; <italic>Wfs1</italic>-KO: 0.4±0.02) in mutant retinal samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, GFAP (8 months WT: 0.5±0.2; <italic>Wfs1</italic>-KO: 1.4±0.3; 12 months WT: 0.2±0.02; <italic>Wfs1</italic>-KO: 52±2) and Vimentin (VIM) (8 months WT: 20±2; <italic>Wfs1</italic>-KO: 38±5; 12 months <italic>WT</italic>: 2.2±0.5; <italic>Wfs1</italic>-KO: 4.6±0.8) staining was found strongly upregulated in mutant retinal Müller glia at both 8 and 12 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, the glia-specific glutamine synthetase (GS) enzyme was found downregulated both at mRNA and protein levels in <italic>Wfs1</italic>-deficient retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>). GS generates glutamine by assembling glutamate and ammonia and, therefore, having a critical role in preventing glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity and ammonia toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rose et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, GS reduction in <italic>Wfs1</italic>-deficient retinal glial cells might favor a toxic environment detrimental for neuronal survival. Next, the genes encoding for the key neurotrophic molecule BDNF, and the survival factors Nr4a1 and Nr4a3 were also reduced in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), further altering neuronal homeostasis and stress resilience. In fact, BDNF is a well-known neurotrophic factor expressed by RGCs and Müller glia in adulthood retina, where it exerts its autocrine or paracrine effects. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that BDNF promotes survival of RGCs and can ameliorates RGC death after traumatic optic nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 1999</xref>). It is thus not surprising that its downregulation occurs before ganglion cell death. Finally, a number of microglial pro-inflammatory genes such as <italic>Il-18</italic>, <italic>Gpr37</italic>, <italic>Cybb</italic>, <italic>Lyz2</italic>, <italic>Lglas3,</italic> and <italic>Mpp12</italic> were upregulated, suggesting that <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant microglia activate at least some reactive-specific pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). However, levels of interferon-inducible genes and NF-κB signaling components were unchanged suggesting the lack of a generalized inflammatory response, but rather a selective activation of specific neuro-inflammatory pathways. To further strengthen our results, RT-qPCR analysis were performed on independent biological samples and substantially confirmed the transcriptome data for the key selected genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), further highlighting a selective pro-inflammatory profile in <italic>Wfs1</italic>-deficient retinas. On this line, we noted that the dysregulated <italic>Lcn2</italic> and <italic>Vim</italic> genes in <italic>Wsf1</italic> mutant samples have been shown to be direct targets of the STAT3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrmann et al., 2008</xref>). Intriguingly, previous studies reported that STAT3 can be stimulated by the ER stress-dependent PERK and IRE1α pathways in glial and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meares et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Zhang, 2017</xref>). Thus, we profiled by western blotting both total and active (pY705) forms of STAT3 in control and <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant retinal lysates at 8 months of age. Interestingly, the active STAT3 variant was highly enhanced in mutant samples although with some variability among the samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Thus, we profiled by candidate gene expression other STAT3 regulated genes such as <italic>Fgf2</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Vegfa</italic>, <italic>C1s,</italic> and <italic>C1rl</italic> finding them consistently upregulated in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Altogether, these findings uncovered a prominent pro-inflammatory molecular program associated with reduction of survival and homeostatic factors which is promoted at least in part by the ER stress-dependent STAT3 activation.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Transcriptome analysis of <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant and control retinas.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole-transcriptome analysis using the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) analysis with a view of the sample distribution along the first two dimensions.

In fact, wolframin regulates the function of several proteins that control ER physiology and ER-mitochondrial interactions through post-transcriptional mechanisms. Thus, we collected eyes from WT and <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant mice at 8 months and isolated the retinas with their optic nerves to carry out label-free LC-MS comparative proteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Three biological replicates for each of the two genotypes were analysed in triplicate and aligned through Multidimensional Algorithm Protein Mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Comunian et al., 2011</xref>). Overall, 2046 proteins were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and the virtual 2D map showed the ability of the shotgun approach to identify proteins in a wide range of molecular weight and isoelectrical point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this study, a label-free quantification was applied, considering the total number of peptides (evaluated as Peptide Spectrum Matches or Spectral Count) for each protein. The quantitative analysis, combined with statistical evaluation, led to the identification of 21 differentially expressed proteins between the two genotypes with 9 upregulated and 12 downregulated in the <italic>Wfs1</italic>-KO compared to the WT condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Notably, the most upregulated protein upon <italic>Wfs1</italic> gene loss was GFAP, confirming increased gliosis described earlier in the mutant retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Conversely, among the most downregulated molecules in mutant samples, we identified MCT1 (Slc16a1) and basigin. MCT1 belongs to the family of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) that promotes the transport across cell membranes and the shuttling between cells of energy metabolites as lactate, pyruvate or ketone bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Felmlee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosshart et al., 2021</xref>). Basigin (known also as CD147) is a glycoprotein which assembles with MCT1 promoting its trafficking from ER and its stabilization on the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirk et al., 2000</xref>). In brain, MCTs govern the extracellular release of lactate from glycolytic astrocytes and its transfer into neurons where it is oxidized to generate ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Magistretti and Allaman, 2018</xref>). This astrocyte-to-neuron lactate shuttle strengthens the metabolic coupling between glial and neuronal cells providing a rapid and tunable energy substrate to sustain the highly dynamic metabolic demand of neurons. To confirm the proteomics results, western blotting for MCT1 was performed on independent retinal tissue samples confirming a strong downregulation of this transporter both at 5 and 8 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Similarly, a marked reduction of basigin was detectable in mutant retinas at 5 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, MCT2 levels were found upregulated in 8 months old mutant retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, loss of MCT1 and basigin is detectable months in advance respect to the frank degeneration suggesting that the pathological process proceeds with a relatively slow progression before leading to clinically relevant symptoms. Intriguingly, MCT1 loss was detectable also in brain cortical and striatal tissue samples in 8 months old <italic>Wfs1</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To further assess wolframin and MCT1 functional relationship, we chose HeLa cells that express wolframin at appreciable levels and inactivated the gene by CRISPR/Cas9 targeted indel mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, MCT1 protein levels were strongly downregulated in <italic>WFS1</italic>-deficient HeLa cells, but not in equivalent cells that underwent the same technical procedures but without the successful inactivation of <italic>WFS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that the wolframin-dependent regulation of MCT1 protein levels is not restricted only to the retina but is a more general phenomenon.

We also confirmed that both wolframin and MCT1 proteins were detectable in lysates of isolated optic nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis on optic nerve sections revealed that wolframin and MCT1 were mainly localized in MBP positive oligodendrocytes wrapping the axonal fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Seminal findings have shown that myelin sheaths play a key role in glial-axonal metabolic support by shuttling metabolites like lactate and pyruvate toward axons to fuel the local energy demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fünfschilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). This trophic support is mediated by both MCT1 and MCT2 localized into oligodendroglia and axons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halestrap and Price, 1999</xref>). This process is crucial for energy homeostasis since MCT1 specific inactivation in oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells leads to late-onset axonal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jha et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Philips et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that <italic>Wfs1</italic> gene loss might affect MCT1 protein levels in the optic nerve myelin and the transfer of lactate within the axonal tracts. If this is the case, it is expected that lactate should accumulate in oligoglial cells that are not able to metabolize themselves the large intracellular quantities. Biochemical quantifications in both retinas and isolated optic nerves showed a prominent accumulation of lactate in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

In fact, although ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions are unequivocally associated with <italic>Wfs1</italic> inactivation, they alone cannot be the cause of the specific cell type loss within the retina occurring in this disease. The retina is a complex assembly of multiple neuronal cell types and photoreceptors that are expected to be comparably sensitive to ER and mitochondrial functional impairments. Herein, we provided unprecedented findings revealing the exact molecular alterations caused by the chronic neuroinflammatory state and the pervasive bioenergetic failure occurring before the development of severe visual deficits in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant mice. Beyond the upregulation of prototype markers of inflammation in astrocytes and microglia, we also showed the downregulation of GS and BDNF that are key molecules in glial homeostasis and cell survival. GS catalyzes the conversion of ammonia and glutamate to glutamine, a precursor of glutamate and GABA, which shuttles from astrocytes to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jayakumar and Norenberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rose et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, GS impairment might lead to reduce clearance of extracellular brain glutamate and ammonia, glutamine deficiency, and perturbed glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. Although these findings identify a new pathological mechanism in WS1, this impairment is expected to equally affects retinal cells and to lie rather downstream to the chain of pathological events. Unbiased proteomics profiling of retinal and optic tissue samples enabled us to identify MCT1 and basigin as significantly downregulated upon <italic>Wfs1</italic> gene inactivation. MCT1 is the main monocarboxylate transporter in glial cells that promotes the shuttling of lactate toward neurons to sustain their elevated energy demand. Intriguingly, we confirmed a simultaneous upregulation of MCT2, the isoform predominantly localized on neuronal cell bodies and axons indicating a compensatory response of the target cells to maximize the entrance of lactate despite its poor extracellular availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). MCT1 loss was detected both in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant retinal and optic nerve samples with concomitant accumulation of lactate and reduction of ATP. Notably, we showed that <italic>Wfs1</italic> expression is enriched in retinal glia and wolframin co-localizes with oligodendrocyte-forming myelin in the optic nerve confirming the co-expression with MCT1 at single-cell resolution. Among all retinal neurons, RGCs are the unique neuronal cells with myelinated axons that travel long distances within the optic nerve to reach their brain targets. Thus, these neurons are predicted to have much higher metabolic needs respect to retinal interneurons that feature short-distance and unmyelinated projections contained within the retina. Thus, we postulate that the simultaneously loss of MCT1-dependent lactate transfer from glial cells to cell bodies and axons of RGCs represent a key pathological event which predominantly undermine the survival of this specific retinal cell type in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant animals. On this view, mice with only one <italic>MCT1</italic> gene copy develop axonal degeneration by 8 months of age and selective <italic>MCT1</italic> inactivation in oligodendrocytes causes axonal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Philips et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, these results in mouse together with observations of <italic>MCT1</italic> expression alterations in human neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andres Benito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tang et al., 2019</xref>), strongly point to MCT1-dependent bioenergetic loss as causative for neuronal function alterations and neurodegeneration. Although we described metabolic alterations both in retina and optic nerve in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant animals, the first detectable pathological sign is the myelin derangement in the optic nerve. These observations indicate that the optic nerve damage and axonal functional impairment likely represent the initial pathological defects caused by <italic>Wfs1</italic> deficiency. Remarkably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barboni et al., 2022</xref> have recently described that in WS1 patients the RNFL thickness shows a fast decline since early age which precedes of about a decade the atrophy of the cellular bodies of RGCs. Thus, experimental findings in mice and patients converge in highlighting RGC axonal damage as the first disease sign in WS1. Moreover, our results uncover chronic bioenergetic failure as an unprecedented new pathological mechanism at the basis of the selective loss of RGC responsible for visual loss in WS1.</p><p>Neuroinflammation and MCT1-dependent energy insufficiency represent likely two independent phenomena triggered by separate <italic>Wfs1</italic> dependent pathways. However, chronic inflammation causes a loss of astrocyte-oligodendrocyte gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Markoullis et al., 2014</xref>). These intercellular gap junctions enable the shuttle of glucose from the blood circulation to oligodendrocytes through astrocyte intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wasseff and Scherer, 2011</xref>). Thus, astrocytosis can reduce glucose availability in oligodendrocytes and consequently its metabolic support to axons. On this view, MCT1 downregulation and astrocytosis create a pathological axis that synergistically impairs oligodendrocyte metabolic support capabilities.</p><p>Several hypotheses can provide an explanation of the loss of MCT1 and basigin based on the known functions of wolframin. First, wolframin was shown to direct vesicle trafficking from ER to the cell periphery and this function can sustain the delivery of specific client proteins (i.e. MCT1 and basigin) to the cell membrane. Second, wolframin can stabilize MCT1 and basigin on the membrane and therefore protect them from selective degradation. Finally, wolframin-dependent ER stress might particularly affect the stability of selective proteins. An additional hypothesis is that wolframin has a general facilitatory role in the assembly of oligomeric protein assemblies. In fact, a previous study reported the concomitant loss of both alpha and beta-subunits of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase suggesting a possible role of wolframin in the correct folding and assembly of multimeric complexes in ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zatyka et al., 2008</xref>). Future studies will be necessary to determine if one or more of these mechanisms are responsible for MCT1/basigin protein reduction upon wolframin loss. Our results indicate that wolframin regulates MCT1/basigin protein processing and/or stability also outside the retina causing other symptoms associated with Wolfram syndrome. In fact, MCT1 is strongly enriched in brain astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and sustain the lactate shuttle towards neuronal cells and their metabolic fitness and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fünfschilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, MCT1 loss in the CNS might contribute to diffuse neurodegeneration underlying the progressive brain volume loss occurring in WS1 patients. Finally, MTC1 is the most abundantly expressed lactate transporter in peripheral nerves and its inactivation in Schwann cells leads to hypomyelination and functional deficits in sensory, but not motor, peripheral nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jha et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, WS1 patients might develop peripheral neuropathy with increased impairment of the sensory component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). Future studies are warranted to determine lactate metabolism dysregulation in brain and peripheral neurons in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant mice.</p><p>These results have also profound implications on future strategies for gene therapy in WS1. In fact, given the selective RGC loss, research activities are in progress to establish gene therapy approaches to express a functional <italic>Wfs1</italic> gene copy in RGCs in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant mice. However, given our results we expect that this design will not efficiently prevent RGC dysfunction and subsequent loss. In contrast, <italic>Wfs1</italic> gene activity should be restored in glial cells of the retina and optic nerve in order to correct the trafficking of energy metabolites and sustain the bioenergetics of RGC cell bodies and axons. Altogether, by revealing new pathophysiological mechanisms underlying visual loss in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant mice these findings uncover unprecedented therapeutic directions for WS1 calling for the exploitation of pharmacological strategies for metabolic support based on boosting glucose alternative energy substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Camandola and Mattson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beard et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The <italic>Wfs1</italic><sup>exon8del</sup> targeted mouse model was a kind gift of M.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Lu Chen as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Findings should be discussed relative to all relevant literature. Several key publications are missing from the manuscript. This results in several incorrect statements and failure to accurately phrase the findings of this study in the context of current knowledge. Literature omitted, includes:</p><p>Crouzier et al., Sci Transl Med 2022 characterized the impact of the loss of function in the Wfs1 knock-out animals on calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial activity in isolated cortical and hippocampal neurons.</p><p>Cairns et al., Sci Rep. 2021 and Crouzier et al., Hum Mol Genet. 2022 describe the generation and phenotyping of zebrafish models that include visual system pathology.</p><p>Chen et al., Acta Neuropathol 2022 illustrates the role of Wfs1 in Tau pathology.</p><p>(2) For glutamine synthetase findings and conclusions, Müller cells should be discussed. Müller cells perform glutamate recycling for a majority of the retina and are implicated elsewhere in the study findings.</p><p>(3) Are ERG and F-VEP measures ever &quot;normal&quot; in this model? &quot;Normal&quot; visual acuity does not translate to &quot;normal&quot; physiology, which is important for the interpretation of these findings.</p><p>(4) Immunohistochemical analysis illustrating MCT1 expression and localization along the optic nerve, preferably in a longitudinal section (not cross-section) so that long segments of myelinated axons can be viewed.</p><p>(5) Rephrase &quot;protein complex&quot; in the conclusions drawn regarding Wfs1 and MCT1 co-immunoprecipitation.

These are highlighted solely for the authors' consideration and are NOT essential revisions for resubmission.</p><p>(1) Is the downregulation of MCT1 specific to the retina or common to all neurons?</p><p>2. Is the decrease in ATP due to the decrease in lactate export or the combination of an altered mitochondria function in the RGCs plus lactate deficiency?</p><p>3. Direct demonstration of the proposed relationship between lactate accumulation and Wolframin/MCT1 depletion, i.e. in primary oligodendrocyte cultures from control and Wolframin mutant mice, would greatly strengthen this study.</p><p>4. Why is MCT2 is upregulated? Does Wfs1 also interact with MCT2?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Use of primary oligodendrocyte cultures from control and Wolframin mutant mice to directly demonstrate the proposed relationship between lactate accumulation and Wolframin/MCT1 depletion is desirable.</p><p>2. It is unclear why the authors focus on astrocytes for glutamine synthetase results and discussion. Muller cells perform glutamate recycling for a majority of the retina (including Muller cell endfeet near RGC soma and axons) and are implicated elsewhere in the study findings.</p><p>3. Please add ages and group sizes to the methods section for each assay.</p><p>4. The OCT findings in this study are contrary to published findings in this model. There is no discussion of the discrepancy.</p><p>5. ERG and f-VEP should be examined at 4 months. It is possible that visual acuity is within normal limits, but f-VEP and ERG latencies are not. OKT data indicates normal visual acuity at 4 months. However, previous literature describes thinning of the retina as early as 4 months. The ability to evaluate f-VEP and ERG data in the context of a young &quot;baseline&quot; would increase the clarity, significance, and potential impact of these findings.</p><p>6. Fluoromicrographs are of insufficient quality to observe the findings reported in the text. Higher magnification images of crisp focus should be included for all.</p><p>7. Optic nerve staining for oligodendrocytes should also include longitudinal sections where larger segments of myelin can be viewed along the nerve.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects need to be addressed in order to strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>(1) The authors should analyze if the downregulation of MCT1 is also observed in other types of neurons (cortex or hippocampus for instance) to determine if the observed deficit is restricted to the retina or is a common alteration of the neurons.</p><p>(2) Several key publications are missing from the manuscript and we encourage the authors to include relevant publications related to their work. For instance, the authors claim that most of the findings on WFS1 were obtained using cell lines and patients' fibroblasts which is not correct. Indeed, a recent publication by Crouzier et al., Sci Transl Med 2022 characterized the impact of the loss of function in the Wfs1 knock-out animals on calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial activity in isolated cortical and hippocampal neurons. Moreover, the author did not cite the generation and phenotyping of zebrafish models of the pathology describing a visual phenotype (Cairns et al., Sci Rep. 2021; Crouzier et al., Hum Mol Genet. 2022). Finally, they do not cite a recent publication on the role of Wfs1 in Tau pathology (Chen et al., Acta Neuropathol 2022).</p><p>3) The function of isolated RGCs mitochondria should be analyzed in order to determine if the decrease in ATP is due to the decrease in lactate export or the combination of an altered mitochondria function in the RGCs plus lactate deficiency.</p><p>(4) An immunohistochemistry analysis of MCT1 expression should be realized on the optic nerve.</p><p>(5) The pan-RGCs marker RBMPs label only 50 % of the RGCs. Therefore, other markers should be used such as BRN3A to support the conclusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am very convinced with the results and the conclusion made from the evidence by the authors. However, I have a few suggestions for the authors.</p><p>1. The authors completely missed to acknowledge the recent development of the zebrafish model of wolfram syndrome which shows optic atrophy, and loss of vision. In the introduction, it would be good to acknowledge the recent finding of the zebrafish model of wolfram syndrome that recapitulates the clinical hallmarks of human wolfram syndrome (Cairns et al., 2021). Cairns and colleagues have demonstrated that wfs1b knockout zebrafish has loss of vision (slower optokinetic response), thinning of optic nerve layer (OCT examination), reduced number of RGCs in the retina, and further defects in motor neurons formation.</p><p>Reference: Cairns G, Burté F, Price R, O'Connor E, Toms M, Mishra R, Moosajee M, Pyle A, Sayer JA, Yu-Wai-Man P. A mutant wfs1 zebrafish model of Wolfram syndrome manifesting visual dysfunction and developmental delay. Sci Rep. 2021 Oct 14;11(1):20491. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-99781-0. PMID: 34650143; PMCID: PMC8516871.</p><p>2. &quot;No deep characterization of the Wfs1 mutant visual structures has been yet reported and the data available refer exclusively to eye morphology in relatively young animals (Waszczykowska et al., 2020)&quot;- this statement should be rewritten mentioning that this is only true for rodent model and worth acknowledging the efforts made in a zebrafish model of Wolfram syndrome.</p><p>There have been no reports of defects in eye morphology in rodents but this is not true for any wolfram syndrome model. Cairns et al., 2021 have shown the defects in eye morphology with OCT imaging, retinal thickness analysis along with behavioural characterization in the zebrafish model of wolfram syndrome. However, they have not shown the molecular mechanism that could be responsible for RGCs loss and this study shows this.</p><p>3. In the Proteomics analysis of Wfs1 mutant retinas section, &quot;MCT1 levels were downregulated whereas the levels of MCT2 were upregulated. It is not very clear to me why the level of MCT2 is upregulated, Is it a compensatory mechanism? Does Wfs1 also interact with MCT2?</p><p>4. &quot;To determine the causal relationship between Wolframin and MCT1, we transiently expressed MCT1-V5 and Wolframin- mCherry forms in HEK293 and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Interestingly, MCT1-V5 was efficiently retrieved from the Wolframin-mCherry immunoprecipitated samples indicating that the two proteins can associate together in the same protein complex&quot;.</p><p>I am not very convinced here how the authors claim that MCT1 and Wfs1 associate in the same protein complex as it is completely possible that Wfs1 and MCT1 interact with each other and that's the reason that co-immunoprecipitate rather than assuming that they are associated in the same protein complex. They could be a part of different protein complex/pathway and interacts with each other. Additional results would be required for this statement. Have the authors done any other experiment that could suggest that MCT1 and WFS1 associate in the same protein complex?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81779.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Findings should be discussed relative to all relevant literature.

Interestingly, both measurements were equivalent between the two genotypes at 2 months suggesting that retinal functions are fully operative in early adulthood despite Wfs1 gene inactivation. However, we detected an initial prolonged implicit time in pERG recordings in 4 months old <italic>Wfs1</italic> deficient implying that retinal dysfunctions initiate earlier than the 8 months when we performed the initial recording in the original manuscript.

Is the decrease in ATP due to the decrease in lactate export or the combination of an altered mitochondria function in the RGCs plus lactate deficiency?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, the total loss of ATP that we measured in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant retinal tissues can well be the result of both the lack of the energetic metabolite transfer from glial cells together with the altered mitochondrial functions in neuronal cells. This scenario is suggested by the mitochondrial dysfunctions in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant cells already analyzed in previous publications that we have fully described in the introduction of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Direct demonstration of the proposed relationship between lactate accumulation and Wolframin/MCT1 depletion, i.e. in primary oligodendrocyte cultures from control and Wolframin mutant mice, would greatly strengthen this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we are currently missing in the lab the expertise to generate primary mouse oligodendrocyte cultures and establishing this procedure would have required significantly more time than the period granted for revising the work. However, to provide further evidence of the close functional interplay between wolframin and MCT1, we inactivated <italic>WFS1</italic> by CRISPR/Cas9 technology in HeLa cells that show appreciable levels of both wolframin and MCT1. Intriguingly, we confirmed that <italic>WFS1</italic> mutant HeLa cells displayed a strong reduction in MCT1 protein levels. These results are presented in the new Supplementary Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Why is MCT2 is upregulated? Does Wfs1 also interact with MCT2?</p></disp-quote><p>The MCT2 isoform is found upregulated in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant retinal tissues (Figure 6C). However, we did not find evidence of interaction of the two proteins in co-IP assays (data not shown). Importantly, we found that MCT2 does not preferentially localizes in glial cells, but conversely in neuronal cell bodies and axons. Thus, in the discussion we postulated that MCT2 is upregulated in <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutant retinal tissues as a compensatory mechanism in the neuronal cells to maximize the entrance of lactate despite its poor extracellular availability from the surrounding glial cells (Figure 7).</p></body></sub-article></article>
