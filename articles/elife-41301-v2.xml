Studying such spatial organization by optical imaging is challenging, partially due to the dense packing of stochastically oriented Golgi stacks. Using super-resolution microscopy and markers such as Giantin, we developed a method to identify en face and side views of individual nocodazole-induced Golgi mini-stacks. Our imaging uncovered that Golgi enzymes preferentially localize to the cisternal interior, appearing as a central disk or inner-ring, whereas components of the trafficking machinery reside at the periphery of the stack, including the cisternal rim. Interestingly, conventional secretory cargos appeared at the cisternal interior during their intra-Golgi trafficking and transiently localized to the cisternal rim before exiting the Golgi. In contrast, bulky cargos were found only at the rim. Our study therefore directly demonstrates the spatial separation of processing and transport functions within the Golgi complex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Golgi complex</kwd><kwd>cisternal membrane</kwd><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd><kwd>Golgi enzyme</kwd><kwd>intra-Golgi trafficking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tier3 MOE2012-T3-1-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sandin</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tier1 RG132/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tier1 RG35/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tier1 RG48/13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tier2 MOE2015-T2-2-073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NMRC/CBRG/007/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transport machinery localizes at the cisternal rim while modification machinery localizes at the interior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Golgi complex is one of the most important processing and sorting stations along the secretory and endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glick and Luini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klumperman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu and Hong, 2014</xref>). In mammalian cells, it consists of a network of laterally linked Golgi stacks. As the structural unit, a Golgi stack comprises 4–7 flattened cisternae and can be divided into <italic>cis</italic>, medial and <italic>trans</italic>-regions. The <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi region further develops into the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN). It is known that the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi receives secretory cargos from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit site (ERES) and ER Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), while the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi and TGN exchange materials with endosomes and the plasma membrane (PM). At the moment, we still don’t understand how the Golgi becomes organized and works at the molecular and cellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glick and Luini, 2011</xref>). One of the challenges in studying the Golgi is to spatiotemporally resolve residents and transiting cargos among individual cisternae of Golgi stacks, a task currently beyond the capabilities of even super-resolution and electron microscopy (EM).</p><p>It has been hypothesized that the two principal functions of the Golgi, processing and transport, are spatially organized for optimal efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patterson et al., 2008</xref>). However, such molecular organization across the Golgi stack has not been directly demonstrated. Previously, by utilizing nocodazole-induced Golgi mini-stacks, we developed a conventional microscopy based super-resolution method, named GLIM (Golgi localization by imaging center of fluorescence mass), to quantitatively map the axial position or localization quotient (LQ) of a Golgi protein with nanometer accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tie et al., 2016b</xref>). To understand the molecular organization of the Golgi mini-stack, the lateral localization, which refers to the distribution of a protein within Golgi cisternal membrane sheets, is also required. Although more structural details of the Golgi can be resolved with the advent of the super-resolution microscopy, it is still difficult to unambiguously interpret Golgi features due to the dense packing of stochastically oriented Golgi stacks. Here, we established a method to systematically study the lateral localization of Golgi proteins. We found that Golgi enzymes and components of trafficking machinery are spatially separated to the interior and periphery, respectively, of the Golgi stack, while secretory cargos with bulky sizes are excluded from the interior during their intra-Golgi transition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Giantin, GPP130 and Golgin84 localize to the cisternal rim of the Golgi mini-stack</title><p>There have been extensive evidences demonstrating that the nocodazole-induced Golgi mini-stack is a valid model of the native Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cole et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rogalski et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Van De Moortele et al., 1993</xref>) and we have previously discussed its advantages in studying the molecular and spatial organization of the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tie et al., 2016b</xref>). Apparently, the lateral localization of a Golgi protein is best revealed by its en face and side view, when the Golgi axis is roughly orthogonal and parallel, respectively, to the image plane. We found that the orientation of a mini-stack can be identified by Golgi markers, such as Giantin, Golgin84 and GPP130. Airyscan super-resolution microscopy clearly revealed their staining patterns as rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Assuming cisternae of a Golgi mini-stack are round membrane disks, we reasoned that these proteins must localize to the rim of their corresponding cisternae and their ring appearances must correspond to en face or oblique views (hereafter en face views) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected for the orthogonal section of a ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), side view images of Giantin, Golgin84 and GPP130 displayed a double-punctum, the connecting line of which is roughly orthogonal to the Golgi-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To describe the localization pattern of a population of mini-stacks, we developed a method to average multiple en face view images of Golgi mini-stacks, by applying size and intensity normalization followed by alignment according to their centers of fluorescence mass (see Materials and methods). En face averaged Giantin, Golgin84 and GPP130 demonstrated their lateral localization patterns as concentric circular rings of difference sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). To substantiate our light microscopic data, we imaged APEX2-fused GPP130 by EM using native NRK cells that were not subjected to nocodazole treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Out of 57 Golgi stacks that we randomly imaged from 25 cells, 68% demonstrated a predominant cisternal rim localization in side or en face views (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), supporting the ring staining pattern observed. The rim localization of Giantin was also corroborated in a previous immuno-EM study, furthring supporting our data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koreishi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41301.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identifying the en face and side view of the Golgi mini-stack.</title><p>All cells are nocodazole-treated HeLa cells and all images are super-resolution images unless specified otherwise.

It is known that the epitope of our antibody is at the N-terminus while Giantin anchors onto the Golgi membrane via its extreme C-terminal transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Linstedt et al., 1995</xref>). A fully extended Giantin molecule is predicted to reach 450 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Munro, 2011</xref>). Hence, it is possible that the large diameter of Giantin-ring can be due to Giantin’s extended structure instead of the physical dimension of Giantin-positive cisternae. However, we think this is not the case due to our following observations. First, we raised an antibody against its C-terminal cytosolic region and ring-patterns resulted from N- and C-terminal antibodies colocalized very well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Quantitative analysis revealed that the mean diameter of the C-terminus ring is ~50 nm smaller than that of the N-terminus one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), far less than the value predicted for the fully extended molecule, which is 900 nm. Second, the C-terminal 129 amino acid fragment of Giantin (mScarlet-Giantin-C129), which has a LQ similar to native Giantin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), displayed almost the same ring-pattern as the N-terminal antibody (hereafter Giantin antibody unless indicated otherwise) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Third, similarly, the N- and C-termini of other Golgins such as GM130 and GCC185 also showed overlapping ring-patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). In summary, although individual Golgins might adopt long filamentous conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Munro, 2011</xref>), ensemble-averaged Golgins, as visualized in bulk by light microscopy, appear to have a closely adjacent N- and C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheung et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the ring-pattern staining of Giantin should closely represent the cisternal rim.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id

of Giantin, GPP130 or Golgin84, we can conveniently identify en face and side view oriented Golgi mini-stacks, images of which should appear as a ring and double-punctum, respectively. It was discovered that some Golgi residents, such as MGAT2, localized to the interior of Giantin-rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, side views of MGAT2 appeared as a short bar connecting the Giantin double-punctum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Under the EM, MGAT2-APEX2-GFP preferentially localized to the cisternal interior (next section).

Two types of residents were studied in this work — components of trafficking machinery, including those involved in the structure and organization of the Golgi, and enzymes involved in the post-translational modifications, particularly glycosyltransferases. Due to the lack of reagents to detect endogenous proteins, many residents were detected by the overexpression of their tagged fusions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Caution must be taken in the interpretation of our data as it has been documented that overexpression can change both the axial and lateral localization of Golgi residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cosson et al., 2005</xref>).

Instead, they corresponded to the rim of cisternae in oblique or en face views (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). In the more densely packed region, cisternae appeared to pile on top of each other, a configuration that requires much higher z-axis resolution to be resolved.

A more systematic investigation is required to resolve this discrepancy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Bulky size prevents the localization of secretory cargos at the cisternal interior</title><p>Based on EM data, Rothman lab previously proposed that large secretory protein aggregates are segregated to the cisternal rim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lavieu et al., 2013</xref>). To investigate if bulky cargos partition to the rim, we imaged the RUSH reporter GFP-collagenX, a soluble secretory protein that tends to form oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kwan et al., 1991</xref>), by Airyscan super-resolution microscopy. We observed that Golgi-transiting GFP-collagenX appeared either diffuse or punctate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Assuming that Golgi-localized GFP-collagenX puncta were single multimeric aggregates, using GFP-tagged nucleoporin Nup133 as an in vivo GFP fluorescence standard, we estimated that Golgi-transiting GFP-collagenX puncta had 190 ± 20 copies (n = 77) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). The diffused collagenX is probably in a much lower oligomeric state. Throughout its intra-Golgi trafficking, collagenX, either in punctate or diffuse appearance, was excluded from the interior of Giantin-rings, where co-expressed mCherry-GPI clearly localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>). Instead, it always resided at the rim, either colocalizing with Giantin or surrounding Giantin-rings as discrete puncta. At later stages, the puncta outside Giantin-rings were probably exocytic carriers targeting to the PM.</p><p>We also tested soluble and transmembrane secretory cargos, FM4-moxGFP and GFP-FM4-CD8a, whose aggregation states can be controlled by the small molecule — D/D solubilizer. These two cargos are similar to the ones used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lavieu et al., 2013</xref>). NRK cells expressing either cargo were treated with D/D solubilizer at 20°C for 2 hr to accumulate and arrest the de-aggregated chimera at the Golgi mini-stack. At 20°C, cells were subsequently subjected to 2 hr of incubation in the presence or absence of D/D solubilizer to either de-aggregate or aggregate the cargo respectively (nocodazole was in the system throughout the procedure). Our previous work has established that secretory cargos such as VSVG are mostly arrested at the medial Golgi under 20°C treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tie et al., 2016b</xref>). In some experiments, 10 min warm up at 37°C was conducted before imaging. Using this protocol, the re-aggregated GFP-FM4-CD8a and FM4-moxGFP Golgi puncta upon D/D washout were estimated to have 830 ± 30 (n = 184) and 660 ± 50 (n = 127) copies, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). We observed that, when in the de-aggregated state, both soluble and membrane FM4-chimeras localized to the interior of Giantin-rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3E</xref>).

We established a method to identify the cisternal rim and interior by taking advantage of rim-localized Golgi markers. In addition to quantitative axial localization using the LQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tie et al., 2016b</xref>), we further showed the advantage of nocodazole-induced Golgi mini-stacks in elucidating the molecular organization of the Golgi complex.

It was proposed that these tightly packed protein arrays comprise Golgi enzymes. Our super-resolution and EM data from the Golgi mini-stack provide direct evidence supporting this hypothesis. These enzyme-arrays might organize as an ‘enzyme matrix’ to 1) stack cisternal membrane, 2) retain Golgi enzymes or accessory proteins and 3) exclude trafficking machinery components by a possible molecular crowding mechanism. Therefore, it seems that, collectively, Golgi enzymes determine and maintain the characteristic structure of the Golgi complex.</p><p>Most secretory cargos in higher eukaryotes undergo glycosylation in the Golgi complex. Our finding that the cisternal interior and rim correspond to processing and transport domain, respectively, implies that secretory cargos must access interior domains of different cisternae and then reside there long enough for sequential glycosylation. This is indeed what we observed for conventional cargos, such as GPI-anchored proteins, Furin, E-cadherin, VSVG and secretory GFP. On the other hand, these cargos probably have a sufficiently short residence time in the cisternal rim, in which they are either retrieved and retained by the ‘enzyme matrix’ to the interior or packed into membrane carriers targeting to the PM at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi. It seems that the retention by the ‘enzyme matrix’ occurs by default and is independent of glycosylation because secretory GFP is preferentially found within the cisternal interior. However, this is not the case for bulky cargos, such as collagenX and aggregated GFP-FM4-CD8a and FM4-moxGFP, which localized only at the rim and were excluded from the interior. These observations suggest that bulky cargos might be incompatible with the crowded molecular environment of the tightly packed ‘enzyme matrix’ and/or the narrow luminal space at the interior, which can have a width of &lt;10 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engel et al., 2015</xref>). Rim partitioning of large secretory cargos has previously been noted by EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lavieu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Volchuk et al., 2000</xref>). Here, we directly visualized by light microscopy the size-dependent lateral partitioning of secretory cargos within the Golgi stack.</p><p>This study did not attempt to resolve different intra-Golgi trafficking models and our discoveries can be explained by both cisternal progression and stable compartment models or their modified variants.

Fluorophores were excited by three laser lines with wavelengths of 488, 561 and 640 nm and their respective emission bandwidths were 495–550 nm, 595–620 nm and long pass 645 nm. The microscope system was controlled by ZEN software (Carl Zeiss). Pixel size of images ranged from 40 to 54 nm. For 3D imaging, the z-step of image stacks was 170 nm. Image stacks were subjected to Airyscan processing and maximal intensity projection (MIP) in ZEN software. Image analysis was performed in Fiji (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/Fiji">https://imagej.net/Fiji</ext-link>).

Mini-stack images were first cropped to square shape and subjected to background subtraction. To quantify the size of the Giantin-ring, we adopted the concept of the gyradius from physics. For pixel i in the Giantin-ring image, assuming that I<sub>i</sub> is its intensity and r<sub>i</sub> is its distance to the center of fluorescence mass, the gyradius of the Giantin-ring can be calculated as<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:msqrt><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>with all pixels of the image considered. The macro ‘gyradius and intensity normalization’ (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>) calculates the gyradius of Giantin in a set of multi-channel images and resizes the set of images so that the gyradius of Giantin is 100 pixels. The canvas of the image set is further expanded to 701 × 701 pixel. Using the macro ‘Golgi mini-stack alignment’ (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode2">Source code 2</xref>), Golgi marker images are aligned so that their centers of fluorescence mass are at (350, 350), the center of the image. The en face averaged Golgi mini-stack image is acquired by z-projection of these aligned images. The radial mean intensity profile is acquired using the macro ‘Radial mean intensity profile’ (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode3">Source code 3</xref>). The mean intensity of all pixels within a circle around the center of the fluorescence mass is plotted against its radius (ranging from 1 to 350 pixels). The radius of a Golgi marker is defined by the half maximum position of its outer slope of the intensity plot and is normalized by the corresponding radius of Giantin.

HeLa cells were co-transfected with shNup133-1 and GFP-Nup133-mut to knock down the endogenous Nup133 and replace it with shRNA-resistant GFP-Nup133-mut. The resulting nuclear pores, which contain ~16 GFP-Nup133-mut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tie et al., 2016a</xref>), were used as a fluorescence standard to quantify the copy number of GFP-collagenX, GFP-FM4-CD8a and FM4-moxGFP at Golgi-localized puncta. Identical imaging conditions were used under Airyscan super-resolution microscopy to image Nup133 and the fluorescence protein aggregate puncta. In GFP-Nup133-mut image, a circular region of interest (ROI) that contains a nuclear pore was generated and its total intensity was quantified as I<sub>Nup</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tie et al., 2016a</xref>). The total intensity of a circular ROI containing a Golgi punctum was also similarly acquired as I<sub>punctum</sub>. The copy number of GFP-tagged chimera in the Golgi punctum was therefore calculated as 16 × I<sub>punctum</sub>/ I<sub>Nup</sub>. To quantify the copy number of FM4-moxGFP, moxGFP was assumed to be 1.47-fold brighter than EGFP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.addgene.org/fluorescent-proteins/plasmid-backbones/">https://www.addgene.org/fluorescent-proteins/plasmid-backbones/</ext-link>), which is called GFP in this study, and the copy number of FM4-moxGFP in the Golgi punctum was calculated as 10.9 × I<sub>punctum</sub>/ I<sub>Nup</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Fluorescence-conjugation of Giantin antibodies</title><p>Alexa Fluor 647 and Alexa Fluor 488 were covalently conjugated onto a commercial (BioLegend) (against the N-terminus) and our homemade (against the C-terminus) rabbit pAb against Giantin, respectively, using APEX antibody labeling kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank A Luini for discussions and the following persons for sharing their reagents with us: H Clausen, M De Matties, D Gadella, H Hauri, W Hong, A Linstedt, M Lowe, F Perez, J Rothman, E Snapp, Z Song, D Stephens, A Ting, F van Kuppeveld and Y Zhuang.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The spatial separation of processing and transport functions to the interior and periphery of the Golgi stack&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Suzanne R Pfeffer as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Frederic A Bard (Reviewer #2); Alberto Luini (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a high quality description of the spatial distribution of Golgi enzymes and trafficking machinery in nocodazole-induced Golgi ministacks using super resolution light microscopy and the RUSH system to monitor transit through the compartment. The authors find that glycosyltransferases appear to reside in the internal portion of the cisternae while trafficking machinery can be found at the rims. The work will be a valuable resource to readers of <italic>eLife</italic> if it was made more scholarly and quantification is added. We suggest that the revision be submitted in the category of a Tools and Resources article.</p><p>Most of the suggested edits are textual but important. Two experiments and some additional quantifications are required for revision.</p><p>1) The authors use different conditions to study the distribution of enzymes and of cargo proteins. They examine the former in unperturbed cells, and the latter during a traffic wave. However, intense traffic could alter the distribution of the enzymes. Please examine the distribution of at least a couple of enzymes during a traffic pulse. The results might be very interesting and will add something novel to the story.</p><p>2) The EM is of low quality and needs quantification. All EM localizations need to be quantified with a suitable N value by some metric to convince the reader of enzyme distributions across the stacks. In addition, the authors conclude that &quot;the total amount of GnT2 in these vesicles was probably much less than that in the interior since we did not find APEX2-signal outside Giantin-rings by fluorescence imaging of Golgi mini-stacks&quot;. APEX is non-linear in terms of the signal it generates and so one must be careful about concluding too much from an amplified signal. The fact that the authors did not find the APEX2-signal of GnT2 outside giantin-rings by fluorescence does not mean that GnT2 is less in vesicles than the interior. Only immunogold can tell you absolute amounts of protein, but we are not asking you to carry out immuno EM for this study.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>1) In Figure 4A and 4D, the authors show the peripheral and central distribution of small and bulky cargos during the intra Golgi-transport. The time points they study are not appropriate.</p><p>It has been extensively shown that a secretory cargo crosses the Golgi within 12-15 minutes. Their synchronization protocol does not allow one to understand what stage of intra-Golgi traffic one is observing. It might be more productive to use the 15 degree block protocol and follow cargo transport along the cis to trans axis in the next 15 min.</p><p>2) The authors conclude that &quot;large cargos preferentially partition to the cisternal rim, possibly due to their bulky sizes, while conventional or small cargos tend to locate to the interior&quot;. A problem here is that transport is synchronized at 20 °C, which is well known to arrest the secretory proteins mainly in the TGN. The TGN is morphologically and functionally different from the Golgi cisternae, and when cargo reaches the TGN, the intra Golgi transport is complete. This experiment is confusing and needs to be described with greater care.</p><p>3) Many of the proteins they study are tagged and overexpressed. This is probably necessary for many enzymes, whose endogenous levels are very low. However, overexpression might alter their distribution. This cannot really be fixed but it should be stated clearly and discussed – Orci demonstrated this in previous EM studies.</p><p>4) For the Golgi images for the various markers, the line scans reflect individual cells. It would be important to include quantitation of the number of cells showing a particular staining pattern, in addition to selected images. Figure 3G shows a summary but we could not find any values of N for the experiments. Perhaps for example markers, the localizations of 30 cells could be overlaid or a metric used to distinguish donut morphology from spheres? More quantitation is important.</p><p>5) The authors need to be more scholarly about previous immuno EM localizations of various Golgi enzymes and trafficking machinery in relation to their own story. Quantitative work of Orci and Klumperman for example, need to be referred to in a table in comparison with the present data. There is also lots of published information regarding glycosyltransferase localization at the EM level. Subsection “Glycosylation enzymes reside at the interior of a Golgi stack”, first paragraph, this was in plants, which build entirely different glycans. Please use mammalian cell references for the precise enzymes studied – and note in the text where this method confirms.</p><p>6) Subsection “trans-Golgi and TGN proteins (LQ ≥ 1.0)”. In most cell types, CI-M6PR (and possibly Furin) is in perinuclear late endosomes next to the Golgi, which would explain lack of co-localization with TGN markers. The clathrin stain has been shown previously to be in a distinct TGN microdomain (Brown et al., 2011). Please correct the text.</p><p>7) In the Discussion section, they suggest that the enzymes might be a major component of the protein intracisternal matrix that has been previously visualized by other authors by EM. But this is very unlikely to be the case, as Golgi enzymes are expressed in very low copy numbers.</p><p>They venture into speculation about the transport mechanism within the Golgi. It is obvious that the distributions at steady state of cargo proteins and enzymes does not allow them to distinguish between transport models, and the authors actually state that they do not want to speculate on their observations in this regard. In the previous paragraph, however, they suggest that the observed lateral distributions can be linked to anterograde vesicular movement of the cargo proteins which, once deposited in the cisterna would reach the central domain of the cisterna to be glycosylated by enzymes residing in that region. This is an interpretation in favor of the anterograde vesicular transport model. Here the authors draw conclusions that are not based on data and at the same time contradict themselves. Please adhere to a simpler unbiased logic in the Discussion.</p><p>8) It seems that the sentence &quot;conventional secretory cargos were observed to transit the cisternal interior before exiting the Golgi at the rim&quot; in the Abstract is more an extrapolation from the data than an observed phenomenon. Since it bears on the debate of cisternal maturation versus vesicular transport of cargo, please modify the text.</p><p>9) It would improve greatly the accessibility of the paper to have a summary model in the form of a 3D graphic. It would also be interesting (although maybe not for this paper) to have a simple website document summarizing the sub-cellular localisations of all these Golgi proteins.</p><p>10) It should be discussed that most enzymes studied are related to the N-glycosylation pathway. It should also be explained which enzymes are not part of this pathway. Indeed, most glycosylation enzymes are involved in specific glycosylation pathways and different pathways may have slightly different enzymatic distributions within the Golgi.</p><p>11) Is there evidence that bulky cargoes have less elaborated N-glycans than small cargoes?</p><p>12) COPII components localisation: is this specific for nocodazole induced mini-stacks? It is known indeed that mini-stacks form near ERES. Do the authors think these values would hold for a normal Golgi?</p><p>13) The authors propose that some enzymes have a different cisternal distribution (inner ring for some). Is it possible to compare with data obtained using FRET, notably by the group of Sakari Kellokumpu?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41301.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors use different conditions to study the distribution of enzymes and of cargo proteins.

We studied the effect of the synchronized trafficking wave of RUSH reporter, VSVG-SBP-Flag, on the lateral distribution of ST6Gal1-moxGFP. HeLa cells co-expressing VSVG-SBP-Flag, ST6Gal1-moxGFP and GalT-mCherry were treated with biotin to chase VSVG and en face averaged images were acquired (the average of size and intensity normalized and center aligned en face images; please see the revised Materials and methods). Cisternal rim ROI was defined by the donut formed by the radius of en face averaged ST6Gal1-moxGFP (not subjected to traffic wave) and that of Giantin-ring. The percentage of ST6Gal1 within the interior was quantified at different chase time (min) and is shown in revised Figure 5—figure supplement 2 with the corresponding plot of VSVG-SBP-Flag’s LQ vs. time from the same experiment.</p><p>We did not observe any obvious change of the interior localization of Golgi enzymes. However, it is an important control to demonstrate the interior localization of enzymes under traffic wave. We have inserted the below text to the Results section: “The secretory cargo wave does not seem to grossly affect the interior distribution of Golgi enzymes, as evidenced by ST6Gal1 (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). […] A more systematic investigation is required to resolve this discrepancy.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The EM is of low quality and needs quantification.

From almost 60 Golgi stacks imaged for each construct, we found that, for MGAT2, 93% (n=58 from 14 cells) stacks demonstrated interior localization while, for GPP130, 68% (n=57 from 25 cells) stacks displayed rim localization. We have modified the manuscript to include these data.</p><p>We agree that the APEX2-catalyzed reaction is non-linear and deleted the conclusion that “the total amount of GnT2 in these vesicles was probably much less than that in the interior”. Below is the revised corresponding text:</p><p>“Noticeably, APEX2-generated electron density was also found in vesicles and budding profiles at the rim (arrow heads in Figure 4I). However, we did not find MGAT2 (Figure 1K and 4C) or MGAT2-APEX2 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1U) signal outside Giantin-rings by fluorescence imaging of Golgi mini-stacks.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>1) In Figure 4A and 4D, the authors show the peripheral and central distribution of small and bulky cargos during the intra Golgi-transport.

This should not be an issue since we also showed (in Figure 4B, 4E and 4F) plots of LQ vs. time measured from the same experimental data sets. LQ vs. time plots very accurately and numerically indicate the position of secretory cargos within the Golgi stack or the secretory pathway at the time of interest. Take note that LQ is linear and 0.0 and 1.0 correspond to GM130 and GalT-mCherry localizations respectively. Therefore, by combining both en face view imaging and LQ vs. time data (A and B; D and E, F), we are able to tell the lateral distribution (rim or interior) of a cargo when it is at a precise intra-Golgi position along the cis-trans axis of the Golgi mini-stack.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors conclude that &quot;large cargos preferentially partition to the cisternal rim, possibly due to their bulky sizes, while conventional or small cargos tend to locate to the interior&quot;.

The TGN is morphologically and functionally different from the Golgi cisternae, and when cargo reaches the TGN, the intra Golgi transport is complete. This experiment is confusing and needs to be described with greater care.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous study, we demonstrated that, at 15 and 20°C, the LQ of secretory cargo VSVG-GFP was arrested at −0.06 ± 0.03 (n = 97) and 0.56 ± 0.03 (n= 124), corresponding to the cis<italic>-</italic> and medial-Golgi localization, respectively (Tie et al., 2016). Our data indicated that at least a significant pool of a small secretory cargo does not reach the trans-Golgi or TGN at 20 °C. The LQ value of 0.56 for VSVG-GFP is likely resulted from the almost even distribution from the cis to trans-Golgi cisternae at 20 °C. Therefore, there should be still intra-Golgi transport after warming up the system to 37 °C.</p><p>We added the following sentence to give this background information: “Our previous work has established that secretory cargos such as VSVG are mostly arrested at the medial Golgi under 20 °C treatment (Tie et al., 2016)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Many of the proteins they study are tagged and overexpressed. This is probably necessary for many enzymes, whose endogenous levels are very low. However, overexpression might alter their distribution. This cannot really be fixed but it should be stated clearly and discussed – Orci demonstrated this in previous EM studies.</p></disp-quote><p>The problem of the overexpression on a protein’s subcellular localization is a general and valid concern for all studies. It certainly applies to our study. We think that this reviewer refers to the following paper: Dynamic transport of SNARE proteins in the Golgi apparatus by Cosson et al. (2005), where the authors studied the effect of overexpression of SNAREs on its localization in comparison to endogenous ones. We have modified our text in Results by adding the below sentences: “Due to the lack of reagents to detect endogenous proteins, many residents were detected by the overexpression of their tagged fusions (Table 1). Caution must be taken in the interpretation of our data as it has been documented that overexpression can change both the axial and lateral localization of Golgi residents (Cosson et al., 2005).”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For the Golgi images for the various markers, the line scans reflect individual cells.

Perhaps for example markers, the localizations of 30 cells could be overlaid or a metric used to distinguish donut morphology from spheres? More quantitation is important.</p></disp-quote><p>We have developed a software tool to average en face view images of Golgi mini-stacks. Golgi mini-stacks were first co-stained for Giantin and a testing Golgi marker. En face view images of a Golgi marker were subsequently size-normalized by radii of their corresponding Giantin-rings, intensity-normalized to 200 million and aligned according to their centers of fluorescence mass. Only Golgi residents localizing to the stack (LQ in between 0 and 1) were averaged. The en face averaging provides a powerful tool to survey a large number of mini-stack images and extract information such as radius and radial mean intensity profile. The radius of a Golgi marker were normalized by that of Giantin (normalized radius) and plotted against the Golgi marker’s LQ. In revamped Figure 4J (previously Figure 3G), the normalized lateral distribution vs. LQ plot was replaced by normalized radius vs. LQ. The number of mini-stack images used for averaging is indicated by n in Figure 4J. Through en face averaging, we further found that TPST2-GFP displays inner ring appearance. Figures have been modified to include these averaged images and corresponding radial mean intensity profiles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors need to be more scholarly about previous immuno EM localizations of various Golgi enzymes and trafficking machinery in relation to their own story. Quantitative work of Orci and Klumperman for example, need to be referred to in a table in comparison with the present data.</p></disp-quote><p>EM studies on the Golgi mostly concerned the cis-trans or axial localizations. As suggested by this reviewer, we have examined past quantitative EM studies, especially those from Orci, Luini and Klumperman labs, on the lateral distributions of Golgi residents or Golgi transiting secretory cargos. It is difficult to compare EM results with our light microscopy data since definitions of interior and rim are likely to differ. Our attempt of such comparison is now summarized in Appendix 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is also lots of published information regarding glycosyltransferase localization at the EM level.

[…] Second, it has been documented that the sub-Golgi localization of enzymes can be cell-type dependent (Velasco et al., 1993).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “trans-Golgi and TGN proteins (LQ ≥ 1.0)”. In most cell types, CI-M6PR (and possibly Furin) is in perinuclear late endosomes next to the Golgi, which would explain lack of co-localization with TGN markers. The clathrin stain has been shown previously to be in a distinct TGN microdomain (Brown et al., 2011). Please correct the text.</p></disp-quote><p>In native cells (without nocodazole treatment), a significant pool of CI-M6PR localizes to the perinuclear late endosome. Therefore, there are CI-M6PR positive punctate structures near the TGN but they neither co-localize with the TGN nor do they represent carriers or budding profiles directly derived from the TGN, as commented by this reviewer. However, in cells treated with nocodazole, CI-M6PR positive late endosomes are no longer perinuclear and, instead, they localize throughout the cytosol. Therefore, except by chances, late endosomes are not commonly found near Golgi mini-stacks and a majority CI-M6PR punctate structures should be membrane profiles derived from the TGN. Hence, we think that the distinct localization pattern of CI-M6PR can be explained by their localization at the different domain of the TGN from other markers. We have cited the suggested JCB paper by Brown et al. for the microdomain of TGN and Ladinsky et al. (1999) for clathrin microdomains, which are projected away from the Golgi stack.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the Discussion section, they suggest that the enzymes might be a major component of the protein intracisternal matrix that has been previously visualized by other authors by EM.

Please adhere to a simpler unbiased logic in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We are open to all possible models of intra-Golgi trafficking. Thanks for pointing out this discrepancy. We have modified the corresponding text: “On the other hand, these cargos probably have a sufficiently short residence time in the cisternal rim, in which they are either retrieved and retained by the “enzyme matrix” to the interior or packed into membrane carriers targeting to the PM at the trans-Golgi”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It seems that the sentence &quot;conventional secretory cargos were observed to transit the cisternal interior before exiting the Golgi at the rim&quot; in the Abstract is more an extrapolation from the data than an observed phenomenon.

We will map more sub-Golgi localizations or LQs of Golgi residents and publish these data in certain form in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) It should be discussed that most enzymes studied are related to the N-glycosylation pathway. It should also be explained which enzymes are not part of this pathway. Indeed, most glycosylation enzymes are involved in specific glycosylation pathways and different pathways may have slightly different enzymatic distributions within the Golgi.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, the following text was added to Results to categorize enzymes in our study: “We studied components of Golgi post-translational modification machinery (Table 1; Supplementary file 1), including a GDP-fucose transporter, SLC35C1 (Lubke et al., 2001), and more than a dozen enzymes involved in N-glycosylation (ManIB1, MGAT1, ManII, MGAT2, GalT, SialT and MGAT4B), O-glycosylation (GalNT1, GalNT2 and POMGNT1), poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis (β4GalT3), glycosaminoglycan synthesis (β3GalT6 and β4GalT7) and sulfation (TPST1 and 2)”. Therefore, in addition to N-glycosylation enzymes, enzymes involved in other glycosylation and post-translational modifications were also studied.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Is there evidence that bulky cargoes have less elaborated N-glycans than small cargoes?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question that we also wanted to address. We reported in this manuscript that bulky cargoes transit through the rim of Golgi cisternae while Golgi enzymes localize to the interior. According to our knowledge, it is currently unclear whether bulky cargoes have less elaborated N- or O-glycosylation than small cargos. We think that the rim partition probably doesn’t abolish the Golgi-type N-glycosylation modification of large secretory cargos. This is because: (1) ManI, MGAT4B and ManII can localize to the rim; (2) minor amount of enzymes could transiently pass through the rim; and (3) the low amount of glycosylation enzymes could be sufficient to modify the low copy numbers of the large secretory cargos in the rim.</p><p>As the best known large secretory cargo, collagen has been noted to be extensively O-glycosylated by galactosyl and glucosyl transferases. Interestingly, different from the O-glycosylation at the Golgi, the O-glycosylation of collagen takes place in the ER before its triple helical structure is assembled (Kadler, 1994). Collagen galactosyltransferase contains RDEL ER localization-motif (Schegg et al., 2009) and has been shown to localize to the ER (Liefhebber et al., 2010). However, some collagens, such as Col4a1 and Col4a2, have single N-glycosylation (Basak et al., 2016), suggesting that collagen might complete the N-glycan modification in the Golgi. Another large secretory cargo, high molecular weight adiponectin, similarly has N-glycan in addition to extensive galactosyl and glucosyl O-glycosylation modifications at the ER.</p><p>It is probably difficult to design experiments to address this question since the glycosylation process is usually unique for each protein. Hence, it would be a good strategy if the glycosylation of the same protein can be compared between its monomer and aggregated form. One experiment that we can think of is the small molecule inducible aggregation cargos, such as FM4, engineered with artificial glycosylation motifs. However, for a tight aggregate, it is likely that only surface-exposed glycosylation sites can be accessed and modified by enzymes, resulting in a much lower glycosylation efficiency than monomers and thus obscuring result interpretation.</p><p>Therefore, although this is a very interesting question that would be a good follow up study, no conclusion can be made at this stage. We therefore did not discuss it in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) COPII components localisation: is this specific for nocodazole induced mini-stacks? It is known indeed that mini-stacks form near ERES. Do the authors think these values would hold for a normal Golgi?</p></disp-quote><p>The LQs of COPII components only apply to the nocodazole-induced Golgi mini-stacks. In native cells that are not treated with nocodazole, COPII and ERES are not physically coupled to the Golgi stacks and their distances can vary greatly. However, we think that LQ values still provide important information for the logical organization of the ERES, ERGIC and Golgi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The authors propose that some enzymes have a different cisternal distribution (inner ring for some). Is it possible to compare with data obtained using FRET, notably by the group of Sakari Kellokumpu?</p></disp-quote><p>We found that Man1B1, ManII and MGAT4B appear as inner-rings concentric to corresponding Giantin-rings while other N-glycosylation enzymes localize to the central disk. FRET studies from Kellokumpu lab reported that, among Golgi N-glycosylation enzymes they tested, including MGAT1, MGAT2, GalT and ST6Gal1, only MGAT1/2 and GalT/ ST6Gal1 were found to assemble as heteromeric complexes (Hassinen et al., 2010). Our lateral localization data are consistent with the report from Kellokumpu lab as both MGAT1/2 and GalT/ ST6Gal1 complexes localize to the central disk and the heteromeric interaction might contribute to such interior localization.</p><p>References:</p><p>Basak T, Vega-Montoto L, Zimmerman LJ, Tabb DL, Hudson BG, Vanacore RM.
