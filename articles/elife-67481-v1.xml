frequently detected genomic imbalance events in congenital heart disease (CHD) patients. However, a portion of CHD-associated 4q deletions without known CHD genes suggests unknown CHD genes within these intervals. Here, we have shown that knockdown of <italic>SORBS2</italic>, a 4q interval gene, disrupted sarcomeric integrity of cardiomyocytes and caused reduced cardiomyocyte number in human embryonic stem cell differentiation model. Molecular analyses revealed decreased expression of second heart field (SHF) marker genes and impaired NOTCH and SHH signaling in <italic>SORBS2-</italic>knockdown cells. Exogenous SHH rescued <italic>SORBS2</italic> knockdown-induced cardiomyocyte differentiation defects. <italic>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse mutants had atrial septal hypoplasia/aplasia or double atrial septum (DAS) derived from impaired posterior SHF with a similar expression alteration. Rare <italic>SORBS2</italic> variants were significantly enriched in a cohort of 300 CHD patients. Our findings indicate that <italic>SORBS2</italic> is a regulator of SHF development and its variants contribute to CHD pathogenesis. The presence of DAS in <italic>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hearts reveals the first molecular etiology of this rare anomaly linked to paradoxical thromboembolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group

variation in human genome and causes a variety of genetic syndromes. The identification of causal disease gene(s) within CNV intervals is crucial to understand the pathogenesis of the related disease. Chromosome 4q deletion syndrome is a genetic disease resulting from a chromosomal aberration that causes the missing of a portion of chromosome four long arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Strehle and Bantock, 2003</xref>). Patients have a spectrum of clinical manifestations including craniofacial, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal abnormalities, and mental and growth deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Strehle and Bantock, 2003</xref>). Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a common defect seen in about half of the 4q deletion patients. A previous study narrowed the cardiovascular critical region to 4q32.2–q34.3, which contains <italic>TLL1</italic>, <italic>HPGD</italic>, and <italic>HAND2</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Over-represented right-sided CHDs in 4q deletion syndrome patients suggest that <italic>HAND2</italic>, an essential regulator of the second heart field (SHF), is mainly responsible for the CHD phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2002</xref>). However, a part of terminal 4q deletions with CHDs that we and others have discovered does not cover <italic>HAND2</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Strehle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsai et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>SORBS2</italic> within chromosomal 4q35.1 has been proposed as a candidate gene for CHD of terminal 4q deletion syndrome based on an unusual small interstitial deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Strehle et al., 2012</xref>). However, there has been no further evidence to substantiate it ever since. Here, we have presented evidence from in vitro cardiogenesis, animal model, and mutation analyses to demonstrate that <italic>SORBS2</italic> is a genetic factor regulating cardiac development and contributing to cardiac malformation of the CHD population.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>SORBS2</italic> is required for cardiomyocyte differentiation and the integrity of sarcomeric structure</title><p>To recapitulate <italic>SORBS2</italic> haploinsufficiency of 4q deletion, we knocked down <italic>SORBS2</italic> in human embryonic stem cell lines (H1-hESC).

Previous studies have shown that CHD is observed more frequently in patients with the terminal deletion at 4q31 than in patients with the terminal deletion at 4q34 or 4q35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 1988</xref>). Since some terminal 4q deletions that do not cover <italic>HAND2</italic> still manifest conotruncal defects, there may be another genetic modifier in the terminal deletion region. <italic>Helt,</italic> whose human homologous <italic>HELT</italic> is located within 4q35.1, encodes a Hey-related bHLH transcription factor that is expressed in both the brain and heart, and mediates Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nakatani et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, both <italic>SORBS2</italic> and <italic>HELT</italic> haploinsufficiency might synergistically impair NOTCH signaling and cause a cardiac outlfow tract (OFT) defect.</p><p>DAS, also called Cor triatriatum type C in the original report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thilenius et al., 1976</xref>), is a very rare CHD characterized by an extra septal structure to the right side of primary atrial septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roberson et al., 2006</xref>). This anatomic abnormality is implicated as a cause of paradoxical thromboembolic event to stroke or heart attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breithardt et al., 2006</xref>). However, its etiology and pathogenesis are entirely unknown. Here, we have shown that <italic>Sorbs2</italic> deficiency can cause this abnormality. Interestingly, Cor triatriatum, another type of abnormal extra atrial septation, has been reported in a patient with a terminal 4q34.3 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marcì et al., 2015</xref>), which includes <italic>SORBS2</italic> but not <italic>HAND2</italic>. It has been speculated that DAS might result from the persistence of embryologic structures or abnormal duplication of atrial septum. The impaired cardiogenesis in <italic>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice suggests that the latter scenario may be the underlying pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Next, cells were routinely dehydrated in an ethanol series of 30, 50, 70, 80, and 95% for 15 min each, and 100% ethanol and acetone twice for 20 min each at room temperature, and then embedded in an epoxy resin. Sections (70 nm thick) were poststained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate and visualized on Hitachi 7650 microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>D30 h1ESC-CMs were digested by Accutase (7920; STEMCELL Technologies, Canada), washed one time with a baseline extracellular fluid, and then moved to the stage of an inverted microscope (ECLIPSE Ti-U; Nikon, Japan) for patch-clamp recording. h1ESC-CMs were continuously perfused by an extracellular solution through a ‘Y-tube’ system with a solution exchange time of 1 min. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed using Axopatch 700B (Axon Instruments, Inc, Union City, CA, USA) amplifiers under an invert microscope at room temperature (22–25°C). Glass pipettes were prepared using borosilicate glasses with a filament (Sutter Instruments Co, Novato, CA) using the Flaming/Brown micropipette puller P97 (Sutter Instruments Co). The final resistance parameters of patch pipette tips were about 2–4 MΩ after heat polish and internal solution filling. After the formation of ‘gigaseal’ between the patch pipette and cell membranes, a gentle suction was operated to rupture the cell membrane and establish whole-cell configuration. All current signals were digitized with a sampling rate of 10 kHz and filtered at a cutoff frequency of 2 kHz (Digidata 1550A; Axon Instruments, Inc, Union City, CA). The spontaneous action potentials were recorded in a gap-free mode with a sampling rate of 1 kHz and filtered at a cutoff frequency of 0.5 kHz. If the series resistance was more than 10 MΩ or changed significantly during the experiments, the recordings were discarded from further analyses. The pipette internal solution for action potential recording contained (in mM) KCl 150, NaCl 5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, EGTA 5, HEPES 10, and MgATP 5 (pH 7.2, KOH), and baseline extracellular solution and extracellular solution for action potential recording contained (in mM) NaCl 140, KCl 5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, glucose 10, and HEPES 10 (pH 7.4, NaOH). Data were analyzed by using Clampfit 10.5 and Origin 8.0 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from D0, D2, D3, D5, and D10 cells or E10.5 embryos using Trizol reagent (15596018; Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Library preparation and transcriptome sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq platform were performed by Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co, Ltd to generate 100-bp paired-end reads. HTSeq v0.6.0 was used to count the read numbers mapped to each gene, and fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM) of each gene were calculated. We used FastQC to control the quality of transcriptome sequencing data. Next, we compared the sequencing data to the human reference genome (hg19) by STAR. The expression level of each gene under different treatment conditions is obtained by HTSeq-count after standardization. The differentially expressed genes were analyzed by DESeq2 package. Functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes was analyzed on Toppgene website.</p><p>GSE126128 and GSE131181 datasets were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Seurat (version 3.0) toolkit was used for scRNA-seq analysis. After data integration, batch effect elimination, normalization, and scaling, different cell populations were identified based on existing references. Gene expression was plotted using normalized read counts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Network and GO analysis</title><p>From ENCODE database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>), 316 human fetal heart-specific genes including <italic>SORBS2</italic> were selected and their expression coefficients were computed.

Patients carrying 22q11.2 deletion and gross chromosomal aberrations were excluded from our study. The mean age of included probands was 10 months with a range of 3 days to 17 years. 188 (62.7%) were boys and 112 (37.3%) were girls. CHD diagnosis was confirmed by reviewing patient history, physical examinations, and medical records. Patients carrying 22q11.2 deletion and gross chromosomal aberrations (e.g., trisomy 21, trisomy 13, and trisomy 18) were excluded from our study. The study conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and approval for human subject research was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Shanghai Children's Medical Center (SCMC-201015). Written informed consents were obtained from parents or legal guardians of all patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Control cohort</title><p>Exome sequences for 220 control subjects of Han Chinese descent were derived from the 1000 genome project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.internationalgenome.org/data">http://www.internationalgenome.org/data</ext-link>). Raw sequence data in the form of fastq files were re-aligned and re-analyzed with the same bioinformatic pipelines with CHD patients.

Briefly, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA, version 0.7.17) was used to align the Fastq format sequences to human genome reference (hg38). De-duplication was performed using Picard, and the base quality score recalibration (BQSR) was performed to generate analysis-ready reads. HaplotypeCaller implemented in GATK was used for variant calling in genomic variant call format (GVCF) mode. All samples were then genotyped jointly. We then excluded the variants based on the following rules: (1) &gt;2 alternative alleles; (2) low genotype call rate &lt;90<bold>%</bold>; (3) deviation from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium in control samples (p&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>); (4) differential missingness between cases and controls (p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>). After alignment and variant calling, we removed two subjects with low-quality data, leaving a total of 298 cases and 220 controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Variant enrichment analysis</title><p>Given that severe mutations are generally present at low frequencies in the population, we set the relevant variants filtering criteria as follows: (1) variants that located in exonic region, (2) excluding synonymous variants, (3) variants with an MAF below 1% according to the public control database (Exome Aggregation Consortium, ExAC), and (4) damaging missense variants predicted to be deleterious by at least two algorithms (Polyphen2 ≥0.95/MutationTaster_pred:D/SIFT ≤0.05). All relevant variants following these criteria were hereafter called ‘rare damaging’ variants. The number of rare damaging variant carriers in each gene was counted in CHD patients and controls. We hypothesized that rare damaging variants should be enriched in CHD patients, hence the carrier and non-carrier groups were compared between CHD patients and controls using a one-tailed Fisher’s exact test. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated. Only genes with at least two variants were retained, and multiple testing correction was performed using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (q-value, adjusted p-value after Benjamini-Hochberg testing).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance was performed using a two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic> test, χ<sup>2</sup> test, or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate.

the deletion of the gene SORBS2 as a contributor to the congenital heart disease phenotype in the 4q deletion syndrome. They have shown that the gene is required for the development of the dorsal mesenchyme protrusion, a structure necessary for septation of the atria. To reach these conclusions, the team has used human genetics data, an in vitro differentiation model of human embryonic stem cells, and a mouse model of Sorbs2 loss of function. The data presented indicate that Sorbs2 is important for atrial septation by supporting Tbx5 expression as well as NOTCH and SHH signalling. The work supports a role for Sorbs2 in heart development and adds novel information to the genetics of 4q deletion syndrome.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;SORBS2 is a genetic factor contributing to cardiac malformation of 4q deletion syndrome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Your study addresses the genetic basis of an interesting, and as yet unclear human condition. The strength of your work is in the use of both mouse and human systems. However, the reviewers have underlined insufficient depth in the datasets from both systems, thus preventing a robust support for your conclusions.</p><p>Hoping to help you to increase the strength of your work, I summarize the issues that have been raised:</p><p>1. Mouse data need to be expanded significantly to better define the phenotype and to identify a developmental mechanism.</p><p>This work should also include validation of the proposed mechanism c-ABL/NOTCH/SHH.</p><p>2. Is there a haploinsufficiency phenotype in the mouse? While there may be species-specific differences in sensitivity to gene dosage, the authors should make an effort to investigate this question. There could be, for example a molecular phenotype (rather than a morphogenetic one) in the heterozygous mutant.</p><p>3. The human genetics data should be extended: a) correlate more directly variants and ASD; b) validate variants to demonstrate their functional significance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript describes the identification of the gene SORBS2 as a likely contributor to the congenital heart disease (CHD) phenotype in patients with 4q deletions. The support for the implication of the SORBS2 gene derives from the phenotype of <italic>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos, from human genetics studies, and from analysis of differentiated human ES cells in which this gene has been knocked down using siRNAs. The authors conclude that SORBS2 has at least two &quot;functions&quot; in the cardiogenic lineage. One is related to the sarcomere structure of the cardiomyocyte, a role to a certain extent predicted by previous studies of the SORBS2 protein, which is localized in the Z line and is a multi-domain scaffolding protein involved in cytoskeletal organization. The other, more novel role and more related to heart development, would be &quot;… that SORBS2 is a critical regulator to maintain the balance between FHF and SHF cells during differentiation&quot;. The support for the latter role is much more speculative and requires more extensive studies, which would considerably increase the competitiveness of this manuscript.</p><p>– The cardiac development phenotype of <italic>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos should be investigated in greater detail, also with the aid of regional and lineage marker analyses, to corroborate the conclusions drawn by the hES cell culture experiments. Without these studies, the conclusion that Sorbs2 is involved in fate specification of SHF progenitors is not supported.</p><p>For example, RNA-seq data of differentiated hES cells suggest that knock-down of Sorbs2 reduces the expression of anterior SHF markers, such as Tbx1, and increases the expression of posterior SHF markers such as Tbx5, thus, the imbalance could be between aSHF and pSHF, rather than between FHF and SHF as suggested by the authors. Thus, is TBX5 expression altered in the pSHF of mutant embryos? How is the expression of other pSHF markers? Where is Sorbs2 expressed?</p><p>It is virtually impossible to predict mechanisms leading to cardiac structural defects using hES differentiation data. Even though the mouse phenotype is incompletely penetrant, it should still be possible to analyse it in more details and validate the proposed c-ABL/NOTCH/SHH pathway in vivo.</p><p>– Human genetics studies were performed on a relatively small number of patients; nevertheless they provided some suggestion that SORBS2 may have a role in CHD. The authors should show a map of the gene model or predicted protein with the location of the variants and list the actual variants that they found.</p><p>Also, did the 20 patients that carried &quot;rare damaging variants&quot; of SORBS2 also have variants in other CHD genes?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present their study on the identification of SORBS2 as regulator of cardiac defects associated to Chr 4q deletion syndrome. The aim of this study was to identify the role of SORBS2, as a candidate gene for CHD of terminal 4q deletion syndrome, during cardiac development. The authors found that <italic>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse hearts have atrial septal defects (ASD) including rare double atrial septum. The authors used human ES cell lines as in vitro model to examine the requirement of SORBS2 during cardiomyocyte differentiation. Thus, they knockdown SORBS2 expression with 2 different shRNAs. Video shown that differentiated SORBS2-knockdown cardiomyocytes contracted much weaker than controls. Quantification of cTnT+ cells confirmed the later observation. Myofibril structure examination showed abnormal sarcomeric structure when SORBS2 expression is reduced whereas electrical activity seemed normal. The authors hypothesized that SORBS2 had an early role in cardiomyocyte differentiation. Expression of progenitor but not mesodermal markers was disturbed in SORBS2-knockdown hES cells. Based on expression analysis, the authors claimed that expression of first heart field (FHF) genes was increased whereas second heart field (SHF) markers were reduced. The authors concluded that SORBS2 is a critical regulator to maintain the balance between FHF and SHF cells. To understand how SORBS2 regulates SHF progenitor commitment, the authors performed RNA-seq experiments. RNA-seq analysis showed that the NOTCH signaling target genes were reduced in SORBS2-knockdown cardiomyocytes. Finally, in this study the authors used rare variant association to identify genes within CNVs responsible for CHD. Hence, the authors sequenced 300 complex CHD cases. Among genes with a p-value lower than 0.05, they found SORBS2. The authors identified missense mutations in SORBS2 suggesting that rare variants in this gene could be associated to ASD.</p><p>Although the basic insight regarding the identification of atrial septal defects in SORBS2 mutant mice and the reduction of cardiomyocyte differentiation in hES cells when SORBS2 is reduced are interesting, there are some weaknesses in the arguments and data reported in this study.</p><p>– My main concern is related to the arguments used to claim a role of SORBS2 in SHF development through c-ABL/NOTCH/SHH axis.</p><p>– It is clear that Sorbs2-null mice have ASD. However, the authors did not find the origin of this defect. The authors should show how dorsal mesenchymal protrusion is formed in these mutant embryos.</p><p>– The use of shRNA has some limitations that the authors did not discuss. Reduction of SORBS2 expression resulted in reduction of cTnT-positive cells. However, the authors should show whether apoptosis is normal in shRNA treated cells.</p><p>– The expression of sarcomeric genes is reduced in SORBS2-KD cells. How do the authors explain this result?</p><p>– In this study the qPCR is used to examine transcriptional levels of FHF and SHF genes during cardiomyocyte differentiation. Increase of TBX5, HAND1 and HCN4 is observed at D5 but clearly significant at D10. I'm wondering whether these markers signed the FHF or the atrial identity? The authors should validate this observation using other FHF markers.</p><p>– qPCR shows a decrease of three SHF genes. However, there is no SHF markers (except FGF8) listed in TableS2 (downregulated genes at D5 from RNA-seq analysis). The authors should discuss this point.</p><p>– I do not understand why the authors focused on the c-ABL/NOTCH/SHH axis to explain the role of SORBS2 in SHF development. The arguments that link NOTCH to SHH signaling pathways in this context are very weak. The mechanism is incomplete and here again the mouse model should have been used to validate these observations.</p><p>– The authors sequenced 300 CHD cases and found several missense variants in SORBS2 gene. TableS6 shows heart phenotype in patients. &quot;The majority of patients with rare SORBS2 variants had ASD&quot;. The authors should show whether there is any correlation between SORBS2 mutation and ASD phenotype.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic>In this study, the Authors have attempted to use a mouse model to link the cardiac malformations observed in patients with the 4q deletion to defects in the SORBS2 locus. It is interesting to see that 40% of <italic>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hearts had ASD, and that some of them have an absence/hypoplasia of the primary septum and/or double atrial septum with an incomplete penetrance. However, while the ratio of cardiac defects in embryos is similar to the percentage of reported postnatal lethality, in general ASD hardly causes 100% postnatal lethality and likely cannot provide an adequate explanation as the sole cause of the early postnatal death. In addition, ASDs were only seen in the case of null genotypes (<italic>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>), and the authors didn't report ASDs in the case of Sorbs2+/- genotypes. This is crucial because in 4q-, SORBS2 is going to be haploinsufficient, and not a null genotype.The major fault of the study is, if the authors feel that SORBS2+/- haploinsufficiency is the cause for cardiac defects, patient samples (from 4q- or SORBS2 VUCS) should be used to derive iPSCs instead of the hRNA knockdown ESCs for all subsequent studies.</p><p>SORBS2-knockdown iPSCs were used for cardiomyocyte differentiation, which cannot be directly linked to cardiac defects such as ASD.

A rescue experiment using recombinant NOTCH or SHH in the cell culture model.</p><p>2.

Phenotypic analysis in the mouse mutant has been extended, but it is still limited. However, the authors did find developmental abnormalities with the DMP, which is interesting (albeit predictable). Phenotyping would benefit from testing additional pSHF markers and perhaps by testing basic mechanisms such as cell proliferation and cell death</p><p>2. Mechanisms: the focus of the authors in a so called c-Abl-Notch1-Shh &quot;axis&quot; remains speculative and based on gene (and in some cases protein) expression assays in differentiated hES cells and in whole embryo RNA-seq. These results are insufficient to draw conclusions about the pSHF or whatever it is happening in the DMP. Claims to the effect that Sorbs2 specifies &quot;the fate of second heart field (SHF) progenitors through c-ABL/NOTCH/SHH axis&quot; are unsubstantiated and should be removed (in the abstract, subheading of results, discussion), or be proposed as a speculative hypothesis in the discussion. In addition, the authors show no evidence that Sorbs2 specifies the fate of SHF progenitors. On the other hand, new data added to the resubmission clearly show a downregulation of Tbx5 in the DMP/pSHF region of mutants. It is unclear whether this is due to hypoplasia of the DMP or to reduced expression of the gene. In any case, this could be a valuable clue to understand mechanisms as Tbx5 is a critical factor in DMP development (e.g. Xie et al., 2012, Moskowitz group, which has also shown interaction between Tbx5 and SHH signalling), thus it could be part of the pathogenesis of ASD in this mutant. This should be discussed and contrasted with the NOTCH hypothesis.</p><p>3. The authors should discuss the apparently inconsistent findings of increased expression of Tbx5 in the hES cell model, and the decreased expression of the same gene in the pSHF of mutant embryos.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Authors have done an incredible job to revise the manuscript.

They used PCR, RNA-seq and in situ hybridization to validate their hypothesis. Thus, they showed that Notch1 protein expression level is significantly decreased whereas c-ABL is increased in <italic>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant embryos. In this revised version, they better used their in vivo model to support their hypothesis. The phenotype of the DMP is now examined which is consistent with ASD observed at E18.5. Control quality of shRNA KD hES cells is now performed and no apoptosis is detected. Expression of pSHF markers is now shown including Hoxb1, Hoxa1, Aldh1a2 and Tbx5 which confirms the previous statement. The rational to examine NOTCH and SHH signals is now better explained. Finally, human genetics data is improved and detection of significant enrichment of SORBS2 rare damaging variant in patients with ASD vs non-ASD is great. However, I agree with reviewer#3 that hiPS cells model rather than hESC would have been better to support their hypothesis. In addition, a rescue experiment using recombinant NOTCH or SHH treatment in the in vitro culture would have been important to perform in order to support the main finding of this study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67481.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

The support for the implication of the SORBS2 gene derives from the phenotype of <sup>-/-</sup>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup> embryos, from human genetics studies, and from analysis of differentiated human ES cells in which this gene has been knocked down using siRNAs. The authors conclude that SORBS2 has at least two &quot;functions&quot; in the cardiogenic lineage. One is related to the sarcomere structure of the cardiomyocyte, a role to a certain extent predicted by previous studies of the SORBS2 protein, which is localized in the Z line and is a multi-domain scaffolding protein involved in cytoskeletal organization. The other, more novel role and more related to heart development, would be &quot;… that SORBS2 is a critical regulator to maintain the balance between FHF and SHF cells during differentiation&quot;. The support for the latter role is much more speculative and requires more extensive studies, which would considerably increase the competitiveness of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>TBX5</italic> is generally considered as a FHF marker in in vitro cardiomyocyte differentiation model.

In regarding to the mouse phenotype, it is more important to establish the role of <italic>Sorbs2</italic> in promoting SHF development rather than a role in maintaining the balance between FHF and SHF.

Since Notch signaling is a known molecular mechanism promoting Smo accumulation in cilia and enhancing cellular response to Shh (ref.14), we proposed the current working model.

Using the same threshold, we selected genes significantly down-regulated in homozygous mutants to perform GO analysis. These genes are enriched in pathways regulating heart development, myofibril assembly and cardiac septum development (Figure 3D, Table S5). Particularly, the Notch signaling pathway was also in the enrichment list. Looking closer, we noted that genes involved in cardiac development, myofibril assembly and contraction force were down-regulated in nearly all the homozygous mutants (Figure 3E). The decrease of posterior SHF marker genes were less general but still clearly down-regulated in the <sup>major</sup>ity of <italic>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos (Figure 3F). Decreased Tbx5 expression in posterior SHF of <italic>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos was validated by RNA in situ hybridization (n=3, Figure 3G). A portion of embryos had obvious down-regulation of Notch and Shh signaling targets (Figure 3H), which is consistent with a low penetrance of ASD in homozygous mutants. RNA in situ hybridization confirmed decreased Heyl expression in posterior SHF of <italic>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos (n=1, Figure 3I). Next, we verified the upstream molecular changes of Notch signaling found in hESCs differentiation model. Indeed, we noted that Notch1 expression level significantly decreased whereas c-ABL significantly increased in <italic>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos (Figure 3J-3K).”</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>There are two sets of experiments that are deemed critical (please see details in the individual reviews):</p><p>1.

Mechanisms: the focus of the authors in a so called c-Abl-Notch1-Shh &quot;axis&quot; remains speculative and based on gene (and in some cases protein) expression assays in differentiated hES cells and in whole embryo RNA-seq. These results are insufficient to draw conclusions about the pSHF or whatever it is happening in the DMP. Claims to the effect that Sorbs2 specifies &quot;the fate of second heart field (SHF) progenitors through c-ABL/NOTCH/SHH axis&quot; are unsubstantiated and should be removed (in the abstract, subheading of results, discussion), or be proposed as a speculative hypothesis in the discussion. In addition, the authors show no evidence that Sorbs2 specifies the fate of SHF progenitors. On the other hand, new data added to the resubmission clearly show a downregulation of Tbx5 in the DMP/pSHF region of mutants. It is unclear whether this is due to hypoplasia of the DMP or to reduced expression of the gene. In any case, this could be a valuable clue to understand mechanisms as Tbx5 is a critical factor in DMP development (e.g. Xie et al., 2012, Moskowitz group, which has also shown interaction between Tbx5 and SHH signalling), thus it could be part of the pathogenesis of ASD in this mutant. This should be discussed and contrasted with the NOTCH hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer 1 that our work lacks of embryonic evidence to substantiate our previous claim. As per reviewer’s suggestion, we have removed the statement, “specifying the fate of SHF through c-ABL/NOTCH/SHH axis”, from the Abstract and subheading of Results. We state it as a hypothesis in discussion.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to the important <italic>Tbx5</italic> works and point out additional molecular explanation for the pathogenesis of <italic>Sorbs2</italic> mutants. Now we have cited this article and discussed the possible role of <italic>Tbx5</italic> in the pathogenesis of <italic>Sorbs2</italic> mutants.</p><p>Excerpt from Discussion</p><p>“In both models, we detected increased protein level of NOTCH1 endocytosis facilitator c-ABL, decreased NOTCH1 protein level and impaired SHH signaling. Notch and Shh signaling are essential for SHF development(24). Notch signaling promotes Smo accumulation in cilia and enhancing cellular response to Shh, placing Notch upstream of Shh signaling (16, 25). Therefore, SORBS2 might promote SHF progenitor fate through c-ABL/NOTCH/SHH axis. In addition, Tbx5 was also significantly downregulated in posterior SHF of Sorb2 mutants. Tbx5-Hh molecular network is an essential regulatory mechanism in SHF for atrial septation(26). It is likely that Tbx5 downregulation also contributes to the pathogenesis of ASD through its effect on Hh signaling. Consistently, adding recombinant SHH protein is sufficient to rescue SHF marker gene expression and cardiomyocyte differentiation efficiency.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should discuss the apparently inconsistent findings of increased expression of Tbx5 in the hES cell model, and the decreased expression of the same gene in the pSHF of mutant embryos.</p></disp-quote><p>As per reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the relevant discussion about the discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo model. Based on literature, Tbx5 mainly functions as a FHF regulator in in vitro cardiogenesis (Anderson etc. Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3140). The simplified in vitro model may not fully recapitulate the multiple roles of Tbx5 in regulating cardiogenesis in vivo.</p><p>Excerpt from Discussion</p><p>“However, TBX5 was upregulated in D5 SORBS2 knockdown cells. It is likely that in vitro cardiomyocyte differentiation is a simplified model that can not fully recapitulate the in vivo spatial and temporal information of various cardiac progenitors and therefore has less regulatory layers in which TBX5 may predominantly function as a FHF regulator. Indeed, Tbx5 knockdown reduces FHF progenitors and has no effect on SHF progenitors in an in vitro cardiogenesis model(27).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors have replied to several of my concerns such as the arguments that SORBS2 specifies SHF progenitors through c-ABL/NOTCH/SHH. They used PCR, RNA-seq and in situ hybridization to validate their hypothesis. Thus, they showed that Notch1 protein expression level is significantly decreased whereas c-ABL is increased in <sup>-/-</sup>Sorbs2<sup>-/-</sup> mutant embryos. In this revised version, they better used their in vivo model to support their hypothesis. The phenotype of the DMP is now examined which is consistent with ASD observed at E18.5. Control quality of shRNA KD hES cells is now performed and no apoptosis is detected. Expression of pSHF markers is now shown including Hoxb1, Hoxa1, Aldh1a2 and Tbx5 which confirms the previous statement. The rational to examine NOTCH and SHH signals is now better explained. Finally, human genetics data is improved and detection of significant enrichment of SORBS2 rare damaging variant in patients with ASD vs non-ASD is great. However, I agree with reviewer#3 that hiPS cells model rather than hESC would have been better to support their hypothesis. In addition, a rescue experiment using recombinant NOTCH or SHH treatment in the in vitro culture would have been important to perform in order to support the main finding of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer’s constructive suggestion that would strengthen our conclusion. We have performed rescue experiment with recombinant SHH protein. Results showed that it was sufficient to upregulate SHF markers gene expression and improve the efficiency of cardiomyocyte differentiation, suggesting that SORBS2’s function is mediated through SHH signaling.</p><p>Excerpt from Results</p><p>“We applied recombinant SHH protein to check whether it can rescue defects caused by SORBS2 knockdown. As expected, exogenous SHH activated PTCH1 and GLI1 expression (Figure 1O). It also upregulated the expression of SHF marker ISL1 and MEF2C in D5 SORBS2-shRNA1 cells (Figure 1O) and rescued cardiomyocyte differentiation efficiency with more cells presenting a polygonal or spindle-like shape (Figure 1P and 1Q).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
