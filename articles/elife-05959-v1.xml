For these reasons and because they are mammals, house mice are well suited to serve as models for human phenotypes and disease. House mice in the wild consist of at least three distinct subspecies and harbor extensive genetic and phenotypic variation both within and between these subspecies. Wild mice have been used to study a wide range of biological processes, including immunity, cancer, male sterility, adaptive evolution, and non-Mendelian inheritance. Despite the extensive variation that exists among wild mice, classical laboratory strains are derived from a limited set of founders and thus contain only a small subset of this variation. Continued efforts to study wild house mice and to create new inbred strains from wild populations have the potential to strengthen house mice as a model system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05959.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05959.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>the natural history of model organism</kwd><kwd><italic>Mus musculus</italic></kwd><kwd>house mouse</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>wild mice</kwd><kwd>classical inbred strain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 GM074245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nachman</surname><given-names>Michael W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Studies of the house mouse <italic>Mus musculus</italic> have provided important insights into mammalian biology, and efforts to study wild house mice and to create new inbred strains from wild populations have the potential to increase its usefulness as a model system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Today, house mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) are widely known as an excellent mammalian model for studying a wide variety of traits and diseases, including those involved in metabolism, development, neurological disorders, immunity, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Morse, 2007</xref>). At the beginning of the 20th century, however, Mendel's work had only recently been rediscovered and the race was on to develop genetic model systems. In a series of papers from 1902–1905, Lucien Cuénot used mice to demonstrate Mendel's laws for the first time in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hickman and Cairns, 2003</xref>). Around the same time, William E Castle, a pioneer of the use of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to study genetics, also began investigating the inheritance of coat color in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castle and Allen, 1903</xref>). The Castle lab and others launched research programs focused on mouse genetics, and soon realised the need to create inbred strains (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref> for a glossary of specialist terms used in this article) of mice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castle and Allen, 1903</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castle and Little, 1910</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Russell, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Morse, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">1985</xref>). By 1909, the first inbred strain, DBA, was created and the era of modern mouse genetics had begun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Russell, 1978</xref>).

Mice were used in experimental study as early as the 17th and 18th centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Morse, 1981</xref>). In the 19th century, Mendel is believed to have worked with mice before switching to pea plants after reportedly being admonished by his bishop for keeping organisms that had sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Henig, 2000</xref>). When Mendel's laws were rediscovered in 1900, researchers saw the advantages of working with a mammal that could be housed in a small area, bred quickly, and that displayed many easily scored, variable traits.</p><p>Most of the inbred lines available today have their origins in the trade of fancy mice in the early 1900's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Morse, 1981</xref>). Abbie Lathrop, a retired schoolteacher in Granby, Massachusetts, USA, started breeding mice as pets, using mice purchased from other fanciers, including varieties like waltzing mice and creamy buffs. Among her best customers were scientists, including William E Castle and Clarence C Little at Harvard University, and Leo Loeb, who collaborated with Lathrop to investigate mammary tumors in her mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Morse, 1981</xref>). The need for truly genetically homogenous mice spurred these scientists and others to begin inbreeding their colonies. In 1929, CC Little founded the Roscoe B Jackson Memorial Laboratory, which now has the largest selection of inbred mice in the USA. Other major suppliers include Charles River Laboratories, Harlan Laboratories and Taconic Farms, Inc., among others.</p></caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05959.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05959.003</ext-link></p></boxed-text></sec><sec id="s2"><title>The natural history of house mice</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phylogenetic history</title><p>House mice comprise three main subspecies of <italic>M. musculus</italic> with different global distributions: <italic>Mus musculus castaneus</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus domesticus</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Their closest relatives are not human commensals (see ‘Glossary’) and include the mound building mouse, <italic>Mus spicilegus</italic>, and the Algerian mouse, <italic>Mus spretus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chevret et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Tucker et al., 2005</xref>). The ancestral range for <italic>M. musculus</italic> was likely in present-day India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boursot et al., 1993</xref>). Genetic and genomic data indicate that the three subspecies of <italic>M. musculus</italic> started to diverge ∼350–500 thousand years ago (KYA) and that the split among the three subspecies occurred within a short period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Geraldes et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duvaux et al., 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, the available evidence suggests that <italic>M. m. castaneus</italic> and <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> are more closely related to each other than either is to <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">White et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Keane et al., 2011</xref>). There is evidence of hybridization among the subspecies in zones of secondary contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tucker et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boursot et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duvaux et al., 2011</xref>). An additional subspecies, <italic>Mus musculus molossinus</italic>, is found in Japan and is derived from hybridization between <italic>M. m. castaneus</italic> and <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Yonekawa et al., 1988</xref>). Classical inbred strains of house mice are genetic mosaics of the three main subspecies, although they are primarily <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> in origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Didion and de Villena, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, contributions from the other two subspecies may be due to early crosses with <italic>M. m. molossinus</italic>, likely as a result of interactions between mouse fanciers in Japan and Western Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). A fifth subspecies, <italic>Mus musculus gentilulus</italic>, has been described from collections in the southern Arabian Peninsula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harrison, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Harrison and Bates, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Prager et al., 1998</xref>).

Although feral populations exist, house mice are commonly found in residential, agricultural, and commercial structures. The rise of agrarian societies is very recent compared to the divergence among house mice subspecies, indicating that commensalism evolved independently in each of the three subspecies. House mice are omnivorous with varied diets including grains, seeds, and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sage, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Singleton and Krebs, 2007</xref>). They generally weigh less than 20 grams and serve as food for predatory snakes, birds and mammals. Laboratory mice tolerate regular handling by humans and live and breed in a small area. Their commensal life style, small size, and flexible diet have likely been key to their success as a model system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Reproduction and social structure</title><p>The reproductive biology of mice is also favorable for laboratory breeding. Mice have short generation times; gestation lasts approximately 3 weeks and they are sexually mature at 6–8 weeks of age. Thus, generation times in the lab are between 9 and 11 weeks. In the wild, females may breed seasonally with one or two litters per year or they may breed year round if resources are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Pocock et al., 2004</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Latham and Mason, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Singleton and Krebs, 2007</xref>). In the lab, with unlimited food and good environmental conditions, females can breed year round. Litter sizes in the wild are large (∼4–9 pups), a trait that facilitates the efficient generation of inbred strains (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sage, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Singleton and Krebs, 2007</xref>). House mice in the wild have variable social structures, ranging from discrete ‘demes’ with a single male and one to several adult females and juveniles, to high-density aggregations in which adults are socially gregarious and have largely overlapping ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Singleton and Krebs, 2007</xref>). While males can be territorial, females are known to mate with multiple males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dean et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Firman and Simmons, 2008</xref>). Female house mice tend to live in extended family groups and can nest communally and nurse offspring communally (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">König and Lindholm, 2012</xref>). Mice found in a limited geographic area are likely to be related, and the average inbreeding coefficient (see ‘Glossary’) of wild-caught mice in one study was ∼0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Laurie et al., 2007</xref>). This natural level of inbreeding may help to purge recessive deleterious alleles and may have facilitated the creation of inbred strains in the laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Disease</title><p>Wild mice can carry a variety of diseases, including mouse hepatitis virus, mouse mammary tumor virus and mouse parvovirus. They can also be vectors for human diseases, such as leptospirosis, cryptosporidiosis, salmonellosis, and streptobacillosis (summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Singleton and Krebbs, 2007</xref>). However, unlike rats, they are not known to be major vectors of the plague or of hemorrhagic fevers like hantavirus. They are commonly parasitized by tapeworms, flukes, fleas and lice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Singleton and Krebbs, 2007</xref>). As such, wild mice are routinely quarantined before they enter mouse facilities.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Phenotypic variation</title><p>Wild house mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) exhibit considerable phenotypic variation, and it is likely that much more remains to be described. In association with humans, house mice have been spread around the world and have adapted to a wide range of environments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Jones et al., 2012</xref>). Mice can be found from sea level to over 4000 m in elevation, from the tropics to subarctic environments, and in both dry and wet environments. Studies of water balance in wild populations suggest that house mice can adapt to arid habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Mutze et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Moro and Bradshaw, 1999</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05959.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Wild derived house mouse (<italic>Mus musculus domesticus</italic>) from Brazil.</title><p>Image credit: Taichi Suzuki.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05959.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05959.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05959-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Phenotypic variation among wild house mice has been described along environmental gradients. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lynch (1992)</xref> surveyed populations of house mice on the east coast of the United States and found that mice from more northern latitudes were bigger and built bigger nests than those from more southern populations. These differences persisted in the lab over several generations, demonstrating a genetic basis. Selection experiments also provide evidence that house mice have the ability to rapidly adapt to cold temperatures. Wild mice bred at 3°C for 10 generations were more fertile, with larger litters of larger body size, and reached sexual maturity earlier than mice bred at 23°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett and Dickson, 1984</xref>). Rapid phenotypic change has occurred on many islands, including shifts in size, morphology, and diet (e.g., Berry et al., 1978; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Le Roux et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Renaud et al., 2013</xref>). One example comes from mice on Gough Island, a small island in the Atlantic Ocean approximately halfway between South Africa and Argentina. House mice were likely introduced to this island by sealers or whalers in the 19th century and are the only terrestrial mammals living on it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Holdgate, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gray et al., 2014</xref>). Gough Island mice live independently of humans, are large compared to European house mice, and eat seabird chicks, including those of the critically endangered Tristan albatross (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Rowe–Rowe and Crafford, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cuthbert and Hilton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wanless et al., 2007</xref>). These mice are alarming from a conservation perspective, but they are intriguing from an evolutionary one. Variation in natural populations is fertile ground for exploring the genetic basis of complex traits. Such efforts could add to the decades of study of complex traits in inbred strains of mice (such as body size, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheverud, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kenney-Hunt et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Genetic variation</title><p>Populations of wild house mice exhibit levels of genetic variation that are several-fold higher than those seen in human populations, consistent with the larger effective population size for house mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Geraldes et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Halligan et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2013</xref>).

For example, some beneficial variants appear to have come from introgression between subspecies or between closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Song et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Staubach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite the substantial level of genetic variation seen in wild house mice, the commonly used classical inbred strains of laboratory mice derive from a limited set of founders and thus contain only a small subset of the genetic variation that is seen in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Salcedo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). As a result, there are many genomic ‘blind spots’ in crosses involving classical inbred strains. Since the 1970's, new inbred lines have been established using wild mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guénet and Bonhomme, 2003</xref>). Levels of diversity are much higher among these wild-derived inbred strains than among classical inbred strains (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ideraabdullah et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Several recent outcrossed populations have also been developed from classical and wild-derived inbred strains, including the Heterogeneous Stock mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Valdar et al., 2006</xref>) and the Collaborative Cross mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Churchill et al., 2004</xref>). Both of these outbred mapping populations contain more genetic variation than do mice derived from crossing classical inbred lines, and they also have more recombination, permitting traits of interest to be mapped with improved resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Yalcin et al., 2010</xref>). However, they are not without their limitations. First, much of the genetic variation is due to differences between subspecies. Second, since crosses between subspecies result in partial hybrid sterility, selection effectively eliminates genetic variation in some regions of the genome in these crosses. Third, mapping intervals are not typically at the resolution of individual genes. The development of additional inbred lines of wild-derived mice should help address these limitations and augment existing resources.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Insights from wild house mice</title><p>Here, we briefly highlight a few examples in which studies of wild house mice have provided insight into fundamental questions concerning mammalian biology. This is not a comprehensive review; research on wild house mice encompasses a diverse range of topics, only some of which are touched on here. For more information, we refer readers to ‘<italic>The mouse in biomedical research</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Foster et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fox et al., 2007</xref>), ‘<italic>The genus Mus as a model for evolutionary studies</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britton-Davidian and Searle, 2005</xref>) and ‘<italic>Evolution of the house mouse</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Macholán et al., 2012</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Immunity: the Major Histocompatibility Complex</title><p>The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is a family of strikingly polymorphic genes that have a critically important role in the immune response of vertebrates. Proteins encoded by MHC genes bind peptides derived from pathogens and present them on the cell surface for recognition by T cells. MHC genes were first discovered in classical inbred strains of house mice (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Klein, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Penn and Musolf, 2012</xref>). Wild house mice have also played a major role in advancing our understanding of the MHC. For example, the high level of variation seen at MHC genes was first discovered in populations of wild mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Klein, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Klein and Bailey, 1971</xref>) and has since been documented in many other vertebrates. This discovery spawned a considerable amount of research aimed at understanding the evolutionary forces that maintain such diversity. These studies have led to some intriguing findings regarding the possible functional significance of MHC diversity in wild mice and other organisms. One area of particular interest is mate choice. Data suggest that individual mice prefer mates with dissimilar MHC haplotypes, a form of disassortative mating (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Penn and Potts, 1998</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Penn and Musolf, 2012</xref>). Such mating preferences could function to improve offspring resistance to pathogens, reduce inbreeding, or both. However, the relative importance of MHC in mate choice in wild populations remains unresolved; there are many other factors that have been shown to affect mate choice. Moreover, the specific mechanism by which individuals identify MHC-dissimilar individuals remains obscure.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cancer: retroviruses and the Lake Casitas mice</title><p>In the late 1960's, virally induced cancers were known to occur in laboratory mice and in chickens, but had yet to be discovered in humans. Robert Huebner and Murray Gardner hypothesized that resistance to viral cancer was likely present in wild mouse populations but had been lost in laboratory strains through inbreeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gardner et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">O'Brien, 2003</xref>). Gardner embarked on a mission to sample wild populations of house mice. While he found disease-free mice at most sites, at a poultry farm near Lake Casitas in California, he found ∼85% of the mice carried murine leukemia virus (MuLV). Infected mice developed severe lymphoma and/or hind limb paralysis after sexual maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gardner et al., 1991</xref>). Despite the severity of the disease and evidence of transmission, the population did not crash and many mice were apparently unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gardner et al., 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">O'Brien, 2003</xref>). Gardener and his colleague, Stephen O'Brien, hypothesized that an anti-retroviral genetic element was segregating in the Lake Casitas mice, protecting some from infection. This proved to be the case; they found an allele at a single locus that conferred complete resistance in homozygotes and was inherited in a Mendelian fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gardner et al., 1980</xref>). Researchers in Japan independently identified a common viral cancer, as well as endogenous retroviral sequences (see ‘Glossary’) in <italic>M. m. molossinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ikeda et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Odaka et al., 1981</xref>). Ultimately, it was shown that resistance in the two populations localized to the same gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">O'Brien et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>How did the resistance allele prevent infection? And why were two mouse populations on either side of the Pacific Ocean, thought to be different subspecies, polymorphic for the same protective allele? The resistance locus was itself a truncated endogenous retrovirus in which only the subunit responsible for the creation of the viral envelope remained intact (see ‘Glossary’). When a virus replicates in a cell, some of its envelope proteins bind to receptors on the cell, preventing additional viruses from entering. Thus, resistance to MuLV in the Lake Casitas and Japanese mice was conferred by cells that produce harmless endogenous viral envelope proteins, blocking the binding of the virulent MuLV viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kozak et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ikeda et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dandekar et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ikeda and Sugimura, 1989</xref>). These populations of mice share the resistance allele because they have a shared evolutionary history. Japanese mice descend from hybridization between <italic>M. m. castaneus</italic> from Southern China and <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> from northern China. While the resistance gene and the virus were undetected in <italic>M. m. musculus</italic>, they were both found in <italic>M. m. castaneus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">O'Brien, 2003</xref>). Although mice in North America were originally believed to be entirely of <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> origin, the Lake Casitas mice are hybrids of <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> and <italic>M. m. castaneus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Orth et al., 1998</xref>). The Lake Casitas farm was originally settled by immigrants from China in the 19th century, who likely brought <italic>M. m. castaneus</italic> with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gardner et al., 1991</xref>). The Lake Casitas mice have provided insight into the mechanisms of resistance to retroviruses, the dynamics of disease outbreaks, and the origins of sequences derived from retroviruses found throughout vertebrate genomes, including humans.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Structural rearrangements and non-Mendelian inheritance</title><p>Two kinds of structural rearrangements in the genomes of wild mice have provided insight into genome evolution and into chromosome transmission during meiosis: Robertsonian (whole-arm) chromosomal translocations (also called fusions) and t-haplotypes, which are associated with chromosomal inversions (see ‘Glossary’). The karyotype of wild mice typically consists of 2n = 40 acrocentric chromosomes. However, numerous populations exist within the subspecies <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> in which the diploid number is as low as 2n = 22 as a result of Robertsonian fusions between two different acrocentric chromosomes, creating a metacentric chromosome (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gropp et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capanna et al., 1973</xref>). Otherwise indistinguishable from mice with the standard karyotype, some karyotypic races show some reproductive isolation as a consequence of the mis-pairing of chromosomal heterozygotes in hybrids and the production of aneuploid gametes or complete meiotic arrest (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garagna et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, some Robertsonian heterozygotes show transmission distortion in meiosis, preferentially transmitting the acrocentric products (instead of the fused, metacentric chromosome) to the oocytes in female meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gropp and Winking, 1981</xref>). In these cases, the metacentric chromosomes are preferentially distributed to the first polar body.</p><p>T-haplotypes are meiotic-drive systems (see ‘Glossary’) found at low frequency in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ardlie and Silver, 1996</xref>). T-alleles are associated with inversions on chromosome 17, and they show a strong transmission distortion in meiosis, with heterozygotes transmitting the t-bearing allele to over 90% of gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lyon, 2003</xref>). The responder locus (see ‘Glossary’) was first identified and molecularly characterized 15 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Herrmann et al., 1999</xref>), but transmission distortion was first documented in 1927 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Willison and Lyon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Herrmann and Bauer, 2012</xref>). Decades of research have made t-haplotypes one of the best-studied meiotic-drive systems in any organism, providing a model for understanding non-Mendelian inheritance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Adaptation: rodenticide resistance</title><p>One consequence of a commensal lifestyle is an ongoing arms race with humans intent on extirpating mice and reducing food loss and the spread of disease. Warfarin-based rodenticides were introduced in the 1950's and have been periodically replaced by other rodenticides that have anticoagulant properties owing to the development of resistance among rats and mice (e.g., reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pelz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ishizuka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buckle, 2011</xref>). The study of rodenticide resistance in wild populations has provided insights into the molecular biology and biochemistry of anticoagulants and mechanisms of resistance to those agents. Importantly, the spread of rodenticide resistance has also led to insights into the process of adaptation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Rost et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pelz et al., 2005</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Song et al. (2011)</xref> found that an allele of the mouse gene <italic>Vkorc1</italic>, which underlies resistance to warfarin in <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic>, resulted from adaptive introgressive hybridization (see ‘Glossary’) with the Algerian mouse (<italic>M. spretus</italic>). This study is one of many recent studies that highlight that adaptive introgression is an often overlooked source of new variation in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hedrick, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Speciation and hybrid male sterility</title><p>Laboratory crosses between some subspecies of house mice produce hybrid males that are sterile or have reduced fertility (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Forejt and Ivanyi, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Britton-Davidian et al., 2005</xref>). In nature, house mouse subspecies hybridize where they meet in secondary contact. The best-studied hybrid zone is between <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> and <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> in Central Europe (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Vanlerberghe et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dod and Jermlin, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Payseur et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Macholán et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Teeter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Janoušek et al., 2012</xref>). This hybrid zone is young; colonization of this area is relatively recent (∼3000 YA; for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cucchi et al., 2005</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baird and Macholán, 2012</xref>). Studies of this hybrid zone, and of laboratory crosses between these subspecies, have helped us to understand speciation genetics, particularly the genetic basis of hybrid male sterility (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mihola et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">White et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Turner et al., 2014</xref>). For example, evidence from natural populations and from laboratory crosses has revealed an important role of the X chromosome in reproductive incompatibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tucker et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Oka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Storchová et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dod et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Good et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Oka and Shiroishi, 2012</xref>), a pattern that appears to be quite general across animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coyne and Orr, 2004</xref>). Studies of wild house mice have also found that hybrid male sterility has a complex basis, involving many genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Oka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Good et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">White et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Turner and Harr, 2014</xref>). Laboratory crosses between <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> and <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> also led to the positional cloning of <italic>Prdm9</italic>, the only gene known to contribute to hybrid sterility in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mihola et al., 2009</xref>). This gene has a role in recombination rate variation in both mice and humans (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parvanov et al., 2010</xref>). The identification of other genes underlying hybrid male sterility remains a challenge, but the combination of mapping studies in the lab and studies of regions showing limited introgression in nature might identify good candidates for future study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Janoušek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Phifer-Rixey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Turner and Harr, 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusions: the next frontiers</title><p>As outlined in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box3">Box 3</xref>, much remains to be learned about wild mice, even in the areas of research highlighted above. Genetic variation, phenotypic variation, variation in disease and parasite load remain uncharacterized in many wild populations throughout the world. The genetic bases for adaptive phenotypes are largely unknown. Contact zones between subspecies outside of Europe are mostly unexplored. Wild mice are an untapped reservoir of genetic variation. The generation of new wild-derived inbred strains would add a valuable component to existing mouse resources by adding new genetic variants. Moreover, since haplotype blocks are much shorter in wild mice than in classical inbred strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Laurie et al., 2007</xref>), association mapping (see ‘Glossary’) with wild mice could help link individual genes to phenotypic differences. New more efficient genome-editing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>) will also enable the direct testing of the effects of wild alleles on phenotypes.
