While a plethora of genomic data reveals the long-term fate of diverging coding sequences and their <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, little is known about the early dynamics around the duplication event itself. In microorganisms, selection for increased gene expression often drives the expansion of gene copy-number mutations, which serves as a crude adaptation, prior to divergence through refining point mutations. Using a simple synthetic genetic reporter system that can distinguish between copy-number and point mutations, we study their early and transient adaptive dynamics in real-time in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We find two qualitatively different routes of adaptation, depending on the level of functional improvement needed. In conditions of high gene expression demand, the two mutation types occur as a combination. However, under low gene expression demand, copy-number and point mutations are mutually exclusive; here, owing to their higher frequency, adaptation is dominated by copy-number mutations, in a process we term Amplification Hindrance. Ultimately, due to high reversal rates and pleiotropic cost, copy-number mutations may not only serve as a crude and transient adaptation, but also constrain sequence divergence over evolutionary time scales.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional Files</title><sec id="s3" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Source Data and R scripts to generate the plots shown in the Figures are uploaded as the respective source code files.Flow cytometry and Illumina sequencing data are uploaded on Dryad together with R scripts to generate the plots shown in the respective Figures (Flow cytometry data: Figure 2C, 3C-D (and Figure Supplements), 4A; Illumina sequencing data: Figure 5 and (Figure Supplement)).</p><p>The following datasets were generated:</p><p><element-citation id="dataset1" publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Tomanek I</collab><collab>Guet C</collab></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><source>Flow cytometry YFP and CFP data and deep sequencing data of populations evolving in galactose</source><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.rfj6q57ds">https://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.rfj6q57ds</ext-link><comment>Dryad Digital Repository, doi:10.5061/dryad.rfj6q57ds</comment></element-citation></p></sec><supplementary-material><ext-link xlink:href="elife-82240-supp-v2.zip">Download zip</ext-link><p>Any figures and tables for this article are included in the PDF.
