nature of the cytoplasm and can globally affect cellular processes, yet density regulation remains poorly understood. Here, using a new quantitative phase imaging method, we determined that dry-mass density in fission yeast is maintained in a narrow distribution and exhibits homeostatic behavior. However, density varied during the cell cycle, decreasing during G2, increasing in mitosis and cytokinesis, and dropping rapidly at cell birth. These density variations were explained by a constant rate of biomass synthesis, coupled to slowdown of volume growth during cell division and rapid expansion post-cytokinesis. Arrest at specific cell-cycle stages exacerbated density changes. Spatially heterogeneous patterns of density suggested links between density regulation, tip growth, and intracellular osmotic pressure. Our results demonstrate that systematic density variations during the cell cycle are predominantly due to modulation of volume expansion, and reveal functional consequences of density gradients and cell-cycle arrests.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>quantitative phase imaging</kwd><kwd><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic></kwd><kwd>dry-mass density</kwd><kwd>cell-cycle arrest</kwd><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>polarized tip growth</kwd><kwd>fission yeast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P2ELP3_172318</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Odermatt</surname><given-names>Pascal D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P400PB_180872</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Odermatt</surname><given-names>Pascal D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH GM056836</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110275/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miettinen</surname><given-names>Teemu P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Kerwyn Casey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The density of the cytoplasm in <italic>S. pombe</italic> varies in time and space during the cell cycle through modulation of tip growth rate coupled with constant mass growth rate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intracellular density, a cumulative measure of the concentrations of all cellular components, is an important parameter that globally affects cellular function: density affects the concentration and activities of biomolecules and can impact biophysical properties of the cytoplasm such as macromolecular crowding, diffusion, mechanical stiffness, and phase transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchison, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van den Berg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Although it is typically assumed that density must be maintained at a particular level to optimize fitness, there is a growing appreciation that intracellular density often varies across physiological conditions. For example, substantial shifts in density and/or crowding have been detected in development, aging, and disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neurohr and Amon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oh et al., 2019</xref>). Even normal cell-cycle progression can involve changes in density; in cultured mammalian cells, volume increases by 10–30% during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Son et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zlotek-Zlotkiewicz et al., 2015</xref>), which likely dilutes the cytoplasm prior to an increase in density during cytokinesis.</p><p>Despite this biological centrality, the homeostatic mechanisms maintaining cellular density remain poorly understood. Over the course of a typical cell cycle, cells both double their volume and duplicate all cellular contents. A critical unresolved question is how this growth in cell volume (increase in cell size) and biosynthesis are coordinated. In walled cells, the rate of volume growth is dictated largely by cell-wall synthesis and turgor pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rojas and Huang, 2018</xref>). In principle, feedback mechanisms could tightly couple biosynthesis with wall expansion. However, recent studies have demonstrated that it is possible to decouple biosynthesis from volume growth. For instance, budding yeast cells that are arrested in G1 phase grow to very large sizes and exhibit dilution of the cytoplasm accompanied by decreased protein synthesis and growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, temporary inhibition of volume growth using osmotic oscillations or inhibition of secretion leads to increased density accompanied by a subsequent dramatic increase in volume growth rate in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knapp et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Numerous methods have been developed to measure aspects of biomass and intracellular density and crowding in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchison, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neurohr and Amon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zangle and Teitell, 2014</xref>). Suspended microchannel resonators (SMRs) infer buoyant cell mass from changes in the frequency of a resonating cantilever as a single cell passes through an embedded microchannel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burg et al., 2007</xref>). As an alternative to SMRs, quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is a well-established optical technique for extracting dry-mass measurements from changes in the refractive index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2018</xref>), as the refractive indices of major cellular components such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zangle and Teitell, 2014</xref>). Previous studies have used phase gratings or holography to generate phase-shift maps that can be used to quantify intracellular density; these approaches require specialized equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Precise measurement of density throughout the cell cycle requires non-invasive, long-term quantification of single cells at high spatial and temporal resolution.</p><p>Here, we developed a new QPI method for measuring the intracellular density of fission yeast cells. This label-free method is based on the analysis of <italic>z</italic>-stacks of bright-field images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bostan et al., 2016</xref>), thus having the advantage of not requiring a specialized phase objective or holographic system. The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is a leading cell-cycle model, as these rod-shaped cells have a highly regular shape, size, and cell cycle conducive to quantitative analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoffman et al., 2015</xref>). Using QPI to track the density of individual cells as they grew and divided within a microfluidic chamber, we determined that wild-type fission yeast cells exhibit characteristic density changes during the cell cycle, in which density falls during G2 phase and increases during mitosis and cytokinesis. These density variations arise from differences in the relative rates of volume and mass growth; while mass grows exponentially throughout the cell cycle, volume growth varies dependent on cell cycle stage/phase. Perturbations to cell-cycle progression and/or growth exacerbated density changes. We further observed gradients in density within single cells and found that intracellular density variations were correlated with tip growth and intracellular pressure. Our findings illustrate a general mechanism by which density is regulated through controlling the relative rates of volume growth and biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>QPI enables high-resolution measurements of intracellular density in growing cells</title><p>To measure intracellular density using a standard wide-field microscope, we developed a version of QPI in which the phase shift is retrieved computationally from a <italic>z-</italic>stack of bright-field images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bostan et al., 2016</xref>).

As observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitchison and Nurse, 1985</xref>), volume measurements showed that cells exhibited steady tip growth in interphase (mostly G2 phase), and then volume growth slowed or halted during mitosis and cytokinesis (defined here as the period starting from septum formation and ending at daughter-cell separation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Density gradually decreased from the beginning of the cell cycle through G2 phase by ~5%, followed by a steady rise during mitosis and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By contrast to volume, dry mass increased steadily throughout the cell cycle without any obvious transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These measurements suggest that the density increase during mitosis and cytokinesis is a consequence of continued mass accumulation when volume growth halts.</p><p>We confirmed these density variations using complementary approaches. We used a suspended microchannel resonator (SMR) to measure the buoyant mass of single cells in two different density solutions and thereby derive single-cell buoyant densities and volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grover et al., 2011</xref>; Materials and methods). SMR measurements revealed that fission yeast exhibit a mean buoyant density of 1.108 ± 0.005 g/mL, and buoyant densities were lower in intermediate-sized cells than in small and large cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>), consistent with our QPI-based observations of cell cycle-dependent densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As expected, the relative changes in buoyant density were much less than changes in dry-mass density due to the different nature of the respective measurements: dry-mass density accounts only for a fraction of buoyant density as cells are comprised mostly of water, and hence relative changes are magnified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feijó Delgado et al., 2013</xref>). The general cell-cycle variations in density were also confirmed using holographic methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rappaz et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We also identified an additional change in density at cell birth. At the end of cytokinesis, the middle layer of the septum is digested, and daughter cells separate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martín-Cuadrado et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hercyk et al., 2019</xref>). During this 5–10 min period, the septum bulges outward on each side to form the rounded shape of the new end, in a physical process driven by turgor pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atilgan et al., 2015</xref>). QPI analysis of individual cells showed a consistent drop in density within a 5-min window around cell separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>); during this period, cell volume increased by ~5% while density decreased by ~5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The magnitude and rapidity of the density change suggest that the volume increase at cell separation is due primarily to swelling from water uptake. Thus, density appears to be directly tied to the dynamics of volume expansion.</p><p>Our precision measurements of cellular dimensions and intracellular density provide a quantitative characterization of dry-mass dynamics (biosynthesis) throughout the cell cycle. The absolute rate of dry-mass accumulation steadily increased during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Dry-mass dynamics were more exponential than linear in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), as shown by a comparison of linear versus exponential fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and in the dynamics of normalized mass growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The absolute rate of mass synthesis was therefore higher during mitosis and cytokinesis than at the beginning of the cell cycle, even though the cell slowed in volume growth late in the cycle. Thus, mass production was not tightly coupled to volume growth. These measurements suggest a simple model in which the increase of density in mitosis and cytokinesis arises as consequence of continued mass accumulation when volume growth is halted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cell-cycle perturbations exacerbate cell cycle-dependent density variation</title><p>Our data demonstrate that intracellular density increases during mitosis and cytokinesis as a result of biosynthesis continuing unabated while volume growth slows; conversely, density decreases during interphase because the rate of volume growth surpasses the rate of mass synthesis. However, the origin of these dynamics remains unresolved. One possibility is that the relative rates of mass synthesis and volume growth are not directly coupled; with mass growing exponentially, density variations then arise indirectly as a consequence of cell-cycle regulation of volume expansion, which is controlled by cell polarity programs that redirect the cell wall growth machinery to the middle of the cell for septum formation prior to cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Simanis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martin and Arkowitz, 2014</xref>). Alternatively, the density at each cell-cycle stage could be directly programmed to specific levels by specific cell-cycle regulators. Another possibility is that density variations may be due to a cell cycle-independent oscillator, such as a metabolic oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papagiannakis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). To distinguish these models, we examined the consequences of arresting or delaying cells at particular stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). If there is no strict control of biosynthesis then when mitosis or cytokinesis is blocked, mass should continue to accumulate and density should reach higher levels than in normal cells, and conversely density should fall below normal in extended interphase. If density is instead regulated at specific levels according to cell-cycle phase, density levels should not change during cell-cycle delays beyond the ranges appropriate for each phase. If a cell cycle-independent oscillator governs density variations, then oscillations could continue even during cell-cycle arrests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Novak and Mitchison, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchison, 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Extension of the G2 phase of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> cell cycle results in cell elongation and decreased intracellular density.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the fission yeast cell cycle, highlighting the point at which the <italic>cdc25</italic> temperature-sensitive mutant delays the G2-M transition.

To focus on cells that remained in G2 phase for an extended interval, we limited our analysis to cells that elongated to &gt;2.5 fold their initial length.

No evidence of density oscillations in the prolonged G2 phase was evident, arguing against cell-cycle independent oscillations as the cause of density variations during a normal cell cycle.

As expected, our time-lapse data showed that the old and new ends grew over the course of the cycle on average by ~4 and 2 µm, respectively. In QPI density maps, we noted that many cells exhibited a gradient of intracellular density in which the ends that were actively growing appeared less dense than the non-growing ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We hypothesized that these subcellular gradients reflected differences in tip growth between the two ends of the cell. In agreement with our hypothesis, the slower-growing new end typically appeared denser than the faster-growing end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In some cells, the difference in densities between the fast- and slow-growing ends was ~10% of the mean overall density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Examples of post-cytokinesis cells with adjacent compartments exhibiting different densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) further indicated that these differences could not be explained simply by width differences.

One variable potentially connected with intracellular density is macromolecular crowding. High concentrations of macromolecules are predicted to produce colloid osmotic pressure that may influence cell mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchison, 2019</xref>). As noted above, the densities of daughter compartments in septated cells were often different from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>); these differences were often exacerbated in cells with cell-division defects, such as <italic>mid1</italic>, <italic>mid2</italic>, and <italic>cdc16</italic> cells. We noted that the septum between these daughter cells generally bent away from the more dense compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A similar situation was observed in multi-septated cells in which the internal cellular compartment, whose volume growth is restricted by two septa, increased in density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, right). Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atilgan et al., 2015</xref>) reported that the septum is an elastic structure that can be used as a biosensor that reports on osmotic pressure differences between compartments. For instance, when one daughter is lysed by laser microsurgery and loses turgor pressure, the septum bulges away from the intact daughter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atilgan et al., 2015</xref>). Temporal fluctuations in septum bending have been proposed to arise from fluctuations in pressure differences between daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Muñoz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the relationship between density differences and septum bending, we focused on <italic>mid2∆</italic> cells. Mid2 is an anillin ortholog that regulates septins in late cytokinesis; <italic>mid2∆</italic> mutants exhibit long delays (1–2 hr) in cell separation and thus most cells in the population have one or more septa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berlin et al., 2003</xref>). We used QPI to track intracellular density over time and identified the time after septum formation at which the maximum density difference was reached for each cell. Of the 71% (64/90) of cells exhibiting a bent septum, 97% (62/64) exhibited a septum bent away from the compartment of higher density at the time of maximum density difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), with a mean maximum difference of 16 ± 5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In 2/90 cells, the septum was bent in the opposite manner, toward the compartment of lower density; in these rare instances, the maximum density difference was substantially lower (5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and may represent cases in which the septum is fluctuating in direction. Indeed, in one cell, the fluctuating direction of septum bending coincided with alternation of the sign of the density difference between the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In instances where the septum appeared flat, the density difference was substantially lower (~4.5%) than in cells with a bent septum. The observation that septal bending occurred for density differences as low as 5–10% suggests that the density variations over the course of a normal cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), in cell cycle-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) or between growing and non-growing cell tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) may reflect substantial changes in turgor-mediated stresses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we established a QPI method based on <italic>z</italic>-stacks of bright-field images for quantifying intracellular density dynamics in living cells. We found that exponential-phase fission yeast cells have a dry-mass density of 282 ± 16 mg/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>) and a buoyant-mass density of 1.108 ± 0.005 g/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), comparable to measurements in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neurohr and Amon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bryan et al., 2010</xref>). Density varied systematically across the cell cycle in wild-type fission yeast cells over a range of ~10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), while the relative rate of dry-mass synthesis remained constant (reflecting exponential accumulation) throughout all cell-cycle stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). These quantitative findings, which utilize precise sub-pixel measurements of cellular dimensions and automated analysis platforms, are consistent with more qualitative density studies of fission yeast using other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rappaz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mitchison, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stonyte et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our data support a model in which these density variations during the cell cycle are a product of programmed changes in volume growth accompanied by a constant relative rate of mass biosynthesis. Accordingly, volume growth and biosynthesis were not tightly coupled throughout the cell cycle. During tip growth in G2 phase, intracellular density dropped steadily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>), indicating that the rate of volume growth outpaces biosynthesis during this period. Density steadily rose during mitosis and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), when volume growth ceases or slows. After separation of daughter cells (cell birth), density dropped during the rapid increase in cell volume as the new cell end expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atilgan et al., 2015</xref>), possibly due to water influx.</p><p>Consistent with this model, density shifts were exacerbated by perturbations of cell-cycle progression or of volume growth directly. <italic>cdc25</italic> mutants delayed in G2 phase exhibited a steady decline in density as cells elongated abnormally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), reminiscent of the cytoplasmic dilution observed in very enlarged budding yeast cells and senescent mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref>). During mitotic arrest at the spindle checkpoint (<italic>cut7</italic>) or cytokinesis arrest through regulation of the SIN pathway (<italic>cdc16</italic>), volume growth was slowed but mass synthesis was unaffected, resulting in steady density increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,E</xref>). Inhibition of cell growth with latrunculin A caused a steady increase in density regardless of cell-cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These findings suggest that any perturbation that affects cell-cycle progression or growth is likely to alter density dynamics. Cell-cycle arrests are commonly used to synchronize cells and are often triggered in response to stresses such as DNA damage. Our study demonstrates that such perturbations are not as innocuous as often thought; arrests not only affect cell-cycle progression and cell size, but also cause changes in intracellular density and potentially other downstream changes in physiology.</p><p>Our studies provide quantitative measurements of the mass dynamics of individual fission yeast cells throughout the cell cycle. We found that mass accumulation was continuous, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mitchison, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stonyte et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, our quantitative measurements suggested that mass dynamics were exponential in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), consistent with findings in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Godin et al., 2010</xref>). Intriguingly, studies of density and growth in other cell types reported somewhat different cell-cycle patterns. In budding yeast, buoyant density is lowest in early G1 and rises in late G1 and S phase at the time of bud formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bryan et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, cell-cycle arrests in S and M phase and latrunculin A treatment do not lead to increases in buoyant density in budding yeast, unlike our findings in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In human cells, mass growth continues in early mitosis, but stops in metaphase and resumes in late cytokinesis, potentially with subtle oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miettinen et al., 2019</xref>). Density is constant in human cells during much of the cell cycle, but decreases in mitosis (by 0.5% in buoyant mass, equivalent to &gt;10% decrease in dry-mass density) coincident with a 10–30% volume increase during mitotic rounding; density then slightly increases in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Son et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zlotek-Zlotkiewicz et al., 2015</xref>). In the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, density varies somewhat from birth to division, but the ratio of surface area to mass is relatively constant, suggesting that biosynthesis is linked to surface-area synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oldewurtel et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we found that in fission yeast, mass was also more closely coupled with surface area than volume, especially when the surface area of both sides of the septum were factored in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). However, examples such as latruculin A-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) demonstrated that mass accumulation and surface area growth are not inextricably linked and can be uncoupled. It remains to be seen whether general rules of cell-density regulation will emerge from comparisons across organisms and cell types.</p><p>Our findings also provide insight into the relationship between the rate of volume growth and subcellular density regulation. Fission yeast cells grow through tip growth, which involves the extension and assembly of new cell wall and plasma membrane at the growing tip; this growth is accomplished by a complex integration of the cell-polarity machinery, exocytosis, wall growth and mechanics, and turgor pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martin and Arkowitz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang and Martin, 2009</xref>). In addition to the global effect of volume growth on density, the intriguing polarization of density patterns that we discovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggests that tip growth influences local intracellular density patterns more directly. Spatial gradients revealed that local density was correlated with tip growth, with growing ends having lower density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). It is not yet clear what cellular components are responsible for this spatial pattern, and whether they are actively depleted at growing cell tips or concentrated at non-growing regions. FITC staining revealed asymmetry in the distribution of total protein/RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This gradient may be caused by the distribution of membrane-bound or membrane-less organelles; it is unlikely that it arises from soluble, freely diffusing particles, unless a diffusion barrier (perhaps the nucleus) exists. We note that polarized patterns have been detected in immunofluorescence of damaged (carbonylated) proteins, which may impact replicative aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erjavec et al., 2008</xref>). Polarized density patterns established in interphase were often propagated through cell division and appeared to be inherited by the daughter cells, resulting in differences in density across a lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). How these patterns may lead to asymmetric behaviors in cell lineages such as growth patterns and aging remains to be explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang and Martin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erjavec et al., 2008</xref>). Spatial heterogeneities in density have also been observed in mammalian cells; it remains to be determined whether these patterns are related to cell shape, organelles, or variations in cytoplasmic density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tolde et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The effects of changes in intracellular density on cellular functions are only beginning to be appreciated. The density changes of 5–20% that we observed, which likely affect the concentration of most if not all cellular components in the cytoplasm, could have profound consequences for the biochemistry of cellular reactions and on macromolecular crowding and viscosity, for instance through effects on diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchison, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van den Berg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Luby-Phelps, 2000</xref>). An intriguing implication of our findings is that the observed density variations may signify cell-cycle-dependent and spatial changes in the physical properties of the cytoplasm. Here, we provided evidence that density also affects cell mechanics and thereby influence cell shape. Intracellular osmotic pressure and density differences between daughter compartments were strongly coupled, as evidenced by bending of the elastic septal cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Density may affect pressure through effects on macromolecular crowding, which produces colloid osmotic pressure associated with the displacement of water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchison, 2019</xref>). Differences in colloid osmotic pressure have been proposed to influence nuclear size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchison, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harding and Feldherr, 1959</xref>), but experimental evidence linking crowding to force generation <italic>in vivo</italic> generally remains scant. Our findings thus lend important support to the idea that different densities of macromolecules can generate large enough differences in colloid osmotic pressure to alter cell shape. We speculate that the increase of density at cell division may provide mechanical force through increased turgor pressure to facilitate cell-cell separation and bulging of the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atilgan et al., 2015</xref>), and may affect the distribution of mechanical stresses within the cell wall during other cell-cycle stages as well.</p><p>Despite these changes in density, as a population cells maintained a relatively tight distribution of densities (CV ~6%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting the existence of homeostatic mechanisms to maintain density levels. Indeed, consistent with homeostasis, our findings indicate partial correction of density fluctuations over the course of a cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). One possible homeostasis mechanism is via regulation of volume growth rates. In fission yeast, perturbations that increase density are followed by a dramatic increase in volume growth rate that reduces density back to normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knapp et al., 2019</xref>). How density impacts volume growth rate, possibly via the concentration of certain intracellular factors or through effects on intracellular pressure, remains to be elucidated. It is also possible that cells maintain density by tuning biosynthesis rates in other circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miettinen et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies focusing on the effects of cell density on particular cellular processes will be needed to understand the full scope of consequences of density variations on cell physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Wild-type <italic>S. pombe</italic></td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">FC15, <break/><italic>h<sup>- </sup></italic>wild-type strain 972</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>;

Methods for propagation and growth of <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells were as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moreno et al., 1991</xref>. In general, cultures were grown in 3 mL of YE5S medium at 30°C on a rotating shaker overnight to OD<sub>600</sub> ~1, diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> ~0.1, and incubated until OD<sub>600</sub> ~0.3 for imaging. Temperature sensitive mutant c<italic>dc25-22</italic> cells (and wild-type control cells) were first grown at room temperature; 90 min after imaging started, the temperature was increased to 32°C. Temperature-sensitive mutant <italic>cdc16-116</italic> cells (and wild-type control cells) were first grown at 25°C, then imaged on the microscope with the temperature-controlled enclosure pre-heated to 34°C. Temperature-sensitive mutant <italic>cut7-446</italic> cells (and wild-type control cells) were first grown at 25°C, then imaged on the microscope with the temperature-controlled enclosure pre-heated to 30°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Single-cell imaging</title><p>Images were acquired with a Ti-Eclipse inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with a 680 nm bandpass filter (D680/30, Chroma Technology) in the illumination path with a 60X (NA: 1.4) DIC oil objective (Nikon). Before imaging, Koehler illumination was configured and the peak illumination intensity at 10 ms exposure time was set to the middle of the dynamic range of the Zyla sCMOS 4.2 camera (Andor Technology). µManager v. 1.41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edelstein et al., 2014</xref>) was used to automate acquisition of <italic>z-</italic>stack bright-field images with a step size of 250 nm from ±3 µm around the focal plane (total of 25 imaging planes) to ensure substantial oversampling that facilitated correcting for potential drift in the <italic>z</italic>-direction over the course of each experiment at 5- or 10 min intervals at multiple (<italic>x,y</italic>) positions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Microfluidics</title><p>Cellasic microfluidic flow cell plates (Millipore, Y04C) controlled by an ONIX or ONIX2 (Millipore) microfluidic pump system were used for imaging. YE5S medium was loaded into all but one of the fluid reservoirs; the remaining well was loaded with 100 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma Aldrich) in YE5S. Liquid was flowed from all six channels for at least 5 min at 5 psi (corresponding to 34.5 kPa), followed by 5 min of flow from YE5S-containing wells to wash out buffer and to fill channels and imaging chambers. The plate was kept in a temperature-controlled enclosure (OkoLab) throughout loading. Cells were then transferred into the appropriate well and loaded into the microfluidic imaging chamber such that a small number of cells were initially trapped, and flow of YE5S was applied. To ensure full exchange of liquid in the chamber during imaging, the flow channel was switched at least 40 s before images were acquired. Every ~2 hr, BSA flow was activated during one time point of imaging to calibrate QPI measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image analysis to retrieve phase shifts</title><p>To reduce post-processing time, each <italic>z</italic>-stack was cropped to a square region containing the cell(s) of interest and a border of at least 40 pixels, and the focal plane was identified. This cropping was accomplished first using FIJI v. 1.53c to identify regions of interest (ROIs) within a thresholded standard deviation <italic>z</italic>-projection image of each brightfield <italic>z</italic>-stack. Using custom Matlab R2019a (Mathworks) scripts, images were cropped to the ROIs and the standard deviation of the pixels in each ROI was computed. The focal plane was defined based on the image in the stack with the lowest standard deviation. Three images above and three images below the focal plane separated by 500 nm were used to quantify cytoplasmic density. Based on these images, the phase information was calculated using a custom Matlab script implementing a previously published algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bostan et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, this method relates the phase information of the cell to bright-field image intensity changes along the <italic>z</italic>-direction. Equidistant, out-of-focus images above and below the focal plane are used to estimate intensity changes at various defocus distances. A phase-shift map is reconstructed in a non-linear, iterative fashion to solve the transport-of-intensity equation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cytoplasmic density quantification</title><p>Using Matlab, images were background-corrected by fitting a Gaussian to the highest peak of the histogram (corresponding to the background pixels) of the phase-shift map and shifting every pixel so that the background intensity peak corresponded to zero phase shift. These background-corrected phase-shift maps were converted into binary images using watershedding for cell segmentation; where necessary, binary images were corrected manually to ensure accurate segmentation. Binary images were segmented using Morphometrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ursell et al., 2017</xref>) to generate subpixel-resolved cell outlines.</p><p>Each cell outline was skeletonized using custom Matlab code as follows. First, the closest-fitting rectangle around each cell was used to define the long axis of the cell. Perpendicular to the long axis, sectioning lines at 250 nm intervals and their intersection with the cell contour were computed. The centerline was then updated to run through the midpoint of each sectioning line between the two contour-intersection points. The slope of each sectioning line was updated to be perpendicular to the slope of the centerline around the midpoint. Sectioning lines that crossed a neighboring line were removed. Cell volume and surface area were calculated by summing the volume or area of each section, assuming rotational symmetry. Volume and area of the poles were calculated assuming a regular spherical cap.</p><p>To convert the mean intensity of the phase-shift within each cell into absolute concentration (in units of mg/mL), the mean of all cells across all time points was first calculated. Then, the decrease in phase shift induced by a prescribed concentration of BSA (typically 100 mg/mL) was defined as the difference between the mean of the phase shifts before and after the BSA imaging time point and the phase shift during the BSA time point. This difference in intensity established the calibration scaling between phase shift intensity and the concentration of BSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The cytoplasmic density of each cell was then calculated by dividing the mean phase shift of the cell by the aforementioned scaling factor. The mass of each cell was inferred from its mean density and volume.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>BSA calibration</title><p>Channel slides (µ-Slide VI 0.4, ibidi) were treated with lectin (Sigma-Aldrich, L1395) (0.1 mg/mL in water) for ~5 min, washed with YE5S, and cells were added and incubated for ~5 min to allow for attachment. Unattached cells were removed by washing with YE5S. Solutions of BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, A3608) in YE5S were made fresh. Attached cells in the chamber were first imaged in YE5S medium, then shifted transiently to YE5S containing different concentrations of BSA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Lipid droplet staining</title><p>Lipid droplets were stained with the dye BODIPY 493/503 (Thermo Fisher, D3922) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meyers et al., 2016</xref>). Aliquots (10 µL) of 100 mM BODIPY in absolute ethanol were prepared. Ethanol was then evaporated in a desiccator under vacuum and dried aliquots were stored at 4°C for long-term storage. For use, an aliquot was redissolved in 10 µL absolute ethanol and 1 µL was added to 1 mL of cell culture in YE5S for each unit of cell density with OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.1 and incubated protected from light for ~1 min at room temperature. Cells were then pelleted at 0.4 rcf in a microfuge for 1 min and medium was exchanged with fresh YE5S. Cells were spotted onto agarose pads and imaged with an EM-CCD camera (Hamamatsu) through a spinning-disk confocal system (Yokogawa CSU-10) attached to one of the ports of a Nikon Ti-Eclipse inverted microscope with a 488 nm laser. In parallel, bright-field <italic>z</italic>-stack images were acquired for QPI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Lineage tracking for time-lapse imaging datasets</title><p>First, each cell present at the beginning of the experiment was linked to the closest cell in the next frame based on the distance between centers and the difference in their size (cross-sectional area). A cell was considered the same if the centers between consecutive time points were within 20 pixels (~2 µm) and the cross-sectional area was &gt;70% of the area at the previous time point. This process was iterated to define the lineage until either requirement was violated (usually due to cell division), at which point a new lineage was initialized using the earliest unassigned cell. All lineages were visually inspected and corrected when necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Polar growth and density quantification</title><p>To separately quantify the growth of the new and old ends, fiduciary markers such as birth scars on the cell outline were identified from which the distance to each pole at the beginning and completion of the cell cycle was measured. The density of each polar region was calculated by extracting the peak of the histogram of density values in the region within 3 µm of the pole at each time point, and then calculating the mean over time points. For FITC staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knapp et al., 2019</xref>), cells were grown in exponential phase in YE5S liquid cultures at 30°C. One milliliter of cell culture was fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Thermo Scientific, Cat. #28906) for 60 min, washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and stored at 4°C. Two hundred microliters of fixed cells were then split into two separate tubes, one of which them was treated with 0.1 mg/mL RNAse (Thermo Scientific, Cat. #EN0531), and both tubes were incubated with shaking for 2 hr at 37°C. Next, cells were washed in PBS and stained with 50 ng/mL FITC (Sigma, Cat. #F7250) in PBS for 30 min, then washed three times in PBS. Cells were mounted on a PBS + 1% agarose pad and imaged in bright field and with 488 nm laser illumination on a spinning disc confocal microscope. Images were acquired with 300 nm <italic>z</italic>-steps. Monopolar cells (cells growing only at the old end) were selected manually on the basis of their cell shape, as visualized in bright-field images by a person without access to the fluorescence images. Cells were designated as monopolar based on the position of the birthscar at the new end and the characteristic curvatures of growing and non-growing cell ends. For each selected cell, FITC intensity values were calculated from images of a single medial focal plane, a sum of three medial 300 nm <italic>z</italic>-slices, or a sum of <italic>z</italic>-slices encompassing the entire cell. To measure the intensity profile along the long axis, FITC signal was measured in a stripe 1.2 µm in width along the long axis. Background intensity was subtracted, and intensities were normalized to the maximum intensity along the line profile within each cell. For comparison between the old end (OE) and new end (NE), intensities were measured in defined regions near the cell poles at 0.2–0.3 (NE) and 0.7–0.8 (OE) along the normalized cell length.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Suspended microchannel resonator (SMR) measurements</title><p>SMR-based density and volume measurements were carried out according to a previously reported fluid-switching method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grover et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, the SMR measures the buoyant mass of a cell by flowing in culture medium through a vibrating cantilever and measuring changes in vibration frequency. The cell is then mixed with a denser medium composed of 50% culture medium and 50% OptiPrep (Sigma-Aldrich), and flowed back through the cantilever to obtain a second buoyant mass measurement 10 s later. Cell volume and density are calculated from the two consecutive buoyant mass measurements based on the known densities of the two fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grover et al., 2011</xref>). Each cell is serially flushed into the system in culture medium from a reservoir at 30°C. After every hour of measurement, the reservoir is replenished from an exponential-phase culture.</p><p>SMR devices were fabricated at CEA-LETI (Grenoble, France). The physical dimensions and operation of the SMR, as well as data analyses, were identical to those reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miettinen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kang et al., 2019</xref>. Briefly, the SMR cantilever was vibrated in the second flexural bending mode using a piezo-ceramic plate underneath the SMR chip. The vibration frequency of the cantilever was measured using piezo-resistors at the base of the cantilever. A digital control platform was used to drive the cantilever in a feedback mode, where the vibration frequency signal acquired from the piezo-resistor was delayed, amplified, and used as the drive signal to actuate the cantilever. Fluid flow was controlled using two electronic pressure regulators and solenoid valves, which were used to pressurize vials containing the culture medium. A typical cell transit time through the cantilever was 150 ms. System temperature was controlled by mounting the SMR and culture-medium vials on copper stands connected to a heated water bath. All SMR operations were controlled using National Instruments control cards and custom LabVIEW (2012) code. Frequency data were analyzed using previously reported custom Matlab code that measures the maximum frequency change during the transit of each cell through the cantilever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kang et al., 2019</xref>). Frequency measurements were calibrated using polystyrene beads and NaCl solutions of known density.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Holographic refractive index measurements</title><p>For refractive index measurements, wild-type <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells grown at 30°C were immobilized on a lectin-coated glass-bottom 35 mm diameter µ-dish (ibidi). Holographic refractive index measurements were acquired with a 3D Cell Explorer system (Nanolive) with a temperature-controlled enclosure set to 30°C. First, sum images of <italic>z-</italic>stacks of three-dimensional refractive index maps were generated to retrieve cell outlines by watershedding. Cells oriented at an angle to the flat glass bottom dish were ignored. For each remaining cell, the mean refractive index was extracted from each image in the <italic>z</italic>-stack using Matlab and the highest value (assumed to correspond to the middle plane) was used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Latrunculin A treatment</title><p>Stock solutions were made by dissolving 100 µg latrunculin A (Abacam, ab144290) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) to a concentration of 20 mM and stored at −20°C in 1 µL aliquots. To prepare agarose pads, 1 µL of 20 mM latrunculin A or 1 µL of DMSO was mixed with 100 µL of YE5S medium containing 2% (w/v) agarose UltraPure agarose (Invitrogen Corporation) kept in a water bath at ~70°C. The mixture was pipetted onto a microscope glass slide and quickly covered with another slide to form flat agarose pads with thickness of ~2 mm. Once pads had solidified, one slide was carefully removed and 1–2 µL of exponential-phase wild-type cells were deposited on the agarose pad. Cells were allowed to settle for 1–2 min before a coverslip was placed on top and sides were sealed with Valap (1:1:1 vaseline:lanolin:paraffin) to prevent evaporation during imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The magnitude of the correlation between two continuous variables was reported using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> and associated p-values were calculated using the built-in function corrcoef in Matlab R2019a (Mathworks).

It provides a broadly applicable method for dry mass measurement of single cells and, using it, it describe how cell density varies across the cell division cycle. The key finding of this article is the fact that growth in mass and volume seem to be generally uncoupled, leading to significant density changes. The method developed can be used across multiple biological systems to investigate similar questions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Variations of intracellular density during the cell cycle arise from tip-growth regulation in fission yeast&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mohan Balasubramanian as the Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Matthieu Piel (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The editors and referees agreed that you have developed a novel and highly quantitative approach to investigate some key questions in cell physiology that require precise measurements of cell dry mass density and how this tracks cell cycle progression. The referees also paid particular attention to the density gradients that you have identified, which all agreed was exciting. However, a small number of issues were raised both in the review process and also during further discussion.</p><p>I think most issues raised can be fixed with appropriate rewriting, although you may need new data in 1-2 cases.</p><p>Below I have summarized the essential revisions required for further consideration. The referee’s comments also are appended below verbatim.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Density gradients (5-10%) are apparent in G2 cells, with lower density at faster growing (old end) poles. The gradients persist through mitosis and cytokinesis, giving birth to daughter cells whose mean densities reliably differ from each other. These findings would appear to suggest that density differences might accumulate with each generation, but this is clearly not the case as the density variation in a cell population is very small (CV ~ 6%). This raises the interesting question of how density homeostasis is maintained, which this paper does not address but could clearly be investigated with available tools/mutants/conditions.</p><p>2. Supp Figure 4: The authors' surface area measurements require estimation of septum surface area. Those estimates assume a relation between optical density and fractional septum diameter (rather than fractional septal area?) that would seem to need validation.</p><p>3. To me, the most interesting result is that density gradients a stable within cells. This result must have important implications in cytosolic viscosity, which I was disappointed was not explicitly discussed. The discussion does claim that the &quot;distributions of large organelles and total protein are not polarized&quot;, but it is not clear that the papers cited to support that claim would be able to detect the ~5% reported difference in density. The organelle paper contains no quantitation and the noise in the protein paper looks to be around 10%.</p><p>4. I was surprised that the density increases in the control cells in Figure 5B. That result seems to contradict the result that density decreases during interphase (Figure 1C). The authors should address this apparent contradiction.</p><p>5. I could not understand how it is possible that internal density gradients are established.

They find that density decreases during G2 and increases during mitosis/cytokinesis. The idea that dry mass growth continues while volume growth stops during mitosis, leading to cell cycle fluctuations in density, dates back to the early work of JM Mitchison. Data on cdc mutants and Latrunculin treatment are consistent with the idea that while mass increases continuously, cell cycle-regulated changes in volume growth create the density oscillations, which seems unsurprising. One difference between the current work and older work is that JM Mitchison thought the dry mass increase was linear, while here it is argued to be exponential (consistent with some other work on protein synthesis). Overall, the quantitative data appeared to me to convincingly support the authors' conclusions.</p><p>Perhaps the more interesting findings come in the last two figures. Density gradients (5-10%) are apparent in G2 cells, with lower density at faster growing (old end) poles. The gradients persist through mitosis and cytokinesis, giving birth to daughter cells whose mean densities reliably differ from each other. These findings would appear to suggest that density differences might accumulate with each generation, but this is clearly not the case as the density variation in a cell population is very small (CV ~ 6%).

We have now added important new data demonstrating density homeostasis (new Figure 1D). Similar to cell size homeostasis analyses, we plotted the change in density over the entire cell cycle as a function of the density at the beginning of the cell cycle. The plot revealed an inverse relationship consistent with homeostatic behavior over the cell cycle, whereby cells with higher or lower than average density at the beginning of the cell cycle end up closer to the average by the end of the cell cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We note that we used the intensity of the QPI signal because it was not possible to accurately measure the dimensions of the septa directly from the QPI images.</p><p>The new results are shown in Figure 2-supplement 3 and show that the ratio of surface area to mass remains relatively constant throughout the cell cycle. We have modified the discussion of this figure accordingly, these changes do not affect the general conclusions of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. To me, the most interesting result is that density gradients a stable within cells. This result must have important implications in cytosolic viscosity, which I was disappointed was not explicitly discussed. The discussion does claim that the &quot;distributions of large organelles and total protein are not polarized&quot;, but it is not clear that the papers cited to support that claim would be able to detect the ~5% reported difference in density. The organelle paper contains no quantitation and the noise in the protein paper looks to be around 10%.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we now provide new data on the spatial distribution of intracellular contents that support the observed gradient in density. We show that FITC staining of total protein and RNA reveals similar spatial gradients as for density, in which the intensity at the old end is on average 5% less than at the new end in cells growing only at one pole. Similar differences between the cell ends were observed in analyses of FITC intensity data from single or multiple focal planes. These data are now included in new Figure 6-supplement 2. These findings strongly support the existence of an intracellular density gradient.</p><p>We agree that currently available literature are not able to conclusively determine whether organelle distribution contributes to this gradient distribution and hence have revised our point regarding organelle distribution.</p><p>We have included in the discussion the exciting possibility that these density changes may affect spatial and temporal variation in crowding, diffusion, and viscosity in the cytoplasm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I was surprised that the density increases in the control cells in Figure 5B. That result seems to contradict the result that density decreases during interphase (Figure 1C). The authors should address this apparent contradiction.</p></disp-quote><p>The apparent density rise in the control cells over time is due to the nature of the measurement method and the lack of synchronization among the population at the time of treatment. As each cell completed a cell cycle and divides, it was thereafter no longer counted in the cohort. Since the cells were asynchronous, over time the tracked population was enriched for cells in mitosis or cell division, which experience an increase in density (Figure 1C). We have clarified this point in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. I could not understand how it is possible that internal density gradients are established.

To validate these findings, we have added important new data using FITC staining showing that total protein and RNA also exhibit a gradient (new Figure 6-supplement 2). As FITC does not stain the cell wall, these data argue against the gradient being due to variations in the mass of the cell wall. Moreover, we note that our QPI method may not recognize the lateral cell wall; for instance, birth scars, which are regions of thicker cell wall, do not exhibit higher intensity by QPI.</p><p>We have added speculation to the text that this stable spatial density gradient might be due to asymmetric distributions of organelles or other structures that do not diffuse freely. We hope to study the basis of this gradient further in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

We propose that macromolecules exert colloid osmotic pressure, as discussed in Mitchison’s MBoC review. This colloid pressure may be smaller than the turgor pressure produced by small solutes such as ions, but may cause enough difference between the compartments to bend the septum.
