pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41497.001</object-id><p>Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me), a widely-distributed chromatin mark, largely results from association of the lysine methyltransferase (KMT) SET-2 with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), but most eukaryotes also have additional H3K36me KMTs that act independently of RNAPII. These include the orthologs of ASH1, which are conserved in animals, plants, and fungi but whose function and control are poorly understood. We found that <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> has just two H3K36 KMTs, ASH1 and SET-2, and were able to explore the function and distribution of each enzyme independently. While H3K36me deposited by SET-2 marks active genes, inactive genes are modified by ASH1 and its activity is critical for their repression. ASH1-marked chromatin can be further modified by methylation of H3K27, and ASH1 catalytic activity modulates the accumulation of H3K27me2/3 both positively and negatively. These findings provide new insight into ASH1 function, H3K27me2/3 establishment, and repression in facultative heterochromatin.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41497.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Not all genes in a cell’s DNA are active all the time. There are several ways to control this activity. One is by altering how the DNA is packaged into cells. DNA strands are wrapped around proteins called histones to form nucleosomes. Nucleosomes can then be packed together tightly, to restrict access to the DNA at genes that are not active, or loosely to allow access to the DNA of active genes.</p><p>Chemical marks, such as methyl groups, can be attached to particular sites on histones to influence how they pack together. One important site for such marks is known as position 36 on histone H3, or H3K36 for short. Correctly adding methyl groups to this site is critical for normal development, and when this process goes wrong it can lead to diseases like cancer. An enzyme called SET-2 oversees the methylation of H3K36 in fungi, plants and animals. However, many species have several other enzymes that can also add methyl groups to H3K36, and their roles are less clear.</p><p>A type of fungus called <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> contains just two enzymes that can add methyl groups to H3K36: SET-2, and another enzyme called ASH1. By performing experiments that inactivated SET-2 and ASH1 in this fungus, Bicocca et al. found that each enzyme works on a different set of genes. Genes in regions marked by SET-2 were accessible for the cell to use, while genes marked by ASH1 were inaccessible. ASH1 also affects whether a methyl group is added to another site on histone H3. This mark is important for controlling the activity of genes that are critical for development.</p><p>ASH1 is found in many other organisms, including humans. The results presented by Bicocca et al. could therefore be built upon to understand the more complicated systems for regulating H3K36 methylation in other species. From there, we can investigate how to intervene when things go wrong during developmental disorders and cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>H3K36 methylation</kwd><kwd>H3K27 methylation</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>Set2</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>gene silencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>N. crassa</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA180468</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bicocca</surname><given-names>Vincent T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM093061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selker</surname><given-names>Eric U</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM035690</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selker</surname><given-names>Eric U</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM127142</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selker</surname><given-names>Eric U</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>While SET-2 methylates histone H3K36 during transcription, ASH1 methylates this residue in repressed regions, is important for silencing, and can both positively and negatively influence methylation of histone H3K27.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me) is largely associated with euchromatic regions of eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ho et al., 2014</xref>). It serves as a link to transcription, as a H3K36 lysine methyltransferase (KMT; for example, yeast Set2) is directly associated with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation, and the mark is enriched along actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kizer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morris et al., 2005</xref>). As a result, H3K36me is commonly cited as an indicator of ‘active’ chromatin and is thought to exist in an antagonistic relationship with heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaydos et al., 2012</xref>). Cohabitation of H3K36me3 with either H3K27me2/3 or H3K9me2/3 on the same histone tail is rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jamieson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Young et al., 2009</xref>), and deposition of one mark can inhibit deposition of the second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmitges et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yuan et al., 2011</xref>). Paradoxically, studies of H3K36me have shown that this modification can recruit chromatin remodelers and modifiers that organize and deacetylate nucleosomes, stabilize histones by inhibiting exchange, and restrict access to DNA – effectively conferring features of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fazzio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smolle et al., 2012</xref>). In metazoans, these seemingly dissonant functions are resolved by a division of labor within the H3K36me pathway that: 1) links conversion of H3K36me2 to –me3 with transcription elongation by physically tethering the Set2-ortholog to RNAPII, and 2) employs specialized RNAPII-independent KMTs to catalyze H3K36me1/2. The consequence is a complex and poorly understood regulatory network controlling access to and modification of the H3K36 substrate. Though much has been learned about H3K36me3 as a signal, there is little mechanistic understanding of how the RNAPII-independent KMTs are targeted and how their products function.</p><p>The complexity and significance of the H3K36me regulatory pathway is illustrated both in the range of fundamental genomic processes it underlies (e.g. transcription initiation and repression, alternative splicing, and DNA replication, recombination and repair) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagner and Carpenter, 2012</xref>), and the frequency with which it is disturbed during oncogenesis. The direct or indirect disruption of H3K36me by mutation of histone H3 genes defines distinct subtypes of pediatric chondroblastoma (H3.3K36M) and glioblastoma (H3.3G34R/V) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwartzentruber et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, recurrent mutation or overexpression of genes that methylate (Ash1L, Nsd1/2/3, and Setd2) or demethylate (Kdm2b and Kdm4a) H3K36 have been implicated as drivers of malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Black et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaju et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kovac et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2015</xref>). The prevalence of aberrant H3K36me regulation in cancer underscores the value of identifying therapeutic options for targeting this pathway. Unfortunately, the complexity and essential nature of the H3K36me pathway in higher organisms has restricted lines of inquiry and has left fundamental aspects of its function largely unexplored. Instead, much of the functional characterization of H3K36me has been performed in the yeasts <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>, where H3K36me is nonessential and performed by a single RNAPII-associated KMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strahl et al., 2002</xref>). The simplicity of the H3K36me pathway in yeasts has proven valuable but has limited our understanding of the situation in eukaryotes that possess RNAPII-independent H3K36 KMTs, including filamentous fungi, plants, and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janevska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We present the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> as an experimental bridge between yeasts and higher organisms, and use it to address unresolved questions concerning H3K36me. As in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>, H3K36me is not essential in <italic>N. crassa</italic> but unlike the case in the yeasts, we found that H3K36 methylation results from a division of labor between the RNAPII-associated SET-2 enzyme which can catalyze mono-, di-, and tri-methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhvaryu et al., 2005</xref>) and ASH1 (NCU01932). Notably, like higher organisms, Neurospora possesses both facultative heterochromatin – characterized by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-catalyzed H3K27me2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>) – and constitutive heterochromatin – characterized by H3K9me3, HP1, DNA methylation and HDAC recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freitag et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tamaru and Selker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tamaru et al., 2003</xref>). Both of these forms of heterochromatin are nonessential in Neurospora, facilitating studies of their interplay in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jamieson et al., 2016</xref>). The study presented here reveals a novel function for ASH1 and elucidates relationships between H3K36me, RNAPII, and facultative heterochromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ASH1 and SET-2 differentiate poorly- and robustly-transcribed genes</title><p>Our examination of the H3K36me pathway in Neurospora began with analyses of <italic>set-2</italic> and <italic>ash1</italic> mutant strains. In preliminary work, we found that, unlike <italic>set-2</italic>, which is dispensable for viability, <italic>ash1</italic> appears to be essential, as evidenced by the inability to generate a pure Δ<italic>ash1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colot et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, we found that we could build an <italic>ash1</italic> strain that should be catalytically inactive by mutation of Y888, which is required for coordinating the target lysine in SET protein superfamily members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dillon et al., 2005</xref>). Strains harboring the <italic>ash1</italic>(Y888F) mutation displayed severely compromised growth but only minor reductions in global H3K36me2 and –me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D,E</xref>). Δ<italic>set-2</italic> strains showed a dramatic loss of H3K36me2 but only minor impairment of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D,E</xref>). We found that deletion of the ‘Set2 Rpb1 Interacting’ (SRI) domain of SET-2, which should decouple the enzyme from RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Youdell et al., 2008</xref>), resulted in a loss of H3K36me3 comparable to that seen with a <italic>set-2</italic> deletion, suggesting that RNAPII-associated SET-2 is responsible for nearly all H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Weak H3K36me3 signals remain in each of these backgrounds, raising the possibility that ASH1 is responsible for some H3K36me3. Consistent with this possibility, <italic>set-2; ash1</italic>(Y888F) double mutants showed additive loss of the H3K36me2 observed in the single mutants and loss of the residual H3K36me3 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F,G</xref>).

Our observation that the catalytic activity of ASH1 is not essential provided an opportunity to analyze separately the H3K36me2 and –me3 catalyzed by ASH1 and SET-2 by ChIP-seq in <italic>set-2</italic> knockout and <italic>ash1</italic>(Y888F) strains, respectively. Overall, we found that H3K36me2 and –me3 is associated with gene-rich DNA and excluded from constitutive heterochromatin, which is marked by DNA methylation and H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). H3K36me2 catalyzed by ASH1 or SET-2 was found in distinct domains that apparently together produce the overall pattern of wildtype (WT) H3K36me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). We found ASH1-catalyzed H3K36me2 was prominent across the promoter and body of the genes that are silent or poorly transcribed in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Conversely, SET-2-catalyzed H3K36me2 was found associated predominantly with moderately- and highly-transcribed genes and was depleted from transcriptional start-sites (TSS) but enriched over gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). By this assay, SET-2 was found to mark most (&gt;80%) genes, while ASH1 marked the minority (~20%) of genes that lacked SET-2-catalyzed H3K36me2 (p-value&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In the <italic>ash1</italic> mutant, H3K36me3 was found restricted to sites of SET-2-catalyzed H3K36me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and the intergenic H3K36me3 seen in WT was absent. Similarly, H3K36me3 at domains of ASH1-catalyzed H3K36me2 was lost in the <italic>ash1</italic> mutant. Consistent with the results of the western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), H3K36me3 was not entirely lost when <italic>set-2</italic> was deleted, and signal remained at regions with intense ASH1-catalyzed H3K36me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41497.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ASH1 and SET-2 specificities segregate the genome into compartments of poorly and robustly transcribed genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative IGV tracks of H3K36me2 ChIP-seq in WT, Δ<italic>set-2</italic>, and <italic>ash1</italic>(Y888F) backgrounds.

Altogether, these analyses show that a fraction of ASH1-marked chromatin is asymmetrically modified by PRC2 to generate overlapping profiles of H3K27me and H3K36me at genes that are most refractory to derepression, and that H3K27me-competency is a distinguishing characteristic of ASH1-marked chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ASH1 activity influences H3K27me2/3 accumulation</title><p>Drosophila Ash1 has previously been reported to inhibit PRC2-mediated repression by preventing H3K27me2/3 accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Papp and Müller, 2006</xref>).

Study of the functional relationships between Set2-orthologs and the mono/di-KMTs has been limited, in part because numerous dedicated H3K36 mono/di-KMTs are found in higher organisms (e.g. seven in mammals) and these enzymes – as well as the Set2-ortholog – are typically essential, making determination of their independent actions difficult or impossible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagner and Carpenter, 2012</xref>). To address unresolved questions regarding the functional relationship between H3K36 KMTs, we took advantage of the simplified H3K36me pathway of <italic>N. crassa</italic>, which we showed consists of two H3K36 KMTs, SET-2 and ASH1. Unlike SET-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhvaryu et al., 2005</xref>), ASH1 appears to be essential for viability but we found that the organism tolerates a catalytic null mutation of <italic>ash1</italic>, allowing us to assess the relative contribution of the two KMTs. By dissecting the roles of these enzymes, we uncovered a previously undescribed pathway that connects ASH1-catalyzed H3K36me to repression of poorly transcribed genes. Curiously, we found that much of ASH1-marked chromatin is characterized by H3K27me2/3-competency. Not only did native domains of H3K27me overlap with domains of ASH1-catalyzed H3K36me, but experimentally-induced domains of H3K27me2/3 selectively spread to ASH1-marked chromatin.</p><p>RNAPII-associated SET-2 is generally considered to be the only KMT capable of catalyzing H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhvaryu et al., 2005</xref>), and based upon biochemical studies with Drosophila and human orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yuan et al., 2011</xref>) we expected ASH1 to act as a dedicated H3K36 mono/di-KMT. Conservation of a tyrosine residue at the ‘F/Y-switch’ of its SET domain (Figure S1A) supported this expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2005</xref>). Results of western blotting suggested, however, that ASH1 is responsible for ~5% of global H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) in the absence of SET-2, and the ASH1 homologs of <italic>Fusarium fugikuroi</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> have also been reported to have H3K36me3 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janevska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>). Although we detected ASH1-catalyzed H3K36me3 in vivo with different, independently validated, antibodies and techniques, it remains possible these antibodies recognized residual H3K36me2 or that ASH1 can convert H3K36me2 to –me3 but only in the absence of SET-2.</p><p>Neurospora SET-2 catalyzes H3K36me2/3 across the bodies of active genes, much as in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krogan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2003</xref>), whereas ASH1 is responsible H3K36me2/3 across large domains that encompass multiple genes and intergenic regions. Interestingly, genes marked by ASH1 are silent or poorly transcribed and are largely reliant upon the mark for their repressed state. Genes that were derepressed by inactivation of ASH1 were mostly ‘SET-2-comarked,’ that is, they only lost H3K36me in the absence of both KMTs. It will be interesting to learn how ASH1 is directed to where it acts, that is, in domains of lowly transcribed genes. Neurospora ASH1 does not display telling conserved protein domains, but does have an AT-hook that might interact with the minor-groove of A/T-rich DNA. Constitutive heterochromatin in Neurospora is characterized by A/T-rich DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cambareri et al., 1989</xref>), but we found no indication that ASH1 functions at constitutive heterochromatin; in fact, H3K36me appears to be normally excluded from such regions.</p><p>Our finding that ASH1 has a function in repression is not entirely surprising given prior evidence of H3K36me3 in recruiting repressive chromatin machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fazzio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keogh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strahl et al., 2002</xref>) but it was striking to see the extent of its repressive influence. When compared to PRC2-catalyzed H3K27me2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>), ASH1-catalyzed H3K36me appears to be the predominant repressive modification of poorly transcribed genes (H3K27me covers only ~30% of silent, ASH1-marked, genes). Given the collaborative relationship between H3K36 KMTs, chromatin remodelers, and histone deacetylases (HDACs) described in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), we predict a role for nucleosome positioning and histone deacetylation in ASH1-mediated repression. Here, we observed an accumulation of H3K27ac following loss of ASH1-dependent H3K27me2/3, but it is unclear if this is a passive product of H3K27me2/3 loss or if there is an active role for H3K27me2/3 in exclusion.</p><p>Future studies should examine the Neurospora counterpart of the yeast HDAC complex, RPD3 Small (RPD3S), which includes the H3K36me3 reader, EAF-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joshi and Struhl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keogh et al., 2005</xref>). RPD3S activity appears to be dependent upon proper nucleosome spacing established by Isw2 and Chd1, which together apparently organize and stabilize nucleosomes to restrict internal initiation by RNAPII in the wake of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fazzio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smolle et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, this mechanism is dependent upon transcription, as H3K36me3 deposition by SET-2 is strictly tied to elongating RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Youdell et al., 2008</xref>). Our results support a related transcription-independent mechanism that maintains gene repression at facultative heterochromatin. ASH1 would establish the H3K36me mark required to recruit RPD3S, while chromatin remodelers would establish proper nucleosome positions to facilitate RPD3S deacetylase activity. To test this hypothesis, further study of the RPD3S HDAC will be required, but it will be challenging as the <italic>N. crassa</italic> ortholog of Rpd3 (HDA-3) is essential, and other units of the complex – EAF-3, SIN3, and NPF – are components of various other chromatin modifying complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sathianathan et al., 2016</xref>).

Neurospora H3K27me2/3 is catalyzed by a PRC2 complex that is highly similar to those found in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>) but <italic>N. crassa</italic> has no apparent PRC1 components. Even in higher organisms, the mechanism of repression mediated by PRC2 and H3K27me2/3 is far from clear, necessitating additional studies. Interestingly, we observed in Neurospora that loss of ASH1-dependent H3K36 methylation was associated with both losses and gains of H3K27me2/3. Early work with Drosophila gave evidence that ASH1 opposes the action of PRC2 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klymenko and Müller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shearn, 1989</xref>), consistent with the observation that the presence of H3K36me on a histone tail can inhibit PRC2 activity in cis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yuan et al., 2011</xref>), but our findings suggest the situation is more complicated. We found new domains of H3K27me2/3 at ASH1-regulated regions when ASH1 was inactivated, suggesting the presence of the ASH1 mark prevents H3K27me2/3. In addition, we found that ASH1 drives repression, and derepression associated with ASH1 inactivation is frequently accompanied by H3K27me2/3 loss. These seemingly opposing activities may reflect differential histone modifications and accompanying effector proteins found at those regions. Or perhaps, similar to plants, different forms of PRC2 may exist that respond differently to the presence of H3K36me (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmitges et al., 2011</xref>). These possibilities will be interesting to investigate in the future. Finally, it is important to note that though it was initially surprising to find genome-wide colocalization of H3K27me2/3 with ASH1-catalyzed H3K36me2, this does not appear to be unique to Neurospora and other fungi, as recent work with embryonic stem cells revealed apparent cross-talk of these marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Streubel et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our work supports a model in which the genes of <italic>N. crassa</italic> are separated into two compartments depending upon their source of H3K36me (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Actively transcribed genes possess SET-2-catalyzed H3K36me2/3 specific to the gene body, while silent and infrequently transcribed genes are covered in large domains of ASH1-catalyzed H3K36me2/3. In both cases, H3K36me appears to act as a repressive mark, protecting active genes against internal cryptic-transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2007b</xref>) and blocking general transcription at inactive genes. The repressed state of ASH1-modified chromatin is largely contingent upon the presence of ASH1-catalyzed H3K36me, but can be further modified with H3K27me2/3 catalyzed by the PRC2 complex to support repression.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41497.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for H3K36me deposition in <italic>Neurospora crassa.</italic></title><p>Neurospora genes can be divided into two groups depending upon their source of H3K36me. SET-2 marks the gene body of actively transcribed genes, and conversion to the trimethylated state is tied to transcription. ASH1 establishes large domains of H3K36me that covers silent genes and flanking regions. ASH1 predominantly deposits H3K36me2, but also appears to have the capacity to produce H3K36me3; the significance of di- versus tri-methylation remains unclear. In both cases, H3K36me appears to have a repressive function, protecting active genes from cryptic transcription and maintaining general repression of inactive genes. Genes marked by ASH1 can be co-modified by PRC2 with H3K27me2/3. Genes marked by both ASH1 and PRC2 appear ‘locked’ in a dormant state (i.e., they are less likely to be activated in the absence of ASH1).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-41497-fig6-v1"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>N. crassa</italic>)</td><td><italic>WT</italic></td><td>FGSC#6103</td><td>N623</td><td><italic>mat A;

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jerry Workman as Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Bicocca et al. investigates the role of H3K36 methylation and its interplay with H3K27 methylation in <italic>Neurospora</italic>. The study starts out by providing evidence that in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, the bulk of H3K36me3 and substantial amounts of H3K36me2 are generated by SET-2 and that ASH1 is a second HMTase that is making a major contribution to generating the bulk of H3K36me2. The authors go on to show that SET-2 and ASH1 contribute to the genome-wide H3K36me2 and -me3 profiles in a locus-specific manner. RNAseq analyses unexpectedly reveal that among the genes that are misregulated in <italic>ash1</italic> mutants, a substantially larger fraction of genes is upregulated compared to down-regulated genes. It appears that ASH1 is required for repression of poorly transcribed genes. The authors show that about 30% of the genes that are marked with H3K36me2 by ASH1 are also decorated with H3K27me2/3 generated by PRC2. Surprisingly, about 30% of the genes that are co-marked with H3K36me2 and H3K27me2/3 show strong reduction or complete loss of H3K27me2/3, gain of H3K27ac and up-regulated expression of RNA. Nevertheless, the authors also find regions where the loss of H3K36me2 in <italic>ash1</italic> mutants is accompanied by a marked gain of H3K27me2/3 (Figure 5F), consistent with the 'conventional' view that H3K36me2/3 directly antagonizes H3K27 methylation by PRC2. The authors conclude that ASH1 catalyzed H3K36me2 can affect H3K27me2/3 accumulation both in a positive and in a negative manner.</p><p>This study is interesting. At some genomic regions, H3K36me2/3 deposited by ASH1 antagonizes H3K27 methylation by PRC2, consistent with previous findings made in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Papp and Müller, 2006; Srinivasan et al., 2008; Dorighi et al., 2013), in worms (Gaydos et al., 2012) and in experiments that used purified PRC2 for HMTase reactions on nucleosomes in vitro (Schmitges et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 2011). On the other hand, the authors also present data that stand in direct contrast to this regulatory relationship. Specifically, the ChIP analyses suggest that ASH1-mediated H3K36me2 deposition can – somehow – act in a positive way to promote H3K27 methylation by PRC2. The authors discuss these findings that are not so simple to reconcile in a balanced way. Perhaps, their discussion could also touch on a two main issues mentioned in point 4 below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Looking at WB in Figure 1E, it seems that there is still a very faint H3K36me3 WB signal in lane 7 and that this signal is comparable to that seen in lanes 3 and 4 of the same blot. So, from this, it does not look like ASH1 would contribute to generating H3K36me3, whereas in lane 4 (<italic>set-2 ash1</italic> double mutant) in Figure 1F it indeed appears that there is a further reduction of H3K36me3 signal compared to lane 3 (<italic>set-2</italic> single mutant). The authors should clarify this point because, as the authors point out in the Introduction, there is no evidence that HMTases of the ASH1/NSD class are at all capable to tri-methylate H3K36. Since the effects are subtle, it would have been useful to show a more quantitative analysis of bulk modification levels, by performing western blots on serial dilutions (e.g. 4:2:1) of the extracts, rather than just one amount of extract per genotype. If the authors have more quantitative WB data, we encourage them to add them to the manuscript.</p><p>2) Figure 2. First, how were the ChIP-seq reads from wt, <italic>ash1</italic> and <italic>set-2</italic> mutants normalized to take into account the changes in bulk H3K36me2 and -me3 levels? Second, have the authors generated H3K36me2 and -me3 profiles in <italic>set-2 ash1</italic> double mutant cells?</p><p>3) For the RNA-seq analysis, it would be good to have more quantitative information on the extent of up- and down-regulation. In particular, how many genes are more than 2-fold up- or down-regulated and how many genes are more than 4-fold up- or down-regulated?</p><p>4) These are two points that the authors may want to discuss.</p><p>First, what is the function of H3K27me2/3 in <italic>Neurospora</italic>? Does <italic>Neurospora</italic> contain a chromodomain-containing protein in a PRC1-type complex (i.e. like Pc/CBX2 in PRC1 in animals)?</p><p>The second point that might be interesting to discuss is that unlike in flies and mammals, in plants, not all forms of PRC2 are inhibited by active marks (Schmitges et al., 2011). Specifically, PRC2 complexes containing the Su(z)12 ortholog EMF2 are inhibited by H3K4me3 but PRC2 containing the Su(z)12 ortholog VRN2 are not inhibited by this mark (Schmitges et al., 2011). So, it remains to be tested whether the HMTase activity of <italic>Neurospora</italic> PRC2 is at all inhibited on H3K36me2/3 nucleosomes in vitro.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41497.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Looking at WB in Figure 1E, it seems that there is still a very faint H3K36me3 WB signal in lane 7 and that this signal is comparable to that seen in lanes 3 and 4 of the same blot.

The contribution of ASH1 is more obvious in Figure 1F (perhaps helped by the lanes being directly adjacent) than in Figure 1E, but we believe the conclusions drawn from both blots are consistent. In each case, the signal remaining after <italic>set-2</italic> deletion is very faint, suggesting SET-2 is responsible for nearly all of H3K36me3. Though faint, the intensity of this remaining signal is reduced when combined with the <italic>ash1</italic> mutant. The phenotype is robust in its reproducibility, but there is slight variation in the apparent contribution of ASH1. We felt these blots were representative of the phenotype, but took the recommendation of performing serial dilution blots to further demonstrate the phenotype. The new data, now shown as Figure 1F, reinforce our conclusion.</p><p>Regarding evidence of H3K36me3 activity from ASH1/NSD orthologs, we note in the Introduction that no in vitro analysis of ASH1 orthologs has demonstrated H3K36me3 activity. However, as we note in the Discussion section, there is in vivo evidence for it. Janebska et al. (2017) and Jiang et al. (2013) describe H3K36me3 activity from ASH1-orthologs in <italic>Fusarium fujikuroi</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. In addition, <italic>C. elegans mes-4</italic> (an ortholog of NSD1) has been reported to have H3K36me3 activity (Furuhashi et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2. First, how were the ChIP-seq reads from wt, ash1 and set-2 mutants normalized to take into account the changes in bulk H3K36me2 and -me3 levels? Second, have the authors generated H3K36me2 and -me3 profiles in set-2 ash1 double mutant cells?</p></disp-quote><p>ChIP-seq tracks are shown with as little manipulation as possible; they are simply normalized to reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) and averaged over 25bp bins. We do not think the ChIP-seq tracks should be used to interpret the relative intensity of H3K36me catalyzed by SET-2 versus ASH1 and tried not to make claims to suggest they could. Largely, we think each mutant should be considered independently to draw more qualitative conclusions about where the mark is being found. However, the data do provide an opportunity to compare the relative contribution of SET-2 and ASH1 to the profile observed in WT. Consider the 50kb region we highlight in Figure 2A and 2C, where we see that SET-2 contributes little or no H3K36me2 signal, but in the WT track we still observe a H3K36me2 signal that is comparable in intensity to adjacent regions. This suggests ASH1 is both responsible for nearly all the H3K36me2 signal found at this location and the intensity of the ASH1 signal is comparable to that catalyzed by SET-2 in the neighboring region.</p><p>We were able to build a <italic>set-2/ash1</italic> double mutant. As one might expect, ChIP of H3K36me from the <italic>set-2/ash1</italic> double mutant yielded very little DNA (less than what we typically need to generate libraries) and the ChIP-seq tracks we interpreted as non-specific. The <italic>set-2/ ash1</italic> double mutant was more valuable as a control in ChIP qRT-PRC experiments, which avoid some of the normalization concerns of ChIP-seq experiments. We have therefore added qRT-PCR results to Figure 2—figure supplement 1 to better demonstrate the relative signal contribution from ASH1 and SET-2, and to show that the signal attributed to either ASH1 and SET-2 is eliminated in the double mutant.</p><p>H3K36me3 ChIP results are shown for WT, Δ<italic>set-2</italic>, and Δ<italic>set-2; ASH1</italic>(Y888F) strains at three genomic regions with distinct H3K36me profiles. 8:G3 is a constitutive heterochromatin region that lacks H3K36me and is used to assess “background” in the ChIP. <italic>hH4</italic> is an actively expressed gene that is marked by SET-2-catalyzed H3K36me but not ASH1-catalyzed H3K36me. <italic>NCU07152</italic> in a silent uncharacterized gene that is densely marked by ASH1-catalyzed H3K36me and H3K27me2/3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For the RNA-seq analysis, it would be good to have more quantitative information on the extent of up- and down-regulation. In particular, how many genes are more than 2-fold up- or down-regulated and how many genes are more than 4-fold up- or down-regulated?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have included a more quantitative analysis of our RNA-seq data in a table included as Figure 5—figure supplement 2. Δ<italic>set-7</italic> data were taken from Klocko et al. (2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) These are two points that the authors may want to discuss.</p><p>First, what is the function of H3K27me2/3 in Neurospora? Does Neurospora contain a chromodomain-containing protein in a PRC1-type complex (i.e. like Pc/CBX2 in PRC1 in animals)?</p></disp-quote><p>Although it is clear that PRC2 is repressive in <italic>Neurospora</italic> (numerous genes are derepressed when complex components are eliminated genetically), the mechanism remains unknown. We revised the Discussion section to provide additional background and context for H3K27me2/3 in <italic>Neurospora</italic> and we have specifically addressed conservation (or lack thereof) of the PRC2 and PRC1 complexes. Briefly, as in some other organisms, no obvious homologs of the PRC1 components are apparent in the <italic>Neurospora</italic> genome. However, it is clear that the presence of H3K27me2/3 is associated with repression (Wiles and Selker, 2016). Ongoing work is directed at discovering the mechanism behind H3K27me2/3-associated repression in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, and the mechanism of repression by H3K27me2/3 is not completely clear even in organisms sporting obvious PRC1 homologs. Moreover, recent work has called into question seeming established models for the role of PRC1 in repression (King et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second point that might be interesting to discuss is that unlike in flies and mammals, in plants, not all forms of PRC2 are inhibited by active marks (Schmitges et al., 2011). Specifically, PRC2 complexes containing the Su(z)12 ortholog EMF2 are inhibited by H3K4me3 but PRC2 containing the Su(z)12 ortholog VRN2 are not inhibited by this mark (Schmitges et al., 2011). So it remains to be tested whether the HMTase activity of Neurospora PRC2 is at all inhibited on H3K36me2/3 nucleosomes in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>Schmitges et al. (2011) is an interesting paper and may be relevant to the observations we report. Although not known in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, PRC2 complexes that consist of different components could potentially explain why only certain H3K27me2/3 genes are derepressed when ASH1 is inactivated. Of possible relevance, earlier work from our lab showed partial loss of H3K27me2/3 associated with deletion of the gene encoding <italic>Neurospora</italic> p55 (NPF; Jamieson et al., 2013), which is thought to be a component of <italic>Neurospora</italic> PRC2. The mutant specifically loses H3K27me2/3 at telomere-proximal regions. This is in stark contrast to the ASH1 mutant, which retains telomere-proximal regions. In fact, when we categorize H3K27me2/3-marked genes into NPF-dependent and ASH1-dependent we see they each influence a similar number of genes (about 30% of all H3K27me2/3-marked genes). If NPF and ASH1 were randomly regulating H3K27me2/3 genes we would expect 30% of these genes would be regulated by both NPF and ASH1; however, we see only 17% overlap, suggesting they are actively regulating separate compartments of H3K27me2/3-marked genes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
