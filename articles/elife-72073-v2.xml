transformation of endometrial stromal cells during the menstrual cycle. However, the potential molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the initiation and maintenance of decidualization in humans is yet to be fully elucidated. In this investigation, we document that SOX4 is a key regulator of human endometrial stromal cells decidualization by directly regulating FOXO1 expression as revealed by whole genomic binding of SOX4 assay and RNA sequencing. Besides, our immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry results unravel that SOX4 modulates progesterone receptor (PGR) stability through repressing E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC4-mediated degradation. More importantly, we provide evidence that dysregulated SOX4–HERC4–PGR axis is a potential cause of defective decidualization and recurrent implantation failure in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) patients. In summary, this study evidences that SOX4 is a new and critical regulator for human endometrial decidualization, and provides insightful information for the pathology of decidualization-related infertility and will pave the way for pregnancy improvement.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SOX4</kwd><kwd>decidualization</kwd><kwd>PGR protein

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adequate crosstalk between implantation-competent embryo and receptive endometrium is prerequisite for successful pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cha et al., 2012</xref>). The receptive endometrium in human requires remodeling of stromal cells under the regulation of rising progesterone and intracellular cyclic AMP to initiate the decidualization, which will undergo more extensive transformation after embryo implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>). The human endometrial stromal compartment can decidualize during the progesterone-dominant early secretory phase of a nonconception cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). During the pregnancy, the decidual process is poised to transit through distinct phenotypic phases that underpin endometrial receptivity, embryo selection, and ultimately resolution of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>). The decidual reaction plays a central role in the establishment of a pregnancy and continues throughout the pregnancy. Insufficient decidualization in endometrium is related to failed embryo implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peter Durairaj et al., 2017</xref>), unexplained infertility, recurrent spontaneous abortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coulam, 2016</xref>), intrauterine growth retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lefèvre et al., 2011</xref>), and preeclampsia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garrido-Gomez et al., 2017</xref>). However, the underlying molecular mechanism governing the endometrial decidualization remains enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Okada et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A wide range of transcription factors crucial for stromal cell decidualization have been successively identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>). FOXO1, a member of FOXO fork-head transcription factors subfamily, is one of the earliest identified transcriptional factors in human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) responding to decidualization stimulation (progesterone and cAMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Labied et al., 2006</xref>). Accumulative evidence has demonstrated that FOXO1 regulates transcription of PRL and IGFBP1 through direct binding to their promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Christian et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). Progesterone receptor (PGR), which is a critical master factors for the endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) decidualization, imparts endometrium receptivity through binding with P4 ligand and its nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Keller et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mulac-Jericevic et al., 2000</xref>). An array of PGR direct target genes had been unraveled by PGR ChIP-Seq in both human and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rubel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mazur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chi et al., 2020</xref>). Abnormal PGR expression is closely relevant with unexplained infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Keller et al., 1979</xref>) and endometriosis (EMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pei et al., 2018</xref>). Although many transcription factors and downstream events in decidualization of both mice and human have been unraveled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeMayo and Lydon, 2020</xref>), the precise mechanism orchestrating transcriptional regulatory network underpinning endometrial decidualization remained not fully explored.</p><p>SOX4 is a highly conserved transcription factor belonging to the SOX (SRY-box) family. Studies have shown that SOX4 is vital to a variety of biological processes, including embryogenesis, neural development, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moreno, 2020</xref>). Further, it has been noticed that SOX4 knockout mice die of cardiac malformation on the 14th day of pregnancy, suggesting the key role of SOX4 in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ya et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, an increasing number of reports indicate that SOX4 is related to tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and epithelial–mesenchymal transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Report also shows that SOX4 is highly expressed in breast cancer under the regulation of progesterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graham et al., 1999</xref>). Additionally, SOX17, another member of the SOX family, has also been observed to be a direct target of PGR in epithelium regulating IHH expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). While the significance and regulation of SOX4 in female pregnancy remain intangible.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that SOX4, under the regulation of P4-PGR, guides human endometrium stromal cells (HESCs) decidualization by regulating FOXO1 expression as revealed by ChIP-Seq and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Mechanism studies also unravel the importance of SOX4 in maintaining the protein stability of PGR by repressing ubiquitin E3 ligase HERC4. Moreover, both SOX4 and PGR have been demonstrated to be aberrantly downregulated in the endometrium of EMS patients suffering from implantation failure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SOX4 is dynamically expressed in human endometrial stromal cells regulated by P4-PGR signaling</title><p>To investigate the expression of transcription factors in HESCs, RNA-Seq was performed in normal endometrium stromal cells. We noted that among the transcription factors expressed in endometrium stromal cells, SOX4 was the 17th highest expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and as the most abundant member in SOX family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Meanwhile, previous RNA-Seq data in isolated mouse stromal and epithelial cells revealed that SOX4 expression was the most abundant SOX family in stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), while the expression of SOX17 was restricted to the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we speculated that the conserved expression of SOX4 in stroma was linked to decidualization. To explore whether SOX4 was under the regulation of dynamic change of estrogen and progesterone during the menstrual cycle, we first analyzed the expression of SOX4 in endometrial biopsy samples obtained from healthy, reproductive-aged volunteers with regular menstrual cycles. Albeit SOX4 was detected at a low level in the E2-dominant proliferative phase, its expression was progressively increased in the nucleus of stromal cellsin P4-dominant early, middle, late secretory phases and this high expression in stroma cell sustained in the decidual cells in early pregnancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SOX4 is dynamically expressed in human ESCs.</title><p>Expression of all transcription factors (<bold>A</bold>) and SOX family genes (<bold>B</bold>) in human nondecidualized ESCs by RNA-Seq.

The coimmunoprecipitation result demonstrated a conserved physical interaction between endogenous HERC4 and PGR in decidualized stromal cells as well asexogenous expressed in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, E</xref>). Immunoﬂuorescence analysis showed the colocalization of HERC4 and PGR in decidualized HESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). To figure out whether HERC4 could induce endogenous ubiquitination of PGR, HERC4 was overexpressed in immortalized HESCs followed by decidualization for 2 days. The ubiquitination of PGR was higher in the presence of HERC4 than in control, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, consistent with a reduced level of PGR protein in immortalized HESCs cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Conversely, HERC4 abolished by siRNA significantly reduced PGR ubiquitination in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The above studies demonstrated that HERC4 was a critical E3 ligase for PGR ubiquitination. Moreover, overexpression of HERC4 recused the decreasing PGR ubiquitination in the presence of SOX4 in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Hence, SOX4 affected PGR ubiquitination through E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC4.</p><p>Since HERC4 was a ubiquitin ligase of PGR and the increased ubiquitination of PGR was observed in the presence of HERC4, we next interrogated whether HERC4-mediated PGR degradation. This posit was underpinned by decreased PGR protein level with HERC4 overexpression in both 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>) and immortalized HESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>).

Previous studies have demonstrated that the SOX family controls cell fate and differentiation in various developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">She and Yang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angelozzi and Lefebvre, 2019</xref>). A previous study has confirmed that epithelial SOX17, one of SOX transcription factors, is indispensable for uterine receptivity and embryo implantation by regulating IHH expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). The embryo adhesion of implantation process occurred between the embryo and epithelia, and the proper differentiation of epithelia is required for this event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ye, 2020</xref>). Moreover, for the endometrial receptivity establishment, the stromal compartment also needs to differentiate in response to the endocrine hormone progesterone and estrogen that is known as decidualization, and the crosstalk between the stroma and epithelia has been widely approved to participate to the establishment of endometrial receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we uncover the critical role of SOX4 in stromal cell decidualization by RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq. Several previously unappreciated genes of SOX4 are unveiled through RNA-Seq. FOXO1 is indispensable in the process of decidualization account for the widely overlapping of binding peaks with PGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vasquez et al., 2015</xref>). In this investigation, FOXO1 is regulated by SOX4 at transcriptional level, indicating the essential role of SOX4 in decidualization. We are also very surprised to notice that the direct regulation of SOX4 on FOSL2, an important part of AP1 complex involving inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Renoux et al., 2020</xref>), expression directly. Moreover, we also find that FOSL2 and FRA2 motifs are significantly enriched in SOX4-binding sites, suggesting the complex interplay between these factors. The regulation of SOX4 on FOLS2 implicates an alternative role of SOX4 regulating decidualization, which deserves further investigation.</p><p>PGR is a master regulator of the decidualization process since decidualization is mainly influenced by the progesterone–PGR signaling. After dimerization and nuclear translocation, PGR protein interacts with the following proteins to synergistically direct the differentiation program: FOXO1, C/EBPβ, STAT3, STAT5, HOXA10, and HOXA11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>). An array of modulators regulates the functional plasticity of PGR, including subcellular distribution, protein modification, and interaction with coregulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we were intrigued by the finding that SOX4 affects PGR protein stability rather than its transcription.</p><p>During the menstrual cycle, estrogen–ER signaling induced endometrial PGR mRNA in the proliferative phase, recapitulating the regulation manner of PGR in mouse uteri (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McKinnon et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we provided evidence that PGR protein is further stabilized by increased SOX4 at post-transcriptional regulation in the later secretory phase. Previous studies have validated that SOX4 regulates P53 stability through E3 ligase Mdm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pan et al., 2009</xref>). In breast cancer cells, E3 ligase BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Calvo and Beato, 2011</xref>) and CUEDC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>) have been shown to regulate PGR protein stability. Multiple evidence in our research has verified that the E3 ligase HERC4 functions as a ubiquitin-modified enzyme for the PGR protein. Further exploration revealed that lysine residual in the PGR DNA-binding domain possess modified sites for ubiquitination. In the endometrial cells, there are very limited reports regarding PGR protein modification. Our previous study proved that Bmi1 facilitates the PGR ubiquitination through E3 ligase E6AP, which promotes PGR transcriptional activity instead of protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xin et al., 2018</xref>). Besides, SUMOlation of PGR has been reported to occur at the K388 site and fine-tunes the transcriptional activity of PGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jones et al., 2006</xref>). The Lys-388 is a key site not only for PGR-B SUMOlation, but also a key site for CUEDC2-mediated ubiquitination in proteasome in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we characterized that K588, K613, K617, and K638 were critical sites for E3 ligase HERC4, which mediated PGR ubiquitination and degradation. There were other E3 ligases interacting with PGR as revealed by our mass spectrum, whether these E3 ligases also mediated PGR ubiquitination remains largely unknown. Multiple specific E3 ligases may exist for PGR ubiquitination rely on individual lysine residues.</p><p>Here, we report a previously unrecognized PGR ubiquitination and degradation modified by the ubiquitin E3 ligase HERC4 regulated by SOX4 in endometrial stromal cells. There are several potential postulations concerning the underlying mechanism by which SOX4 inhibits HERC4 expression in stromal cells. SOX4 has been reported to interact with repressive histone modifiers, such as H3K27 trimethylation enzyme EZH2, to directly repress the target gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koumangoye et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, SOX4 indirectly represses the target gene expression through regulating EZH2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tiwari et al., 2013</xref>). Since no direct SOX4 binding on HERC4 is observed, the detailed mechanism by which SOX4 regulates HERC4 transcription in endometrial stroma cells requires further exploration.</p><p>Considering the critical role of progesterone during the pregnancy establishment and maintenances, both natural and synthetic progestogens have been widely used to improve endometrial function in women with a history of RIF and unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. However, some of these patients still suffered from RIF and recurrent miscarriages due to progesterone resistance. The causes of progesterone resistance may be related to defects in the PGR signaling and its molecular chaperones as well as decreasing PGR transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McKinnon et al., 2018</xref>). PGR functional deficiency is related to abnormal PGR mRNA levels, post-transcriptional modifications, post-translational modifications, and protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McKinnon et al., 2018</xref>). However, the specific causes of PGR defects are, at present, poorly explored and understood.</p><p>EMS is frequently accompanied by progesterone resistance and infertility. Several transcription factors, including the factors in GATA and HOX family can regulate the progesterone signaling, and the epigenetic differential methylation of PR-B, HOX, and GATA family transcription factor can lead to their decreased expression, leading to the disturbed progesterone signaling in the EMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Longo et al., 2020</xref>). It is interesting that lower SOX4 expression is strongly relevant with reduced PGR protein expression in endometrial stromal cells of EMS who experience RIF, and the level of PGR is restored to some extent when SOX4 is overexpressed in these stromal cells. It is conceivable that PGR defects caused by insufficient SOX4 may potentially result in implantation failures, even with high doses of progestogens supplementation during IVF. In our previous study using human endometrial samples from different patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion cohort, we also observed progesterone resistance as revealed by defective PGR signaling, with normal PGR protein level but diminished transcriptional PGR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xin et al., 2018</xref>). This implies that any disturbances in the transduction of P4-PGR signaling pathway will severely influence the endometrial cell responsiveness to progesterone and contribute to infertility.</p><p>Collectively, our investigation provides compelling evidence that SOX4 plays a key role in HESCs decidualization through the transcriptional regulation of critical factors related to decidualization. Meanwhile, SOX4 endows human stromal cells appropriate progesterone responsiveness by fine-tuning PGR protein stability. Aberrant SOX4 expression is strongly associated with decreased PGR and FOXO1 expression in the endometrium of women who have experienced RIF with EMS, implying the high clinic relevance of SOX4 in female fertility and pregnancy maintenance. A better understanding of the regulatory network of SOX4 will facilitate the development of therapeutic strategy for the clinical treatment of RIF in EMS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">T HESCs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-4003RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_C464">CVCL_C464</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-SOX4(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat #

The reader must delve into the Materials and methods to figure out how the experiment was conducted in terms of the approach. This issue can be rectified by providing more detail on the experimental approach for each major investigation and result.

This may deserve some discussions.</p><p>Other suggestions:</p><p>1. The &quot;Eichment&quot; in all the label in the ChIP-PCR data should be changed into &quot;Enrichment&quot;.</p><p>2. In the manuscript, the authors used &quot;human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs)&quot; while the hESCs is usually short for &quot;human Embryonic Stem Cells&quot;, I suggest to make a little change into &quot;human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs)&quot;, which may reduce potential confusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The scientific background should be more clear and straightforward, it would be interesting that the authors discuss it in the manuscript.</p><p>a. The connection between receptivity and decidualization is confused. Decidualization is a differentiation process that regulates mainly the stromal compartment regulating embryo invasion, the next step of embryo adhesion, which is mainly govern by endometrial receptivity affecting the epithelial compartment. So, why the authors linked these processes and what is the connection?</p><p>b. Intro (lines 59-61): The receptive endometrium in human requires remodeling of stromal cells under the regulation of rising progesterone and intracellular cyclic AMP, which will undergo more extensive transformation driven by factors secreted from embryos. Which reference support this affirmation?</p><p>c. In the introduction ´Insufficient decidualization in endometrium is related to failed embryo implantation, unexplained infertility, recurrent spontaneous abortion (Coulam 2016), intrauterine growth retardation (Lefevre, Palin et al., 2011), and preeclampsia (Garrido-Gomez, Dominguez et al., 2017). However, the underlying molecular mechanism governing the endometrial decidualization remains enigmatic (Okada, Tsuzuki et al., 2018)´. There is lack of references to relate insufficient decidualization with failed embryo implantation and insufficient decidualization with unexplained infertility in this paragraph. The fact is that deficient decidualization relates to defects in embryo invasion and subsequent placentation and pregnancy complications. But the authors are trying to connect receptivity with insufficient decidualization and infertility. This is unclear and the authors need to be more precise that the scientific background that is exposed in this manuscript.</p><p>d. Intro: &quot;both SOX4 and PGR have been demonstrated to be aberrantly downregulated in the endometrium of endometriosis (EMS) patients suffering from implantation failure&quot;. It is confused the focus of this study connecting role of SOX4 in decidualization with patients with implantation failure. If the authors want to relate SOX4 with implantation failure should demonstrate the connection with endometrial receptivity and embryo adhesion.</p><p>2. The clinical data included in this manuscript is very concise and need to be completed.</p><p>a. The authors described that some experiment was performed with normal samples, clinically what means ´normal´? The authors should define the clinical characteristics, the sample size and when the samples were collected.</p><p>b. Is the Table S2 (line 933) the equivalent to supplementary Table 1 (line 999)? please review it. This table include the clinical information about the patients analyzed in the last part of the article, but the authors should include another table including the clinical data of the patients that were recruited to collect the endometrial samples that are the source of primary hESCs used in the rest of paper. Also, this table include abbreviations that need to be defined and the history of previous pregnancies of controls to prove fertile status.</p><p>3. There are some general aspects that must be improved in the drafting of the results to improve the comprehensibility, much more details in some experiments are needed.</p><p>a. The nomenclature of cell types needs to be clearer, sometimes it is confusing to know whether you are using cell lines or primary endometrial stromal cells isolated from biopsies (e.g. In line 120 &quot;endometrial stromal cells&quot;), they are cell line or primary cells? it must be specified also in figure 1 legend, in line 129 &quot;in endometrial biopsy samples obtained from healthy reproductive-aged volunteers&quot; linked with Figure 1C, it would be better to specify which type of cells are you using in figure 1 because it seems that there are 2 type of cells. The authors explained results using immortalized cells and 293T cells, this are same cells? Please detail.</p><p>b. Another nomenclature issue to improve is the use of different terms for non-decidualized and decidualized cells &quot;undifferentiated and differentiated stromal cells&quot;; &quot;undecidualized and decidualized&quot;; &quot;non-decidualized and decidualized&quot;. The authors should use unified nomenclature.</p><p>c. Authors expose results analyzing decidualized and non-decidualized cells, but the figures do not show decidualized vs non-decidualized instead of this they shown D0 and D4. Why do they not use decidualized and non-decidualized cells at same time of treatment (D4)? This comparison let us to know what is happening with cells under hormonal treatment compared with cells growing at the same time without decidualization inductors. The author should explain how they performed the experiments and why they decided to make this experimental design.</p><p>d. I have missed the times at which some treatments are performed, such as the decidualization treatments in Figure 2 A and the silencing and overexpression treatments. It should be specified for how long the silencing and overexpression is performed as well as decidualization. Additionally, in some treatments you must specify the dose of the drug you are using.</p><p>e. Why did you performed an RNA-Seq only 2 days after decidualization when in all of you experiments you show that decidualization markers increase their value from day four (e.g. Figure 3 B and C)? This may be somewhat confusing; the authors should explain this decision.</p><p>4. Some experimental part of the manuscript could be improved it:</p><p>a. Western Blot in general you have to specify in which day you have performed it, in some cases it has not been mentioned (e.g. Figure 3A). Also, the authors need to well-defined the double band that found in the PGR protein experiment, as well as, to improve some GAPDH western blot where the bands are undistinguished between conditions (example figure 2D and Figure 3G). Furthermore, graphic including the band quantification and statistical analysis in each western blot could help supporting the findings.</p><p>b. Immunostaining should be more described along the manuscript explaining that are based in the analysis of endometrial tissue and to specify details such as day of sample collection.</p><p>5. The authors need to improve details on methodology.</p><p>a. RNAseq data need to be explain in detail. Figure 1A-B: &quot;(A) Expression of all transcription factors in human non-decidualized ESCs by RNA-Seq. (B) Expression of SOX family genes in human non-decidualized ESCs by RNA-Seq&quot; is based in the normal endometrium stromal cells analysis and figure legend define that are non-decidualized cells. Which cells are analysed in RNAseq analysis? Please, do not use the term normal to clinically define type of sample. Which experimental design was used? Sample size (N)? Raw and normalized counts? Filtered and quality control process? Which statistics were used? Please improve the results showed for RNAseq analysis.</p><p>b. Versions of software and bioinformatic tools need to be included.</p><p>c. New sections in M and M need to be included for RNA extraction and quality evaluation (specifying RIN threshold consider), gene ontology enrichment, and real-time PCR.</p><p>d. How batch effect was evaluated, and variables tested for controlling confounding effects.</p><p>e. What function was used in edgeR for identify differentially expressed genes (e.g. exactTest), p-value adjustment and threshold for consider a transcript significantly deregulated, the fold change obtained and if there was some threshold to select genes to be included in subsequent analysis.</p><p>f. Antibody concentrations used in immunoprecipitation and immunostaining must be included. Also, reagent concentrations for transfection including lipofectamine and times followed to procced such as medium change during transfection. We suggest creating a Key Resource Table with all the chemical compounds, kits, antibodies, plasmids, and software used with the references and concentrations with the aim of being more transparent and increasing the reproducibility of experiments.</p><p>6. Regarding the discussion there are some aspects to be commented:</p><p>a. Line 409: The paper of SOX4 in decidualization linked with implantation failure in endometriosis could be improved. In this sense I suggest a proposal about how the authors think about the mechanism underlying with these two biological processes.</p><p>b. PGR isoforms A and B have different roles during the menstrual cycle, being the isoform B the predominant in decidualization. Authors should recognize it is a limitation not included this differentiation in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72073.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some Essential Revisions that require your careful attention are listed below:</p><p>– Expand Materials and methods section to provide more experimental details.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the corresponding modification in the “Materials and methods” section in the revision as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Provide Rationale for Sox4 ChIP-seq using immortalized cells and provide details of timing for ChIP-seq studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted new ChIP-seq experiment using the primary endometrial stroma cells and got the similar results as in the immortalized cells (See revised Figure 4F) and the data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database.

So, why the authors linked these processes and what is the connection?</p></disp-quote><p>Different from the scenario in the rodent models in which the decidualization occurred after the embryo attachment, decidualization of the human endometrium does not require embryo adhesion. The human endometrial stromal compartment can initiate the decidualize during the progesterone-dominant early secretory phase of menstrual cycle. When the endometrium entered into the receptive state mainly dominating by the endocrine progesterone and estrogen, the stromal compartment has initiated the decidualization, which has also been demonstrated by the recent single cell RNA-Seq data (Single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human endometrium during the menstrual cycle. Nat Med. 2020 Oct;26(10):1644-1653. PMID: 32929266). The implantation window open, which accompanied with the receptive endometrium, accompanied with a widespread decidualization feature in the stromal fibroblasts, which was confirmed by our data about the decidualization marker IGFBP1 immunostaining (Figure 8I). Just as the reviewer stated, the embryo adhesion occurred between the blastocyst and the endometrial epithelium, but the proper differentiation of epithelium preparing for adhesion with the embryo is also regulated the stromal compartment, which have been demonstrated by mouse models. Only when the epithelium and stroma compartment properly differentiated under the influence of endocrine progesterone and estrogen, the endometrial receptivity can be established well, and the differentiation process for stromal compartment is the decidualization. In this study, we focus the decidualization, which means the stromal cell differentiation, directed by the progestogen signal for preparing the endometrial receptivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.

The nomenclature of cell types needs to be clearer, sometimes it is confusing to know whether you are using cell lines or primary endometrial stromal cells isolated from biopsies (e.g. In line 120 &quot;endometrial stromal cells&quot;), they are cell line or primary cells? it must be specified also in figure 1 legend, in line 129 &quot;in endometrial biopsy samples obtained from healthy reproductive-aged volunteers&quot; linked with Figure 1C, it would be better to specify which type of cells are you using in figure 1 because it seems that there are 2 type of cells. The authors explained results using immortalized cells and 293T cells, this are same cells? Please detail.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We have added the detailed information in the revised manuscript and figure legends. 293T cells was utilized in this section mainly due to lower transfection efficiency in immortalized stromal cells. Similar results in both cell types also corroborate the regulation of PR protein stability by the ubiquitin E3 ligase HERC4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Another nomenclature issue to improve is the use of different terms for non-decidualized and decidualized cells &quot;undifferentiated and differentiated stromal cells&quot;; &quot;undecidualized and decidualized&quot;; &quot;non-decidualized and decidualized&quot;. The authors should use unified nomenclature.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this concern to strength our manuscript and we have uniformly changed into the “undecidualized and decidualized&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Authors expose results analyzing decidualized and non-decidualized cells, but the figures do not show decidualized vs non-decidualized instead of this they shown D0 and D4. Why do they not use decidualized and non-decidualized cells at same time of treatment (D4)? This comparison let us to know what is happening with cells under hormonal treatment compared with cells growing at the same time without decidualization inductors. The author should explain how they performed the experiments and why they decided to make this experimental design.</p></disp-quote><p>The main purpose of this experiment is to determine the gene expression during the decidualization process, that is from the beginning of treatment (D0) throughout to D6. The similar approach has been used in the published paper (Recurrent pregnancy loss is associated with a pro-senescent decidual response during the peri-implantation window. Commun Biol. 2020 Jan 21;3(1):37. PMID: 31965050).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. I have missed the times at which some treatments are performed, such as the decidualization treatments in Figure 2 A and the silencing and overexpression treatments. It should be specified for how long the silencing and overexpression is performed as well as decidualization. Additionally, in some treatments you must specify the dose of the drug you are using.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this concern to make our description clearer. HESCs were cultured with differentiation medium for two days, since the expression of PR increased significantly on the second day of HESC differentiation. For the knockdown and overexpression experiment, the silencing and overexpression was first performed without differentiation stimulus, 24 hours later hESCs were decidualization for another 2 days. This information had been added in the revised manuscript (See line 546-549). The information including the doses of drug have been included in the Key resource table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. Why did you performed an RNA-Seq only 2 days after decidualization when in all of you experiments you show that decidualization markers increase their value from day four (e.g. Figure 3 B and C)? This may be somewhat confusing; the authors should explain this decision.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this concern. During the process of decidualization, SOX4 was significantly induced as early as 2 days after decidualization, and the expression of decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1 was obvious increased at the later time, such on D4 and D6. To explore the direct effect of SOX4 on the regulation for decidualization, the time when SOX4 was induced was chose for the RNA-Seq to minimize the secondary effects. The decidualization status as determined by the marker genes expression was on D4, when the marker gene expression increased to a high level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Some experimental part of the manuscript could be improved it:</p><p>a. Western Blot in general you have to specify in which day you have performed it, in some cases it has not been mentioned (e.g. Figure 3A). Also, the authors need to well-defined the double band that found in the PGR protein experiment, as well as, to improve some GAPDH western blot where the bands are undistinguished between conditions (example figure 2D and Figure 3G). Furthermore, graphic including the band quantification and statistical analysis in each western blot could help supporting the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this concern. We added the information about the timing in the revised figure legend. The double band in the WB data for PR indicate PRA and PRB respectively and we have added this information in the revised manuscript (See line 235). As suggested by the reviewer, we improved the bands of GAPDH by rerunning the WB and also provided the data for band quantification and statistical analysis (See revised Figure 2 and 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Immunostaining should be more described along the manuscript explaining that are based in the analysis of endometrial tissue and to specify details such as day of sample collection.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this concern. The detailed information for Immunostaining has been provided as reviewer suggested in the revised manuscript (See line 618-621).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors need to improve details on methodology.</p><p>a. RNAseq data need to be explain in detail. Figure 1A-B: &quot;(A) Expression of all transcription factors in human non-decidualized ESCs by RNA-Seq. (B) Expression of SOX family genes in human non-decidualized ESCs by RNA-Seq&quot; is based in the normal endometrium stromal cells analysis and figure legend define that are non-decidualized cells. Which cells are analysed in RNAseq analysis? Please, do not use the term normal to clinically define type of sample. Which experimental design was used? Sample size (N)? Raw and normalized counts? Filtered and quality control process? Which statistics were used? Please improve the results showed for RNAseq analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks very much for the reviewer’s suggestion. The term “normal” was changed to “non-decidualized ESCs” cell in the revised manuscript. RNA-Seq was perform in non-decidualized ESCs for Figure 1A-B. The average FPKM values (N = 3) of all transcription factors were used for these plots. Quality scores of reads above 30 was kept for alignment and only uniquely mapped reads were used for downstream quantification analysis by exact negative binomial test in edgeR package of R. The results of RNA-Seq of Figure 1A and 1B were improved per suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Versions of software and bioinformatic tools need to be included.</p></disp-quote><p>The softwares for RNA-Seq and ChIP-seq analysis including STAR (2.7.3a) for alignment, MACS2 (2.2.7.1) for peakcall of ChIP-seq, ggplot2 (3.3.5) for visualization, ngs.plot.r (2.61) for peak heatmap of ChIP-seq and the packages of edgeR (3.9), Complexheatmap (2.4.3), ChIPseeker (1.24.0) in R (4.1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. New sections in M and M need to be included for RNA extraction and quality evaluation (specifying RIN threshold consider), gene ontology enrichment, and real-time PCR.</p></disp-quote><p>The description about RNA extraction and quality evaluation, gene ontology enrichment, and real-time PCR had been modified or added as reviewer’s suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. How batch effect was evaluated, and variables tested for controlling confounding effects.</p></disp-quote><p>To reduce the batch effect, the libraries of all RNA samples were prepared at the same time. The pooled RNA libraries were sequenced in a same flow cell. After sequencing, the sequencing depth and principal component analysis of all samples were evaluated. After library size calculation, sample dispersion evaluation and normalization, gene expression was calculated as FPKM (Fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. What function was used in edgeR for identify differentially expressed genes (e.g. exactTest), p-value adjustment and threshold for consider a transcript significantly deregulated, the fold change obtained and if there was some threshold to select genes to be included in subsequent analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>The function of exactTest in edgeR was applied for p-value calculation. Fold changed above 2 or less than 0.5 and p-Value &lt; 0.05 were the significance threshold for consideration of differential expression. Only those differentially expressed genes (DEG) met the significance threshold were selected for downstream analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. Antibody concentrations used in immunoprecipitation and immunostaining must be included. Also, reagent concentrations for transfection including lipofectamine and times followed to procced such as medium change during transfection. We suggest creating a Key Resource Table with all the chemical compounds, kits, antibodies, plasmids, and software used with the references and concentrations with the aim of being more transparent and increasing the reproducibility of experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this concern. We have provided more tables for all the chemical compounds, kits, antibodies, and plasmids (See Key resources table and Supplementary file 3. The plasmids used in this study).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Regarding the discussion there are some aspects to be commented:</p><p>a. Line 409: The paper of SOX4 in decidualization linked with implantation failure in endometriosis could be improved. In this sense I suggest a proposal about how the authors think about the mechanism underlying with these two biological processes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks very much for this concern. We narrow down the statement about the connection between decidualization and implantation to prevent the disruption the focus of this investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. PGR isoforms A and B have different roles during the menstrual cycle, being the isoform B the predominant in decidualization. Authors should recognize it is a limitation not included this differentiation in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this concern. As suggested by the reviewer, both PRA and PRB were expressed in the stromal cells, and PRB played predominant role in decidualization, we also observe the expression of PRA and PRB were both influenced by the SOX4 and since the PRB was more critical for decidualization, the regulation of HERC4 on PR was mainly focused on PRB.</p></body></sub-article></article>
