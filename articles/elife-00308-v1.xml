Clearance of a stalled complex is required to recycle the ribosome for future use. Here we show that the ubiquitin (Ub) pathway segregase Cdc48/p97 and its adaptors Ufd1-Npl4 participate in ribosome-associated degradation (RAD) by mediating the clearance of ubiquitinated, tRNA-linked nascent peptides from ribosomes. Through characterization of both endogenously-generated and heterologous model substrates for the RAD pathway, we conclude that budding yeast Cdc48 functions downstream of the Ub ligases Ltn1 and Ubr1 to release nascent proteins from the ribosome so that they can be degraded by the proteasome. Defective RAD could contribute to the pathophysiology of human diseases caused by mutations in p97.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00308.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00308.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00308.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ribosomes are complex molecular machines that translate the sequence of bases in a messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript into a polypeptide that subsequently folds to form a protein. Each ribosome is composed of two major subunits: the small subunit reads the mRNA transcript, and the large subunit joins amino acids together to form the polypeptide. This process stops when the ribosome encounters a stop codon and releases the completed polypeptide.</p><p>It is critical that cells perform some form of quality control on the polypeptides as they are translated to prevent a build up of incomplete, incorrect or toxic proteins in cells. Problems can occur if a ribosome stalls while translating the mRNA transcript, or if the mRNA transcript is defective. For example, most mRNA transcripts contain a stop codon, but some do not, and these non-stop mRNA transcripts result in a non-stop polypeptide that remains tethered to the ribosome. It is important that the cell identifies and removes these faulty polypeptides so as to leave the ribosome free to translate other (non-faulty) mRNA transcripts. A regulatory protein called ubiquitin is responsible for marking and sending proteins that are faulty, or are no longer needed by the cell, to a molecular machine called the proteasome, where they are degraded by a process called proteolysis. In 2010 researchers identified Ltn1 as the enzyme that attaches ubiquitin to non-stop proteins in yeast.</p><p>Now, building on this work, Verma et al. identify additional proteins involved in this process. In particular, an ATPase enzyme called Cdc48 (known as p97 or VCP in human cells) and two co-factors—Ufd1 and Npl4—promote release of the ubiquitinated non-stop polypeptides from the ribosomes, thus committing the marked polypeptide to destruction by the proteasome. Verma et al. also show that the Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex is involved in other aspects of quality control of newly synthesized proteins within cells. Collectively these processes are known as ribosome-associated degradation.</p><p>Mutations of the gene that codes for human p97 can cause a number of diseases, including Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia, so an improved understanding of ribosome-associated degradation could provide new insights into these diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00308.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00308.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>Cdc48</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deshaies</surname><given-names>Raymond J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The enzyme that collaborates with ubiquitin ligases to promote the release of defective polypeptides from stalled ribosomes in a process named ribosome-associated degradations has been identified as the ATPase Cdc48.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maintaining protein homeostasis is key for the healthy lifespan of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koga et al., 2011</xref>) and cells have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to control the quality of newly synthesized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bukau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). Dysfunction of these quality control (QC) pathways can tip the balance towards the accumulation of toxic proteins and manifestation of disease, most notably neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dennissen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>There are multiple pools of QC substrates in cells. A relatively well-characterized substrate pool arises from misfolding of nascent chains that have been properly translated. Depending upon the relative rate at which malfolded sequences that comprise degrons form and bind their Ub ligase receptors vs the rate at which translation is completed, ubiquitination and degradation of misfolding proteins may initiate on the ribosome. It has been shown, for instance, that the acetylated N-terminus recognized by the Ub ligase Doa10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hwang et al., 2010</xref>) is generated co-translationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gautschi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Polevoda et al., 2008</xref>), and that the Ub ligase Ubr1 can initiate degradation of an N-end rule substrate prior to completion of its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Turner and Varshavsky, 2000</xref>).</p><p>A second pool of QC substrates arises from failure to complete translation successfully. This can occur because the mRNA is defective or the ribosome stalls due to either irresolvable structures in the mRNA or interactions between the nascent peptide and the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu and Deutsch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kramer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>). Defective mRNAs are recognized by a cytosolic mRNA surveillance machinery that mediates their destruction. There are at least three pathways: no-go decay (NGD) targets mRNAs with strong stalls in translation elongation leading to endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) targets messages containing premature termination codons (PTC), and non-stop decay (NSD) targets mRNAs that lack a stop codon. Within this broad scheme, there are many variations by which aberrant mRNAs are generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parker, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, recent data suggest an intimate coupling between QC of defective mRNAs and the nascent peptides they produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shoemaker and Green, 2012</xref>). For example, Upf1 is a positive effector of NMD that is also needed for proteasome-mediated degradation of the prematurely terminated products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takahashi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuroha et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Quality-control of mRNAs that lack a stop codon and the proteins produced from them has been the focus of considerable recent attention. Translation of these ‘non-stop’ mRNAs yields a ribosome-tethered polypeptide that is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito-Harashima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dimitrova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>). Notably, the mRNA may be processed by multiple pathways (e.g., NSD and NGD) because absence of a stop codon can cause translation to stall either because the end of the message is encountered or polylysine encoded by the poly(A) tail interacts with the negatively charged exit tunnel of the ribosome. Non-stop mRNAs can arise naturally through premature termination or polyadenylation within ORFs, which are estimated to occur for up to 10% of all transcriptional events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frischmeyer et al., 2002</xref>). Proteins encoded by these messages could potentially impose a considerable burden on QC pathways. Thus, disposal of proteins produced from non-stop messages is likely to be of general significance to understanding human diseases that result from defects in protein homeostasis.</p><p>Stalled ribosomes that trigger NGD/NSD are recognized by the Dom34–Hbs1 complex which is structurally related to the termination factors eRF1 and eRF3 but lacks the residues necessary for both stop codon recognition and hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA and instead binds to the empty A site in the stalled ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doma and Parker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsuboi et al., 2012</xref>). Dom34–Hbs1 works in concert with a member of the ABC family of ATPases, known as ABCE1 in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pisareva et al., 2011</xref>) or Rli1 in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shoemaker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shoemaker and Green, 2011</xref>), to disassemble stalled ribosomes for subsequent reuse. Additionally, the translational GTPase Ski7, which is closely related to Hbs1 (and thus to eRF3), has been proposed to recognize ribosomes stalled at the 3′ end of non-stop messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Hoof et al., 2002</xref>). However, no Dom34/eRF1-like molecule has been identified to date that can interact with Ski7 specifically so it remains unknown if it can promote recycling of ribosome subunits. Following dissociation of subunits, the mechanism by which the associated nascent peptide is extricated remains poorly understood. What has been shown so far is that the Ub ligase Ltn1 can bind the ribosome and ubiquitinate NSD substrates that contain a polylysine tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>). Ltn1 belongs to the RING domain family of E3 Ub ligases that ubiquitinate substrates targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finley, 2009</xref>). However, the mechanism by which the nascent non-stop peptide is released from the ribosome and degraded remains unknown. Nevertheless, the underlying biochemistry is likely to be important for human health, because point mutations in mouse Ltn1 result in neurodegeneration and a null allele is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Budding yeast Cdc48 (the human protein is known as p97 or valosin-containing protein [VCP]) is a member of the AAA (<underline>A</underline>TPases <underline>a</underline>ssociated with diverse cellular <underline>a</underline>ctivities) family of proteins. Cdc48 has intrinsic Ub-binding affinity that is greatly enhanced by the binding of UBX domain proteins or the Ufd1–Npl4 heterodimer to its N-terminus and Ufd2 to its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ye, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). Cdc48/p97 is widely believed to function as a ‘segregase’ that uses the free energy released upon ATP hydrolysis to remodel ubiquitinated substrate complexes, usually, but not always, as a prelude to their degradation by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jentsch and Rumpf, 2007</xref>). In the work reported here, we show that Cdc48–Ufd1–Npl4 promotes the release of tRNA-linked ubiquitinated nascent chains as well as aberrant non-stop and prematurely terminated polypeptides from the ribosome. Our findings establish a new function for Cdc48/p97 in RAD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In an effort to systematically elucidate cellular functions of Cdc48 and its adaptors, mutants were subjected to chemical profiling by determining growth in the presence of various drugs, including translation inhibitors.

Deletion of <italic>LTN1</italic> leads to hygromycin-sensitivity and since Ltn1 is involved in QC of NSD pathway substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>), we explored the possibility that Cdc48–Ufd1–Npl4 and one or more Ubx proteins also function in this pathway.</p><p>To determine if Cdc48 contributes to protein degradation at the ribosome in unperturbed, exponentially growing cells, we purified ribosomes using a rapid, one-step affinity method designed to isolate 60S subunits, 80S monosomes and polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oeffinger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halbeisen and Gerber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Halbeisen et al., 2009</xref>). Coomassie blue staining of purified ribosomes confirmed that Cdc48 activity was not required for their assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, lane 3), a conclusion that was further validated by sucrose gradient fractionation of ribosomes from wildtype, <italic>cdc48-3</italic>, and <italic>ufd1-2</italic> whole cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, the mutants do appear to have a slightly lower ratio of polysomes:80S monosomes. Immunoblotting for Ub revealed strong accumulation of Ub conjugates on ribosomes affinity-purified from <italic>cdc48-3</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Again, Ub conjugates were observed to accumulate on ribosomes in <italic>cdc48-3</italic> and <italic>npl4-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Because the proteolytic defects of <italic>npl4-1</italic> are manifested at the semi-permissive temperature of 30°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bays et al., 2001</xref>), we carried out the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> at 30°C.

Consistent with the idea that Cdc48 ATPase functions at the ribosome to mediate release of ubiquitinated nascent peptides, both Cdc48 and Ufd1 were found to cofractionate with affinity-purified ribosomes isolated under stringent conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>We next wished to ascertain if the Ub conjugates were derived from nascent polypeptides that were linked to tRNA. Magnetic beads containing bound ribosomes from wildtype or <italic>cdc48-3</italic> cells were treated with TEV protease, which cleaves between Rpl18B and the TAP tag. The TEV cleavage was carried out in the presence or absence of puromycin. Puromycin causes premature termination of translation by binding in the A-site of the ribosome and reacting with peptidyl-tRNA in the P-site, yielding a peptide-puromycin conjugate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nathans, 1964</xref>). Thus, we expected that puromycin would induce the release of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome as a peptide-puromycin conjugate. The supernatants were then bound to UBA Sepharose resin to enrich for Ub conjugates. The rationale behind this step was that ribosome-associated Ub conjugates that remained bound to the ribosome would bind poorly to UBA beads because ribosomes do not efficiently penetrate the pores of a Sepharose resin, whereas Ub conjugates released from the ribosome by puromycin would be able to bind more efficiently to UBA beads. Puromycin treatment of ribosomes from <italic>cdc48-3</italic> but not wildtype cells released ubiquitinated proteins that were enriched on the UBA resin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, top panel). A similar result was obtained with ribosomes isolated from <italic>npl4-1</italic> and <italic>ufd1-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The conjugates observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> were indeed linked to puromycin because they cross-reacted with an antibody specific for puromycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom panel).

First, ribosomes affinity-purified from <italic>cdc48-3</italic> were treated with RNAse A or not before incubation with puromycin followed by binding to the UBA resin. Immunoblotting for Ub revealed that both the control and RNAse-treated ribosomes contained Ub conjugates that bound the UBA beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top panel, lanes 2 and 3). However, ribosomes pre-treated with RNAse no longer yielded puromycin-reactive conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom panel). By contrast, pre-treating lysate with RNAse <italic>before</italic> affinity purification of ribosomes eliminated recovery of both Ub-, and puromycin immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 4, top and bottom panels).</p><p>The second experiment that we did to confirm tRNA linkage was to treat affinity-purified ribosomes with CTAB. CTAB is an ionic detergent that disrupts protein structure and precipitates peptidyl-tRNA molecules selectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hobden and Cundliffe, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mariappan et al., 2010</xref>). In parallel with results obtained previously using puromycin, Ub conjugates were precipitated from <italic>cdc48-3</italic> ribosomes in an RNAse-sensitive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>As a final test of the idea that the Ub conjugates that accumulated on <italic>cdc48-3</italic> ribosomes were attached to nascent chains, wildtype and mutant cells were pulsed with radioactive methionine for 90 s and then chased with cold methionine. Ribosomes were affinity-purified from cells sampled at different times of chase and treated with puromycin to release tRNA-linked nascent chains. This material was then fractionated on UBA resin to enrich for discharged Ub conjugates. Strikingly, ribosomes from both <italic>cdc48-3</italic> and <italic>ufd1-2</italic> cells contained far higher levels of radiolabeled high MW Ub conjugates than wildtype ribosomes, and a substantial portion of this signal persisted on ribosomes for 10–20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which is considerably longer than the time required to synthesize a protein. Importantly, the low signal on wildtype ribosomes was not due to inefficient incorporation, because the WT inputs for the UBA fractionation step actually contained slightly more total pulse-labeled species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Taken together, the experiments described thus far indicate that Cdc48 and its cofactors Ufd1 and Npl4 prevent accumulation of ubiquitinated, tRNA-linked nascent chains on the ribosome. For simplicity, we hereafter refer to these species as tUNPs (<underline>t</underline>RNA-linked, <underline>u</underline>biquitinated <underline>n</underline>ascent <underline>p</underline>olypeptides). Notably, other Cdc48 cofactors including Ubx2, Ubx4, Ubx6, and Ufd2 did not appear to contribute to clearance of tUNPs from the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These cofactors were tested because they had scored positively in the hygromycin-sensitivity assay whereas <italic>ubx3Δ</italic>, <italic>ubx5Δ</italic>, and <italic>ubx7Δ</italic> were hygromycin-insensitive, and therefore not pursued further. Hygromycin-sensitive <italic>ubx1Δ/shp1Δ</italic> was also not pursued further, because this mutant is extremely sick.</p><p>The findings summarized above raised the question: what is the composition of the tUNPs? One possibility is a class of aberrant proteins arising from translation of mRNAs that lack stop codons (‘non-stop mRNA’). Translation through the poly(A) tail of these mRNAs can result in a ribosome that stalls either because it reaches the end of the message, or the polylysine encoded by the poly(A) tail interacts with the negatively charged exit tunnel of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dimitrova et al., 2009</xref>). Prior work has demonstrated that the Ub ligase Ltn1 targets proteins translated from mRNAs that lack a stop codon or that contain polylysine stretches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>). We therefore employed the puromycin release/UBA bead capture protocol to test whether deletion of <italic>LTN1</italic> diminished the accumulation of tUNPs on ribosomes in <italic>cdc48-3</italic> cells. We also tested the impact of <italic>ubr1Δ</italic>, because of prior reports that Ubr1 promotes co-translational ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Turner and Varshavsky, 2000</xref>), and because <italic>ubr1Δ</italic> mutants, like <italic>ltn1Δ</italic>, are hygromycin-sensitive (not shown, but see below). The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> demonstrate that additional loss of <italic>LTN1</italic> or <italic>UBR1</italic> resulted in a marked decrease in the level of tUNPs on <italic>cdc48-3</italic> ribosomes. This result encouraged us to evaluate the steady state levels of the Gfp-FLAG-His3Non-Stop (GFH<sup>NS</sup>) fusion protein shown earlier to be an Ltn1 substrate at the ribosome that is degraded by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>). Amongst the Cdc48 pathway mutants examined, GFH<sup>NS</sup> accumulated maximally in <italic>ufd1</italic> mutants (similar to levels observed for <italic>ltn1Δ</italic>), and also exhibited significant accumulation in <italic>npl4-1</italic> and <italic>cdc48-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Cycloheximide chase analysis in <italic>ufd1-2</italic> cells indicated that accumulation resulted from stabilization of the non-stop reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As observed in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>), the same reporter containing a stop codon was not degraded and accumulated at a much higher level than the NS reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; amounts loaded were adjusted to yield signals of equal intensity at 0 min).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00308.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Aberrant proteins derived from non-stop mRNA accumulate in cells deficient in Cdc48–Ufd1–Npl4 function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ltn1 and Ubr1 contribute to accumulation of Ub conjugates on <italic>cdc48-3</italic> ribosomes.

Shallow gradients (10–30%) were set up, enabling good resolution of the subunits, monosomes, and polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Immunoblotting for PrA<sup>NS</sup> revealed that the RNAse-sensitive species peaked in the 80S fractions isolated from <italic>ltn1Δ</italic> mutants but was found in both the 60S and 80S-containing fractions from <italic>cdc48-3</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Additionally, modified forms of slower mobility than the tRNA-linked species were detected in 60S ribosomes from <italic>cdc48-3</italic> but not <italic>ltn1Δ</italic>, suggesting that these high MW species are Ltn1-dependent Ub conjugates. Only a small fraction of the PrA<sup>NS</sup> detected on ribosomes migrated as Ub-conjugated species. This is consistent with what is typically observed for most Ub-dependent substrates upon inhibition of their degradation, and presumably reflects robust cytosolic deubiquitination activity. In addition, overproduction of PrA<sup>NS</sup> from the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter may overwhelm Ltn1, which is inabundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>). Besides the modified forms of PrA<sup>NS</sup>, unmodified protein was observed throughout the gradient and peaked in the ribosomal fractions. We do not know whether this latter form arose from hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA linkage in cells or in vitro.</p><p>Our data thus far indicate that in <italic>cdc48, npl4,</italic> and <italic>ufd1</italic> mutants, nascent proteins were targeted for degradation by Ltn1- and Ubr1-dependent ubiquitination but became stuck on 60S and 80S ribosomes as peptidyl-tRNAs, implying that Cdc48 activity promotes release of stalled, ubiquitinated peptides, which are then degraded by the proteasome. This hypothesis predicts that ribosomes isolated from cells in which proteasome activity is compromised should accumulate less tUNPs than <italic>cdc48</italic> mutants. To test this prediction, we used the sucrose cushion method to isolate ribosomes from <italic>cdc48-3</italic> and <italic>npl4-1</italic> mutants, as well as <italic>pdr5Δ</italic> cells treated with or without the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<italic>pdr5Δ</italic> enables cellular accumulation of this compound).

We do not know the basis for these differences.</p><p>Our observation that Ubr1 contributed to ubiquitination of tUNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) led us to wonder about the diversity of the QC mechanisms that underlie their formation. To determine if the role of Cdc48 is limited to the non-stop pathway or whether it plays a more global role in degradation of proteins encoded by aberrant messages, we also assessed the stability of endogenous phosphogluconate dehydrogenase truncated by a premature termination codon (Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup>) in the middle of a folded domain at residue 368. Over-produced Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup> was shown to be a substrate of the Ubr1 cytosolic quality control pathway in a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heck et al., 2010</xref>). The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> confirmed stabilization of Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup> in <italic>ubr1Δ</italic>. Notably, <italic>cdc48-3</italic> and <italic>ufd1-2</italic> mutations also stabilized Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup>, but <italic>ltn1Δ</italic> was without effect (equivalent loading confirmed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup> was also stabilized in <italic>upf1Δ.</italic> Upf1 is a RING domain Ub ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takahashi et al., 2008</xref>) that plays a crucial role in NMD and stimulates the degradation of aberrant PTC translation products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuroha et al., 2009</xref>). The dependence of Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup> degradation on Cdc48 and Upf1 suggested that tRNA-linked Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup> might become stuck on ribosomes, as observed for the non-stop reporters. To test this possibility we used the sucrose cushion method to isolate ribosomes from various mutants, and evaluated the ribosomal pellets for their content of Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup>. Analysis of total cell lysates revealed strong accumulation of Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup> in <italic>cdc48-3</italic>, <italic>ubr1Δ</italic>, and <italic>upf1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Some proteins encoded by non-stop mRNAs, including the reporter proteins used here (GFH<sup>NS</sup> and PrA<sup>NS</sup>), are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>). The Ub ligase Ltn1 binds 60S ribosomes and promotes ubiquitination of stalled GFH<sup>NS</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>). Our data suggest that Cdc48–Ufd1–Npl4 acts downstream of Ltn1 to promote release of the non-stop peptide from the ribosome, so that it can be degraded by the proteasome. How Ltn1 and the Cdc48 complex does this remains unknown. Indeed, this remains unknown for any NSD or NGD pathway substrate; the Dom34-Hbs1 complex lacks the residues necessary for hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA bond, and the two budding yeast peptidyl-tRNA hydrolases, Pth1 and Pth2, are non-essential mitochondrial proteins whose transmembrane configurations are currently unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosas-Sandoval et al., 2002</xref>). An interesting question for the future will be to determine whether Ltn1 and Cdc48–Ufd1–Npl4 act together with, or in a redundant pathway parallel to Ski7 or Dom34–Hbs1-Rli1.</p><p>We observed direct physical association of Cdc48 and Ufd1 with both affinity-purified ribosomes and the NSD pathway substrate GFH<sup>NS</sup>. This interaction was highly specific, because Cdc48 and Ufd1 did not bind the same substrate when it was translated from a message that includes a stop codon. While this manuscript was in revision, it was reported that Cdc48, Ufd1, and Npl4 are components of the newly identified Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) complex, which also contains Ltn1, Rqc1 and Tae2 and associates with the 60S ribosomal subunit. The latter two proteins, like Ltn1 and Cdc48–Ufd1–Npl4, are highly conserved and have mammalian homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>). Both Ltn1 and Rqc1 help link Cdc48–Ufd1–Npl4 to RQC. Rqc1 associates with and is required for the degradation of an Ltn1 substrate that contains an internal polyarginine sequence, but a functional role for Cdc48–Ufd1–Npl4 in RQC was not established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandman et al. (2012)</xref>.</p><p>A key question that emerges from this work is, what is the signal that differentiates ribosomes engaged with NSD or other aberrant substrates from normally translating ribosomes? Ltn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>) and RQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>) are reported to be predominantly bound to 60S ribosomal subunits, suggesting that they may act downstream of the initial recognition and splitting of a stalled ribosome. However, in <italic>ltn1Δ</italic> cells, GFH<sup>NS</sup> accumulates on 80S monosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>). Likewise, we report here that tRNA-linked PrA<sup>NS</sup> appeared to be concentrated in monosomes in <italic>ltn1Δ</italic>. By contrast, tRNA-linked PrA<sup>NS</sup> was spread more broadly across 60S and 80S fractions in extracts from <italic>cdc48-3</italic> cells. The different fractionation behavior of tRNA-linked PrA<sup>NS</sup> in <italic>ltn1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc48</italic> mutants may reflect leakiness of the <italic>cdc48</italic> mutation (the experiment was done at the semi-permissive temperature of 30°C) or Cdc48-independent ribosome splitting. Detailed resolution of the exact sequence of events will require reconstitution of the overall process with defined components.</p><p>In addition to observing accumulation of engineered NSD pathway reporter proteins in Cdc48 pathway mutants, we also observed extensive accumulation of endogenous, tRNA-linked ubiquitinated nascent polypeptides (tUNPs) on ribosomes in these cells. These tUNPs could potentially arise from multiple sources including misfolded domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Turner and Varshavsky, 2000</xref>), mRNAs whose transcription was prematurely terminated, mRNAs or nascent peptides containing sequences that cause ribosome pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>) or mRNAs that encode premature termination codons (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus it is perhaps not surprising that at least two Ub ligases (Ltn1 and Ubr1) contributed to their accumulation. In any event, we believe it is unlikely that there is a single pathway or mechanism for disposing of tUNPs. Even in the seemingly simple case of a ribosome that translates into the poly(A) tail of an mRNA that is prematurely polyadenylated within the coding sequence, the 3′-most ribosome may be stalled because it reached the end of the message, or because polylysine encoded by the poly(A) tail bound the exit channel of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito-Harashima et al., 2007</xref>). Because stalls in translation elongation lead to endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA upstream of the 3′-most ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsuboi et al., 2012</xref>), each trailing ribosome will present a unique substrate to the UPS, and may be processed by a different mechanism.</p><p>The intimacy with which protein biosynthesis is coupled to protein degradation is highlighted by the identification of the translasome, a supercomplex defined by mass spectrometric analysis of the translation initiation factor eIF3 and found to contain both ribosome and proteasome subunits as well as chaperones involved in protein QC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sha et al., 2009</xref>). A tight coupling of these processes may be particularly important for neurons, which are post-mitotic and need to remain robust for the life of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Segref and Hoppe, 2009</xref>). Indeed, homozygous lister mice deficient in Listerin (Ltn1) function exhibit severe neurological dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2009</xref>), whereas mutations in human Ubr1 result in the Johanson–Blizzard syndrome characterized by, amongst other phenotypes, frequent mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hwang et al., 2011</xref>). Mutations in p97 contribute to 1–2% of familial ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>) and are the root cause of a syndrome, IBMPFD, that includes frontotemporal dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watts et al., 2004</xref>). Defects in metabolism of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manno et al., 2010</xref>), endosomal trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ritz et al., 2011</xref>) and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ju et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tresse et al., 2010</xref>) have been previously suggested to contribute to the pathophysiology that results from mutation of p97. As the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases are unraveled, it will be interesting to see if ribosome-associated degradation contributes to their etiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth</title><p>All strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your submission has been evaluated by three reviewers, two of whom are members of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision has been discussed further with one of <italic>eLife's</italic> Senior Editors. The following reviewer wants to reveal his identity: Roy Parker.</p><p>General assessment and substantive concerns: This manuscript addresses the role of Cdc48 in targeting nascent aberrant polypeptides for degradation. The main conclusion is that the Cdc48 complex plays a role in disassembling tRNA-peptide-ubiquitin conjugates from the ribosome. Cdc48 has been previously characterized as a “seggregase” to remodel certain ubiquitinated substrate complexes prior to their proteasomal degradation, but these findings are relevant because they describe a new role for Cdc48 in ribosome-associated protein quality control pathways. All of the reviewers have credited the quality of the work but they also indicated that mechanistic understanding of this new pathway is missing. For example, no evidence is presented that the Cdc48 role in this process is direct and it remains possible that Cdc48 affects other aspects of the cell that indirectly lead to this phenotype. Further detailed analyses of the pathway and a better mechanistic understanding of the process are needed for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00308.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>The main changes from the original submission are as follows:</p><p>1. The main criticism of the original submission was that there was not sufficient mechanistic insight into how Cdc48–Ufd1–Npl4 promotes degradation of tUNCs and non-stop decay (NSD) pathway substrates that are translated from messages that lack a stop codon. In particular, we provided no evidence to indicate that the role of Cdc48–Ufd1–Npl4 in this process is direct. In a series of email and telephone discussions with the editors, we were advised that providing evidence to support a direct role for Cdc48–Ufd1–Npl4 in RAD might suffice to address the concern that the reviewers raised about mechanism. We have addressed this criticism by showing in the revised manuscript that Cdc48 and Ufd1 were associated specifically with stringently-washed, affinity-purified ribosomes (Figure 1D). We also show that Cdc48 and Ufd1 bound the NSD substrate GFH<sup>NS</sup>, but not the control GFH<sup>Stop</sup> (Figure 3E), despite the latter being present at much higher levels than the NS reporter.</p><p>2. In addition to the new figure panels described above (Figures 1D and 3E), we have added the following additional data panels to address the other criticisms made by the reviewers: (i) input controls for Figure 1B, (ii) evidence that accumulation of tUNCs in <italic>cdc48-3</italic> cells is reversed by expression of wild type Cdc48 but not the ATPase-deficient Q2 mutant (Figure 1C), (iii) an expanded Figure 2B to include a control in which RNAse was added to cell lysate prior to isolation of ribosomes, (iv) a new version of Figure 3A showing the effect of <italic>ubr1Δ</italic> and <italic>ltn1Δ</italic> on accumulation of tUNCs in <italic>cdc48-3</italic> mutants, (v) a new version of Figure 3B showing the effect of Cdc48 pathway mutations on accumulation of the NSD substrate GFH<sup>NS</sup>, including an anti-tubulin loading control, (vi) degradation assays for GFH<sup>NS</sup> in wild type, <italic>ltn1Δ</italic>, and <italic>ufd1-2</italic> cells and GFH<sup>Stop</sup> in wild type cells (Figure 3C), (vii) high-resolution sucrose gradient fractionation of lysates of <italic>ltn1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc48-3</italic> cells expressing PrA<sup>NS</sup> (Figure 4B; these data replace the sucrose gradient fractionations of GFH<sup>NS</sup> that were previously shown in Figure 3D), (viii) levels of Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup> in total cell extracts of various mutants (Figure 6B), and (ix) post-ribosomal supernatants from the sucrose cushion fractionation of cells expressing Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup> (Figure 6C bottom panel).</p><p>3. Because we do not have direct mechanistic data on exactly what Cdc48 is doing to promote degradation of proteins encoded by mRNAs that lack a stop codon, we have attenuated our Discussion regarding the potential role(s) of Cdc48 in this process.</p><p>One week prior to the submission of this revised manuscript, a paper was published by Jonathan Weissman's group (Brandman et. al. 2012 Cell 151, 1042-54; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23178123">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23178123</ext-link>; doi:10.1016/j.cell.2012.10.044) that partially overlaps with our own work in a complementary manner. Weissman's group was studying the heat shock response in yeast, which is mediated by the transcription factor HSF1. This led them to discover the Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) protein complex, which contains Rqc1, Tea2, Ltn1, Cdc48, Ufd1, and Npl4, as well as subunits of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Brandman et al show that Rqc1 and Ltn1 are required for association of Cdc48 with RQC, and hence they propose that Rqc1 and Ltn1 help recruit Cdc48 to the ribosome. Mutant <italic>rqc1Δ</italic> cells accumulate a model substrate (GFP–Arg12–RFP) with an internal polybasic tract that is designed to mimic an NSD pathway substrate, and Rqc1 and Cdc48 are shown to co-immunoprecipitate with this substrate. Although Weissman and colleagues propose that Cdc48 is involved in degradation of RQC substrates, no evidence is provided that Cdc48, Ufd1, or Npl4 are required for RQC function. This leaves open several possible interpretations. As but one example, their data are also consistent with the possibility that Cdc48–Ufd1–Npl4 serves as a negative regulator of RQC that blocks RQC from targeting inappropriate substrates, thereby determining the specificity of RQC action. In that sense, the two papers provide a nice complement to each other – Brandman et al describe a mechanism for how Cdc48 is recruited to NSD pathway substrates, whereas our work establishes that Cdc48, Ufd1, and Npl4 are required to release these substrates from the ribosome so that they can be degraded by the proteasome. We have modified our Discussion to incorporate the findings of Brandman et al and how they relate to our own.</p></body></sub-article></article>
