established. We developed methods for efficient gene transfer and retrograde tracing in adult and larval zebrafish by herpes simplex viruses (HSV1). HSV1 was combined with the Gal4/UAS system to target cell types with high spatial, temporal, and molecular specificity. We also established methods for efficient transneuronal tracing by modified rabies viruses in zebrafish. We demonstrate that HSV1 and rabies viruses can be used to visualize and manipulate genetically or anatomically identified neurons within and across different brain areas of adult and larval zebrafish. An expandable library of viruses is provided to express fluorescent proteins, calcium indicators, optogenetic probes, toxins and other molecular tools. This toolbox creates new opportunities to interrogate neuronal circuits in zebrafish through combinations of genetic and viral approaches.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>viral vector</kwd><kwd>gene transfer</kwd><kwd>imaging</kwd><kwd>neuronal circuit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004784</institution-id><institution>Novartis Foundation for Medical-Biological Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedrich</surname><given-names>Rainer W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>742576</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedrich</surname><given-names>Rainer W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Satou</surname><given-names>Chie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>HORIZON EUROPE Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>331463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Satou</surname><given-names>Chie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003 A_172925/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Satou</surname><given-names>Chie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Novel procedures for viral gene transfer in zebrafish enable visualization and manipulation of specific neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The zebrafish is an important vertebrate model in systems neuroscience because its small, optically accessible brain provides unique opportunities to analyze neuronal circuits and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friedrich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vanwalleghem et al., 2018</xref>). Key methods established in zebrafish include large-scale imaging of neuronal population activity, behavioral approaches including virtual realities, and genetic manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cherng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friedrich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Namekawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Satou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vanwalleghem et al., 2018</xref>), but efficient methods for viral gene transfer are still lacking. Viral vectors are important experimental tools in mammals because they enable the visualization and manipulation of defined neurons with high spatial, temporal, and molecular specificity, and because they can bypass the need to generate transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jüttner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, engineered viral tools that cross synapses allow for the visualization and physiological analysis of synaptically connected neuronal cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Callaway and Luo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghanem and Conzelmann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wickersham et al., 2007a</xref>). Our goal was to establish similar methods for specific viral gene transfer and transneuronal tracing in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimization of the temperature regime for viral gene transfer</title><p>Previous studies demonstrated that adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), which are widely used for gene transfer in mammals and other amniotes, fail to infect neurons in the zebrafish brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). Infection of zebrafish neurons by other viruses has been reported but efficiency was usually low and viral vectors for conditional gene expression in transgenic fish have not been described. To improve upon these points, we first focused on herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), a DNA virus that can infect zebrafish neurons both locally and retrogradely via projecting axons without obvious signs of cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zou et al., 2014</xref>). We first explored whether HSV1-mediated gene transfer can be further improved by optimizing the temperature regime. Zebrafish are usually kept at 26–28.5 °C but the temperature range of natural habitats is broad (up to &gt;38 °C) and temperature tolerance in the laboratory extends up to ~41 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engeszer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">López-Olmeda and Sánchez-Vázquez, 2011</xref>). We therefore tested whether viral gene expression is more efficient at temperatures near those of mammalian hosts (37 °C).</p><p>We injected amplicon type HSV1 viruses into the brain of adult or larval zebrafish using established procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zou et al., 2014</xref>) and thereafter kept fish at standard laboratory temperatures (26–28.5 °C) or at 35–37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Results were compared to fish that received no injection or buffer alone. In adult fish, survival rates were 100% for 10 days post injection in all treatment groups, independent of temperature (N=5 fish per treatment group; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In larvae, some mortality occurred in all groups, which is likely to be natural. Mortality was slightly enhanced at elevated temperatures but survival during the first three days, which are most relevant for viral gene transfer (see below), was always &gt;90% (N=30 fish per group; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HSV1-mediated gene delivery in adult zebrafish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Procedure to test temperature-dependence of HSV1-mediated gene expression.

However, the general swimming pattern appeared similar (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">4</xref>) and social distance was not significantly different (p=0.53, Wilcoxon rank sum test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). No significant effects on swimming speed were observed when fish were returned to standard laboratory temperatures after seven days at 36 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To examine effects of transient temperature changes on a more complex behavior, we trained two groups of adult zebrafish in an odor discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Namekawa et al., 2018</xref>) that comprised 1 day of acclimatization to the setup followed by 5 days of appetitive conditioning (nine training trials with a rewarded odor [CS+] and with a non-rewarded odor [CS-] each per day). Group 1 (control) underwent no surgery and was kept at the standard laboratory temperature. Group 2 was injected with an HSV1 and subsequently kept at 36 °C for 2 days before training commenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Injections were targeted unilaterally into the olfactory bulb (OB) and fish were then maintained at 26 °C or 36 °C for 6 days after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zou et al., 2014</xref>), reporter expression (DsRed) was observed in the injected OB. Moreover, retrogradely labeled neurons were present in telencephalic areas that project to the OB, most notably in the posterior zone of the dorsal telencephalon (Dp), the homolog of mammalian olfactory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). After incubation at 36 °C, substantially more neurons expressed DsRed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) than after incubation at 26 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In addition, retrograde labeling was detected in a small but distinct population of neurons in the dorsal telencephalon that was not seen at 26 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). DsRed expression at 36 °C was first detected ~12 hr after injection and stable for at least 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Similar expression was also observed when the temperature was decreased from 36 °C to 26 °C 3 days after injection, but not when it was increased from 26 °C to 36 °C after 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>).

However, for specific manipulations it is often desired to target genetically defined subsets of cells or cell types. This is usually achieved by combining viral gene transfer with transgenic lines using two-component expression systems (e.g. injection of a Cre-dependent viral construct into Cre-expressing mice). In zebrafish, the most widely used two-component expression system is the Gal4/UAS system. We therefore explored the possibility to combine viral delivery of UAS-dependent expression constructs with Gal4-expressing driver lines. We first created a Gateway expression vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reece-Hoyes and Walhout, 2018</xref>) to simplify the construction of HSV1 for UAS-dependent expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Interestingly, mCherry-expressing neurites arborized extensively in the lateral pallium but spared a region of Dp immediately adjacent to the <italic>gad1b</italic>-positive cluster, indicating that the dorsal telencephalon contains specific long-range projections of GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In zebrafish larvae (7 dpf), we injected HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:GFP] into the hindbrain of Tg[<italic>gad1b</italic>:Gal4; <italic>gad1b</italic>:DsRed] fish (N=3) and detected expression of GFP selectively in DsRed-positive cells in the hindbrain and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>). These observations indicate that HSV1 can be combined with the Gal4/UAS system to enhance the specificity of cellular targeting.</p><p>To corroborate this conclusion we designed experiments to target sparse neuronal populations. We first injected HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:Venus-CAAX] into the optic tectum of Tg[<italic>th</italic>:Gal4; <italic>UAS</italic>:tdTomato-CAAX] fish, which express Gal4 and the red-fluorescent protein tdTomato-CAAX under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase-1 promoter, a marker for catecholaminergic neurons. This procedure resulted in the selective expression of the membrane-associated protein Venus-CAAX in a small number of tdTomato-CAAX-positive neurons in the locus coeruleus with complex long-distance axonal projections, indicating that expression was specifically directed to catecholaminergic (noradrenergic) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; N=4 fish). In additional experiments, we first injected HSV1[<italic>LTCMV</italic>:Gal4] into the OB of wildtype zebrafish and subsequently injected HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:GFP] into the dorsal telencephalon. Expression of GFP was observed specifically in OB-projecting neurons of the dorsal telencephalon without expression elsewhere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To assess the efficiency of this intersectional targeting approach, we compared the number of labeled neurons using either the Gal4/UAS system or the one-component approach (injection of HSV1[<italic>LTCMV</italic>:DsRed] into OB). Both approaches yielded similar numbers of labeled neurons in the dorsal telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We therefore conclude that HSV1 can be combined with the Gal4/UAS system in intersectional approaches with high efficiency and low leakiness.</p><p>We next explored strategies for co-expression of multiple transgenes in the same neurons. When red and green reporter constructs were co-packaged into the same virus (HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:TVA-mCherry &amp; <italic>UAS</italic>:GFP]), injection into the cerebellum of Tg[<italic>gad1b</italic>:Gal4] resulted in a high rate of co-expression, as expected (89.5% ± 8.7% co-expression; mean ± s.d.; N=3 fish; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,C</xref>). However, the rate of co-expression did not reach 100 %, possibly because not all virus particles received both constructs during packaging. Interestingly, co-injection of the same responder constructs packaged into separate viruses (HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:TVA-mCherry] and HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:GFP]) produced a similar rate of co-expression, even when overall expression was sparse (84.3% ± 6.0% co-expression; mean ± s.d.; N=3 fish; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). These results indicate that co-packaging and co-injection of viruses can be used to express multiple transgenes in the same neurons.</p><p>We also tested HSV1 as a tool for functional manipulations of neurons and behavior. We first injected HSV1[<italic>LTCMV</italic>:Gal4] into the OB of wildtype zebrafish and subsequently co-injected HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:GCaMP6f] and HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:Chrimson-tdTomato] into the dorsal telencephalon. This procedure resulted in the co-expression of the green-fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) and the red-light-gated cation channel Chrimson-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) in OB-projecting neurons of the dorsal telencephalon. Brief (500ms) illumination with red light evoked GCaMP6f fluorescence transients that increased in amplitude with increasing light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>; 21 neurons in one fish). Hence, transgene-expressing neurons were functional and responsive to optogenetic stimulation. To explore loss-of-function manipulations we expressed tetanus toxin light chain (TeNT) in GABAergic neurons of the cerebellum by injecting HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:TeNT-GFP] into the cerebellum of Tg[<italic>gad1b</italic>:Gal4] fish. Injected fish showed abnormal body posture and swimming patterns such as slow swimming, circular or ‘corkscrew’ trajectories, and a tendency to stay in the lower portion of the water column, whereas control fish injected with HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:GFP] swam normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">3</xref>). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that virally delivered TeNT-GFP modified synaptic output of GABAergic neurons in the cerebellum, although further experiments are needed to fully understand the mechanism underlying the observed effects on swimming behavior. HSV1-mediated gene transfer thus offers a wide range of opportunities for anatomical and functional experiments in zebrafish.</p><p>We have so far assembled a collection of 26 different HSV1s for applications in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> file1). Fifteen of these drive expression of fluorescent markers, calcium indicators, Gal4 or optogenetic probes under the control of the non-specific LTCMV promoter for regional transgene expression and retrograde tracing. The remaining 11 HSV1s drive expression of fluorescent markers, optogenetic probes, toxins and other proteins under UAS control for intersectional targeting of neurons using the Gal4/UAS system. Although not all constructs have been tested yet, this toolbox is available and can be further expanded using our UAS-containing expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transneuronal viral tracing in zebrafish</title><p>The ability of some viruses to cross synapses has been exploited to express transgenes in synaptically connected cohorts of neurons. In zebrafish and other species, neurons can be traced across one or multiple synapses using engineered vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSVs), and modifications have been introduced to limit transneuronal spread to one synapse in anterograde direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mundell et al., 2015</xref>). In rodents, modified rabies viruses have become important tools to analyze connectivity and structure-function relationships in neuronal circuits. These vectors can infect specific ‘starter’ neurons and are transmitted retrogradely to presynaptic neurons across one synapse. Specific infection is achieved by expressing the receptor protein TVA in the starter neuron and pseudotyping the virus with the envelope protein EnvA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wickersham et al., 2007a</xref>). To limit retrograde transfer to one synapse, an essential glycoprotein (G) is deleted from the viral genome and supplied in trans only in the starter neurons. In zebrafish, the G-deleted rabies virus (RVΔG) has been reported to infect neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>) and to cross synapses when complemented with G but the efficiency of retrograde synaptic transfer appeared very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dohaku et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To enhance the efficiency of viral infection and transneuronal tracing, we first explored the effect of temperature. When we injected EnvA-coated RVΔG expressing GFP (EnvA-RVΔG-GFP) into the telencephalon of wildtype fish at 36 °C, no GFP expression was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then injected EnvA-RVΔG-GFP into the telencephalon of Tg[<italic>gad1b</italic>:Gal4; <italic>UAS</italic>:TVA-mCherry] fish that express TVA-mCherry in GABAergic neurons. After 6 days, efficient and selective infection of neurons expressing GFP was observed at 36 °C but not at 26 °C, nor when the temperature was raised from 26 °C to 36 °C 3 days post injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Hence, infection of zebrafish neurons by EnvA-RVΔG-GFP required TVA and was substantially more efficient when the temperature was close to the body temperature of natural hosts. Subsequent experiments were therefore performed at 35–37 °C.</p><p>To target defined starter neurons we co-injected HSV1[UAS:TVA] and EnvA-RVΔG-GFP into adult fish expressing Gal4 in neurons of interest. Survival rates were high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To assess potential toxicity of RVΔG at the cellular level we injected EnvA-RVΔG-GFP into the OB of Tg[<italic>gad1b</italic>:Gal4; <italic>UAS</italic>:TVA-mCherry] fish as before. After 3–4 days, we dissociated the OB and performed RNA sequencing after fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The incubation period was chosen to approximately match the duration of RVΔG infection in neurons that received the virus by transneuronal spread using a typical experimental schedule (Materials and methods; see below). This approach allowed us to compare transcriptomes of GABAergic neurons infected by RVΔG (green and red) to transcriptomes of non-infected GABAergic neurons expressing only the TVA receptor (red only; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Of 19,819 endogenous genes analyzed, 522 were significantly downregulated while 27 were significantly upregulated in infected cells (see Materials and methods for details on statistics). Among these, stress markers occurred with approximately average frequency (downregulated: 27 out of 471 stress marker genes; upregulated: 1/471) and cell death markers were underrepresented (downregulated: 14/651 genes; upregulated: 4/651; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> file1). The 65 gene ontology (GO) terms that were significantly associated with the set of regulated genes were primarily related to immune responses while GO terms related to stress, cell death, electrophysiological properties or synapses were rare or absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref> file2). The observed changes in gene expression may therefore reflect a general immune response but they do not suggest major effects of RVΔG on physiological functions or cellular stress levels.

As observed before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), mCherry expression was localized to Purkinje neurons and putative Golgi cells. Neurons expressing GFP were concentrated around the injection site and usually co-expressed mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>). Rarely, GFP expression was observed in mCherry-negative neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which may indicate TVA-independent viral entry. However, as no GFP expression was observed when EnvA-RVΔG-GFP was injected into wildtype animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), it appears more likely that GFP+/mCherry- neurons initially expressed TVA but subsequently lost expression due to the slight decline of expression driven by the viral promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Co-expression of mCherry and GFP was stable for at least 10 days after injection and GFP+/mCherry- neurons remained very rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results confirm the specificity of EnvA-RVΔG-GFP infection and provide additional evidence that expression of TVA-mCherry or the infection by RVΔG alone are not toxic in the absence of glycoprotein. No expression of GFP was observed in the inferior olive, consistent with the expectation that RVΔG does not spread in the absence of glycoprotein.</p><p>To examine whether the delivery of glycoprotein to starter cells can drive transneuronal spread, we injected a mixture of HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:TVA-mCherry], HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:zoSADG] and EnvA-RVΔG-GFP into the cerebellum of Tg[<italic>gad1b</italic>:Gal4] fish. Unlike in the absence of glycoprotein, the number of mCherry-expressing Purkinje neurons and putative Golgi cells now declined over the incubation period of 10 days. The number of neurons expressing GFP, in contrast, was low initially but increased steeply between 6 and 10 days after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Injecting EnvA-RVΔG-GFP 2 or 4 days after the injection of HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:TVA-mCherry] and HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:zoSADG] did not result in a further increase in the number of infected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with observations in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vélez-Fort et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wertz et al., 2015</xref>). In the cerebellum, GFP was expressed in Purkinje cells and throughout the granular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The number and spatial distribution of GFP-expressing neurons in the granular layer was clearly different from mCherry expression in the absence of glycoprotein (Tg[<italic>gad1b</italic>:Gal4] fish injected with HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:TVA-mCherry]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that GFP was expressed in granule cells. Moreover, GFP-positive neurons were found in the contralateral inferior olive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We therefore conclude that <italic>trans</italic>-complementation with zoSADG in starter cells promoted transneuronal spread of the rabies virus.</p><p>Transneuronal viral transfer for synaptic inputs to Purkinje neurons from the inferior olive was quantified in each individual by a convergence index that is defined as the number of transneuronally labeled neurons (here: GFP+/mCherry- neurons in the inferior olive) normalized to the number of starter cells (here: GFP+/mCherry +Purkinje neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>). This index does not reflect the true convergence because an unknown number of starter neurons has disappeared at the time when neurons are counted. We nevertheless used this index to assess transneuronal spread because it has been established previously as a benchmark in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>).

In this area, both glutamatergic principal neurons and GABAergic interneurons receive long-range input from mitral cells in the OB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In addition, Dp receives other telencephalic inputs that are not well characterized.

This cluster was located near a prominent furrow that separates an anterior from a posterior compartment of Dp, consistent with the known location of GABAergic neurons in Dp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2019</xref>). When HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:zoSADG] was added to the injected virus mixture, mCherry expression became rare while a large number of neurons in different telencephalic areas expressed GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H1</xref>).

We found that viral infection and transgene expression can be significantly enhanced by adjusting the temperature to that of the natural viral host. Furthermore, we show that HSV1 vectors can be combined with the Gal4/UAS system for intersectional gene expression strategies. We applied HSV1s to target the expression of multiple transgenes to different brain areas and neuron types in the adult zebrafish brain and in larvae. Hence, HSV1-mediated gene transfer and retrograde tracing has a wide range of potential of applications in zebrafish.</p><p>Effects of temperature on the expression of virally delivered transgenes cannot easily be explained by increased proliferation of infected cells or other indirect effects. Temperature shift experiments suggest that temperature affects gene expression by modulating the process of viral infection but the precise mechanism is not understood and additional effects on protein synthesis may also occur. Because a transient temperature shift around the time of virus injection was sufficient to achieve high expression, fish can be returned to standard laboratory temperature days before follow-up experiments are usually performed. The temperature shift is therefore expected to have minimal effects on subsequent experiments such as activity measurements or behavioral analyses.</p><p>Our results show that HSV1 can be combined with the Gal4/UAS system for two-component control of gene expression without obvious leakiness. Such intersectional strategies are important to target narrowly defined types of neurons by combining the genetic specificity of promoters with the spatial and temporal precision of viral injections. For example, anatomically defined sets of projection neurons can be targeted by retrograde HSV1-mediated delivery of Gal4 and subsequent HSV1-mediated delivery of a UAS responder. Importantly, expression can be directed to specific neurons by injecting HSV1 with UAS-dependent inserts into existing Gal4 driver lines. Such approaches can immediately capitalize on the broad spectrum of Gal4 driver lines that has been created using defined promoters and random insertion strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asakawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Förster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Satou et al., 2013</xref>). Conceivably, viral delivery of UAS responders may also be useful to overcome the slow loss of expression observed in some Gal4/UAS transgenic lines over generations because it bypasses epigenetic silencing of the highly repetitive UAS elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akitake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goll et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We have generated a collection of HSV1s for the direct or conditional expression of different transgenes including fluorescent markers, calcium indicators, optogenetic probes, and toxins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> file1). This toolbox opens novel opportunities for the fast and flexible interrogation of neurons in zebrafish. For example, the toolbox can be used to express genetically encoded calcium indicators for measurements of neuronal activity from defined types of neurons or to express optogenetic probes for functional manipulations of specific neurons. Such applications are useful to examine how neuronal circuits process information and control behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Transneuronal tracing in zebrafish</title><p>We further established procedures for retrograde monosynaptic tracing using rabies viruses that greatly enhanced the efficiency of transneuronal transfer compared to a previous study in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dohaku et al., 2019</xref>). Temperature adjustments were important but unlikely to be the only factor underlying the enhanced transneuronal spread because the temperature difference to the previous study was only 1.5 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dohaku et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore assume that increased glycoprotein expression by codon optimization, viral gene delivery, and possibly small differences in the experimental schedule also contributed significantly.</p><p>Experiments in rodents indicate that high levels of the viral glycoprotein G are toxic to cells within a few days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohara et al., 2013</xref>) while the G-deficient Rabies virus, RVΔG, exhibits toxicity on longer timescales (&gt;2 weeks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chatterjee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wickersham et al., 2007b</xref>). Consistent with these notions, we found that starter neurons expressing G disappeared during the first 10 days after virus injection whereas neurons infected with RVΔG in the absence of G did not substantially decline in number. Transcriptional profiling revealed that RVΔG primarily changed the expression of immunity-related genes, suggesting no obvious effects on cellular health or physiology on the timescales explored here. However, a detailed interpretation of these results would require additional experiments and is beyond the scope of this study. The comparison of odor-evoked activity in RVΔG-infected and non-infected neurons within the same animals revealed no signs of toxicity of RVΔG alone. It is therefore likely that transneuronally labeled neurons remain physiologically functional for up to 10 days even though starter neurons disappear. These results are consistent with observations in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chatterjee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wickersham et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wickersham et al., 2007a</xref>) and provide a time window for a wide range of experiments, including anatomical labeling and functional analysis of neurons connected to specific starter cells.</p><p>Transneuronal spread of rabies viruses was glycoprotein-dependent and labeled substantial numbers of putative presynaptic neurons from different starter neurons, both in adult zebrafish and in larvae. Convergence ratios were similar to those observed in rodents despite the fact that zebrafish neurons are smaller and probably receive fewer synaptic inputs. These results suggest that the efficiency of transneuronal tracing was in the same range as in rodents although quantitative comparisons are difficult. Rabies-based methods for transneuronal tracing are subject to ongoing developments with the general goal to further increase efficiency and reduce toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chatterjee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciabatti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciabatti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, rabies-based transneuronal tracers are promising tools for the structural and functional dissection of neuronal circuitry in zebrafish.</p><p>Retrograde tracing of connected neuronal cohorts using rabies viruses has become an important approach to decipher the functional logic of neuronal connectivity in rodents. Our results pave the way for applications of this approach in zebrafish. The small size of zebrafish facilitates the combination of neuronal circuit tracing with other methods such high-resolution imaging of neuronal activity patterns throughout large brain areas. Transneuronal tracing in the anterograde direction from starter neurons that were not genetically defined has previously been achieved using VSVs in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mundell et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, anterograde transneuronal tracing using VSVs may complement retrograde transneuronal tracing by rabies viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions and outlook</title><p>Our experiments were designed primarily to explore HSV1 and rabies viruses as tools for structural and functional analyses of neuronal circuits and behavior. While our experiments were performed in adult zebrafish, we found that viral gene transfer and tracing can also be performed in larvae. Viral gene transfer may therefore be used also for developmental studies but the temporal resolution will be limited by the time required for viral gene expression (days). Hence, we expect that viral gene transfer will be most useful for the analysis of neuronal circuit structure and function in juvenile or adult fish, similar to the application of viral tools for systems neuroscience in rodents.</p><p>The ability to target gene expression to specific neurons opens new opportunities for the functional dissection of neuronal circuits in zebrafish. Juvenile and adult zebrafish exhibit a richer repertoire of behaviors than larvae that includes, for example, social affiliation and associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dreosti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Valente et al., 2012</xref>). At the developmental stages when these behaviors emerge, the use of transgenic lines for the functional dissection of neuronal circuitry becomes increasingly difficult because transgene expression often declines. Viral gene transfer is therefore a promising strategy to extend genetic manipulations into juvenile or adult stages. Some brain areas including the telencephalon remain optically accessible even at late juvenile or adult stages, allowing for optical measurements of neuronal activity during behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Such approaches could be particularly powerful to examine information processing in the context of cognitive behaviors. Viral tools and their combination with genetic and optical approaches therefore offer a wide range of experimental opportunities that have not been available in zebrafish so far.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Zebrafish)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AbtuTL x WIK</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">European zebrafish stock center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Zebrafish)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Basel-golden</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Created in this study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">To obtain this line, please contact Friedrich lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Zebrafish)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tg[<italic>UAS</italic>:TVA-mCherry]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Created in this study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">To obtain this line, please contact Friedrich lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Zebrafish)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tg[<italic>vglut1</italic>:GFP]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Created in this study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">To obtain this line, please contact Higashijima lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Zebrafish)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tg[<italic>vglut1:</italic>Gal4]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Created in this study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">To obtain this line, please contact Higashijima lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Zebrafish)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tg[<italic>gad1b</italic>:GFP]</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Satou et al., 2013</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Zebrafish)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tg[<italic>gad1b</italic>:Gal4]</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Zebrafish)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tg [<italic>vglut2a</italic>:loxP-DsRed-loxP-GFP]</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Satou et al., 2013</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Zebrafish)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tg[<italic>th</italic>:Gal4]</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Zebrafish)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tg[<italic>UAS</italic>:tdTomato-CAAX]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miyasaka et al., 2014</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>UAS</italic>:TVA-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Created in this study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene plasmid #

However, the number of GFP-positive neurons was not increased when EnvA-RVΔG-GFP was injected 2 (N=3 fish) or 4 (N=3 fish) days after HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:TVA-mCherry] and HSV1[<italic>UAS</italic>:zoSADG] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with observations in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vélez-Fort et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wertz et al., 2015</xref>).

First, rabies virus appears to remain close to the injection site for an extended period of time, possibly because it has high affinity for membranes. Second, it is difficult to precisely target the two separate injections at the same neurons.</p><p>Transneuronal spread of the rabies virus was determined by quantitative analyses of neurons that expressed GFP but not TVA-mCherry. In theory, some of these neurons could be two (or more) synapses away from the starter cell if they target other neurons that received only the glycoprotein but not TVA-mCherry, if these neurons in turn were presynaptic to a starter neuron. However, because labeling was sparse and because the number of neurons receiving G only should be low, the probability of such events should be very low. Moreover, because transneuronal gene expression is observed only after a delay of &gt;6 days, multi-step events should be very rare 10 days post infection. Multi-step events were therefore not taken into account in our quantitative analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Clearing of brain samples</title><p>We adapted the original Cubic protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>) to small samples such as adult zebrafish brains.

Optogenetic stimuli (500ms duration) were applied randomly every 6–11 s. The average power of each stimulus was chosen at random to be 1.3 mW, 2.4 mW, 4.7 mW, or 8.6 mW under the objective. The total duration of an imaging session was 11 min.</p><p>Raw images were full frame registered to correct for motion. Regions of interest were manually selected based on neuronal co-expression of GCaMP6f and ChrimsonR-tdTomato (N=11 neurons). Raw fluorescence traces were calculated as mean of the pixel values in a given region of interest in each imaging frame. Raw traces were then corrected for slow drift in fluorescence using an 8th-percentile filtering with a 15 s window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dombeck et al., 2007</xref>). ΔF/F traces were computed by dividing raw fluorescence trace by the median calculated over the entire fluorescence distribution for each region of interest. Responses were pooled across neurons and pulses of the same intensity, and the resulting population responses were normalized by subtracting average population activity in a 1 s baseline window prior to the pulse. The standard error of the mean population response was computed over average responses of individual neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Calcium imaging in the OB</title><p>Calcium imaging in the adult OB was performed 4–10 days after viral injections in an explant preparation of the entire brain and nose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacobson et al., 2018</xref>) that was continuously superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 124 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.25KH2PO4, 1.6 MgSO4, 22 D-(+)-Glucose, 2 CaCl2, 24 NaHCO3, pH 7.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mathieson and Maler, 1988</xref>).

Briefly, individual fish were acclimated to the behavioral setup without food for 1–3  days and subsequently trained to associate one odor stimulus (CS<sup>+</sup>: alanine) with a food reward, whereas a second odor stimulus (CS<sup>−</sup>: tryptophan) was not rewarded. Each odor was infused into the tank for 30 s nine times per day in an alternating sequence (inter-trial interval: 20  min) for 5 consecutive days. A small amount of food was delivered at a specific location at the end of the presentation of the CS<sup>+</sup> but not the CS<sup>-</sup>. 3D swimming trajectories were reconstructed from videos acquired by two orthogonal cameras (Logitech HD Pro C920). The following behavioral components were extracted from the trajectories: swimming speed, elevation in water column, presence in the reward zone, surface sampling, distance to the odor inflow and rhythmic circular swimming. The components were combined into a compound score of appetitive behavior as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Namekawa et al., 2018</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Lei Jin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers requested more information about the morbidity and mortality following viral infections. As detailed in Reviewer 2's comment #4, the manuscript should include information about how many fish were involved at each stage. This comment is particularly vital because other viral manipulations in zebrafish have had significant technical limitations, and it is important to understand how this new technical approach compares.</p><p>2) After discussion, reviewers agreed that it is not essential to quantify behavior at elevated temperatures. However, the claim that behavior is affected by TeTx (or unaffected by high temperatures) should be removed unless you choose to add quantification, per Reviewer 2's comment #5. If these claims are to stay in the manuscript, they must be quantified more than just the included videos.</p><p>3) While there were mixed evaluations of the sequencing approach to demonstrating cell health, there was general agreement that the extent of conclusions from those data should be modest, given the difficulty in interpreting changes in gene expression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There is sufficient evidence provided that this system can work, as a proof-of-principle, for certain cell types, in healthy adults. Whether it will be a widely adopted and useful approach and toolkit will depend on how efficient the throughput is and on whether the methods are applicable to more difficult circumstances, such as mutant animals. As such, a more complete demonstration of animal health, and a more complete accounting of the efficiency of the approach, should be provided, as outlined in the Public Review.</p><p>Beyond these concerns, we have the following specific suggestion and edits:</p><p>Suggestion:</p><p>The behavior design with the ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator is a nice touch; however, it has been shown that BAPTA has some toxicity. Therefore, the authors could expand the discussion for what the toolkit could provide to enhance functional imaging with structural labeling using available ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator lines.</p><p>Edits:</p><p>1. Please use full &quot;wildtype&quot; for places where &quot;wt&quot; is in the texts, e.g. Line 95, 178, 530. Alternatively, use the full name first, then use the abbreviated version later.</p><p>2. As mentioned above, the conclusion/data interpretation on Line73-74 is not optimal for showing increasing efficiency.</p><p>3. Line 58 The design does not support the conclusion containing &quot;or&quot;. In this case, use &quot;…not significantly impaired by virus injection with subsequent incubation at temperatures near 37…&quot;. The treatments were not done independently: 2(viral infection/no infection) x 2(temperature high/low), but in a combination of two.</p><p>4. Line 165-167 The statement comparing modified versions of RV to be less toxic and more popular and VSV to be more toxic and less popular is not accurate and could be misleading for researchers new to the field as they choose a viral tracer. AAV and RV are frequently used because of their utilization in mammals in the past. Zebrafish neural circuit mapping is more recent and less mature. AAV is widely used for anterograde tracing because of its availability and accessibility on the commercial market and the initiatives in mice and other mammals. VSV was recently proposed and mainly used to fill the gap in anterograde tracers in zebrafish. Because VSV is relatively new and has low availability, it is less used. But these factors are not equivalent to the statement of &quot;toxicity.&quot; RVΔG does not indicate the elimination of toxicity, thus does not provide strong evidence to counter that VSV∆G is more toxic (same line in the paragraph). The toxicity depends on the mutation(s) of the recombinant viral vector. In a 2018 paper, double mutation on RVΔGL achieved this goal (Chatterjee, S., Sullivan, H.A., MacLennan, B.J. et al. 2018). In a 2021 paper, M51R∆G mutation in zebrafish (Kler, 2021) and N gene mutation in mice (Lin 2020) achieved this goal.</p><p>5. Line 189 &quot;19'819&quot; -&gt; &quot;19,819&quot;.</p><p>6. Line 310-314 Does this mean that the temperature could be reduced with glycoprotein support? Have the authors examined whether increasing viral titer could also increase viral efficiency?</p><p>7. Line 343: &quot;At these stages, zebrafish the repertoire&quot;.</p><p>8. A close-up of the cell in Figure 2E should be provided. Figure 5A and B, zoomed-in figures have an inconsistent height for the scale bars. A minor suggestion is reducing the scale bar heights for zoomed-in small pictures as the scale bar covers some parts of the labeling. In general, though, the figures are presentable.</p><p>9. Expand the discussion on the following points: stress measure, the period for experiment cycle (particularly during development), virus double exposure, the assessment of how the current titer was selected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript should be written more precisely.</p><p>• Line 94-95: 'This virus did not drive expression when injected into the brain of wt zebrafish (N = 3; not shown)' and Line 593 and 595: 'However, the number of GFP-positive neurons was not increased when EnvA-RVΔG-GFP was injected two (n = 3 fish) or four (n = 3 fish) days after HSV1[UAS:TVA-mCherry] and HSV1[UAS:zoSADG] (not shown)'.</p><p>For the data not shown, please make supplementary figures for this. I think some readers like to look at these details to see whether UAS has a leaky issue or something else.</p><p>• Need to include all p values and the statistical methods in the text if having done these comparisons. For example, lines 56-57: 'Learning was assessed by a standard discrimination score and not significantly different between groups.' Also, line 127-Figure 2F.</p><p>• Line 314-316: 'Transcriptomics and measurements of odor evoked activity revealed no signs of toxicity of RVΔG alone, indicating that transneuronally labeled neurons are healthy even though starter neurons disappear.</p><p>For the method section' Tissue dissociation and cell sorting': 'Briefly, after 3 – 4 days at 36 {degree sign}C, fish were anesthetized.' This means Figure 3's data is from 3-4 days after infection, but the transneuronal tracing experiment used 10 days. These two experiments have a different time length. I think after 10 days cells should be in a different healthy stage, this claim is not solid. The starter neurons disappearing can be from that cells infected with two different viruses or any of gene from these viruses such as glycoprotein. And how about HSV1's toxicity in zebrafish?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A viral toolbox for conditional and transneuronal gene expression in zebrafish&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been revised to address all concerns, and all reviewers support publication. There are some brief textual revisions suggested below. Please attend to those and we look forward to seeing your final submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done an excellent job addressing the previous comments and I have no further concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript includes a new experiment quantifying survival under different conditions and some additional data and analyses addressing some of the reviewers' concerns. There are also some changes in interpretations that bring them more closely in line with the results.</p><p>We raised the issue of whether more infected cells were the result of higher viral efficiency or greater proliferation at elevated temperatures. In their response letter, the authors have provided several arguments for why the former is more likely, some of which are compelling. It would be good to see this issue addressed in the main manuscript so that readers are not left with the same concern.</p><p>The new data for behavior with the expression of TeTx are welcome. The effect is noisy but appears genuine. Given that this is not a core element of the manuscript's advances, we view this issue as sufficiently addressed by the new data. However, the discussion of this result should still include the possibility that these are simply less healthy fish, since the behavioural analysis is shallow. With the current wording, the reader could be left with the false impression that a targeted circuit manipulation has been demonstrated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript is great, and has addressed all of the concerns I had in my last review. The new experiments and data make this work more solid and will convince more researchers using this technology in zebrafish. This fantastic work will facilitate some new fundamental discoveries in zebrafish field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77153.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers requested more information about the morbidity and mortality following viral infections.

The results are reported in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1. Briefly, in adult fish injected with buffer only or with HSV1, survival rates were always 100%, irrespective of whether they were kept at 26 deg or 36 deg. Hence, HSV1, the temperature, or the injection procedure had no detectable effect on survival. When adult fish were injected with Rabies, or when fish received two successive injections of HSV1, survival rates were still 80 – 90%. In larvae, survival rates were somewhat reduced at higher temperature. Possible reasons for this are discussed below. Nevertheless, survival rates were &gt;90 % after three days (the most important time window for most applications) and still substantial a week after injection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) After discussion, reviewers agreed that it is not essential to quantify behavior at elevated temperatures.

Our results show directly that temperature is important for infection. Decreasing temperature will therefore affect the outcome of the experiment. In addition, we discuss that high expression levels of G may be important for transsynaptic spread. This was concluded previously from experiments in rodents and may explain why transsynaptic spread appeared more efficient in our study (which achieved high expression levels using codon optimization and HSV1-mediated expression) as compared to a previous study (which used stable transgenic lines to express TVA and G). We hope that this is clear now.</p><p>As we have used the highest available titers in our study, it was not possible to test whether even higher titers could further increase the efficiency of infection or transsynaptic spread. We believe that this is possible. However, we do not discuss this possibility explicitly because it would be very difficult to produce higher virus titers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

This means Figure 3's data is from 3-4 days after infection, but the transneuronal tracing experiment used 10 days. These two experiments have a different time length. I think after 10 days cells should be in a different healthy stage, this claim is not solid. The starter neurons disappearing can be from that cells infected with two different viruses or any of gene from these viruses such as glycoprotein. And how about HSV1's toxicity in zebrafish?</p></disp-quote><p>The time of incubation for the data in Figure 3 (3-4 days) was chosen to match the expected time of expression in transsynaptically labeled neurons.</p><p>The rationale behind this experiment was to determine potential toxicity in neurons that are labeled transsynaptically. We assumed that most of these neurons are infected with RVΔG but do not express G (the goal of the experiment was not to determine toxicity in starter cells, which is expected to be high because these neurons express G). The results in Figure 4D (right) indicate that the delay between the infection of the starter cells and the expression of GFP in the presynaptic neurons is 6 days or more. Hence, neurons that were labeled transsynaptically 10 days after injection should have been infected with the virus for roughly 4 days or less. In the experiments to assess toxicity (Figure 3), neurons were not transsynaptically labeled but directly infected via TVA (in the absence of G; this was necessary to obtain a sufficient number of positive neurons). We therefore chose 3 – 4 days of incubation to match the approximate time of infection in transsynaptically lableled neurons (Figure 4D). We now discuss this explicitly in the manuscript (Methods: ln 775-780; see also ln 212-214).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been revised to address all concerns, and all reviewers support publication. There are some brief textual revisions suggested below. Please attend to those and we look forward to seeing your final submission.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The revised manuscript includes a new experiment quantifying survival under different conditions and some additional data and analyses addressing some of the reviewers' concerns. There are also some changes in interpretations that bring them more closely in line with the results.</p><p>We raised the issue of whether more infected cells were the result of higher viral efficiency or greater proliferation at elevated temperatures. In their response letter, the authors have provided several arguments for why the former is more likely, some of which are compelling. It would be good to see this issue addressed in the main manuscript so that readers are not left with the same concern.</p></disp-quote><p>A sentence has been added to the Discussion to clarify this point (second paragraph, first sentence): “Effects of temperature on the expression of virally delivered transgenes cannot easily be explained by increased proliferation of infected cells or other indirect effects.”</p><p>Furthermore, we added a sentence to the Results section to highlight one of the results that strongly argue against proliferation as a possible cause for increased expression (Results, fourth paragraph: “Similar expression was also observed when the temperature was decreased from 36 ºC to 26 ºC three days after injection, but not when it was increased from 26 ºC to 36 ºC after three days (Figure 1A, C).”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The new data for behavior with the expression of TeTx are welcome. The effect is noisy but appears genuine. Given that this is not a core element of the manuscript's advances, we view this issue as sufficiently addressed by the new data. However, the discussion of this result should still include the possibility that these are simply less healthy fish, since the behavioural analysis is shallow. With the current wording, the reader could be left with the false impression that a targeted circuit manipulation has been demonstrated.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to stress that “simply less healthy fish” cannot explain these observations, already for obvious statistical reasons. Moreover, fish showing such abnormal swimming behavior in the absence of any treatment would immediately be removed from our fish facility and never enter an experiment. Nonetheless, we included a sentence stating that the mechanism underlying the observed motor behavior is not understood, although the behavioral observation is consistent with the most obvious hypothesis (Results, section “Intersection of HSV1 with the Gal4/UAS system”, sixth paragraph: “These results are consistent with the hypothesis that virally delivered TeNT‐GFP modified synaptic output from GABAergic neurons in the cerebellum, although further experiments are needed to fully understand the mechanism underlying the observed effects on swimming behavior.”)</p></body></sub-article></article>
