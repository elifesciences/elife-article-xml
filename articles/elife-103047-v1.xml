crucial for effective control and elimination efforts. In some endemic regions, malaria is highly seasonal with no or little transmission during up to 8 mo, yet little is known about how seasonality affects the parasite population genetics. Here, we conducted a longitudinal study over 2.5 y on 1516 participants in the Upper River Region of The Gambia. With 425 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genetic barcodes genotyped from asymptomatic infections, we developed an identity by descent (IBD) based pipeline and validated its accuracy against 199 parasite genomes sequenced from the same isolates. Genetic relatedness between isolates revealed a very low inbreeding level, suggesting continuous recombination among parasites rather than the dominance of specific strains. However, isolates from the same household were sixfold more likely to be genetically related compared to those from other villages, suggesting close transmission links within households. Seasonal variation also influenced parasite genetics, with most differentiation occurring during the transition from the low transmission season to the subsequent high transmission season. Yet chronic infections presented exceptions, including one individual who had a continuous infection by the same parasite genotype for at least 18 mo. Our findings highlight the burden of asymptomatic chronic malaria carriers and the importance of characterizing the parasite genetic population at the community-level. Most importantly, ‘reactive’ approaches for malaria elimination should not be limited to acute malaria cases but be broadened to households of asymptomatic carriers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Malaria is a life-threatening, mosquito-borne illness caused by the parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. In 2023 alone, over 200 million people were diagnosed with the disease, and hundreds of thousands died from it. Yet the true scale of the problem is likely underestimated.</p><p>Indeed, most infected individuals do not experience symptoms and therefore do not seek treatment. However, they can still pass the parasite to any mosquito that bites them, thereby contributing to the disease silently persisting within the population.</p><p>These asymptomatic infections therefore complicate malaria eradication efforts, in part because they pose a challenge to studying <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genetics. Controlling the disease often requires a detailed understanding of how different strains of the parasite wax and wane in a population across regions and seasons; without considering asymptomatic individuals, this knowledge remains incomplete.</p><p>To address this issue, Guery et al. studied <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections in four nearby villages in The Gambia for over two years. In this region, a long dry period during which malaria spreads slowly is followed by a short, wet season marked by high transmission levels. The team analysed samples from 425 asymptomatic participants, generating unique genetic ‘barcodes’ for each strain of the parasite they detected. These data were then used to construct <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ‘family trees’ and determine transmission dynamics.</p><p>The analyses revealed a high degree of genetic diversity in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> from this region, which increased during the wet season. This typically indicates high levels of transmission within the population, with frequent mosquito bites increasing the chance of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> strains recombining their genetic make-up. In contrast, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites found in members of the same household were much more likely to be genetically related. This suggests that individuals living together were infected at the same time by one mosquito, or that the insects spread the disease between people living in close quarters. Finally, parasites could persist for over a year for certain asymptomatic individuals.</p><p>These results shed new light on the factors affecting <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spread and genetic diversity, highlighting the role of asymptomatic carriers and household-level transmission. Guery et al. hope their findings will pave the way to more effective malaria control strategies. Mass testing could be important to identify asymptomatic carriers, for example, as well as treating those living with infected individuals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd>genome</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO 016.158.306</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bousema</surname><given-names>Teun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INDIE OPP1173572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bousema</surname><given-names>Teun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC/LSHTM fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Claessens</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009660</institution-id><institution>London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC/LSHTM fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Claessens</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Transversales</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guery</surname><given-names>Marc-Antoine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR 18‐CE15‐0009‐01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Claessens</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EQU202303016290</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Claessens</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Household clustering and seasonal parasite dynamics highlight the need to target asymptomatic carriers for community-based malaria elimination strategies.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria control and elimination efforts require a detailed understanding of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> population dynamics, particularly in regions with seasonal transmission. In The Gambia, substantial progress has been made in reducing malaria prevalence in the first decade of 2000. However, the decline has fallen short of meeting the 75% reduction target set for 2025, emphasizing the need for more targeted interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">World Health Organization, 2023</xref>).</p><p>In regions characterized by seasonal transmission, malaria clinical cases peak towards the end of the wet season, a pattern mirrored in The Gambia’s transmission cycle. Its climate is characterized by a rainy season from late June to September, followed by a ~8-mo-long dry season, typically without rainfall. Malaria cases are almost exclusively reported from September to December (the high transmission season), while malaria is virtually absent for the remaining 8 mo (the low transmission season) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ceesay et al., 2008</xref>). During the high transmission season, malaria disproportionately affects rural, low-income populations in the eastern regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mwesigwa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mwesigwa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonko et al., 2014</xref>). Understanding how the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasite population adapts to these seasonal variations is critical for informing targeted malaria elimination strategies.</p><p>Evidence suggests that imported cases play a minor role in maintaining malaria transmission, with the resurgence of malaria attributed to a persistent reservoir of asymptomatic chronic carriers that bridge two transmission seasons separated by several months of low to no transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daniels et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fola et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gwarinda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sy et al., 2022</xref>). Previous studies in The Gambia and neighboring Senegal demonstrated that individuals can harbor persistent infections across transmission seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2022</xref>), with some infections maintaining transmissible gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andolina et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barry et al., 2021</xref>). This reservoir of asymptomatic infections represents a major challenge to malaria control programs.</p><p>Various molecular methods and metrics are now available to characterize the parasite genetic diversity. At the population level, the average COI—the number of distinct parasite genotypes within a host—is often used to infer transmission intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daniels et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hendry et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nkhoma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pacheco et al., 2020</xref>). Genetic relatedness is assessed through Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) or the cost-effective molecular barcode genotyping, the latter able to identify a unique parasite strain with as few as 24 loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daniels et al., 2008</xref>). From pairwise distances between such barcodes, it has been shown that relatedness tends to decrease with time and distance of the sampled infections both at the national level in The Gambia and at the local level in neighboring Senegal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amambua-Ngwa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Population-level genetic analyses, particularly using IBD, provide a powerful tool for exploring parasite relatedness and recent recombination events. While Fst-based studies are valuable for long-term and large-scale comparisons, IBD allows for the resolution of recent recombination events, shedding light on fine-scale spatio-temporal transmission dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mobegi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noviyanti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Extensive genomic epidemiology studies to date focused on clinical cases, yet such symptomatic cases only represent a minority of all <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lindblade et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stone et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, relying exclusively on clinical cases may lead to miss a substantial fraction of the actual parasite population diversity.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genetic diversity in four nearby villages of The Gambia’s Upper River Region through a longitudinal study spanning 2.5 y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fogang et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Using a combination of molecular genotyping and whole genome sequencing, we constructed a high-quality pipeline to assess COI and genetic relatedness at the community-level. We aimed to elucidate how seasonal transmission cycles shape parasite population structure, including the stability of COI, the spatio-temporal patterns of IBD, the persistence of drug resistance alleles, and the contribution of asymptomatic chronic carriers to sustained transmission. These findings provide insights into the dynamics of parasite recombination and the genetic adaptations required for persistence in seasonal transmission settings.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Combined barcode and whole genome analysis pipeline</title><p>Overall, 5322 fingerprick and 253 venous blood samples were collected from 1516 individuals aged 3–85 y in four nearby villages of the Upper River Region of The Gambia between December 2014 and May 2017, as detailed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp1">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fogang et al., 2024</xref>).

However, when barcodes were sampled more than 2 mo apart, the correlation between genetic relatedness and sampling location disappeared. Altogether, the overall low inbreeding combined with the increased proportion of related isolates within the same household indicate a scenario in which the same infectious mosquito infected two or more individuals living together, or a direct transmission chain between two household members.</p><p>The impact of seasonality on the parasite inbreeding level was assessed by comparing the proportion of related barcodes (IBD ≥0.5) between groups of collection dates within or between transmission seasons. Barcodes sampled during the high transmission seasons of 2014, 2015, and 2016, as well as the low transmission seasons of 2015 and 2016, were grouped into intraseasonal pairs if they were collected during the same season or interseasonal pairs otherwise. This resulted in 5 groups for intraseasonal pairs and 10 groups for interseasonal pairs, with the most distant groups (high 2014 and high 2016) being four seasons apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, pairs of collection dates close in time exhibited greater similarity than more distant collection dates. This suggests a continuous recombination process among all parasites, rather than the transmission of one or more specific strains. To determine the specific time of the year the average genetic relatedness declines, the proportion of related barcodes was compared between pairs of sample collections from the same season or one season apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Parasites from the ‘low to high’ group exhibited the lowest average proportion of related barcodes (average relatedness of 0.006) compared with the ‘within high’ (average relatedness of 0.026, Welch’s t-test value = 3.14, p-value &lt; 0.01), ‘within low’ (average relatedness of 0.024, Welch’s t-test value = 2.35, p-value &lt; 0.05) and ‘high to low’ (average relatedness of 0.024, Welch’s t-test value = 4.87, p-value &lt;0.001) groups all displaying a fourfold higher genetic relatedness. Here, most of the parasite differentiation occurs during the transition from the low transmission season to the subsequent high transmission season. This corresponds to the increase in transmission rate at the onset of the high transmission season, with parasite genomes being reshuffled after sexual reproduction in the mosquito.

Achieving this goal is difficult as it requires whole genome sequencing followed by a deconvolution tool such as DEploid, with the caveat that the different strains are not too related or too rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nkhoma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>).

However, previous findings tend to indicate a limited effect of imported cases on maintaining transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daniels et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fola et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gwarinda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sy et al., 2022</xref>). Future studies will require recruiting a larger number of participants with more frequent samplings.</p><p>A follow-up study carried out in rural villages of eastern Gambia between 2012 and 2016 reported that roughly half of asymptomatic infected individuals at the end of the wet season were still infected at the end of the dry season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2023</xref>). We previously reported a similar rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2022</xref>). We showed that parasites collected during the dry season share significantly more genetic similarity with those from the previous wet season than those from the next wet season. Average relatedness quickly declined with the temporal distance between samplings (10-fold lower after 1 y), probably due to active genetic recombinations in the population leading to fewer fragments in IBD over time. A study conducted in Colombia (with a 10-fold lower malaria prevalence than in The Gambia) showed that a 10-fold decrease in genetic similarity was reached in 9 y while we observed the same decrease after just 1 y in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Echeverry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Most infections were sub-microscopic, which is typically observed when prevalence falls below 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fogang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Slater et al., 2019</xref>). These low-density infections that may persist for months are typically asymptomatic unless the host immune system is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashley and White, 2014</xref>). In this study, the infection with the longest duration was in an asymptomatic individual aged between 5 and 9 y in which it persisted as the same parasite strain for one and a half year. School-age children contribute the most to the malaria reservoir through their higher carriage of asymptomatic infections and their ability to effectively infect mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andolina et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bylicka-Szczepanowska and Korzeniewski, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mueller et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the late 20th century, when the malaria burden in The Gambia was much higher, clinical cases from the same household were more likely to be caused by the same mosquito bite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conway and McBride, 1991</xref>). More recently, Ngwa et al. showed that parasite genetic similarity during the 2013 transmission season was inversely correlated with each spatial and temporal distances in The Gambia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amambua-Ngwa et al., 2019</xref>). We also found that parasites sampled in neighbouring households are more genetically similar but only when sampled less than 3 mo apart. Similarly, two other studies observed parasite strains with varying levels of spatio-temporal propagation in Thiès, Senegal, suggesting that some parasites are more actively transmitted than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sy et al., 2022</xref>). These results add evidence that anti-malarial strategies should target all members of a household with an infected individual. Such ‘reactive’ strategies include treatment of a malaria case and all its household members (without testing) or testing all household members and treating if necessary. The impact of reactive strategies on malaria transmission is at best very limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Newby et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okebe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Steinhardt et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stresman et al., 2020</xref>). Based on the sheer size of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asymptomatic reservoir, with parasitemias typically below microscopy or RDT detection level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fogang et al., 2024</xref>), it is not surprising that targeting clinical cases and their immediate families is not sufficient to break the transmission. For a malaria elimination campaign, based on our insights and previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Soremekun et al., 2024</xref>) on asymptomatic infections in The Gambia at the community-level, we argue for mass detection with a highly sensitive method such as qPCR, followed by treatment of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> positive cases and all their household members.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>Starting in December 2014, we recruited all residents from two villages (Madina Samako and Njayel, identified, respectively, with the letters ‘K’ and ‘J’), with two additional villages (Sendebu and Karandaba, identified respectively with the letters ‘P’ and ‘N’) recruited from July 2016, all four villages being in the Upper River Region in The Gambia within 5 km of each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

To estimate IBD, the model requires pairs of homozygous sites between two samples that are referred to as ‘comparable sites’ in this manuscript.

This raises several questions about how this transmission pattern impacts the spatiotemporal distribution of circulating parasite strains, how parasites persist during the dry season, and how asymptomatic infections contribute to maintaining transmission during the low/no transmission season.</p><p>Combining a molecular barcode genotyping using 101 bi-allelic SNPs and SNPs from Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) in a &quot;consensus barcode&quot;, the authors aimed at measuring the relatedness between parasites at different spatial (i.e., individual, household, village, and region) and temporal (i.e., high, low, and the corresponding the transitions) levels by assessing the fraction of the genome having a common ancestry (i.e. Identity-by-Descent (IBD)).</p><p>By measuring the Complexity of Infection (COI) and parasite relatedness by IBD the authors show that a large fraction of infections is polygenomic and stable over time, resulting in a high recombinational diversity. Moreover, they show that transmission intensity increases during the transition from the dry to wet seasons. However, they find that there is a higher probability of finding similar genotypes within the same household, but this similarity rapidly disappears over time and is not observed between different villages. If there is no drug selection during the dry season, and if resistance results in a fitness cost, alleles associated with drug resistance may change in frequency. The authors looked at the frequencies of six drug-resistance haplotypes (aat1, crt, dhfr, dhps, kelch13, and mdr1), and found no evidence of changes in allele frequencies associated with seasonality. They also find chronic infections lasting from one month to one and a half years with no dependence on age or gender.</p><p>This work makes use of genomic information and IBD analytic tools to show parasite relatedness from asymptomatic infections at different spatial and temporal scales, thus providing a better understanding of the transmission dynamics of malaria in highly seasonal environments.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>The authors use a combination of high-quality barcodes (425 barcodes representing 101 bi-allelic SNPs) and 199 high-quality genome sequences to infer the fraction of the genome with shared Identity by Descent (IBD) (i.e. a metric of recombination rate) over several time points covering two years. The barcode and whole genome sequence combination allows full use of a large dataset, to confidently infer the relatedness of parasite isolates at various spatiotemporal scales and show the advantage of using genomic information for understanding malaria transmission dynamics.</p><p>The authors aimed to establish how seasonal transmission cycles shape the spatiotemporal parasite population structure using metrics such as parasite genetic diversity, genetic relatedness, and frequency of drug resistance alleles, as well as the contribution of asymptomatic chronic carriers to sustained transmission. The results support their conclusions.</p><p>Using a combination of molecular barcodes and available whole genome sequence datasets opens new opportunities to understand malaria transmission dynamics in different transmission settings. This allows for data analysis at different spatiotemporal granularities, having a practical utility for identifying malaria control targets and acquiring metrics to evaluate malaria control programs. The development of molecular barcodes using similar SNPs by different malaria control programs would be of great utility to compare and understand malaria transmission dynamics in different settings worldwide.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103047.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This study aimed to examine the impact of seasonality on the population genetics of malaria parasites. To achieve this, the researchers conducted a longitudinal study in a region with seasonal malaria transmission. Over a 2.5-year period, blood samples were collected from 1,516 participants across four villages in the Upper River Region of The Gambia. These samples were tested for malaria parasite infection, and the parasites from positive samples were genotyped using a genetic barcode and/or whole genome sequencing. Genetic relatedness analysis was then performed to explore the findings</p><p>The study identified three key findings:</p><p>(1) The malaria parasite population undergoes continuous recombination, with no single genotype predominating, in contrast to viral populations;</p><p>(2) Parasite relatedness is influenced by both spatial and temporal factors; and</p><p>(3) The lowest genetic relatedness among parasites occurs during the transition from the low to high transmission seasons, which the authors linked to increased recombination during sexual reproduction in mosquitoes.</p><p>The results section is well-structured, and the figures are clear and self-explanatory. The methods are adequately described, providing a solid foundation for the findings. While there are no unexpected results, it is reassuring to see the anticipated outcomes supported by actual data. The conclusions are generally well-supported and the recommendation to target asymptomatic infections is logical and relevant.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103047.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Guery</surname><given-names>Marc-Antoine</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>LPHI, MIVEGEC, University of Montpellier</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Montpellier</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ceesay</surname><given-names>Sukai</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Fajara, Gambia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fajara</named-content></addr-line><country>Gambia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Drammeh</surname><given-names>Sainabou</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Fajara, Gambia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Banjul</named-content></addr-line><country>Gambia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jaiteh</surname><given-names>Fatou K</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Fajara, Gambia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Banjul</named-content></addr-line><country>Gambia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>D'Alessandro</surname><given-names>Umberto</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>MRC Unit the Gambia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Banjul</named-content></addr-line><country>Gambia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bousema</surname><given-names>Teun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nijmegen</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Conway</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Claessens</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>LPHI, MIVEGEC, University of Montpellier</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Montpellier</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript titled &quot;Household clustering and seasonal genetic variation of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> at the community-level in The Gambia&quot; presents a valuable genetic spatio-temporal analysis of malaria-infected individuals from four villages in The Gambia, covering the period between December 2014 and May 2017. The majority of samples were analyzed using a SNP barcode with the Spotmalaria panel, with a subset validated through WGS. Identity-by-descent (IBD) was calculated as a measure of genetic relatedness and spatio-temporal patterns of the proportion of highly related infections were investigated. Related clusters were detected at the household level, but only within a short time period.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study offers a valuable dataset, particularly due to its longitudinal design and the inclusion of asymptomatic cases. The laboratory analysis using the Spotmalaria platform combined and supplemented with WGS is solid, and the authors show a linear correlation between the IBD values determined with both methods, although other studies have reported that at least 200 SNPs are required for IBD analysis. Data-analysis pipelines were created for (1) variant filtering for WGS and subsequent IBD analysis, and (2) creating a consensus barcode from the spot malaria panel and WGS data and subsequent SNP filtering and IBD analysis.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Further refining the data could enhance its impact on both the scientific community and malaria control efforts in The Gambia.</p><p>(1) The manuscript would benefit from improved clarity and better explanation of results to help readers follow more easily. Despite familiarity with genotyping, WGS, and IBD analysis, I found myself needing to reread sections. While the figures are generally clear and well-presented, the text could be more digestible. The aims and objectives need clearer articulation, especially regarding the rationale for using both SNP barcode and WGS (is it to validate the approach with the barcode, or is it to have less missing data?).

While these are conducted in the same villages, their study design is not the same, which should be addressed in the interpretation and discussion of the results. Between Dec 2014 and Sept 2016, sampling was conducted only in 2 villages and at less frequent intervals than between Oct 2016 to May 2017. The authors should assess how this might have impacted their temporal analysis and conclusions drawn. In addition, it should be clarified why and for exactly in which analysis the samples from Dec 2016 - May 2017 were excluded as this is a large proportion of your samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified which set of samples was used in our Results (Lines 293-295, 316-319). While two villages were recruited halfway through the study, two villages (J and K, Figure 1C) consistently provided data for each transmission season. Importantly, our temporal analysis accounts for these differences by grouping paired barcodes based on their respective locations (Figure 3B). Despite variations in sampling frequency, we still observe a clear overall decline in relatedness between the ‘0-2 months’ and ‘2-5 months’ groups, both of which include barcodes from all four villages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Based on which criteria were samples selected for WGS?

How did this impact the analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>While we acknowledge the potential for bias between samples with a consensus barcode (based on WGS) and those with genotyping-only barcodes, its impact is minimal. WGS does indeed produce a more accurate barcode compared to SNP genotyping, but any errors in the genotyping barcodes were mitigated by excluding loci that systematically mismatched with WGS data (see Figure S3). Additionally, the use of WGS improved the accuracy of 51 % (216/425) of barcodes, which strengthens the overall quality and validity of our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The linear correlation between IBD-values of barcode vs genome is clear. However, since you do not use absolute values of IBD, but a classification of related (&gt;=0.5 IBD) vs. unrelated (&lt;0.5), it would be good to assess the agreement of this classification between the 2 barcodes. In Figure S6 there seem to be quite some samples that would be classified as unrelated by the consensus barcode, while they have IBD&gt;0.5 in the Genome-IBD; in other words, the barcode seems to be underestimating relatedness.</p><p>a. How sensitive is this correlation to the nr of SNPs in the barcode?</p></disp-quote><p>We measured the agreement between the two classifications using specificity (0.997), sensitivity (0.841) and precision (0.843) described in the legend of Figure S8. To further demonstrate the good agreement between the two methods, we calculated a Cohen’s kappa value of 0.839 (Lines 226, 290), indicative of a strong agreement (McHugh 2012). As expected, the correlation between IBD values obtained by both methods improves (higher Cohen’s kappa and R<sup>2</sup>) as the cutoff for the minimal number of comparable and informative loci per barcode pair is raised (data not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) With the sole focus on IBD, a measure of genetic relatedness, some of the conclusions from the results are speculative.</p><p>a. Why not include other measures such as genetic diversity, which relates to allele frequency analysis at the population level (using, for example, nucleotide diversity)? IBD and the proportion of highly related pairs are not a measure of genetic diversity. Please revise the manuscript and figures accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the fact that IBD is not a direct measure of genetic diversity, even though both are related (Camponovo et al., 2023). More precisely, IBD is a measure of the level of inbreeding in the population (Taylor et al., 2019). We have updated our manuscript by replacing “genetic diversity” with “genetic relatedness” or “inbreeding/outcrossing” when appropriate. Nucleotide diversity would be relevant if we wanted to compare different settings, e.g. Africa vs Asia, however this is not the case here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Additionally, define what you mean by &quot;recombinatorial genetic diversity&quot; and explain how it relates to IBD and individual-level relatedness.</p></disp-quote><p>We considered the term ‘recombinatorial genetic diversity’ to be equivalent to the level of inbreeding in the population. Because this expression is rather uncommon, we decided to drop it from our manuscript and replace it with “inbreeding/outcrossing”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Recombination is one potential factor contributing to the loss of relatedness over time. There are several other factors that could contribute, such as mobility/gene flow, or study-specific limitations such as low numbers of samples in the low transmission season and many months apart from the high transmission samples.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the loss of relatedness could be attributed not only to the recombination of local cases but also to new parasites introduced by imported malaria cases. As we stated in our manuscript, previous studies have shown a limited effect of imported cases on maintaining transmission (Lines 72-74). Nevertheless, we cannot definitely exclude that imported cases have an effect on inbreeding levels, since we do not have access to genetic data of surrounding parasites at the time of the study. We updated the discussion accordingly (Lines 497-501).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. By including other measures such as linkage disequilibrium you could further support the statements related to recombination driving the loss of relatedness.</p></disp-quote><p>This commendable suggestion is actually part of an ongoing project focusing on the sharing of IBD fragments and how it correlates with linkage disequilibrium. However, we believe that this analysis would not fit in the scope of our manuscript which is really about spatio-temporal effects on parasite relatedness at a local scale.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) While the authors conclude there is no seasonal pattern in the drug-resistant markers, one can observe a big fluctuation in the dhps haplotypes, which go down from 75% to 20% and then up and down again later. The authors should investigate this in more detail, as dhps is related to SP resistance, which could be important for seasonal malaria chemoprofylaxis, especially since the mutations in dhfr seem near-fixed in the population, indicating high levels of SP resistance at some of the time points.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer noted, the DHPS A437G haplotype appears to decrease in prevalence twice throughout our study: from the 2015 and 2016 high transmission seasons to the subsequent 2016 and 2017 low transmission seasons. Seasonal Malaria Chemoprophylaxis (SMC) was carried out in the area through the delivery of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine to children 5 years old and younger during high transmission seasons. As DHPS A437G haplotype has been associated with resistance to sulfadoxine, its apparent increase in prevalence during high transmission seasons could be resulting from the selective pressure imposed on parasites. After SMC, the decrease in prevalence observed during low transmission seasons could be caused by a fitness cost of the mutation favouring wild-type parasites over resistant ones. We updated our manuscript to reflect this relevant observation (Lines 400-405).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) I recommend that raw data from genotyping and WGS should be deposited in a public repository.</p></disp-quote><p>Genotyping data is available in the supplementary table 4 (Table S4).

This raises several questions about how this transmission pattern impacts the spatiotemporal distribution of circulating parasite strains. Knowledge of these dynamics may allow the identification of key units for targeted control strategies, the evaluation of the effect of selection/drift on parasite phenotypes (e.g., the emergence or loss of drug resistance genotypes), and analyze, through the parasites' genetic nature, the duration of chronic infections persisting during the dry season. Using a combination of barcodes and whole genome analysis, the authors try to answer these questions by making clever use of the different recombination rates, as measured through the proportion of genomes with identity-by-descent (IBD), to investigate the spatiotemporal relatedness of parasite strains at different spatial (i.e., individual, household, village, and region) and temporal (i.e., high, low, and the corresponding the transitions) levels. The authors show that a large fraction of infections are polygenomic and stable over time, resulting in high recombinational diversity (Figure 2). Since the number of recombination events is expected to increase with time or with the number of mosquito bites, IBD allows them to investigate the connectivity between spatial levels and to measure the fraction of effective recombinational events over time. The authors demonstrate the epidemiological connectivity between villages by showing the presence of related genotypes, a higher probability of finding similar genotypes within the same household, and how parasite-relatedness gradually disappears over time (Figure 3). Moreover, they show that transmission intensity increases during the transition from dry to wet seasons (Figure 4). If there is no drug selection during the dry season and if resistance incurs a fitness cost it is possible that alleles associated with drug resistance may change in frequency. The authors looked at the frequencies of six drug-resistance haplotypes (aat1, crt, dhfr, dhps, kelch13, and mdr1), and found no evidence of changes in allele frequencies associated with seasonality. They also find chronic infections lasting from one month to one and a half years with no dependence on age or gender.</p><p>The use of genomic information and IBD analytic tools provides the Control Program with important metrics for malaria control policies, for example, identifying target populations for malaria control and evaluation of malaria control programs.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>The authors use a combination of high-quality barcodes (425 barcodes representing 101 bi-allelic SNPs) and 199 high-quality genome sequences to infer the fraction of the genome with shared Identity by Descent (IBD) (i.e. a metric of recombination rate) over several time points covering two years. The barcode and whole genome sequence combination allows full use of a large dataset, and to confidently infer the relatedness of parasite isolates at various spatiotemporal scales.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary</p><p>This study aimed to investigate the impact of seasonality on the malaria parasite population genetic. To achieve this, the researchers conducted a longitudinal study in a region characterized by seasonal malaria transmission. Over a 2.5-year period, blood samples were collected from 1,516 participants residing in four villages in the Upper River Region of The Gambia and tested the samples for malaria parasite positivity. The parasites from the positive samples were genotyped using a genetic barcode and/or whole genome sequencing, followed by a genetic relatedness analysis.</p><p>The study identified three key findings:</p><p>(1) The parasite population continuously recombines, with no single genotype dominating, in contrast to viral populations;</p><p>(2) The relatedness of parasites is influenced by both spatial and temporal distances; and</p><p>(3) The lowest genetic relatedness among parasites occurs during the transition from low to high transmission seasons. The authors suggest that this latter finding reflects the increased recombination associated with sexual reproduction in mosquitoes.</p><p>The results section is well-structured, and the figures are clear and self-explanatory. The methods are adequately described, providing a solid foundation for the findings. While there are no unexpected results, it is reassuring to see the anticipated outcomes supported by actual data. The conclusions are generally well-supported; however, the discussion on the burden of asymptomatic infections falls outside the scope of the data, as no specific analysis was conducted on this aspect and was not stated as part of the aims of the study. Nonetheless, the recommendation to target asymptomatic infections is logical and relevant.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The manuscript would benefit from additional detail in the methods section.</p><p>a.

We find Figure S1 already heavy in details, adding in more would be detrimental to our will of it being an easily readable summary of our pipeline. Readers seeking in-depth explanation of our pipeline might be more interested in reading the methods section instead. We are very much committed to credit the authors of the tools that were essential for us to create our analysis pipeline. The two most relevant tools that we used are hmmIBD and the Fws calculation, which were both cited in the methods (Lines 148-152, 214-215).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. What changed in the genotyping protocol after May 2016?

We updated the text to include this information (Lines 198-200).</p><p>The rationale behind the discarding of these 21 SNPs for barcodes sampled after May 2016 was that they were consistently mismatching with the WGS SNPs, probably due to genotyping error as mentioned above. However, by replacing these unknown positions in the molecular barcodes with WGS SNPs, 141 samples did recover some of these 21 SNPs with the accurate base calls (Figure S3A). Additionally, we added an extra analysis to assess the agreement between barcodes and WGS data (Figure S3B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Related to this, how are unknown and mixed genotypes treated in the binary matrix? How is the binary matrix coded? Is 0 the same as the reference allele? So all the missing and mixed are treated as references? How many missing and mixed alleles are there, how often does it occur and how does this impact the IBD analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the details that we provided regarding the IBD analysis were confusing. hmmIBD requires a matrix that contains positive or null integers for each different allele at a given loci (all our loci were bi-allelic, thus only 0 and 1 were used) and -1 for missing data. In our case, we set missing and mixed alleles to -1, which were then ignored during the IBD estimation. The corresponding text was updated accordingly (Lines 173-175).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. By excluding households with less than 5 comparisons, are you not preselecting households with high numbers of cases, and therefore higher likelihood of transmission within the household?</p></disp-quote><p>All participants in each household were sampled at every collection time point. This sampling was unbiased towards likelihood of transmission. Excluding pairs of households with less than 5 comparisons was necessary to ensure statistical robustness in our analyses. Besides, this does not necessarily restrict the analysis to only households with a high number of cases as it is the total number of pairs between households that must equal 5 at least (for instance these pairs would pass the cutoff: household with 1 case vs household with 5 cases; household with 2 cases vs household with 3 cases).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Since the authors only do the genotype replacement and build consensus barcode for 199 samples, there is a bias between the samples with consensus barcode and those with only the genotyping barcode. How did this impact the analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>See (6) in the Public Review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. It would be good to get a better sense of the distribution of the nr of SNPs in the barcode. The range is 30-89, and 30 SNPs for IBD is really not that much.</p></disp-quote><p>Adding the range of the number of available SNPs per barcode is indeed particularly relevant. We added a supplementary figure (Figure S5) showing the distribution of homozygous SNPs per barcode, showing that a very small minority of barcodes have only 30 SNPs available for IBD (average of 65, median of 64).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Did you compare the nr of SNPs in the consensus vs. only genotyped barcodes? Is there more missing data in the genotype-only barcodes?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a supplementary figure (Figure S5) with the distribution of homozygous SNPs in consensus (216 samples) and molecular (209 samples) barcodes.

What is the range of QUAL scores in your vcf?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the QUAL &gt; 10000 to make our analyses less computationally intensive while keeping enough relevant genetic information. We agree that keeping variants with extremely high values of QUAL is not relevant above a certain threshold as it translates into infinitesimally low probabilities (10<sup>-(QUAL/10)</sup>) of the variant calling being wrong. We then decided to use a minimal population minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.01 to keep a variant as this will make the IBD calculation more accurate (Taylor et al., 2019). The variant filtering was carried out with the MAF &gt; 0.01 filter, resulting in 27,577 filtered SNPs with a minimal QUAL of 132. With a cutoff of 3000 available SNPs, we retrieved all 199 genomes previously obtained with the QUAL &gt; 10000 condition. The methods have been updated accordingly (Lines 166-170).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Line 161-165: How did you handle the mixed alleles in the hmmIBD analysis for the WGS data?

We updated our manuscript with this correct information (Lines 173-175).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Line 168-171: How many SNPs do you have in the WGS dataset after all the filtering steps? If the aim of the IBD with WGS was to validate the IBD-analysis with the barcode, wouldn't it make sense to have at least 200 loci (as shown in Taylor et al to be required for hmmIBD) in the WGS data? What proportion of comparisons were there with only 100 pairs of loci? This seems like really few SNPs from WGS data.</p></disp-quote><p>There were 27,577 SNPs overall in the 199 high quality genomes. In our analysis, we make the distinction between comparable and informative loci. For two loci to be comparable, they both have to be homozygous. To be informative, they must be comparable and at least one of them must correspond to the minor allele in the population. We borrowed this term and definition from hmmIBD software which yields directly the number of informative loci per pair. By keeping pairs with at least 100 informative SNPs, we aimed to reduce the number of samples artificially related because only population major alleles are being compared. Pairs of genomes had between 1073 and 27466 of these, way above the recommended 200 loci in Taylor et al. (2019). We added more details on comparable and informative sites (Lines 152-160).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Line 178: why remove the 12 loci that are absent from the WGS? Are these loci also poorly genotyped in the spotmalaria panel?</p></disp-quote><p>As our goal is to validate the reliability of molecular genotyped SNPs, these 12 loci have to be removed.

Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>A loci where both alleles are called can result from two distinct haploïd genomes present or from an error occurring during sequencing data acquisition or processing. To distinguish between the two, we empirically determined the cutoff of within-sample MAF above which the loci can be considered heterozygous and below which only the major allele is kept. The corresponding figure was indeed Figure S2 (referenced in next sentence Lines 192-195). We clarified our approach in the methods (Lines 190-192) and legends of Figures S2 and Figure S3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Line 191: How often was there a mismatch between WGS and SNP barcode?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a panel (Figure S3B) showing the average agreement of each SNP between molecular genotyping and WGS.

We added more details regarding comparable and informative sites (Lines 152-160). Indeed, using fewer than 200 loci leads to an IBD estimation that is on average off by 0.1 or more (Taylor et al., 2019). However we showed that the barcode relatedness classification based on a cutoff of IBD (related when above 0.5, unrelated otherwise) was close enough to our gold standard using genomes (each pair having more than 1000 comparable sites). Because we use this classification approach rather than the exact value of barcode-estimated IBD in our study, our 30 minimum comparable sites cutoff seems sufficient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Lines 206-207: which program did you use to analyse Fws?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not use any program, we computed Fws according to Manske et al.

To further support the statement of clustering at the household level, it might be useful to add a (supplementary) figure with the network with household number/IDs as color or shape. In the network, there seems to be a lot of relatedness within the villages and between villages. Perhaps looking only at the distribution of the proportion of highly related isolates is simplifying the data too much. Besides, there is no statistical difference between clustering at the household vs within-village levels as indicated in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, there are too many households (71 in Figure 2) to make a figure with one color or shape per household readable. The statistical test of the difference between the within household and within village relatedness yielded a p value above the cutoff of 0.05 (p value of 0.084). However, it is possible that the lack of significance arises from the relatively low number of data points available in the “within household” group. This is even more plausible considering the statistical difference of both “within household” and “within village” groups with “between village” group. Overall, our results indicate a decreasing parasite relatedness with spatial distance, and that more investigation would be needed to quantify the difference between “within household” and “within village” groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(19) Figure 4: Please add more description in the caption of this figure to help interpret what is displayed here.

That is speculation and should perhaps not be in the results)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is exactly what we think is happening. Due to the very nature of genotyping, only one strain may be observed at a time in the case of a co-infection, where distinct but related strains are simultaneously present in the host. The picked-up strain is typically the one with the highest relative abundance at the time of sampling. As the reviewer stated, fluctuation of strain abundance might not only be due to intra-host competition but also asynchronous development stages of the two strains.

What do you mean by replaced? Did other populations replace the existing populations? I am not sure the lack of IBD is enough to show that the population changed/was replaced. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that the same population evolved. Nevertheless, other measures such as genetic diversity and genetic differentiation or population structure.would be more suitable to strengthen these conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that “replaced” was the wrong term in this case. We rather intended to describe how the numerous recombinations between malaria parasites completely reshaped the same initial population which gradually displayed lower levels of relatedness over time.

Again, the lower parasite relatedness during the transition from low to high was linked to recombination occurring in the mosquito but what about infection burden shifting to naive young children?
