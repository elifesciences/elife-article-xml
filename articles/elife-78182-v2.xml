Contrary to the well characterized function of their SNARE domains bringing the plasma and vesicular membranes together, the level of contribution of their juxtamembrane domain (JMD) and the transmembrane domain (TMD) to the vesicle fusion is still under debate. To elucidate this issue, we analyzed three groups of STX1A mutations in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons: (1) elongation of STX1A’s JMD by three amino acid insertions in the junction of SNARE-JMD or JMD-TMD; (2) charge reversal mutations in STX1A’s JMD; and (3) palmitoylation deficiency mutations in STX1A’s TMD. We found that both JMD elongations and charge reversal mutations have position-dependent differential effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release. Importantly, we show that STX1A’s JMD regulates the palmitoylation of STX1A’s TMD and loss of STX1A palmitoylation either through charge reversal mutation K260E or by loss of TMD cysteines inhibits spontaneous vesicle fusion. Interestingly, the retinal ribbon specific STX3B has a glutamate in the position corresponding to the K260E mutation in STX1A and mutating it with E259K acts as a molecular on-switch. Furthermore, palmitoylation of post-synaptic STX3A can be induced by the exchange of its JMD with STX1A’s JMD together with the incorporation of two cysteines into its TMD. Forced palmitoylation of STX3A dramatically enhances spontaneous vesicle fusion suggesting that STX1A regulates spontaneous release through two distinct mechanisms: one through the C-terminal half of its SNARE domain and the other through the palmitoylation of its TMD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>syntaxin-1</kwd><kwd>syntaxin-3</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>palmitoylation</kwd><kwd>transmembrane domain</kwd><kwd>juxtamembrane domain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>388271549</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>399894546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>436260754</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>27800197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new insight into the role of syntaxin1's juxtamembrane region in controlling palmitoylation and spontaneous neurotransmitter release.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Numerous intracellular trafficking pathways utilize various types of vesicle fusion for that the SNARE proteins play a pivotal role. Similarly, synaptic transmission as a means of neuronal communication employs the fusion of the neurotransmitter containing synaptic vesicles (SVs) with the presynaptic plasma membrane. Therefore, presynaptic vesicular release largely relies on the SNARE complex, in this case formed by the presynaptic neuronal SNAREs synaptobrevin-2 (SYB2), SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1A or syntaxin-1B (STX1), assisted by modulatory synaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rizo, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Both STX1 and SYB2 are integral proteins in the plasma and vesicular membranes, respectively, and their C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) and SNARE motif are separated only by a short polybasic juxtamembrane domain (JMD). By contrast, SNAP-25 is anchored to the plasma membrane through the palmitoylated cysteines in its linker region between its two SNARE motifs. The N-to-C helical formation of the trans-SNARE complex leads to the apposition of the two membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sorensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stein et al., 2009</xref>) in preparation for membrane merger. Additionally, the formation of the cis-SNARE complex on the plasma membrane after vesicle fusion suggests that the SNAREs further zipper into the JMD and TMDs of STX1 and SYB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Risselada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stein et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the merger of two lipid membranes is an energetically high-cost process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Risselada and Mayer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang, 2017</xref>) where the reduction of the energy barrier for membrane merger has been primarily assigned to the modulatory proteins, such as synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martens et al., 2007</xref>). Whereas the role of the SNARE domain zippering is well characterized in vesicle fusion, the roles of TMD and JMDs of STX1 and SYB2 are poorly understood as it is still under dispute whether they are active or rather superfluous factors in that process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Han et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>At this point, it is critical to note that the assumption of the TMDs of STX1 and SYB2 as a passive membrane anchors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>) is not compatible with their presumed β-branched nature that confers a high TMD flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dhara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hastoy et al., 2017</xref>) and is uncommon among integral transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quint et al., 2010</xref>). Remarkably, another feature shared by STX1 and SYB2 but unusual for the majority of transmembrane proteins is that they are palmitoylated in their TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Prescott et al., 2009</xref>) which is shown as an alternative mechanism for TMD tilting and flexibility in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blaskovic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charollais and Van Der Goot, 2009</xref>). Whichever mechanism underlies the oblique position of the TMDs of STX1 and SYB2 in the membrane, it is known that their tilted nature causes their polybasic JMDs to be immersed in the membrane, potentially neutralizing the repulsive forces between the apposed vesicular and plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kweon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Williams et al., 2009</xref>). Conceivably, therefore, the JMD and TMD of STX1 and SYB2 might actively regulate vesicle fusion by reducing the energy barrier for membrane merger.</p><p>Based on this dispute, we addressed whether STX1A plays additional roles in vesicle fusion to facilitate the membrane merger through its JMD and TMD. We created STX1A mutants where the JMD is elongated or modified by charge reversal single point mutations at different positions that lead to altered electrostatic nature. In addition, we constructed palmitoylation deficient STX1A mutants and analyzed the electrophysiological properties of all STX1A mutants in STX1-null hippocampal mouse neurons. First, we found that the tight coupling of STX1A’s JMD to its SNARE domain but not to its TMD is fundamental for neurotransmitter release. Second, and most strikingly, we found that the palmitoylation of STX1A’s TMD depends on its JMD’s cationic amino acids (AAs) and that loss of palmitoylation dramatically impairs spontaneous release while leaving Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release almost intact. Furthermore, we successfully emulated the regulation of palmitoylation of STX1A’s TMD by its JMD and its effect on neurotransmitter release by using other syntaxin isoforms, STX3A or retinal ribbon specific STX3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Curtis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Curtis et al., 2008</xref>). Based on our data, we propose the direct involvement of STX1A’s JMD and TMD in vesicle fusion through electrostatic forces and palmitoylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The level and mode of impairment of neurotransmitter release by the elongation of STX1A’s JMD depends on the position of the GSG-insertion</title><p>The progressive N-to-C zippering of the trans-SNARE complex formed by STX1, SNAP25, and SYB2 sets up the vesicular and plasma membrane in close proximity for vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sorensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stein et al., 2009</xref>). Does the continuity of the SNARE-TMD assembly play a key role in vesicle fusion, and is the distance between the two membranes along the fully zippered trans-SNARE complex important for vesicle fusion? To test this, we followed the classical approach to elongate a helical structure by only one turn, and thus by less than 1 nm. We inserted three AAs, glycine-serine-glycine (GSG), into the JMD of STX1A either at the junction of its SNARE domain and JMD (STX1A<sup>GSG259</sup>) or of its JMD and TMD (STX1A<sup>GSG265</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), similar to the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kesavan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McNew et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mostafavi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>).

On the contrary to the EPSC amplitude, the EPSC charge analysis revealed that STX1A<sup>GSG259</sup> and STX1A<sup>GSG265</sup> had differential effects on the vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Whereas, STX1A<sup>GSG259</sup> completely blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release, STX1A<sup>GSG265</sup> only slowed it down, as expressed by a twofold and more than tenfold increase in the EPSC rise and the decay time, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). This suggests that decoupling STX1A’s JMD from its SNARE domain has more deleterious effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked neurotransmitter release than decoupling it from its TMD. Interestingly, elongation of STX1A’s JMD at either position impaired not only Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked neurotransmitter release but also the upstream process, namely the vesicle priming, as shown by a significant decrease in the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of SVs to ~25% by STX1A<sup>GSG259</sup> and to ~40% by STX1A<sup>GSG265</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). This led to an abolishment of vesicular probability (Pvr) in the STX1A<sup>GSG259</sup> neurons and a trend towards an increase in Pvr in the STX1A<sup>GSG265</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>Once again, three AA insertions between the SNARE domain and the TMD of STX1A had different effects on spontaneous neurotransmitter release depending on the position of the GSG-insertion. Whereas uncoupling of the SNARE domain and the TMD of STX1A by the GSG259 mutation had no effect on spontaneous neurotransmission, uncoupling of its JMD and the TMD by the GSG265 mutation increased the miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency by ~ threefold compared to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Importantly, this shows that it is not only the length of the linker region but also the interplay between the SNARE domain-JMD and JMD-TMD that is important for the regulation of synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked and spontaneous release.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Charge reversal mutations in STX1A’s JMD manifest position specific effects on different modes of neurotransmitter release and on molecular weight of STX1A</title><p>JMD of STX1A, ‘260-KARRKK-265’, consists of basic residues with characteristics of PIP2 binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van den Bogaart et al., 2011a</xref>). In fact, it has been shown that it drives PIP2 or PIP3 dependent clustering of STX1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khuong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van den Bogaart et al., 2011a</xref>) and the inhibition of its interaction with PIP2/PIP3 leads to defects in neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khuong et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, the JMD of STX1A is embedded in the membrane due to the tilted conformation of STX1A’s TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kweon et al., 2002</xref>), setting the ground for a possible role in vesicle fusion through electrostatic interactions with the plasma membrane. Therefore, it is plausible that the position-dependent differential effects of the GSG-insertion might be a result of differential perturbations in JMD-membrane interactions.

For that purpose, we mutated the lysine or arginine residues from AA 256 to AA 265 into glutamate to achieve maximum alterations in the electrostatic interactions between the JMD and the plasma membrane, where K256E served as a control for the effects of net charge difference only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Charge reversal mutations in STX1A’s JMD manifest position specific effects on different modes of neurotransmitter release.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Position of the charge reversal mutations on STX1A’s JMD.

Overall, STX1A<sup>R263E</sup> significantly decreased the EPSC amplitude to ~50% compared to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup>, whereas the other charge reversal mutants only showed a trend towards a 10–35% decrease in EPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, not all the charge reversal mutants led to an impairment in vesicle priming but only STX1A<sup>K256E</sup>, STX1A<sup>K260E</sup> and STX1A<sup>R263E</sup> mutants reduced the RRP size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that the observed impairments in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release and vesicle priming are not simply due to the change in the net total charge of STX1A’s JMD and that the role of its electrostatic interactions with the plasma membrane is position dependent. Additionally, none of the mutants altered the Pvr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, charge reversal mutants in STX1A’s JMD led to differential results in the spontaneous release. Most of the mutants had no effect on the mEPSC frequency and STX1A<sup>R262E</sup> showed only a trend towards a decrease by ~50% with a p-value of 0.46 compared to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the STX1A<sup>K260E</sup> mutant unexpectedly showed a dramatic and significant decrease in spontaneous release as it reduced the mEPSC frequency by ~80% from 5.6 Hz to 1 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This again suggests that the perturbation of the electrostatic interactions between the plasma membrane and the JMD of STX1A affects the neurotransmitter release in a position-specific manner. For a better visualization of the position-specific effects of the charge reversal mutations on release parameters, we plotted the EPSC amplitude, RRP size, Pvr, and mEPSC frequency values normalized to the values obtained from STX1A as a function of the AA position of the charge reversal mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G-J</xref>). Whereas the alterations in the EPSC amplitude, RRP size, and Pvr showed no correlation to the position of the basic to acidic mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G-I</xref>), spontaneous release proved to be specifically perturbed by glutamate insertion at the N-terminus of JMD, that is, STX1A<sup>K260E</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Importantly, the K256E mutation which resides in the SNARE domain and thus more N-terminally to the JMD showed no impact on the spontaneous release, suggesting a specific function for STX1A’s JMD in the regulation of spontaneous neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and J</xref>).</p><p>It is known that the C-terminal lysine residues K264 and K265 in the JMD of STX1A play a more prominent role in PIP2-binding than the arginine residues R262 and R263 in the middle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khuong et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, STX1A clustering through PIP2/PIP3 has been postulated as an organizing factor of vesicle docking and priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khuong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van den Bogaart et al., 2011a</xref>). However, single charge reversal STX1A did not produce a drastic impairment in neurotransmitter release as it would be expected from a mutant unable to mediate vesicle docking and priming. Therefore, it is plausible that the observed phenotypes of single charge reversal mutants might result from a change in the electrostatic nature of the intermembrane area along the SNARE complex and downstream of STX1A/PIP2 clustering. Based on that, we tested how double or quadruple charge neutralization mutations, STX1A<sup>RRAA</sup>, STX1A<sup>KKAA</sup>, and STX1A<sup>4RKA</sup> would affect the neurotransmitter release and observed that the inhibition of the putative PIP2 binding site on STX1A indeed reduced the neurotransmitter release to a greater extent compared to that of single charge reversal STX1A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Both the SNARE domain and the TMD of STX1A have helical structures, whereas its JMD has an unstructured nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kweon et al., 2002</xref>). This might potentially create a helix-loop-helix formation between the SNARE domain and the TMD when STX1A is isolated. It is known that the mutations potentially affecting the helix-loop-helix formation in the membrane proteins can alter their electrophoresis speed in an SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rath et al., 2009</xref>). To test how the charge reversal mutations on STX1A’s JMD affect the electrophoretic behavior of STX1A, we probed our mutants on Western Blot (WB) using neuronal lysates obtained from high-density cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Surprisingly, STX1A’s JMD charge reversal mutations caused not only an apparent different molecular weight on the SDS-PAGE, but they also showed differing band patterns, with the addition of two lower band sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To analyze the effect of the STX1A’s JMD charge reversal mutations on STX1A’s SDS-PAGE behavior, we assigned arbitrary hierarchical numbers from 1 to 6 based on the distance traveled and the number of bands as visualized by STX1A antibody, where number 1 represents the lowest single band as in STX1A<sup>K260E</sup> and number 6 represents the highest single band as in STX1A<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also plotted the weighed band intensity for STX1A for which the lowest band was arbitrarily assigned by 1 × and the highest band was assigned as 100 × as to hierarchically measure the intensity of the bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We observed a correlation between the SDS-PAGE behavior of STX1A to the position of the charge reversal mutations on its JMD with the K260E mutation causing the most dramatic change in the WB band pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). To test whether the change in the WB band pattern of STX1A lysates is only due to the differential velocity of lysine and glutamate in an SDS-PAGE or whether it reflects the presence or absence of a post-translational modification (PTM), we prepared lysates of HEK293 cell cultures transfected with STX1A<sup>WT</sup> and charge reversal mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Strikingly, none of the constructs showed a comparable pattern to the STX1A obtained from neurons, and the band pattern of all STX1A JMD mutants as well as STX1A<sup>WT</sup> collapsed to the level of STX1A<sup>K260E</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-F</xref>). This suggests that STX1A is post-translationally modified in neurons and this PTM is absent in HEK293 cells. Importantly, it also implies that this PTM is regulated by the basic AA residues in the JMD of STX1A in a position-dependent manner. Does the possible PTM pattern on STX1A correlates with the neurotransmitter release properties? To test this, we plotted the EPSC amplitude, RRP size, Pvr, and the mEPSC frequency values normalized to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> as a function of the WB band distribution of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> and charge reversal mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-J</xref>).

A modulatory function for a polybasic stretch has been previously shown as a prerequisite for Rac1 palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Navarro-Lérida et al., 2012</xref>). As STX1A is known to be palmitoylated on its two cysteine residues C271 and C272 in its TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kang et al., 2008</xref>) that neighbors its polybasic JMD, we first tested whether the molecular size shift in STX1A<sup>K260E</sup> is due to loss of palmitoylation. For that purpose, we created either single point mutants STX1A<sup>C271V</sup> or STX1A<sup>C272V</sup> or a double point mutant STX1A<sup>CC271,272VV</sup> (STX1A<sup>CVCV</sup>) and probed them on SDS-PAGE in comparison to STX1A<sup>WT</sup> and STX1A<sup>K260E</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

This suggests that the size shift in the charge reversal mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) might indeed be due to the impairments in palmitoylation of either cysteine residues (middle bands) or both (lowest band).

The lysates of STX1-null neuronal cultures were transduced with STX1A<sup>WT</sup>, STX1A<sup>K260E</sup>, and STX1A<sup>CVCV</sup> that were N-terminally tagged with FLAG epitope. The lysates of non-transduced STX1-null neuronal cultures were used as a control. During cell lysis, the lysates were additionally treated with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) solution to block the free thiol groups. STX1 was then pulled down using anti-FLAG magnetic beads. The beads that were attached to STX1 were then incubated in a solution either with or without HAM and subsequently with biotin solution. Now, the covalently bound biotin to the free thiols were exposed after HAM cleavage of the thioester bonds between the palmitate and cysteine and could then be detected by WB using streptavidin antibody. A positive biotin band was detected only in STX1A<sup>WT</sup> which was treated with the HAM solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

For that purpose, we created STX1A mutants in which the lysine K260 on STX1A was exchanged either with a neutral and small alanine (K260A), a neutral glutamine (K260Q) which is more similar to glutamate, or with an arginine (K260R) which is basic. Whereas STX1A<sup>K260A</sup> produced a banding pattern on SDS-PAGE with two lower bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) similar to STX1A<sup>R262E</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), STX1A<sup>K260Q</sup> produced three bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) similar to STX1A<sup>K264E</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Indeed, we observed that STX3B<sup>E259K</sup> showed a higher molecular weight compared to that of STX3B<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This is consistent with the expected palmitoylation deficiency of STX3B<sup>WT</sup> due to the presence of a glutamate at the position which corresponds to K260 in STX1A. Before proceeding with our electrophysiological recordings, we also assessed the expression level of STX3B<sup>E259K</sup> relative to the expression of STX3B<sup>WT</sup>. We determined that both constructs are exogenously expressed at comparable levels at Bassoon-positive puncta when lentivirally introduced into STX1-null neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). Endogenous expression of STX3B in STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons did not produce a measurable signal at the exposure times of the excitation wavelength used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested how the replacement of STX1s either with STX3B<sup>WT</sup> or STX3B<sup>E259K</sup> affects the neurotransmitter release by measuring the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked and spontaneous release and the RRP of the SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E-I</xref>). STX3B<sup>WT</sup> was unable to rescue neither the form of neurotransmitter release nor vesicle priming in STX1-null neurons, deeming it dysfunctional in conventional synapses even though it efficiently mediates the neurotransmitter release from retinal ribbon synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E-I</xref>). Surprisingly, the E259K mutation served as a molecular on-switch for STX3B as STX3B<sup>E259K</sup> fully rescued both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release with normal release kinetics and spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E, F and I</xref>). However, the size of the RRP in STX3B<sup>E259K</sup> neurons remained at ~50% of that observed in STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), which then led to an increased Pvr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).

Here we created STX3A mutants in which either two cysteine residues were incorporated into its TMD (STX3A<sup>CC</sup>) or where the ‘KARRKK’ sequence was introduced into its JMD (STX3A<sup>LINK</sup>) to transmute the region of STX3A into STX1A-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Furthermore, to evaluate the interplay between the JMD and the palmitoylation of STXs, we also created two additional mutants in which cysteine and JMD incorporation were combined (STX3A<sup>LINK + CC</sup>) or where the whole region spanning the JMD and the TMD of STX3A was exchanged with the corresponding region of STX1A (STX3A<sup>LINK + TMD</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><p>We again probed the STX3A<sup>WT</sup> and the STX3A mutants on SDS-PAGE to test for possible alterations in the banding pattern and thereby the palmitoylation state of STX3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Consistent with our proposal that there is an interplay between the JMD of STX1A and the palmitoylation of its TMD, we observed STX3A<sup>WT</sup> produced one single band and that was not affected when the CC or STX1A’s JMD alone were incorporated in STX3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>). However, a combination of CC and STX1A’s JMD in STX3A was enough to reach a partial rescue of the palmitoylation state of STX3A, whereas the introduction of the whole region of STX1A spanning its JMD and TMD effectively reached the full palmitoylation state as manifested by the production of higher molecular weight bands on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>). Whereas we could not detect endogenous expression of STX3A in STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons at the exposure times used for the excitation wavelength tested, none of the STX3A mutations altered their exogenous expression level at Bassoon-positive puncta compared to that of STX3A<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, STX3A<sup>WT</sup>, albeit not being a member of any presynaptic neurotransmitter release machinery, supported some level of neurotransmitter release when lentivirally expressed in STX1-null neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), unlike STX3B<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Whereas the EPSC amplitudes recorded from STX3A<sup>WT</sup> neurons reached ~15% of that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), the EPSCs were significantly slowed down, as shown by a doubled duration of both the EPSC rise and the EPSC decay compared to those recorded from STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G and H</xref>). Introduction of the two cysteine residues or the JMD into STX3A did not lead to any enhancement in the efficacy to support neurotransmitter release, as both the STX3A<sup>CC</sup> and STX3A<sup>LINK</sup> neurons produced EPSCs comparable to STX3A<sup>WT</sup> both in size and kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F-H</xref>). Furthermore, both STX3A<sup>LINK+CC</sup> and STX3A<sup>LINK+TMD</sup> generated EPSCs which were significantly bigger compared to that recorded from STX3A<sup>WT</sup> and which showed only a trend towards a reduction compared to that of produced by STX1A<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Remarkably, the synchronicity of EPSC was rescued partially by STX3A<sup>LINK+CC</sup> and fully by STX3A<sup>LINK+TMD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G and H</xref>) pointing to the involvement of not only STX1A’s TMD in the synchronicity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release but also to the JMD and its palmitoylation. Moreover, neurons in which STX1s were exogenously replaced by STX3A<sup>WT</sup> harbored only a very small RRP and that was not rescued by any STX3A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>) leading to a high Pvr in all neurons expressing STX3A constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, STX3A<sup>WT</sup> neurons spontaneously released SVs at a frequency comparable to that of STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons and introduction of the CC or the LINK mutations alone into STX3A showed no alterations in the mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>). The combination of the linker region mutation either with CC mutation or with the whole TMD enabled the palmitoylation of the cysteines in the TMD that spontaneously discharged the SVs at a frequency of threefold to fourfold of spontaneous release from STX1A<sup>WT</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>). This substantial increase in the mEPSC frequency driven by the palmitoylation of the STX3A’s TMD essentially points to the same mechanism for the regulation of the spontaneous release by the palmitoylation of STX1A’s TMD, as its inhibition either by STX1A<sup>K260E</sup> or STX1A<sup>CVCV</sup> diminished spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). This suggests that the prevention of the palmitoylation of the CC residues in the TMD of syntaxins blocks the spontaneous release.</p><p>As mentioned above, retinal ribbon synaptic STX3B and postsynaptic STX3A are splice variants which differ only at their C-terminus from the layer 0 of the SNARE domain to the end of the TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). The TMD of STX3B is more similar to that of STX1A as the comparative sequence alignment shows that all the AAs at respective positions in the TMD region of STX3B and STX1A share similar or the same biophysical properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the STX3B<sup>E259K</sup>, which can be considered as the active form of STX3B in conventional synapses, did not show higher spontaneous release efficacy compared to STX1A, even though the cysteine residues are present in that mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). On the other hand, STX3A<sup>LINK+TMD</sup>, which has STX1A’s TMD that is now more similar to STX3B, shows an unclamped spontaneous release of SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). Taking these into account, we compared the AA sequences of STX1A, STX3B<sup>E259K</sup>, and STX3A<sup>LINK+TMD</sup> and plotted the mEPSC frequencies as values normalized to the STX1A<sup>WT</sup> for each individual culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). The sequence alignment shows that the STX3A<sup>LINK+TMD</sup> mutant which spontaneously releases SVs at the highest frequency differs from both STX1A<sup>WT</sup> and STX3B<sup>E259K</sup> only in the C-terminal half of its SNARE domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that the C-terminal half of STX1A’s SNARE domain from its layers 0–8 plays a pivotal role in the clamping of the spontaneous vesicle fusion.</p><p>A hypothesis in account of spontaneous vesicle fusion suggests that the vesicles close to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels fuse with the membrane upon stochastic opening of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Williams and Smith, 2018</xref>). Therefore, alterations in the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel gating, such as proposed inhibition of baseline activity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels by the cysteine residues of STX1A’s TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trus et al., 2001</xref>), could lead to a decrease or increase in the spontaneous neurotransmitter release as a result of altered spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx into the synapse. Desynchronization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked neurotransmitter release by STX3A<sup>WT</sup> might be a result of uncoupling of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel-SV spatial organization. In that scenario, it is plausible that the TMD of STX1A plays a role in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel-SV coupling, as its incorporation into STX3A leads to the recovery of synchronous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G and H</xref>). To test whether and how STX3B and STX3A affect the global Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx in their WT or mutant forms, we again co-expressed the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor SynGCampf6 in the autaptic synapses and measured the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx upon differing numbers of APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Interestingly, both STX3B<sup>WT</sup> and STX3A<sup>WT</sup> failed to rescue the reduction of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx in the presynaptic terminals due to STX1-loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>). However, STX3B<sup>E259K</sup> rescued the global Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx when higher numbers of APs were elicited, suggesting that syntaxins might play a role in the gating of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). STX3A mutants did not have any impact on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx as it remained at STX1-null levels even for the mutants that rescued the EPSC synchronicity and led to an excessive amount of spontaneous neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). As the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx in neurons expressing STX3A variants remained low at any AP number compared to that of STX1A neurons, it is likely that the overall Ca<sup>2+</sup>-trafficking and hence Ca<sup>2+</sup>-abundance might be impaired in the absence of STX1 which cannot be rescued by STX3A.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Neither STX3A nor STX3B rescues the global Ca2+-influx back at WT-like level in STX1-null neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The average (top panel) of SynGCaMP6f fluorescence as (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) and example images thereof (bottom panels) in STX1-null neurons rescued with STX1A<sup>WT</sup>, STX3B<sup>WT</sup>, or STX3B<sup>E259K</sup>.

In our study, we addressed whether STX1A plays an additional role in vesicle fusion to facilitate the membrane merger through its JMD and TMD. Based on our data we propose that the JMD of STX1A regulates the membrane merger through adjusting the distance and the electrostatic nature of the inter-membrane area along the trans-SNARE complex. Whereas STX1A’s JMD also determines the palmitoylation state of STX1A’s TMD, the palmitoylation of STX1A’s TMD might directly influence the energy barrier for membrane merger, which is specifically apparent for spontaneous release. We conclude that the JMD and TMD of STX1A function not only as a membrane anchor but are actively involved in the regulation of vesicle fusion.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The role of STX1A’s JMD in neurotransmitter release extends beyond its interaction with PIP2</title><p>The current models of SV fusion have given a significant role to the JMD of STX1A, where it drives STX1A clustering through its interaction with PIP2/PIP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khuong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van den Bogaart et al., 2011a</xref>) and therefore indirectly regulates the spatial organization of vesicle docking as PIP2 also binds to SYT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoyagi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Honigmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Park et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the specific basic residues K256, K260, and R263 that are 3 or 4 AAs apart have the greatest impact on the formation of the pool of releasable vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As these residues potentially reside on the same side of an alpha-helical structure formed by the SNARE zippering, it can be argued that the priming of synaptic vesicles might be regulated through their electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged head groups of phospholipids. Furthermore, it is important to note that the two C-terminal lysine residues in STX1A’s JMD play a key role in PIP2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murray and Tamm, 2011</xref>) as neutralization of both shows a more dramatic impairment not only in vesicle fusion but also in vesicle priming in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and fly neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khuong et al., 2013</xref>) compared to the charge reversal mutations of either K264 or K265 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests that the general electrostatic nature of the juxtamembrane area determined by the JMD of STX1A, as well as by SYB2’s JMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Williams et al., 2009</xref>) directly influences the neurotransmitter release in a process downstream of STX1A-PIP2 binding.</p><p>Our data also show that the function of STX1A’s JMD is not limited to the regulation of the electrostatic nature of the intermembrane area, but also possibly to the coordination of the intermembrane distance along the trans-SNARE complex. The slowing down of the release together with the unclamping of spontaneous release by STX1A<sup>GSG265</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is reminiscent of the phenotype of the loss of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Courtney et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vevea and Chapman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). Through its interactions with the lipids, SYT1 primarily assists the closure of the gap between the two membranes for tight docking of the SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araç et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van den Bogaart et al., 2011b</xref>) and thereby accelerates the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked fast synchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Littleton et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, it is possible that an increase in the intermembrane distance along the trans-SNARE complex by an elongation of the STX1A’s JMD, even by one helical turn that is less than 1 nm, might impair SYT1’s function as a distance regulator in synchronizing the vesicular release.</p><p>It is not clear, however, why STX1A<sup>GSG259</sup> has a more deleterious effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release than STX1A<sup>GSG265</sup> does, but it is conceivable that it blocks the helical continuity of the SNARE complex into the JMD of STX1A and SYB2. This phenomenon of asymmetrical impact on the SNARE-JMD or JMD-TMD decoupling of vesicle fusion is not unique to STX1A as it is also observed in SYB2 mutants where the JMD is also elongated at different positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kesavan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McNew et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mostafavi et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, the helix breaking proline insertion in SYB2 at the junction of its SNARE-JMD, but not at the junction of its JMD-TMD, is detrimental to liposome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2021</xref>) suggesting an essential mechanistic similarity between the regulation of the membrane merger by the JMD of the plasma and the vesicular SNAREs. Given that the spontaneous release was either unaffected or facilitated by the elongation of STX1A’s JMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), it appears that the JMD of both STX1A and SYB2 may contribute to the vesicle fusion by regulating the electrostatic nature and the distance of the intermembrane area along the trans-SNARE complex and the helical continuity of the SNARE complex into the SNARE-JMD in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Palmitoylation of STX1A’s TMD potentially reduces the energy barrier required for membrane merger</title><p>Palmitoylation as a PTM is used for various functions for a wide panel of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Matt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Naumenko and Ponimaskin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Prescott et al., 2009</xref>). First, it anchors soluble proteins, such as SNAP-25 and CSPα, onto their target membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Prescott et al., 2009</xref>), which is generally considered the primary function of palmitoylation. However, palmitoylation of the integral membrane proteins such as STX1A, SYB2, and SYT1, has less defined functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Prescott et al., 2009</xref>). It is known that palmitoylation dependent alteration of a TMD’s length can affect its hydrophobic mismatch status with the corresponding carrier membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Greaves and Chamberlain, 2007</xref>) and therefore it can be utilized for the hydrophobic mismatch regulated transport of an integral membrane protein through Golgi-complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ernst et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ernst et al., 2019</xref>). Based on the same mechanism, palmitoylation can also determine the final localization and the clustering of an integral membrane protein, particularly in cholesterol-rich, thick, and rigid membranes that do not conform to the general properties of TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Levental et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Melkonian et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van Duyl et al., 2002</xref>).

However, such a localization and mobility defect of STX1A would be detrimental not only to spontaneous neurotransmitter release, but to all types of vesicle fusion and vesicle priming. Yet, our palmitoylation deficient STX1A mutants do not manifest a drastic change in vesicle priming and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and chemical removal of cholesterol has been shown to increase spontaneous vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wasser et al., 2007</xref>). This renders the hypothesis of mislocalized STX1A due to the loss of palmitoylation unlikely. As loss of complete or individual palmitoylation sites on SNAP25 does not compromise its proper localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Greaves et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vogel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Washbourne et al., 2001</xref>) but vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Washbourne et al., 2001</xref>), it can be argued that the palmitoylation of the trans-SNARE proteins has a direct influence on the membrane merger.</p><p>A membrane merger is an energetically costly process, and in central synapses, several mechanisms are employed to lower the energy barrier for the SV fusion. These mechanisms include—besides the SNARE complex formation—the concerted actions of SYT1 and complexin (CPX), which confer the central synapse with a spatial and temporal acuity of SV release upon an incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rizo, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the TMD of SYB2 itself can facilitate the membrane merger through its tilted conformation with a high flexibility in the membrane that largely stems from its distinctively high propensity for β-branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dhara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hastoy et al., 2017</xref>). Whether or not STX1A’s TMD, too, shows a higher propensity for β-sheets than for α-helices is not known, but is likely, as it is rich in β-branching isoleucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Remarkably, a similar function in TMD tilting has been attributed to the palmitoylation of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blaskovic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charollais and Van Der Goot, 2009</xref>). In that light, we propose that the palmitoylation of STX1A’s TMD serves as another mechanism for the lowering of the energy barrier for membrane fusion. This mechanism might seem particularly important for spontaneous vesicle fusion at first glance. However, the reduction of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release albeit being small, emphasizes a general impairment in the vesicle fusion due to loss of palmitoylation. This is more evident in the decrease of the vesicular release probability especially revealed by the impairment in STP elicited by a 10 Hz stimulation in neurons that express STX1A single or double palmitoylation mutants as well as STX1A<sup>K260E</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, support for our hypothesis that palmitoylation of STX1A’s TMD reduces the energy barrier for membrane merger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, speculative model) comes from our observation that the incorporation of the palmitoylation substrate cysteines into the TMD of STX3A exclusively facilitates spontaneous fusion even when the rest of STX3A’s TMD is kept unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). According to one line of evidence, spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked vesicle fusion share the same mechanism and membrane topology and thus the stochastic opening of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels enable the spontaneous fusion of single SVs that are in a ‘fusion-ready’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Williams and Smith, 2018</xref>). As STX1A has been postulated to inhibit baseline Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel activity through its cysteine residues in its TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachnoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trus et al., 2001</xref>), it is possible that the reduction of the spontaneous neurotransmitter release might be due to the inhibition of the stochastic opening of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels. We cannot rule out this scenario based on our data. However, our AP-evoked presynaptic global Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx assay shows that the STX3A is unable to rescue the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel abundance and/or activity when expressed in STX1-null neurons in either WT or any mutant form and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx remains smaller than in STX1A-WT neurons even at a high number of AP elicited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Yet, mutant STX3A that has two cysteine residues in its TMD combined with STX1A’s JMD or that has the entire JMD and TMD of STX1A leads to threefold to fourfold increase in spontaneous release. This points to an additional role of the STX1A’s JMD-TMD in the facilitation of vesicle fusion besides its putative interaction with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachnoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trus et al., 2001</xref>). Taking this into account, we propose that natural palmitoylation of STX1A’s TMD and forced palmitoylation of STX3A’s TMD likely increase the number of SVs that more easily overcome the energy barrier for membrane merger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, speculative model).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>STX1A’s TMD is required for the synchronicity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release</title><p>Our studies using the charge reversal mutations on the JMD and the palmitoylation mutations on the TMD of STX1A show that these mutants can reach the AZ, as all of them could mediate some sort neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). However, a potential effect of STX1A’s TMD for fine tuning of its localization is plausible, as the differential distribution of other syntaxins, STX3A and STX4, in the plasma membrane is based on their TMD length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulbarelli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Watson and Pessin, 2001</xref>). Consistently swapping STX3A’s TMD with STX1A’s TMD was sufficient to rescue the synchronous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) suggesting a role for STX1A’s TMD in proper Ca<sup>2+</sup>-secretion-vesicle fusion coupling. However, the TMD of the retinal ribbon synapse syntaxin, STX3B, is almost identical to STX1A’s TMD with only two AA difference in the sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>); further pointing out the importance of the TMD for syntaxins involved in neurotransmitter release either from conventional or ribbon synapses.</p><p>STX3B’s JMD differs from that of STX1A as it resembles the mutant STX1A<sup>K260E</sup> and the STX3B<sup>E259K</sup> mutation, that acts as a molecular on-switch in the STX1-null hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is not yet clear why the alteration of the STX3B’s but not STX1A’s JMD has such a dramatic effect also on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked vesicle fusion and vesicle priming. Yet, different syntaxins might go through different conformational changes due to different intramolecular interactions with their regulatory N-terminal domains. Indeed, STX3B’s opening in retinal ribbon synapses, where Munc13s do not function as a primary vesicle priming factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>), is mediated through its N-peptide phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Whereas such an opening mechanism has not been reported for STX1A, the JMD has been proposed to induce conformational changes on STX1A through interactions with PIP2 which in turn leads to the phosphorylation of its N-peptide on S14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Khelashvili et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Singer-Lahat et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that the E259K mutation’s impact on STX3B as a molecular on-off switch might be due to the opening of STX3B through phosphorylation of its N-peptide.</p><p>Whether or not STX3B is palmitoylated in the retinal ribbon synapses is unknown but the presence of cysteines in its TMD hints at a potential for palmitoylation. On the other hand, it is also possible that the E259 might render the TMD of STX3B inadequate for palmitoylation as in the case of STX1A<sup>K260E</sup>. This raises the possibility of inhibition of spontaneous vesicle fusion in retinal ribbon synapses by the non-palmitoylated TMD of STX3B. This is interesting as the retinal ribbon synapses operate in an essentially different manner compared to the conventional synapses as they predominantly rely on the tonic fusion but not on AP-driven phasic fusion of the SVs. Thus, JMD dependent inhibition of the TMD palmitoylation of STX3B and therefore the blockage of the spontaneous release even at the expense of the full capacity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release might be beneficial for a ribbon synapse to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the tonic neurotransmitter release.</p><p>Our chimeric analysis of the TMD of different syntaxins also shows that besides the regulation of the efficacy of SV fusion by the TMD of STX1A, spontaneous SV fusion is further modulated by the C-terminal half of STX1A’s SNARE domain, suggesting a direct involvement of STX1A in the SV clamp. Which intermolecular interactions regulate the SNARE domain mediated clamping of spontaneous release is not clear, as known interactions of STX1A with the modulatory proteins SYT1 and CPX are shown to be carried out through the N-terminal half of its SNARE domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, this suggests STX1A contributes to the regulation of spontaneous release through two distinct mechanisms: one is inhibitory through its C-terminal half of the SNARE domain, and the other is facilitatory through the palmitoylation of its TMD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal maintenance and generation of mouse lines</title><p>All procedures for animal maintenance and experiments were in accordance with the regulations of and approved by the animal welfare committee of Charité-Universitätsmedizin and the Berlin state government Agency for Health and Social Services under license number T0220/09.

overcome the energy barrier for membrane fusion by assembling into a helical bundle, thus pulling the membranes together. Here the authors have used primary cultures of hippocampal neurons obtained from animals in which the isoforms of syntaxin 1, one of the neuronal SNAREs, are deleted, allowing for the introduction of syntaxin 1a mutants in a clean genetic background. Specifically, the authors investigated mutations into the membrane-proximal region and transmembrane domain of syntaxin 1a and they show that not only charge reversal but also mutations preventing palmitoylation of the transmembrane domain have a strong influence on both spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release. The results add important details to our mechanistic understanding of the late steps in SNARE-mediated exocytosis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78182.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Jahn</surname><given-names>Reinhard</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03e76ya46</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.11.483937">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.11.483937v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All referees were positive about the work and state that it constitutes a significant contribution to the understanding of neurotransmitter release, with the experiments being of consistently high quality. While the reviewers do not see the need for additional experiments, they agree that the manuscript should be carefully re-edited to improve clarity and to make the work better understandable to the reader. Moreover, they comment on specific aspects of your work which require clarification, which are detailed below in the statements of the individual referees.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript contains an enormous amount of experiments that all are carefully analysed and interpreted. Admittedly, considering the complexity of the results, it is &quot;hard reading&quot; even for someone familiar with the field, and many of the effects are not easy to integrate into a coherent picture. The authors deserve credit for being very considerate and careful in the interpretation of the data. While not breaking new ground, the data further refine our understanding of syntaxin in neuronal exocytosis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, this is a well-designed and systematic study that addresses the critical roles of JMD and TMD of syntaxin in neurotransmission. The authors identify a specific role for palmitoylation of syntaxin TMD in regulation of spontaneous release. The results generated by employing gain-of-function mutants are very convincing. Moreover, identification of K260 residues in the JMD for the regulation of palmitoylation of C271/C272 residues in the TMD of syntaxin 1A is a novel finding. However, some points require further clarification.</p><p>1. The study is reported in a rather descriptive manner, therefore, the underlying mechanisms are not always clear. For example, K260E and K260A vs. K260Q and K260R (Figure 6) shows that the PIP2 binding is not related to the role of the K260 residue of syntaxin 1A. I think this point would benefit from further clarification.</p><p>2. The rationale behind the selection of the GSG insertion (Figure 1) needs to be clarified. Why only three residues? And why the specific GSG residues?</p><p>3. The authors should acknowledge that spontaneous – near resting membrane potential – openings of voltage gated ca<sup>2+</sup> channels may be differentially affected by the mutations and such openings are not measured in this study.</p><p>4. A diagram and/or a cartoon summarizing the findings (pointing to the regions of syntaxin and their impact on neurotransmission) would help readers. This would also help alleviate the concern raised in #1 above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript encompasses a comprehensive set of experiments, using state-of-the-art techniques to provide new insight into the molecular context of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. In particular, it is encouraging that Vardar et al. succeed in drawing mechanistic parallels to the mode of action of vesicular SNARE proteins. The results confirm and significantly extend our idea that not only protein-protein but to a large extent also protein-lipid interactions are central for ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven exocytosis and the actual membrane fusion process.</p><p>I have no major objections to the conduct of the experiments and the interpretation of the data. Overall, the presentation of the data is clear and the conclusions are valid.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78182.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript contains an enormous amount of experiments that all are carefully analysed and interpreted.

The study is reported in a rather descriptive manner, therefore, the underlying mechanisms are not always clear. For example, K260E and K260A vs. K260Q and K260R (Figure 6) shows that the PIP2 binding is not related to the role of the K260 residue of syntaxin 1A. I think this point would benefit from further clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the role of K260 in STX1A’s function is not related to PIP2 binding. However, we argue that the differential phenotypes of K260 mutants is not sufficient to show the PIP2 binding is not related to K260’s function. Firstly, all K260 mutants except K260R showed a reduction in vesicle fusion as well as vesicle priming either significantly or with a strong tendency (Figure 6). It is well characterized that a PIP2 binding motif is flanked by a single lysine or arginine residue on one end and double lysine or arginine residues at the other end. Therefore, the rescue of neurotransmitter release parameters by K260R mutant might well be due to the restoration of PIP2-STX1A binding. Therefore, the differential phenotypes of K260 mutants do not exclude the PIP2 binding as the main function of STX1A’s K260 residue.</p><p>On the other hand, we now included the analysis of double charge neutralization mutations of STX1A’s JMD as a read-out of the effects of the inhibition of PIP2-STX1A interaction, even though this interaction still remains controversial. Similar to previous results, we observed that these mutants have more dramatic effect in vesicle fusion and priming. As the single charge reversal mutants have milder phenotypes compared to multiple charge neutralization mutations, we propose that STX1A’s JMD has a function in vesicle fusion downstream of PIP2 binding. We have included this interpretation into our discussion in lines 431-442.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The rationale behind the selection of the GSG insertion (Figure 1) needs to be clarified. Why only three residues? And why the specific GSG residues?</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry if we were not clear enough with our rationale behind our mutational designs. It is well known that inserting GSG residues into a helical structure elongates its length by one helical turn and thus less than 1 nm without altering the gross structure of the protein. Therefore, we used only three amino acids to elongate the JMD of STX1A to reach a minuscule change in the intermembrane distance along the SNARE complex without largely affecting the assembly of the vesicular release machinery. Furthermore, previous studies utilized a similar approach for similar questions and we preferred to employ similar mutations to be able to better interpret our data in the context of known data. We now have clarified this issue in lines 71-77.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should acknowledge that spontaneous – near resting membrane potential – openings of voltage gated ca<sup>2+</sup> channels may be differentially affected by the mutations and such openings are not measured in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our data do not address single ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel opening and the inhibition of the stochastic opening of ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels might well be the reason of reduced spontaneous neurotransmitter release. However, out AP-driven ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx assay show that the STX1-null neurons that exogenously express STX3A in any form have a dramatically lower ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry into the synapse compared to STX1A neurons (Figure 9). This suggests a large decrease in the ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel abundance and/or activity. As mutant STX3A that has two cysteine residues in its TMD combined with STX1A’s JMD or that has the entire JMD and TMD of STX1A leads to 3-4 fold increase in spontaneous release (Figure 8), we propose that the JMD-TMD has an additional role in the facilitation of vesicle fusion besides its putative interaction with ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels. In this light, we hypothesize that JMD dependent palmitoylation of STX1A’s TMD increases the number of SVs that more easily overcome the energy barrier for membrane merger.</p><p>We have discussed this issue more in detail in our discussion lines 516-535.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. A diagram and/or a cartoon summarizing the findings (pointing to the regions of syntaxin and their impact on neurotransmission) would help readers. This would also help alleviate the concern raised in #1 above.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a speculative model for the effects of K260, C271, and C272 in STX1A on neurotransmitter release and the energy barrier for membrane merger (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript encompasses a comprehensive set of experiments, using state-of-the-art techniques to provide new insight into the molecular context of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. In particular, it is encouraging that Vardar et al. succeed in drawing mechanistic parallels to the mode of action of vesicular SNARE proteins. The results confirm and significantly extend our idea that not only protein-protein but to a large extent also protein-lipid interactions are central for ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven exocytosis and the actual membrane fusion process.</p><p>I have no major objections to the conduct of the experiments and the interpretation of the data. Overall, the presentation of the data is clear and the conclusions are valid.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank to the reviewer for their time and insights to evaluate our manuscript.
