establishing the neural circuits that are the basis for several important brain functions. In this study, we acquired high-resolution in utero diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from 140 fetuses as part of the Developing Human Connectome Project, to examine the emergence of thalamocortical white matter over the second to third trimester. We delineate developing thalamocortical pathways and parcellate the fetal thalamus according to its cortical connectivity using diffusion tractography. We then quantify microstructural tissue components along the tracts in fetal compartments that are critical substrates for white matter maturation, such as the subplate and intermediate zone. We identify patterns of change in the diffusion metrics that reflect critical neurobiological transitions occurring in the second to third trimester, such as the disassembly of radial glial scaffolding and the lamination of the cortical plate. These maturational trajectories of MR signal in transient fetal compartments provide a normative reference to complement histological knowledge, facilitating future studies to establish how developmental disruptions in these regions contribute to pathophysiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group

These processes include the migration of neurons along the radial glial scaffold, accumulation of thalamocortical axons in the superficial subplate, innervation of the target cortical area, conversion of radial glial cells into astrocytes, and ensheathment of axonal fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Krsnik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Molliver et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kostović et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kostovic and Judas, 2006</xref>). The challenge for in vivo neuroimaging studies is to disentangle the effect of these different neurobiological processes on the diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) signal, to improve mechanistic insight about the transformation of transient fetal compartments into segments of developing white matter (Kostovic 2012).</p><p>Recent advances in diffusion weighted imaging now allow in vivo characterisation and estimation of white matter development during the fetal period. Tractography has been used to estimate the fetal brain’s major white matter bundles and quantitatively characterise the evolution of the microstructure across the second half of gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bui et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zanin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jaimes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jakab et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keunen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Machado-Rivas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wilson et al., 2021</xref>). Advanced acquisition and analysis methods enable the relative contribution of constituent tissue and fluid compartments to the diffusion signal to be estimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jeurissen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pietsch et al., 2019</xref>). Using this approach, previous work has identified non-linear trends in diffusion metrics over the second to third trimester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wilson et al., 2021</xref>). Namely, we observed an initial decrease in tissue fraction within developing white matter between 22 and 29 weeks, which could be due to the radial glial scaffold disassembling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rakic, 2003</xref>). Subsequently, we observed an increase from 30 to 36 weeks, potentially linked to more coherent fibre organisation, axonal outgrowth, and ensheathment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wimberger et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Back et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haynes et al., 2005</xref>), increasing the structural integrity of maturing white matter. Interpreting these trends is especially challenging in the rapidly developing fetal brain, because of the high sensitivity and low specificity of diffusion metrics to various co-occurring biological processes.</p><p>We hypothesise that the biological processes occurring in different fetal compartments leads to predictable changes in diffusion metrics along tracts, reflecting the appearance and resolution of these transient zones. When a mean value across the whole tract is calculated, sensitivity to the unique neurobiological properties of each transient compartment is lost. For example, in the early prenatal and mid prenatal period, the subplate is a highly water-rich compartment containing extracellular matrix, whereas the cortical plate and the deep grey matter are relatively cell dense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kostović, 2020</xref>). We therefore predict that the tissue fraction would be higher in the deep grey matter and the cortical plate and lower in the subplate. We investigate this by characterising the entire trajectory of tissue composition changes between the thalamus and the cortex, to explore the role of transient fetal brain developmental structures on white matter maturational trajectories.</p><p>We acquired diffusion weighted imaging from 140 fetuses over a wide gestational age (GA) range (21–37 weeks) and use tractography to delineate five distinct thalamocortical pathways. To investigate whether the immature axonal bundles can be traced back to specific and distinct locations within thalamus, we parcellate the thalamus according to streamline connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Behrens et al., 2003</xref>). We find consistent and distinct origins of different tracts, resembling the adult topology of thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Toulmin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Behrens et al., 2003</xref>) as early as 23 weeks’ gestation. We then apply a multi-shell multi-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution (MSMT-CSD) diffusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jeurissen et al., 2014</xref>) and derive tissue and fluid fraction values, charting tract-specific maturational profiles over the second to third trimester. We overlay the tracts on an atlas of transitioning fetal compartments and correlate changes in the dMRI signal across time with critical neurodevelopmental processes, such as the dissolution of the subplate and lamination of the cortical plate. We demonstrate that along-tract sampling of diffusion metrics can capture temporal and compartmental differences in the second to third trimester, reflecting the maturing neurobiology of the fetal brain described in histological studies. With these methods, we provide a detailed, accurate reference of the unique developing microstructure in each tract that improves mechanistic insight about fibre maturation, bridging the gap between MRI and histology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Estimating thalamocortical pathways using probabilistic streamline tractography</title><p>High-angular-resolution multi-shell diffusion weighted imaging (HARDI) was acquired from 140 fetuses between 21 and 37 gestational weeks (70 male, 70 female) as part of the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP).

By overlaying the tracts on the atlas, and corroborating each sampling segment with an atlas region, we could characterise the diffusion properties of the different fetal compartments independent of their change in size across gestation. Tissue fraction values in the deep grey matter and the cortical plate areas increased with GA in all tracts.

In the subplate of sensorimotor and parietal tracts, there was initially a very high fluid fraction and low tissue fraction, which transitions across the second to third trimester, increasing in tissue fraction from early to mid and then to late prenatal. Whereas in the AT, there was a decrease in subplate tissue fraction with GA (and a reciprocal increase in fluid fraction). In the OR, the subplate tissue fraction decreases between early and mid prenatal to then increase again in late prenatal. Highest tissue fractions were generally observed in the ventricular zone, with the lowest tissue fraction in the subplate area. To statistically test if there was a difference between the values in each compartment across GA, we correlated the tissue fraction values against age for each of the 100 sampling points.

We show that these pathways connect to distinct thalamic nuclei, which could be clearly defined at group level even at 23 weeks. To disentangle the impact of different neurobiological processes on diffusion metrics, we characterised the tissue composition profile along each of the thalamocortical tracts as they traverse the different developmental tissue layers of the fetal brain. We used MSMT-CSD to model this fetal DWI dataset because it does not mandate a specific set of b-values. The technique exploits the unique b-value dependencies of different tissue types, and so depends inherently on the characteristics of the tissue in the fetal brain. The distinct properties of different fetal compartments after the application of MSMT-CSD are highlighted by the ODFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>). Readers are directed to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tournier et al., 2019</xref>, for a more comprehensive review of the optimisation process involved to select appropriate b-shell values for the acquisition.</p><p>We found that the spatiotemporal changes in the diffusion signal reflected known developmental processes that take place between the early, mid, and late prenatal period. The early period is characterised by higher tissue fractions in the middle of the tract, where there is a radial scaffold for migrating neurons. As this scaffold dissipates in the mid prenatal period, this is accompanied by a reduction in the tissue fraction in the middle of the tract, and an increase in tissue fraction towards the termination of the tracts as the neurons of the cortical plate mature. Finally in the late prenatal period, we observe the highest tissue fraction values at the start and end of the axis, as the pre-myelination phase of white matter development commences. This study demonstrates how the dMRI signal can be modelled to create in vivo spatiotemporal trajectories which relate to underlying neurobiological properties and are consistent with described trends from post-mortem histology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kostović, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Early embryonic patterning of gene expression and cell division in the thalamus provide a template for specialised nuclei to emerge over the course of development, such that specific cells eventually occupy distinct locations within the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clascá et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nakagawa, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kostovic and Goldman-Rakic, 1983</xref>). Rodent studies labelling the embryonic thalamus demonstrated that there is a characteristic topography of thalamic projections which roughly exists at their time of arrival; anterior to posterior movement along the convexity of the cortex is represented in a medial-to-lateral axis within the thalamus, while ventral-dorsal movement across the cortex is represented in an anterior-to-posterior axis within the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Molnár et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Molnár et al., 2012</xref>). Thalamocortical tracts emerge over the same timescale as the thalamus parcellates and matures into its specialised group of nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clascá et al., 2012</xref>). Although the topography of thalamic nuclei and their cortical connectivity is acquired embryonically, no in vivo parcellation of the thalamus in the fetal brain has been published. Using tract density imaging, we observed that the cortical areas were connected to specific thalamic regions, organised in an anterior-posterior axis. This anterior-posterior representation of cortical connectivity in the thalamus was consistent across the second to third trimester and is in accordance with the topology of thalamic nuclei described in rodent studies and histology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Molnár and Blakemore, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Molnár et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>In addition, our fetal structural connectivity parcellation resembles the functionally derived thalamic parcellation in neonates, supporting the view that there is a strong association between structure and function in thalamocortical circuitry that begins early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Johansen-Berg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Toulmin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcauter et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is worth noting that this thalamic parcellation is dependent on streamline count through a voxel, and in the fetal brain streamlines are prone to spurious detection. This limitation is particularly relevant in the youngest fetuses, where we observe an extremely dense connectome (due to a fixed number of streamlines in a smaller brain) but there are very few coherent axonal bundles, so tracts might be overrepresented in the thalamic parcellation. The topography of thalamic nuclei is also not static during the embryonic and fetal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Le Gros Clark, 1936</xref>), as pulvinar size increases and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus shifts its position from dorsolateral to ventromedial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rakic, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mojsilović and Zecević, 1991</xref>). However, the image resolution of this study and the timespan in development over which this data was collected limit us from visualising these differences across age.</p><p>Recent studies characterising developing white matter pathways using human fetal MRI identified second-order polynomial maturational trends in diffusion metrics unique to this developmental period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wilson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Machado-Rivas et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we replicated these methods with a different group of tracts and found the same U-shaped trends in thalamocortical white matter development. The inflection point at around 29–30 weeks was hypothesised to be the result of the dissipating radial glial scaffold followed by the pre-myelination phase of white matter development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wilson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Machado-Rivas et al., 2021</xref>).

We found that age-related changes in the tissue and fluid fraction along the tracts concurred with histological observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kostović and Judas, 2010</xref>). During the early prenatal period (22–25.5 GW), neuronal precursors migrate along the radial glial scaffold from proliferative zones to their destination in the cortical plate and thalamocortical axons accumulate in the superficial subplate, entering a ‘waiting phase’, forming transient synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ghosh et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kostovic and Rakic, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kostovic and Rakic, 1990</xref>). In terms of the diffusion signal, this strongly aligned microstructure of the radial glia is represented in our results by a higher tissue fraction in the transient compartments containing the most migratory cells (such as the VZ, IZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kostović and Judas, 2010</xref>). Conversely, we observe the lowest tissue fraction in the early prenatal SP, which predominantly contains hydrophilic extracellular matrix, as demonstrated by rodent and non-human primate studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allendoerfer and Shatz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Molnár and Hoerder-Suabedissen, 2016</xref>).</p><p>By the mid prenatal period (26–31.5 weeks), we observe increased tissue fraction in the cortical plate, coinciding with the innervation of the cortical plate by thalamocortical axons, increasing soma volume and dendritic branching of CP neurons and CP synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huttenlocher, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mrzljak et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huttenlocher and Dabholkar, 1997</xref>). We also observe increased tissue fraction in the SP zone in the mid prenatal period, consistent with histological observations of increased coherence of axonal fibres between cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). The tissue fraction in the VZ and IZ decreases compared to the early prenatal period, corresponding to the timeframe when the radial glial scaffold dissipates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kinney et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Back et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haynes et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>From the mid to late prenatal period, there is a marked increase in tissue fraction in last third of the axis between thalamus and cortex. By this point in development, the radial glia have converted into oligodendrocyte precursor cells which ensheath the axonal fibres to commence pre-myelination, enhancing the structural integrity of the fibre pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Back et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Back et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haynes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kinney et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kinney et al., 1994</xref>). A previous study in perinatal rabbits has shown that this oligodendrocyte lineage progression correlates with diffusion metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Drobyshevsky et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting it is likely to contribute to the increased tissue fraction we observe in the late prenatal period. The tissue fraction increase in the CP area is consistent in time with the lamination of the CP, the elaboration of thalamocortical terminals in layer IV, and a rapid growth of basal dendrites of layer III and V pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kostović and Jovanov-Milosević, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Krsnik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Molliver et al., 1973</xref>). These high tissue fraction values at the origin and termination of the tracts suggest co-maturation between ascending and descending pathways between the thalamus and cortex to eventually form continuous, structurally mature fibre bundles. This concept was proposed in the 1990s by Blakemore and Molnar, termed the ‘handshake hypothesis’. They suggested that thalamocortical pathways ascending through the internal capsule project to their cortical targets with assistance from reciprocal descending cortical pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Molnár and Blakemore, 1995</xref>). We hypothesise that continuing this analysis over subsequent weeks into the neonatal period would lead to an increasing tissue fraction in the middle of the axis, as fibre bundles become more uniformly structurally mature and the subplate completely resolves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kinney et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haynes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kostović and Jovanov-Milosević, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We observed that tracts terminating superiorly (motor, sensory, and parietal) shared very similar trajectories in the early, mid, and late periods. However, the OR and the AT had more distinct trajectories. The microstructural change along the AT suggests increasing tissue fraction between the deep grey matter, VZ and IZ. We hypothesise that the high tissue fraction in the IZ is due to densely packed ascending and descending bundles within the anterior limb of the internal capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Emos et al., 2022</xref>). The precise timeline for outgrowth and intermingling of the thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections remains ambiguous, and appears to be different between rodents and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alzu’bi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, the OR traverses the deep parietal lobe along the border of the lateral ventricle and has smoother transitions in tissue fraction between the fetal compartments. This is likely due to the tract area running more parallel to the tissue interfaces. Another explanation for the regional differences in microstructural properties is the variation in subplate remnants. In the late prenatal trajectories, all tracts except the OR have a large dip in tissue fraction along the tract. In the primary visual cortex, the subplate disappears during the final weeks of gestation, whereas in the somatosensory cortex there are still subplate neurons present in term-born neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kostovic and Rakic, 1990</xref>) and the subplate of the pre-frontal associative cortex gradually disappears over the 6 postnatal months. Therefore, the peaks of fluid fraction in the frontal and sensory trajectories might reflect the lasting presence of subplate in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kostović and Jovanov-Milosević, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kostovic and Rakic, 1990</xref>).</p><p>There are several important considerations to our work which may limit the interpretation of our findings. MRI has an inherently low signal:noise ratio as signal attenuation is deliberately introduced and EPI acquisitions are highly susceptible to motion and distortion artefacts. Furthermore, the biophysical properties of the fetal environment introduce a series of additional inter-dependent challenges for acquiring high-quality dMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christiaens et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christiaens et al., 2019b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tournier et al., 2020</xref>). In utero imaging methods must adapt and account for unpredictable, sometimes abrupt motion of fetus, in addition to the motion introduced by maternal breathing. Achieving even coverage of the magnetic coil is challenging due to varying fetal and maternal positions inside the scanner, introducing unique bias fields for every subject. The dHCP acquisition protocol and pre-processing pipelines have incorporated dynamic distortion and motion correction algorithms that were designed to specifically tackle the unique artefacts-associated imaging fetuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deprez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cordero-Grande et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cordero-Grande et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christiaens et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christiaens et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hutter et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Price et al., 2019</xref>). However, even after the extensive correction procedures, there is still some residual motion and distortion in the data. For a more extensive and comprehensive review of challenges associated specifically with in utero diffusion imaging and constructive suggestions to address them, readers are directed to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christiaens et al., 2019b</xref>.</p><p>The conclusions that can be drawn from analysing the diffusion MR signal are limited more generally by the level of noise and lack of directionality in the signal, and therefore we are not able to distinguish between ascending and descending thalamic projections as they develop. The fibre-tracking process itself is also very sensitive to the residual motion and distortion in fetal data, producing highly variable results in terms of streamline count per tract. Therefore, the metrics generally used in this field to investigate fibre bundle morphology, such as streamline count, a proxy for ‘innervation density’, are not an accurate, quantitative measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Calamante, 2019</xref>) and cannot be reliably used to assess fibre morphology. Consequently, we have just used tractography to delineate regions of interest and used the signal contrast in the diffusion maps to quantify microstructure.</p><p>The methods described allow the direct study of the maturational effects of the subplate and intermediate zones, which are known to represent critical substrates for early synaptogenesis and the spatial guidance of thalamocortical axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ghosh et al., 1990</xref>). Damage to this essential structural framework for developing cortical circuitry has been implicated in the origins of numerous developmental disorders and is suspected to underly the altered structural and functional connectivity of the thalamus in preterm infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Back and Volpe, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Volpe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Volpe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hüppi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Counsell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hadders-Algra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mathur and Inder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Toulmin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ball et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ball et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore critical to use clinically relevant tools, such as in utero MRI, to relate the microstructural properties of these transient fetal compartments to neurobiological processes. This improves mechanistic insight about both healthy white matter maturation and the developmental origins of white matter pathologies.</p><p>With this study we explore the development of thalamocortical white matter by quantifying microstructure in the different layers of the fetal brain. Using diffusion metrics, we characterise the emergence of structural connectivity from the thalamus to spatially and functionally distinct cortical brain regions. We observe correlations between the transitioning tissue components and key neurobiological processes in white matter development. By providing a detailed normative reference of MR signal change during the second to third trimester, this will help future studies to identify if the tissue properties of specific compartments are affected by preterm birth or other perinatal injury.

This suggests that our sample is representative, and our results should be generalisable across the London population.

This work demonstrates that there is a marked loss of signal at higher b-shells (&gt;1000 s/mm<sup>3</sup>) in the neonatal brain compared to adults, due to the tissue being inherently much less restricted. There is also increased noise at higher b-shells. Both issues are amplified in the fetal brain, there are long relaxation times in the water-rich, relatively unrestricted fetal brain tissues and the amount of noise is higher.</p><p>To demonstrate the suitability of MSMT-CSD for this dataset, an important consideration is that the MSMT-CSD approach doesn’t mandate a specific set of b-values which are required for the modelling process, only that there are multiple shells in addition to b=0. The technique depends on the signals related to different tissue types having sufficiently distinct behaviours across the b-values sampled, and so depends inherently on the characteristics of the tissue.

Some clarification regarding the validity of these approaches given the sequences used (e.g., in consideration of Tournier, et al., 2013), e.g., including citing prior studies demonstrating validity for a similar range of b-values, would lend support to the application of these analyses to the current data set.</p><p>Assessment of the location-specific developmental effects is accomplished by normalizing each tract on a 0-100 scale between the thalamus and cortex. Does this normalization, in the context of an expanding brain, imply that a given point may be comparatively closer to the terminal zone at different ages? Could this account for (all or some of the) age-related changes in microstructure identified (i.e., if certain features are age-invariant with respect to absolute, rather than relative, position along the tract)? Demonstrating that group differences persist when selecting (e.g.) constant length segments at the ends and middle of each tract would help rule out brain size-induced topographic change as driving these effects (though other statistical approaches could likely also accomplish this).</p><p>I'm unsure what statistics support conclusions regarding position-specific differences in tissue fraction. E.g., the discussion summarizes that &quot;the early period is characterized by higher tissue fractions in the middle of the [thalamocortical] tract&quot;. While this appears likely based on visual inspection of the tracts in Figure 5, it is not clear what specific statistical analyses support this inference. Further, given that differences were assessed both as a function of GA (though perhaps exclusively by group) and as a function of distance, some degree of multiple comparison correction is probably warranted, but not currently employed (or at least, not described).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>First, I would like to commend the authors on a thoughtful, creative combination of histological maps and dMRI data. One of the major challenges of fetal neuroimaging work is understanding how co-occurring and dynamic neurobiological processes contribute to metrics derived from in vivo imaging. The present study presents an exciting model for contextualizing dMRI findings in relation to what we know about brain development from histology studies. The following recommendations are offered with the hope that they can strengthen an already exceptional paper:</p><p>1. Please provide a table with sociodemographic information about the sample. This information is necessary for determining the representativeness of the sample, inferring the generalizability of the present findings, and working towards appropriate diversification of developmental neuroscience as a field. Given that age-related change is the primary question of interest, it would also strengthen the study to show that fetuses of different ages do not systematically differ from one another in terms of other factors that may alter developmental trajectories.</p><p>2. The manuscript would benefit from more detail regarding motion correction. The authors describe using slice-to-volume motion correction (SHARD) and implementing quality control based on slice dropouts and gradient of motion parameters. However, additional information is required to enhance transparency and aid future replication efforts. What cut-offs were used to determine whether to include vs. exclude a subject? How many fetuses were excluded based on the selected quality control thresholds? Can the authors please provide more information about the visual assessment that was conducted? Were post-processing motion parameters correlated with tissue or fluid fraction values or with fetal age? It would also be helpful to include visual examples of residual or uncorrected artefacts that resulted in subject exclusion, even if only in the supplemental materials. Finally, Christiaens et al., 2021 is cited several times in the text (including in reference to preprocessing techniques used for correcting head motion) but is not included in the reference list.</p><p>3. What size were the along-tract analysis segments and how was this segment size selected? Showing the results replicate (or don't) with different segment sizes would show the robustness of results and could inform an ideal resolution at which to examine tissue maturation in the fetal brain.</p><p>4. Additional analyses that show the primary findings do not replicate with noise data but do replicate across different preprocessing choices would enhance rigor, especially since the field of fetal neuroimaging lacks a widely agreed-upon set of best practices. For instance, if segments from the along-tract analysis are scrambled, does the outward-to-inward maturational trajectory disappear? The disappearance of associations with scrambled data would enhance confidence that this finding is not simply a byproduct of the way the data were preprocessed. In addition, showing the results replicate following different preprocessing choices would aid in showing effect robustness.</p><p>5. Several studies have identified sex differences in fetal brain maturation. Given the even split in the present sample, examining whether tissue maturation trajectories differ by fetal sex would be informative. I wonder if the authors would consider adding this analysis.</p><p>6. The limitations of fetal dMRI should be clearly described in the discussion to aid reader interpretation.</p><p>7. It would improve manuscript readability to clarify why the authors believe it is important to report both tissue and fluid fractions. They appear to be reciprocals of one another so the added value of reporting both is unclear.</p><p>8. I would avoid subjective phrases like &quot;thalamocortical connections represent the most important inputs into the developing cortex&quot; and instead use more neutral language like &quot;thalamocortical connections play a key role in guiding…&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, this is a very valuable study with excellent datasets. The material provides a unique and detailed description of the changes in microstructure in the thalamus and cortex. I am very supportive of publication, but I feel that more could have been done to bridge the gap between MRI and histology and to link the results to the basic principles of thalamocortical development.</p><p>Criticisms:</p><p>1. Using tract density imaging, the authors observed that the cortical areas were connected to specific thalamic regions, organised in an anterior-posterior axis. This anterior-posterior representation of cortical connectivity in the thalamus was consistent with previous descriptions in rodent thalamocortical connectivity in rodent. However, the relationship between the cortical surface and the volume of the developing thalamus is not explained clearly. In their studies, Molnar and Blakemore emphasized that at the time of arrival, the thalamic projections are already arranged according to rough topography. Anterior to posterior movement along the convexity of the cortex represented a medial-to-lateral movement of labelling in the embryonic rodent thalamus. Ventral to dorsal movement in the cortex resulted in an anterior-to-posterior movement within the thalamus https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.18-15-05723.1998; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.08119.x. It would be good to improve Figure 3 and represent the overall pattern. The very general pattern should be described. Could the thalamic volumes be color coded and the same fainter shade used on the convexity of the cortex of the 3D outline of the brain?</p><p>2. The study does not attempt to link the thalamic fibre topography to the histological structure of the thalamus. Thalamic nuclei undergo considerable changes at these early stages, e.g. pulvinar increases enormously and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is changing position from dorsolateral to ventromedial. Such changes were already emphasized in the publications of Le Gros Clark and subsequently Rakic. The authors note that the topography of thalamic nuclei and their cortical connectivity is acquired embryonically, but they do not emphasize the considerable changes in this topography at early stages. The in vivo parcellation of the thalamus is only described as part of the fibre topography, no references are made to the changes in relative positions of the thalamic nuclei, and only the adult similarity is emphasized.</p><p>3. The density of the thalamocortical innervation is not equal across the developing or adult cortex. E.g. retrogradely tracing thalamic projections from various parts of the cortex using carbocyanine dyes, it was observed that the same sized carbocyanine dye can label 3-5 times more backlabelled thalamic neurons from the putative somatosensory cortex than from the visual cortex (see references in Z. Molnár, Development of Thalamocortical Connections (Springer, 1998)). The methodologies and the data would have enabled the authors to compare the parameters of the various thalamocortical pathways that they resolved. It would have been good to include some results and comments on these area-specific comparisons.</p><p>4. The authors found the spatiotemporal changes in the diffusion signal reflected known developmental processes that take place between the early, mid, and late prenatal period. &quot;The early period is characterized by higher tissue fractions in the middle of the tract, where there is a radial scaffold for migrating neurons. As this scaffold dissipates in the mid-prenatal period, this is accompanied by a reduction in the tissue fraction in the middle of the tract, and an increase in towards the termination of the tracts as the neurons of the cortical plate mature.&quot; The fact that these changes can be now resolved with in vivo imaging is excellent, but the data itself is under-analysed.</p><p>The authors correctly describe the possible anatomical explanations for the changes of the signals: &quot;In terms of the diffusion signal, this strongly aligned microstructure of the radial glia is represented in our results by a higher tissue fraction in the transient compartments containing the most migratory cells (such as the VZ, IZ). Conversely, we observe the lowest tissue fraction in the early prenatal SP, as this compartment predominantly contains hydrophilic extracellular matrix.&quot; These are key processes of cortical development and the authors have the material to draw conclusions on the various gradients on the cortical plate and subplate changes. It would have been good to get a feel for these dynamic changes and include some representations of the area-specificity of these changes. Surely the increase of the cortical plate has areal variation and also the increase and resolution of the subplate are also area specific. Measuring and representing these differences would increase the impact of the study. Moreover, it would also open avenues to study left-right and gender differences.</p><p>5. The authors have interesting discussions on the corticofugal and thalamocortical connectivity through the internal capsule. &quot;The microstructural change along the anterior thalamic radiation suggests increasing tissue fraction between the deep grey matter, VZ, and IZ. We hypothesise that the high tissue fraction in the IZ is due to densely packed ascending and descending bundles within the anterior limb of the internal capsule.&quot; The exact timing of the outgrowth, intermingling, and arrival of the thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections are not known, but there are some suggestions that these are relatively earlier than in rodents (https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz056; https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-53860-4.00003-9).</p><p>6.

Some clarification regarding the validity of these approaches given the sequences used (e.g., in consideration of Tournier, et al., 2013), e.g., including citing prior studies demonstrating validity for a similar range of b-values, would lend support to the application of these analyses to the current data set.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that providing insight about the choice of acquisition parameters would benefit readers, as these were specifically optimised for the unique biophysical properties of the fetal environment. We have now signposted the publications that provide detail on the optimisation process used to define the b-shell values used (Tournier et al., 2019 and Christiaens et al., 2019) more clearly in the text (line 451). In essence, these papers demonstrate that there is a marked loss of signal at higher b-shells (&gt; 1000 s/mm3) in the neonatal brain compared to adults, due to the tissue being inherently much less restricted. There is also increased noise at higher b-shells. Both issues are amplified in the fetal brain, there are long relaxation times in the water-rich, relatively unrestricted fetal brain tissues and the amount of noise is higher.</p><p>In terms of the validity of MSMT-CSD for this dataset, an important consideration is that the MSMT-CSD approach doesn't mandate a specific set of b-values which are required for the modelling process, only that there are multiple shells in addition to b = 0. The technique depends on the signals related to different tissue types having sufficiently distinct behaviours across the b-values sampled, and so depends inherently on the characteristics of the tissue. To demonstrate the distinct properties of the different compartments in the fetal brain, we have now included a figure in the Appendix (Appendix 1-Figure 4) showing the signal amplitude per tissue type as a function of b-value, and the ODFs after MSMT-CSD has been applied. We have also provided further detail on the motivation for this choice in the discussion (line 265-271).</p><p>There is a general scarcity of literature in the fetal diffusion imaging field, but to support that the MSMT-CSD model is as valid as traditional approaches (DTI), in our previous work (Wilson et al., 2021), we demonstrated a high linear correlation between diffusion tensor metrics and the MSMT-CSD components when whole-tract averages are calculated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Assessment of the location-specific developmental effects is accomplished by normalizing each tract on a 0-100 scale between the thalamus and cortex. Does this normalization, in the context of an expanding brain, imply that a given point may be comparatively closer to the terminal zone at different ages? Could this account for (all or some of the) age-related changes in microstructure identified (i.e., if certain features are age-invariant with respect to absolute, rather than relative, position along the tract)? Demonstrating that group differences persist when selecting (e.g.) constant length segments at the ends and middle of each tract would help rule out brain size-induced topographic change as driving these effects (though other statistical approaches could likely also accomplish this).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to consider the effect of increasing fetal brain size when studying maturational changes across gestational age. We have operated under the assumption that the morphology of the tracts is consistent with age and thus that the tracts consistently project from the same origin to termination point in all fetuses (for example, from the thalamus to the primary motor cortex). Therefore, any change in the length of tract across gestational age will remain proportional to the change in overall brain size (or distance between the start and end of the tract) and thus each sampling point will represent the same relative distance from the origin and termination across different fetal ages.</p><p>We also used this normalisation approach together with an atlas, to cross-reference our trajectories of diffusion values. By overlaying the tracts on the atlas, and corroborating each sampling point with an atlas region, we characterised the diffusion properties of the different fetal compartments independent of their change in size and maturity across gestation. We have included more detail on this choice in the Results section to clarify it for readers (line 218-220).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm unsure what statistics support conclusions regarding position-specific differences in tissue fraction. E.g., the discussion summarizes that &quot;the early period is characterized by higher tissue fractions in the middle of the [thalamocortical] tract&quot;. While this appears likely based on visual inspection of the tracts in Figure 5, it is not clear what specific statistical analyses support this inference. Further, given that differences were assessed both as a function of GA (though perhaps exclusively by group) and as a function of distance, some degree of multiple comparison correction is probably warranted, but not currently employed (or at least, not described).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion, we agree that a more formal statistical comparison supports interpretation and strengthens the conclusion about microstructural differences between compartments. We have therefore correlated the tissue fraction at each sampling point with gestational age in the thalamic motor tract to demonstrate that there are significant associations with age. As there are 100 sampling points, we also used strict Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. This additional analysis has been mentioned in the Results section (line 233-237) and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83727-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>First, I would like to commend the authors on a thoughtful, creative combination of histological maps and dMRI data. One of the major challenges of fetal neuroimaging work is understanding how co-occurring and dynamic neurobiological processes contribute to metrics derived from in vivo imaging. The present study presents an exciting model for contextualizing dMRI findings in relation to what we know about brain development from histology studies. The following recommendations are offered with the hope that they can strengthen an already exceptional paper:</p><p>1. Please provide a table with sociodemographic information about the sample. This information is necessary for determining the representativeness of the sample, inferring the generalizability of the present findings, and working towards appropriate diversification of developmental neuroscience as a field. Given that age-related change is the primary question of interest, it would also strengthen the study to show that fetuses of different ages do not systematically differ from one another in terms of other factors that may alter developmental trajectories.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their enthusiasm about our work, and for highlighting the absence of this important information. We have included a sentence in the methods section (line 440) about the recruitment process, where this data was acquired and sociodemographic information about the cohort in the Appendix 1-Figure 1 (including histograms to demonstrate that IMD and ethnicity distributions are well matched to the diverse population in London). We have also included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> to demonstrate that there is no significant relationship between IMD and gestational age, suggesting that this is not influencing the microstructural trajectories we observe. When the dataset becomes publicly available later this year, a supporting publication will also be released containing all this information.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83727-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The manuscript would benefit from more detail regarding motion correction. The authors describe using slice-to-volume motion correction (SHARD) and implementing quality control based on slice dropouts and gradient of motion parameters. However, additional information is required to enhance transparency and aid future replication efforts. What cut-offs were used to determine whether to include vs. exclude a subject? How many fetuses were excluded based on the selected quality control thresholds? Can the authors please provide more information about the visual assessment that was conducted? Were post-processing motion parameters correlated with tissue or fluid fraction values or with fetal age? It would also be helpful to include visual examples of residual or uncorrected artefacts that resulted in subject exclusion, even if only in the supplemental materials. Finally, Christiaens et al., 2021 is cited several times in the text (including in reference to preprocessing techniques used for correcting head motion) but is not included in the reference list.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that for reproducibility, more detail about precise exclusion criteria would benefit the reader. The methods section now contains additional information about this process (line 464-474), and the appendix includes examples of subjects that were excluded due to motion and residual artefacts (Appendix 1 – Figure 2).</p><p>We have also included correlations between motion-related parameters extracted from the SHARD pipeline, (translation, rotation and SNR) (Christiaens et al., 2021) and gestational age, demonstrating no relationship with age. This is included in Appendix 1-Figure 3. Thank you for pointing out the referencing error, we have now corrected it. We would also like to highlight that when this dataset becomes publicly available later this year, QC scores and motion parameters will also be released that will enhance reproducibility for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. What size were the along-tract analysis segments and how was this segment size selected? Showing the results replicate (or don't) with different segment sizes would show the robustness of results and could inform an ideal resolution at which to examine tissue maturation in the fetal brain.</p></disp-quote><p>The normalisation approach we used was to standardise the sampling interval along all the tracts to 100 points between the origin and termination. This was to ensure consistency across the cohort, account for changing brain size and image resolution. We have assumed that the morphology of the tracts remains consistent across all ages, as we were able to delineate tracts even in the youngest fetuses which projected from the same origin to termination points (for example, from the thalamus to the primary motor cortex). As the start and end points of the tracts are the same regardless of gestational age, any maturational change in length is proportional to a corresponding change in brain size. The smooth transition between each segment, as demonstrated by the consistency of the curves and their gradual shift with age, suggests that this sampling interval is appropriate for the aims of this study. The error bars shown on Figure 5 that reflect the standard error of the mean also support this, as they demonstrate minimal variation between subjects and a lack of overlap between sections in each of the time windows.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Additional analyses that show the primary findings do not replicate with noise data but do replicate across different preprocessing choices would enhance rigor, especially since the field of fetal neuroimaging lacks a widely agreed-upon set of best practices. For instance, if segments from the along-tract analysis are scrambled, does the outward-to-inward maturational trajectory disappear? The disappearance of associations with scrambled data would enhance confidence that this finding is not simply a byproduct of the way the data were preprocessed. In addition, showing the results replicate following different preprocessing choices would aid in showing effect robustness.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that an important caveat in the field of fetal imaging is the lack of a standardised set of procedures with which to conduct analysis of MR data. However, we would like to emphasise that the pre-processing pipeline for the dHCP data has been optimised through an extensive and rigorous procedure, such that the methods used for the reconstruction, motion correction and distortion correction produce the highest quality data (more detail on this procedure is available in the following publications cited in the article: Christiaens et al., 2019, 2021, Cordero-Grande 2019, Pietsch et al., 2019). Please see Appendix 1-Figure 3, where we use parameters derived from the SHARD reconstruction pipeline to demonstrate there are no correlations between motion and gestational age. This figure also highlights that for fetuses of the same age, there is a broad distribution of SNR/translation/slice weight values. We feel that this enhances confidence in our results, because the differences between SNR within a gestational week are not reflected in the tissue and fluid fraction values, which in contrast are consistent for subjects of the same age.</p><p>In reference to the suggestion to scramble the segments, we feel that shuffling the values presented in figure 5 would lead to disappearance of the trajectory because of the non-overlapping error bars between compartments at each age. To strengthen our analysis, we have taken on board the initial lack of statistical testing and computed correlations between each sampling point tissue fraction and gestational age and corrected for multiple comparisons (see above, response to reviewer one).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Several studies have identified sex differences in fetal brain maturation. Given the even split in the present sample, examining whether tissue maturation trajectories differ by fetal sex would be informative. I wonder if the authors would consider adding this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this would be beneficial to include and have tested for statistical significance between male and female in the average values across the whole tract. We found there was no significant difference between the average diffusion values in any of the tracts. Please see a statement about this finding in the Results section (line 189).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The limitations of fetal dMRI should be clearly described in the discussion to aid reader interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is a useful suggestion to help to contextualise the study and the methods used. We have now included a specific limitations section in the discussion (line 388-425) and refer reviewers to a previous publication that comprehensively describes these challenges (Christiaens et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It would improve manuscript readability to clarify why the authors believe it is important to report both tissue and fluid fractions. They appear to be reciprocals of one another so the added value of reporting both is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this point. When fitting this model, the two components are reciprocals of one another if the modelling method has fit the data well and the normalization procedure has worked, so we include this to aid reader interpretation of the results and confirm that data validity. To make our rationale clearer to readers, we have included a sentence in the Results section (line 203-205).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. I would avoid subjective phrases like &quot;thalamocortical connections represent the most important inputs into the developing cortex&quot; and instead use more neutral language like &quot;thalamocortical connections play a key role in guiding…&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and agree more neutral language is appropriate. This suggestion has now been included in the revised article (line 50).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, this is a very valuable study with excellent datasets. The material provides a unique and detailed description of the changes in microstructure in the thalamus and cortex. I am very supportive of publication, but I feel that more could have been done to bridge the gap between MRI and histology and to link the results to the basic principles of thalamocortical development.</p><p>Criticisms:</p><p>1. Using tract density imaging, the authors observed that the cortical areas were connected to specific thalamic regions, organised in an anterior-posterior axis. This anterior-posterior representation of cortical connectivity in the thalamus was consistent with previous descriptions in rodent thalamocortical connectivity in rodent. However, the relationship between the cortical surface and the volume of the developing thalamus is not explained clearly. In their studies, Molnar and Blakemore emphasized that at the time of arrival, the thalamic projections are already arranged according to rough topography. Anterior to posterior movement along the convexity of the cortex represented a medial-to-lateral movement of labelling in the embryonic rodent thalamus. Ventral to dorsal movement in the cortex resulted in an anterior-to-posterior movement within the thalamus https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.18-15-05723.1998; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.08119.x. It would be good to improve Figure 3 and represent the overall pattern. The very general pattern should be described. Could the thalamic volumes be color coded and the same fainter shade used on the convexity of the cortex of the 3D outline of the brain?</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful that this missing but extremely important element of our discussion has been highlighted and have now modified the manuscript accordingly, please see discussion (line 286). We have also adjusted Figure 3 to highlight the anterior-posterior connectivity gradient across the cortex and shaded the different nuclei accordingly. In addition, we have changed the colours of the tracts in Figure 2 according to their anterior-posterior connectivity to clearly demonstrate this pattern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The study does not attempt to link the thalamic fibre topography to the histological structure of the thalamus. Thalamic nuclei undergo considerable changes at these early stages, e.g. pulvinar increases enormously and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is changing position from dorsolateral to ventromedial. Such changes were already emphasized in the publications of Le Gros Clark and subsequently Rakic. The authors note that the topography of thalamic nuclei and their cortical connectivity is acquired embryonically, but they do not emphasize the considerable changes in this topography at early stages. The in vivo parcellation of the thalamus is only described as part of the fibre topography, no references are made to the changes in relative positions of the thalamic nuclei, and only the adult similarity is emphasized.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out that this key feature of thalamic development was missing from our discussion. With the resolution (8mm<sup>3</sup>) and image contrast of our images, smaller changes in the position or size of individual nuclei are unfortunately difficult to evaluate though we agree that being able to resolve these changes concurrently would further reinforce our findings. We have now added more on the histological structure of the thalamus to our discussion (line 305-310).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The density of the thalamocortical innervation is not equal across the developing or adult cortex. E.g. retrogradely tracing thalamic projections from various parts of the cortex using carbocyanine dyes, it was observed that the same sized carbocyanine dye can label 3-5 times more backlabelled thalamic neurons from the putative somatosensory cortex than from the visual cortex (see references in Z. Molnár, Development of Thalamocortical Connections (Springer, 1998)). The methodologies and the data would have enabled the authors to compare the parameters of the various thalamocortical pathways that they resolved. It would have been good to include some results and comments on these area-specific comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. While this would be an interesting question to address, unfortunately we feel that tractography itself (particularly in fetal data) cannot be reliably used to assess fibre morphology. The diffusion MR signal has no directionality, and therefore we are unfortunately not able to distinguish between ascending and descending thalamic projections as they develop. We also find that metrics generally used in this field to investigate fibre bundle morphology, such as streamline count, a proxy for ‘innervation density’, are not an accurate, quantitative measure. These are outlined well in this review article: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787694/. Consequently, we have avoided using the data in this way, and just used tractography to delineate regions of interest. We have now added a limitations section to the article and mention this constraint of diffusion methodology specifically (line 388).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors found the spatiotemporal changes in the diffusion signal reflected known developmental processes that take place between the early, mid, and late prenatal period. &quot;The early period is characterized by higher tissue fractions in the middle of the tract, where there is a radial scaffold for migrating neurons. As this scaffold dissipates in the mid-prenatal period, this is accompanied by a reduction in the tissue fraction in the middle of the tract, and an increase in towards the termination of the tracts as the neurons of the cortical plate mature.&quot; The fact that these changes can be now resolved with in vivo imaging is excellent, but the data itself is under-analysed.</p><p>The authors correctly describe the possible anatomical explanations for the changes of the signals: &quot;In terms of the diffusion signal, this strongly aligned microstructure of the radial glia is represented in our results by a higher tissue fraction in the transient compartments containing the most migratory cells (such as the VZ, IZ). Conversely, we observe the lowest tissue fraction in the early prenatal SP, as this compartment predominantly contains hydrophilic extracellular matrix.&quot; These are key processes of cortical development and the authors have the material to draw conclusions on the various gradients on the cortical plate and subplate changes. It would have been good to get a feel for these dynamic changes and include some representations of the area-specificity of these changes. Surely the increase of the cortical plate has areal variation and also the increase and resolution of the subplate are also area specific. Measuring and representing these differences would increase the impact of the study. Moreover, it would also open avenues to study left-right and gender differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that this is a very rich dataset and there are a lot of questions that we have not addressed or analysed within this paper. Incorporating measures of areal variation in cortical plate development will require surface projection to calculate measures such as cortical thickness and sulcal depth reliably across subjects. Unfortunately, the required processing is non-trivial for fetal MRI data and requires careful optimisation, and thus we felt was beyond the scope of this work. Work is thus currently underway to explore regional differences across the brain for a separate publication that will use a different approach with broader coverage across the whole brain, allowing us to examine areal trends more comprehensively. We will also plan to eventually release surface projected data with the dHCP data release. We imagine this subsequent study will support the findings presented in this paper however, we did not want to overcomplicate the results as we aimed to investigate thalamocortical development more specifically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors have interesting discussions on the corticofugal and thalamocortical connectivity through the internal capsule. &quot;The microstructural change along the anterior thalamic radiation suggests increasing tissue fraction between the deep grey matter, VZ, and IZ. We hypothesise that the high tissue fraction in the IZ is due to densely packed ascending and descending bundles within the anterior limb of the internal capsule.&quot; The exact timing of the outgrowth, intermingling, and arrival of the thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections are not known, but there are some suggestions that these are relatively earlier than in rodents (https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz056; https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-53860-4.00003-9).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and are grateful for them highlighting this incredibly relevant study for our discussion.
