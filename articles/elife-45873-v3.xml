Among the most critical in higher organisms is the Cori Cycle, the systemic cycling between lactate and glucose. Here, skeletal muscle-specific Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier (MPC) deletion in mice diverted pyruvate into circulating lactate. This switch disinhibited muscle fatty acid oxidation and drove Cori Cycling that contributed to increased energy expenditure. Loss of muscle MPC activity led to strikingly decreased adiposity with complete muscle mass and strength retention. Notably, despite decreasing muscle glucose oxidation, muscle MPC disruption increased muscle glucose uptake and whole-body insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, chronic and acute muscle MPC deletion accelerated fat mass loss on a normal diet after high fat diet-induced obesity. Our results illuminate the role of the skeletal muscle MPC as a whole-body carbon flux control point. They highlight the potential utility of modulating muscle pyruvate utilization to ameliorate obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondrial

glucose uptake significantly drives chronic hyperglycemia that leads to microvascular complications and tissue degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeFronzo and Tripathy, 2009</xref>). The metabolic and molecular causes of decreased muscle glucose uptake have been intensively investigated but many critical questions remain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stanford and Goodyear, 2014</xref>). It is clear that impaired insulin signaling and consequently blunted GLUT4 transporter translocation to the plasma membrane contribute prominently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kampmann et al., 2011</xref>). However, the factors underlying muscle insulin resistance are complex, and understanding the relative importance of potential contributing mechanisms has proven challenging.</p><p>In addition to hormonal signaling, skeletal muscle glucose disposal is regulated by muscle-autonomous mechanisms. Over shorter time-scales, this is exemplified by the glucose-fatty acid or Randle cycle, where acutely increasing fatty acid supply decreases muscle glucose uptake and oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Randle et al., 1963</xref>). Similarly, during obesity and T2D chronically elevated muscle lipid content and insulin resistance strongly associate, with increased ceramides, diacylglycerols, and mitochondrial acyl-carnitines and -CoAs implicated as causing insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Samuel and Shulman, 2016</xref>). Thus, acute and chronic lipid oversupply leads to impaired muscle glucose disposal. Notably, a correlate of both conditions is decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pilegaard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 1999</xref>). PDH converts glucose-derived pyruvate into acetyl-CoA inside mitochondria and is therefore essential for complete glucose oxidation.</p><p>In T2D, decreased PDH activity has been hypothesized to impair muscle glucose uptake by metabolic feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeoung, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nogiec et al., 2015</xref>). Tests of the converse relationship, whether increasing PDH activity increases glucose uptake do not support this idea and demonstrate that glucose oxidation and uptake are not obligately connected. Acute chemical PDH activation in rats by dichloroacetate infusion increased muscle glucose oxidation but not uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Small et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, constitutive genetic PDH activation increased muscle glucose oxidation as expected, but led to lipid accumulation, marked insulin resistance, and impaired glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rahimi et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, neither chronically nor acutely increasing muscle glucose oxidation increased muscle glucose uptake. Yet, the more directionally relevant question for T2D, how decreasing muscle pyruvate oxidation affects glucose uptake has, to our knowledge, not been selectively tested.</p><p>To investigate the effects of decreasing muscle pyruvate oxidation on muscle and systemic glucose metabolism, we generated skeletal muscle-specific mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) knockout mice (MPC SkmKO). The MPC occupies a central metabolic intersection by transporting cytosolic pyruvate into the mitochondrial matrix, thereby linking glycolysis with oxidative phosphorylation. The genes encoding the MPC were recently discovered, and little is known about how mitochondrial pyruvate uptake affects skeletal muscle function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bricker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herzig et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, MPC disruption did not impair muscle glucose uptake.

Compared to contracted WT muscle, contracted MPC SkmKO muscle pyruvate levels were several fold greater; conversely, lactate was similarly increased in contracted WT and SkmKO muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These results suggest contraction increases glycolytic production of pyruvate that is readily oxidized by WT but not SkmKO muscle. Pyruvate and lactate rapidly equilibrate across lactate dehydrogenase utilizing NADH and NAD<sup>+</sup> as co-factors. Accordingly, the lactate:pyruvate ratio, which was markedly greater in contracted WT compared to MPC SkmKO muscle, is often reflected by the NADH:NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. This is precisely what we observed here, where NAD<sup>+</sup> was unchanged and NADH was decreased in MPC SkmKO muscle during contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Of note, in muscle the NADH pool is several fold greater than the NAD<sup>+</sup> pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Steen and Vesth, 1979</xref>). Thus, the decrease in NADH does not necessarily indicate a decrease in the combined NADH + NAD<sup>+</sup> pool. MPC disruption decreased isocitrate/citrate and malate, and abolished contraction-induced increases in succinate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, no genotype effect was observed for α-ketoglutarate (αKG), which may be derived from glutamate independently of pyruvate fluxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Together, the decreased lactate:pyruvate ratio, NADH:NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio, and TCA cycle metabolite levels in SkmKO muscle convincingly demonstrate a shift to a more oxidized state. This is consistent with impaired capacity to generate reducing equivalents from pyruvate, resulting in transfer of reductive drive to the liver in the form of lactate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MPC disruption increases acyl-carnitine utilization</title><p>We next considered how muscle MPC disruption could affect acyl-carnitine content. Muscle acyl-carnitine accumulation and mitochondrial overload is associated with insulin resistance in T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koves et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, compensatory MPC SkmKO fatty acid oxidation could protect from insulin resistance by increasing acyl-carnitine clearance. Indeed, MPC disruption strikingly attenuated contraction-induced increases in acyl-carnitine content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). No main effects of genotype were observed for carnitine levels, indicating free carnitine was not a limiting substrate for acyl-carnitine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Lower acyl-carnitine levels in contracted MPC SkmKO muscle could result from either decreased production or increased oxidation. Our observations of increased fatty acid oxidation in MPC SkmKO muscle suggest the latter.</p><p>Enzyme expression changes, increased fatty acid oxidation enzyme specific activities, and diminished TCA cycle substrate competition could each contribute to increased MPC SkmKO muscle fatty acid oxidation. qPCR measurements showed no differences between WT and MPC SkmKO mice for the key fatty acid oxidation enzyme transcripts <italic>Cpt1b</italic>, <italic>Echs1</italic>, and <italic>Hadha</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). As expected, control qPCR measurements for <italic>Mpc1</italic> and <italic>Mpc2</italic> showed near total loss and no difference in MPC SkmKO vs WT muscle, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate programmatic upregulation of fatty acid oxidation gene expression does not underlie increased MPC SkmKO muscle fatty acid oxidation.</p><p>We performed in vivo universally <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucose [(U)<sup>13</sup>C-glucose] tracing experiments in resting, 6 hour-fasted mice to understand metabolic mechanisms for increased MPC SkmKO muscle fatty acid oxidation. In addition to our observation that contracted MPC SkmKO muscle citrate levels were decreased, we observed decreased flux of intraperitoneally-injected (U)<sup>13</sup>C-glucose into muscle citrate, simultaneous with increased flux of <sup>13</sup>C into the liver citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The combination of decreased and increased glucose enrichments into muscle and liver TCA cycle intermediates, respectively, is consistent with the elevated Cori Cycling we observed during glucose clamps. Decreased muscle pyruvate flux through citrate could also propagate to decreased malonyl-CoA production and a regulated fatty acid oxidation increase by Cpt1b disinhibition. In a separate experiment under similar conditions but without glucose injection, MPC SkmKO muscle malonyl-CoA levels were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Notably, these TCA cycle tracing and malonyl-CoA quantitation experiments were performed with resting muscle. Conversely, during in situ contraction experiments the greater WT muscle acyl-carnitine increase indicates Cpt1b activity was not limiting WT fatty acid oxidation. In accord, the minimal MPC SkmKO muscle increase in acetyl-carnitine, which is chemically adjacent to acetyl-CoA, is consistent with diminished substrate competition from mitochondrial pyruvate for entry into the mitochondrial acetyl-CoA pool. These observations suggest decreased TCA cycle pyruvate entry in MPC SkmKO muscle leads to increased fatty acid oxidation by both disinhibition of Cpt1b and diminished substrate competition, with the latter predominating in working muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Adaptive glutaminolysis and pyruvate-alanine cycling</title><p>Increased fatty acid oxidation can only partially compensate for decreased pyruvate oxidation, because it requires but does not generate oxaloacetate. Thus, we expected to also observe changes in muscle amino acid content consistent with adaptive mitochondrial utilization. In contrast to the accumulation of pyruvate we observed in MPC SkmKO muscle with contraction, glutamine and glutamate were depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Glutamine is a major cellular fuel, and our results suggest that MPC disruption increases glutaminolysis in skeletal muscle as previously observed in cancer cell and liver systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gray et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vacanti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Significant changes were observed in several additional amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Two are notable here because of their potential relationship to adaptive MPC SkmKO muscle pyruvate utilization. Alanine was increased similarly by contraction in both WT and MPC SkmKO muscle whereas aspartate was markedly increased in SkmKO muscle only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Pyruvate-alanine cycling can enable MPC-independent pyruvate carboxylation, which could increase aspartate by mitochondrial transamination of oxaloacetate.</p><p>We and others previously found that pyruvate-alanine cycling enables MPC-independent mitochondrial pyruvate utilization in fibroblasts and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gray et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCommis et al., 2015</xref>). In this case, pyruvate is transaminated in the cytosol to alanine, imported into the mitochondrial matrix by a currently unknown alanine transporter, and then deaminated back to pyruvate for oxidation. Here, in addition to our observation that (U)<sup>13</sup>C-glucose flux into citrate was decreased in MPC SkmKO muscle, we observed that (U)<sup>13</sup>C-glucose flux into alanine was increased in MPC SkmKO muscle, consistent with pyruvate-alanine cycling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To test for pyruvate-alanine cycling, we incubated permeabilized mouse soleus muscle with the MPC inhibitor UK-5099 and alanine transaminase inhibitor β-chloro-alanine, in both orders of administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). MPC and alanine transaminase inhibition additively decreased pyruvate-driven respiration. To account for the possibility that UK-5099 and β-chloro-alanine were impairing electron transport chain function, we rescued respiration by treatment with the Complex I inhibitor rotenone, to prevent reverse electron transport, and the Complex II substrate succinate. Succinate restored respiration to pre-inhibited levels, indicating maintenance of gross mitochondrial oxidative capacity. These results provide evidence for pyruvate-alanine cycling as a mechanism for MPC-independent carbohydrate oxidation in MPC SkmKO muscle.</p><p>Combined with our observations of decreased MPC SkmKO muscle glucose flux into citrate, our data also suggest that pyruvate-alanine cycling is kinetically limited compared to direct mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. During in vivo (U)<sup>13</sup>C-glucose tracing, the citrate M + 1 and M + 3 isotopologues were decreased in MPC SkmKO muscle, indicating more greatly decreased pyruvate anaplerosis through pyruvate carboxylase compared to forward TCA cycle flux through PDH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Thus, pyruvate-alanine cycling may be more specifically limiting for pyruvate flux through pyruvate carboxylase and require concomitantly increased glutamine anaplerosis for maintaining TCA cycle flux. This is consistent with the decreased MPC SkmKO but not WT muscle glutamine levels we observed during in situ contraction. Together with observed fatty acid oxidation increases, these data support a model where increased acyl-carnitine utilization, pyruvate-alanine cycling, and anaplerotic glutaminolysis sustain TCA cycle activity when direct pyruvate transport is lost by MPC disruption.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Constitutive and acute skeletal muscle MPC deletion enhances recovery from high fat diet-induced obesity</title><p>Because MPC SkmKO mice showed a marked resistance to fat mass gains and increased insulin sensitivity on a normal chow diet, we sought to understand whether disrupting muscle MPC activity would attenuate high fat diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction.

Pyruvate metabolism has been investigated extensively through studying the crucial regulators of mitochondrial pyruvate partitioning, pyruvate carboxylase and PDH. However, fundamental questions on the relationship between mitochondrial pyruvate utilization and disease have been challenging to address through their study alone. Here, we generated skeletal muscle-specific MPC knockout mice to test how decreasing muscle mitochondrial pyruvate uptake affects muscle and systemic metabolism.</p><p>After uptake by skeletal muscle, glucose may be channeled to three major fates: complete mitochondrial oxidation via pyruvate, storage as glycogen, or excretion as lactate. During hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, the preferred experiment for measuring insulin sensitivity in vivo, MPC disruption increased skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake. In addition, under basal conditions, hepatic glucose production and peripheral glucose disposal were simultaneously increased, indicating increased Cori Cycling. Importantly, this suggests that muscle glucose uptake and glycolysis are not intrinsically connected to pyruvate oxidation and that lactate excretion functions as flexible offset for balancing glucose uptake with disposal. This is notable given the role of lactate as a systemic energy currency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks, 2018</xref>), including recent findings showing that most tissues other than brain, heart, and muscle utilize circulating lactate instead of glucose as their major source of pyruvate for mitochondrial oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hui et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, our findings demonstrate a nodal role for the muscle MPC in total-body energy supply by controlling circulating lactate fluxes.</p><p>Notably, the MPC SkmKO mouse leanness we observe is consistent with the unconventional view that elevated Cori Cycling in T2D is adaptive rather than maladaptive. Cori Cycle activity is increased in T2D and characterized as driving hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vaag et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zawadzki et al., 1988</xref>). While this is accurate when considering the gluconeogenic component in isolation, we note that the full Cori Cycle does not produce net glucose. Muscle glycolysis is increased in T2D, which requires matching glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giebelstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Simoneau and Kelley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vaag et al., 1995</xref>). The Cori Cycle is futile because the two ATP molecules produced by glycolysis are traded for the six ATP equivalents required for re-synthesis of glucose from pyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Surprisingly, while the energy-wasting nature of the Cori Cycle is addressed as a problem during cachexia and hyperthyroid states, it is virtually unaddressed in the diabetes and obesity literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang and Lardy, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Potenza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tisdale, 2009</xref>). All other things being equal, elevated Cori Cycling helps solve the T2D metabolic conundrum of how to scavenge circulating glucose while clearing ectopic lipid deposits by oxidation. Because obesity often arises from a minimal daily energy surplus accumulated over time, we argue that small metabolic rate increases caused by elevated Cori Cycling can nonetheless impact long-term body composition.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45873.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Skeletal muscle MPC disruption drives Cori cycling and fatty acid oxidation.</title><p>Skeletal muscle MPC disruption (MPC SkmKO) impairs glycolytically generated pyruvate entry into skeletal muscle mitochondria, thereby increasing conversion of pyruvate to lactate and consequent skeletal muscle lactate excretion. Increased skeletal muscle lactate excretion drives hepatic gluconeogenesis that re-supplies glucose to skeletal muscle. Thus, skeletal muscle MPC disruption increases Cori Cycling. The Cori Cycle is energetically futile because each round produces two skeletal muscle ATP molecules and consumes six liver ATP equivalents, for a net whole-body consumption of 4 ATP equivalents. Because hepatic gluconeogenesis is energetically supported by fatty acid oxidation and muscle MPC disruption increases muscle fatty acid oxidation, futile Cori Cycling is energetically supported by fatty acid oxidation. Together, increased energy expenditure and fatty acid oxidation contribute to leanness arising from skeletal muscle MPC disruption.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45873-fig7-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Lastly, we consider limitations and potential future directions. The physiological changes occurring with skeletal muscle MPC disruption are clearly complex. Accounting for the many mechanisms that could be driving MPC SkmKO mouse leanness is a formidable challenge. By definition, because of the muscle-liver ATP exchange energetics, Cori Cycling increases whole-body energy expenditure. Additional factors are likely at play as well. These could include altered hypothalamic regulation by unidentified muscle-released serum factors, changes in intramuscular calcium cycling, which is ATP-intensive and known to be intricately connected with metabolism, and yet to be discovered lipolytic cross-talk between muscle and adipose tissue.</p><p>Though the feasibility of therapeutically targeting the MPC in vivo in humans has yet to be fully tested, we note that PPARγ-sparing thiazolidinedione-like molecules that inhibit the MPC attenuate diabetes in rodents and are now being tested in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCommis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCommis et al., 2017</xref>). Because pyruvate-alanine cycling can bypass the MPC to partially sustain glucose oxidation, in vivo targeting may therapeutically modulate rather than pathologically constrain mitochondrial metabolism. Nonetheless, inactivating human patient <italic>MPC1</italic> mutations impair neurological development leading to lasting health problems and in the case of one patient early death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bricker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brivet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oonthonpan et al., 2019</xref>). How in vivo pharmacologic MPC modulation affects the function of tissues less metabolically plastic than liver and skeletal muscle, like brain, heart, and kidney, is a critical consideration that will need to be fully addressed. Important future work also includes deciphering the mechanisms by which skeletal muscle MPC disruption increases glucose uptake. This will require carefully interrogating insulin and AMPK signaling, glucose transporter regulation, and glycogen metabolism. In conclusion, our findings here raise the possibility that selectively decreasing skeletal muscle pyruvate uptake in obese and T2D patients may aid fat mass loss and restoration of whole-body insulin

For all experiments, <italic>Mpc1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6J for six generations and male littermate paired mice were used for experiments unless otherwise indicated. Mouse ages and experimental sample size including the number of littermates is indicated in figure legends. Mice were fed either chow, a high-fat diet (HFD) consisting of 60% kcal from fat, or a corresponding 10% kcal from fat control diet corresponding to the HFD (NFD). For studies utilizing the HSA-MerCreMer mice, recombination of the <italic>Mpc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> allele was accomplished by intraperitoneal injection of 75 mg/kg tamoxifen for five consecutive days. Body composition was measured using a rodent-sized NMR machine (Bruker Minispec LF50).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Snap-frozen tissues were pulverized (only for skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue) and homogenized on ice in a lysis buffer containing 40 mM HEPES, 120 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10% (v/v) Glycerol, 1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630, 1 µM DTT, and protease inhibitor. Samples were rotated at 4°C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 21000 x <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 15 min and supernatant was collected.

To begin the experiment, blood glucose and lactate were measured using a One Touch UltraMini glucometer and Nova Biomedical Lactate Plus lactate meter via the tail vein. Mice were then intraperitoneally injected with a 10% glucose solution for GTT (2.0 g/kg lean mass) or a 10% lactate/pyruvate (10:1) solution for L/PTT (3.0 g/kg lean mass). Blood glucose and lactate were measured at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min post-injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Exercise tolerance test</title><p>Mice were acclimatized to the treadmills by two bouts of 30 min of 5 m/min walking on consecutive days. The exercise tolerance test (ETT) was performed on the third day by beginning at 4 m/min for 30 mins then increasing the treadmill speed by 2 m/min every 10 min for 90 min. After 90 min speed was increased by 4 m/min every 10 min until exhaustion was reached. Exhaustion was determined by inability of the mice to leave the treadmill shock grids for 10 consecutive seconds. Shock grids were set to irritate but not harm the mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Skeletal muscle mitochondrial isolation</title><p>Skeletal muscle mitochondrial isolation was performed essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Cazarin et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, mouse gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, and hamstring muscles were dissected, minced and incubated in 5 ml of PBS containing 10 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) trypsin for 30 min. Following incubation, minced muscle was separated from digestion media and homogenized using a Teflon on glass dounce homogenizer in a buffer containing 10 mM EDTA, 215 mM D-mannitol, 75 mM Sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4. Homogenates were centrifuged at 700 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant were collected. These supernatants were centrifuged at 10,500 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C, and the resulting pellet was used as the mitochondrial fraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Pyruvate uptake assay</title><p>The pyruvate uptake protocol was based on previously published methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray et al., 2016</xref>). Mitochondria were resuspended to 5.0–9.0 mg/mL in Uptake Buffer (120 mM KCL, 5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1 μM Rotenone, and 1 μM Antimycin A) and were divided into two equal aliquots treated with 2 mM α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHC) or vehicle. 20 μL of treated mitochondria were rapidly mixed with 20 μL of 2X Pyruvate buffer (Uptake Buffer, pH 6.2 with 0.10 mM <sup>14</sup>C-Pyruvate) generating the pH gradient needed to initiate uptake. After 1 min, 80 μL of Stop buffer (Uptake Buffer pH 6.8 supplemented with 10 mM CHC) was rapidly mixed with the samples to halt uptake. Mitochondria were recovered by passing the solution through dual filter system consisting of a 0.8 μM cellulose filter and a 0.45 μM nitrocellulose filter. Filters were washed twice with 200 μL Wash buffer (Uptake Buffer pH 6.8 supplemented with 2 mM CHC and 10 mM Pyruvate). Excess filter material around the separated and washed mitochondria were removed, and filters containing mitochondria were placed into scintillation vials for quantification. Mitochondria pre-treated with CHC were used as a negative control and counts were subtracted from non-pre-treated mitochondria. Samples were normalized to the amount of mitochondrial protein used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements</title><p>A Seahorse Bioscience XF-96 extracellular flux analyzer was used to monitor mitochondrial oxygen consumption similar to how previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rogers et al., 2011</xref>). 5 µg of isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria suspended in a buffer containing 70 mM Sucrose, 220 mM D-mannitol, 10 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.2% fatty acid free BSA were attached to V3-PET seahorse plates by centrifugation at 2000 x <italic>g</italic> for 20 min. Substrates of interest were at final concentrations of 10 mM Pyruvate/1 mM Malate or 10 mM Glutamate/1 mM Malate. A three injection protocol was utilized with three replicate measurements taken between each injection. Each replicate consisted of a 1 min mix step, a 1 min equilibration step, and a 3 min measurement step. After basal measurements were acquired, maximum oxygen consumption was stimulated by the addition of 4 mM ADP and 1 μM FCCP (Port A injection). MPC specific activity was inhibited by the addition of 1 mM CHC (Port B injection). Finally, Complex I activity was inhibited by 5 μM Rotenone (Port C injection). Oxygen consumption was normalized to mitochondrial protein loading.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fatty acid uptake assay</title><p>4 hr fasted mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and retro-orbitally injected with 200 μL 0.5% <sup>3</sup>H-Intralipid. Fatty acid uptake was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartelt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cushing et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kusminski et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, blood samples were taken via the tail vein at 1, 5, 10, and 15 min after injection. After the last blood draw, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and tissues were harvested and weighed. Approximately 50 mg of each tissue was then weighed and placed in 2:1 chloroform:methanol overnight at 4°C. 1 mL of 2 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> was then added to each sample to separate organic and aqueous layers. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 rpm, and the upper aqueous layer was collected. The lower organic layer was evaporated overnight to remove chloroform. Blood samples, the upper aqueous layer, and the remaining organic layer following overnight evaporation were mixed with scintillation fluid and <sup>3</sup>H counts per minute (CPMs) was measured by scintillation counting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Serum analysis</title><p>Mouse blood was collected via the tail vein into microvettes (Sarstedt) and spun at 3000 rpm for 30 min 4°C to separate serum. Insulin measurements were performed using the Ultra-Sensitive Mouse Insulin ELISA Kit (Crystal Chem). Serum cholesterol and triglycerides levels were determined using the Infinity Cholesterol and Infinity Triglyceride reagents (Thermo). Serum ketone and NEFA levels were measured using the Total Ketone Bodies and NEFA Reagents (Wake). All reagents were used according to manufacturer’s directions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Ex vivo fatty acid oxidation</title><p>Tendon-to-tendon EDL muscle was carefully dissected from 13 week old mice, weighed (25–29 g), and placed in ice cold Krebs-HEPES-biocarbonate (KHB: 140 mM NaCl, 3.6 mM KCl, 0.5 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 12.5 mM HEPES, 2 mM NaHCO<sub>3,</sub> pH 7.4, gassed with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>) containing 5 mM glucose and 1 mM ATP until assay initiation (30–60 min). Muscles were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes containing warmed (37°C) pre-reaction media (KHB, gassed with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>, pH = 7.4, 12.5 mM HEPES, 1 mM L-carnitine, 200 μM palmitate conjugated to 0.25% fatty acid free BSA, 5 mM glucose, and 0.2% ethanol [palmitate vehicle]) for 15 min. Muscles were then placed in reaction media (Pre-reaction media plus 0.1% 0.5 μCi/mL [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-palmitate) in an airtight chamber with an NaOH solution containing collection vessel and incubated for 1 hr. 70% perchloric acid was injected into the chamber to release CO<sub>2</sub> from the reaction media that was subsequently trapped in the collection vessel. The NaOH was collected to assess complete palmitate oxidation to CO<sub>2</sub> and reaction media was retained to assess incomplete palmitate oxidation intermediates as acid soluble metabolites using a scintillation counter. Data were normalized to tissue weight, corrected for background and reaction media counts, and expressed as nmol/g tissue/hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Traced hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps</title><p>A catheter was introduced into the jugular vein of mice. Mice were allowed to fully recover from surgery prior to clamp procedure. Clamps were performed in 5 hr fasted, unrestrained, conscious mice. Whole-body glucose flux was traced by infusion of D-[3-<sup>3</sup>H]-glucose. After an 80 min basal sampling period, insulin administration was initiated with a 25 mU bolus followed by 2.5 mU/kg/min continuous infusion. At 45 mins prior to clamp conclusion min, [1-<sup>14</sup>C]−2-deoxy-D -glucose was infused in a single bolus. <sup>14</sup>C-2 deoxy-D –glucose-6-phosphate tracer enrichment was used to measure glucose uptake into liver, heart, kidney, white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, and gastrocnemius. Glucose appearance and disappearance rates were calculated using Steele's equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Steele et al., 1956</xref>).

For quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis, an equal amount of RNA was reverse transcribed and qPCR reactions were carried out using SYBR Green mastermix. Relative abundance of mRNA was normalized to ribosomal protein 36B4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Muscle glycogen measurements</title><p>Muscle glycogen measurements were performed using the acid hydrolysis approach which has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Passonneau and Lauderdale, 1974</xref>). Briefly,~10 mg of tibialis anterior muscle was placed into tubes containing 250 μL 2 M HCl. The samples were boiled for 2 hr with intermittent vortexing. Samples were returned to the original 250 μL with water and neutralized with 250 μL 2 M NaOH and 10 μL 1M Tris, pH 7.4. Glucose concentrations were measured using a commercially available kit according to manufacturer’s direction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Steady state metabolomics</title><p>Data were acquired from an Agilent 6545 UHD QTOF interfaced with an Agilent 1290 UHPLC. Metabolites were separated by using a Millipore Sigma SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC (150 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 μm) column. Solvents were A, 95% water in acetonitrile with 10 mM ammonium acetate and 5 μM phosphate, and B, 100% acetonitrile. A flow rate of 200 μL/min was applied with the following gradient (minutes, %B): 0, 94.7%; 2, 94.7%; 27, 36.8%; 35, 20.0%; 37, 20.0%; 39, 36.8%. For all experiments, 2 μL of metabolic extract was injected. MS parameters were as follows: gas, 200°C 4 L/min; nebuilizer, 44 psi; sheath gas, 300°C 12 L/min; capillary, 3kV; fragmentor, 100V; scan rate, one scan/s. MS detection was carried out in both positive and negative modes with a mass range of 65–1,700 Da. Identifications were established by comparing the retention times and fragmentation data of compounds to model standards. All raw data files were converted into mzXML files by using msconvert. Data analysis was performed by using either Agilent’s Profinder or in-house R packages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title><sup>13</sup>C-Glucose tracing</title><p>6hr-fasted mice were intraperitoneally injected with 50% labeled 10% U<sup>13</sup>C-Glucose in water. Blood glucose and lactate were measured at time 0, 30, and 60 min. At 65 mins post injection, mice were anesthetized and a consistent liver lobe and TA muscles were freeze clamped at liquid nitrogen for metabolomic analysis. Metabolomic analysis was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diakos et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>For metabolomics, tissue samples were transferred to a tube prefilled with 1.4 mm diameter ceramic beads and weighed. The bead tube was returned to the freezer and allowed to cool down to −80 °C. Each tube received 900 µL extraction solution (methanol:water = 9:1, containing appropriate amount of internal standard D<sup>4</sup>-succinate, kept at −20 °C and thoroughly mixed before use). The tissue was disrupted using an OMNI BeadRuptor (Omni International), at 6.45 mHz speed, for 30 s, followed by incubation at −20 °C for 1 hr. The tubes were centrifuged at 20,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the tissue debris. The obtained supernatant was collected, dried under vacuum prior to GC-MS analysis.</p><p>All GC-MS analysis was performed with a Waters GCT Premier mass spectrometer fitted with an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph and a Gerstel MPS2 autosampler. Dried samples were suspended in 40 uL of a 40 mg/mL O-methoxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine and incubated for one hr at 30°C. 25 uL of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoracetamide was added and samples were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with shaking. 1 uL of the sample was injected to the gas chromatograph inlet in the split mode at a 10:1 split ratio with the inlet temperature held at 250°C. The gas chromatograph had an initial temperature of 95°C for one minute followed by a 40 °C/min ramp to 110°C and a hold time of 2 min. This was followed by a second 5 °C/min ramp to 250°C, a third ramp to 350°C, then a final hold time of 3 min. A 30 m Restek Rxi-5 MS column with a 5 m long guard column was employed for chromatographic separation.</p><p>Data was collected using MassLynx 4.1 software (Waters). Targeted metabolite identification and quantification as a function of area under the curve for each peak was performed using QuanLynx (Waters). Data was normalized for extraction efficiency and analytical variation by mean centering the area of D<sup>4</sup>-succinate. Metabolite identity was established using a combination of an in house metabolite library developed using pure purchased standards and the commercially available NIST library. Isotope incorporation was performed in the same manner as targeted analysis but measuring the area under the curve for each isotope and correcting for natural isotope abundance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Muscle malonyl-CoA measurements</title><p>Malonyl-CoA was determined as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McGarry et al., 1978</xref>). Briefly, muscles from 4 hour-fast mice were homogenized in 6% perchloric acid, and neutralized. The neutralized extract was then incubated at 37°C in a reaction mixture containing 13 nmoles/ml acetyl-CoA-H<sup>3</sup>, NADPH, and purified chicken fatty acid synthase (FAS) for 60 mins. The reaction was stopped using 70% perchloric acid. The amount of H<sup>3-</sup>fatty acid synthesized during the reaction was used to calculate the initial tissue content of malonyl-CoA in pmoles/mg tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>0.5 Hz and 1 Hz in situ contraction</title><p>In situ contraction was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, anesthetized mice were placed on a platform (Aurora Scientific) heated by circulating water. The tibialis anterior (TA) was exposed through dissection of the skin. A 3–0 silk suture was tied around the patellar tendon and secured to the fixed pillar of the force transducer. A 3–0 silk suture was tied around the distal tendon and looped through the lever arm of the force transducer. Tyrode’s solution warmed to 30°C was dripped on the muscle. An Accupulser stimulator routed through a stimulus isolation unit was used to excite the peroneal nerve. The resting tension on the muscle was set by incrementally adjusting the controller lever arm, and thus muscle length (L0) and resting tension, and then delivering a supramaximal stimulus to the peroneal nerve until a maximal twitch force was obtained. The stimulation amplitude was then set by plotting a twitch force versus stimulus amplitude curve and then setting the stimulator output at two times the threshold for a maximal twitch. Isometric contraction was generated and data collected by using pCLAMP software (Molecular Devices) interfaced with a digital acquisition device. The other contralateral TA muscle was treated as the non-contracted, sham control. Twitch force was normalized to the calculated muscle cross-sectional area (mN/cm<sup><sub>2</sub></sup>) using the muscle mass (in g) divided by the product of the presumed muscle density of 1.06 g/cm3 and the optimal fiber length (L0 ×0.6, in cm) and expressed as specific force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks and Faulkner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hakim et al., 2011</xref>). L0 was measured between suture knots on the muscle tendon and muscle mass was measured after excision. After 15 mins of contraction protocol, contracted and sham TA muscles were rapidly excised, freeze clamped under liquid nitrogen and stored for metabolomics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Home cage measurements of free-living, whole-body metabolism</title><p>Mice were acclimated for 24 hrs and then monitored for 72 hrs in an environmentally controlled Promethion metabolic screening system fitted with indirect open circuit calorimetry, food consumption monitors, and activity monitors to measure activity and energy expenditure. Energy expenditure and respiratory exchange ratio (RER = VCO<sub>2</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub>) were calculated from the gas exchange data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Grip strength measurements</title><p>Grip strength measurements were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dyle et al., 2014</xref>). Forelimb grip strength was determined using a grip strength meter equipped with a triangular pull bar (Columbus Instruments). Each mouse was subjected to five consecutive tests to obtain the peak value. The peak value was considered the maximum grip strength.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Ex vivo muscle force production analysis</title><p>Briefly, Mice were euthanized and the lower hind limb was removed and immediately placed in Krebs Ringer solution with 95% O2% and 5% CO2. The gastrocnemius, soleus, TA muscles, as well as the distal half of the tibia and fibula, were removed, leaving the intact EDL muscle. Contractile measurements were made on the EDL muscle. Maximum isometric tetanic force were recorded along with muscle mass and optimal fiber length and normalized to cross-sectional area to calculate specific force.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>SigmaPlot or Microsoft Excel software suites were used to organize and statistically analyze data and prepare figures.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial pyruvate uptake rewires glucose metabolism to drive whole-body leanness&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a guest Reviewing Editor and Mark McCarthy as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Darrell Neufer (Reviewer #1); Rachel Perry (Reviewer #2); Deb Muoio (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers and the Reviewing Editor found your work of significant interest. The observation that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier can have such a profound role in regulating energy expenditure and thus body mass is of interest. However, all reviewers felt that the manuscript fell short in defining the mechanism for the reduced fat mass, leading to a concern that this will represent yet another paper that reports such a link without mechanism. Nevertheless, the reviewers felt it was of sufficient interest to allow you the chance of resubmitting your paper provided you can fully address the &quot;essential&quot; concerns. In summary they are:</p><p>First, one of the reviewers identified problems with the glucose clamp data. There appears to be no effect of insulin on peripheral glucose utilisation in the KO mice. This needs a complete explanation and you need to provide documentation of the insulin values achieved during the clamp.</p><p>Second, if muscle glucose uptake is increased, apparently in the absence of insulin elevation, this is deserving of further explanation. One reviewer requested measurement of AMPK activity in muscle from WT and KO mice ie assessment of phosphorylation of AMPK and phosphorylation of at least one AMPK substrate such as ACC. One of the reviewers also requested examination of PDH phosphorylation and so such studies could also be done in parallel with those of AMPK.</p><p>Third, it is distinctly possible that MPC deletion has caused adaptive changes in gene expression and these could also be explored in either a targeted or non-targeted manner.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Sharma investigates the metabolic impact of deletion of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) specifically in muscle using both a constitutive and inducible model. The studies appear to be technically sound and well executed, and the manuscript is generally well written. MPC has been knocked down/out in a number of contexts. The compensatory changes in fuel metabolism are pretty well established and/or predictable from those studies, which weakens the novelty of the study. The finding that MPC1 deletion specifically in muscle leads to reduced fat mass on a chow diet is interesting, but it is not clear nor explored experimentally why the same effect is not evident in mice on a chronic high fat diet. The increase in energy expenditure induced by the shift in fuel utilization is likely driving the phenotype, but the mechanism accounting for the increase in energy expenditure on a chow diet is not explored beyond speculation regarding the Cori Cycle. The findings regarding the accelerated weight loss and fat mass when SkmKO mice were switched from a chronic high fat diet to a normal chow diet are novel and interesting and the main strength of the paper. Limiting the ability of pyruvate to enter the mitochondria in muscle appears to induce a mild increase in energy expenditure that is protective in the context of normal chow diet, which raises the possibility of therapeutically targeting MPC to facilitate weigh loss.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps appear not to be of the highest quality.

While the reasons for this are not certain, high basal Ra levels were observed in a limited and date-restricted series of clamps performed in our core – including the clamps under question. These extraordinarily high basal Ra levels resolved with the replacement of several under-delivering infusion pumps. In light of this coupled to the importance of clamp data for understanding whole-body glucose homeostasis, we repeated clamp experiments.</p><p>a) In the repeat clamps, basal Ra’s in mg/kg/min were 30 (WT) and 39 (MPC SkmKO) (Figure 4C). As expected, these values are decreased compared to the previous clamp experiments, with the controls ranging on the high end of literature-reported values. Importantly, the new clamps repeat the same key result of significantly higher basal Ra in MPC SkmKO mice compared to controls, consistent with elevated Cori Cycling.</p><p>b) In the new set of clamps, insulin administration (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) markedly stimulated Rd in both WT (30 to 70 mg/kg/min) and MPC SkmKO (39 to 87 mg/kg/min) mice (Figure 4D).</p><p>c) GIR is now provided in mg/kg/min for clear comparison to Ra and Rd.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The assays used to confirm that MPC1 KO results in decreased PDH flux and pyruvate oxidation were performed in isolated mitochondria (Figure 1).

We added alanine labeling data to Supplementary file 2. Based on citrate and alanine isotopologue distribution differences between WT and MPC SkmKO mice, we discuss the possibility that pyruvate-alanine cycling more efficiently channels pyruvate through PDH for forward TCA cycle flux than through pyruvate carboxylase for anaplerosis. To understand whether increased PDH phosphorylation could be directing a greater MPC SkmKO muscle pyruvate proportion through forward vs anaplerotic TCA cycle flux, we performed new experiments measuring PDH phosphorylation in quadriceps muscle harvested at the end of clamp experiments (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). These blots show no differences between WT and MPC SkmKO mice PDH phosphorylation, consistent with other mechanisms controlling pyruvate channeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Investigators conclude that muscle insulin sensitivity is enhanced in the KO mice.

As recommended, we examined quadriceps muscle harvested at the end of clamp experiments by Western blot for Akt serine 473 and AMPK threonine 172 phosphorylation (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Neither was increased in MPC SkmKO mice. We note in the manuscript that this doesn’t rule out that changes in either of these pathways contributed to increased MPC SkmKO glucose uptake, only that Akt and AMPK phosphorylation were not increased in post clamp samples. Deciphering the mechanisms accounting for increased MPC SkmKO muscle glucose uptake will likely be a complex and formidable challenge. Given the sizable experimental approach required to adequately address this question, we believe they are beyond the scope of this investigation. In the Discussion we raise this as an important future research direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Investigators concluded that MPC1 KO caused increased fat oxidation due to diminished malonyl CoA levels and resulting inhibition of CPT1.

We now discuss the roles of both changed substrate competition and enzymes activities, based on new qPCR experiments, in increased MPC SkmKO fatty acid oxidation. Based on our data, we modified the results narrative to suggest that: 1) in resting MPC SkmKO muscle diminished substrate competition and decreased malonyl-CoA both contribute to increased fatty acid oxidation; and 2) in working (in situ contracted) MPC SkmKO muscle that diminished substrate competition predominates over Cpt1b disinhibition as a mechanism for increased fatty acid oxidation. As the reviewer notes, we discuss the relative accumulation of acetyl- and other even chain acyl carnitines with muscle contraction and how relatively lower acetyl-carnitine in MPC SkmKO muscle is consistent with diminished substrate competition for conversion to acetyl-CoA. Furthermore, we performed additional experiments measuring transcript levels for key fatty acid oxidation enzymes, <italic>Cpt1b, Esch1</italic>, and <italic>Hadha</italic> (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). We observed no differences between WT and MPC SkmKO mice, indicating the absence of programmatic upregulation of fatty acid oxidation gene expression as a mechanism for increased fatty acid oxidation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
