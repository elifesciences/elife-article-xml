However, ATP hydrolysis is typically used for energy-intensive reactions, whereas GTP hydrolysis typically functions as a switch. SpoIVA is a bacterial cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to polymerize irreversibly during <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> sporulation. SpoIVA evolved from a TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases, but the evolutionary pressure that drove this change in nucleotide specificity is unclear. We therefore reengineered the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity. SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup> functioned properly as a GTPase but failed to polymerize because it did not form an NDP-bound intermediate that we report is required for polymerization. Further, incubation of SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup> with limiting ATP did not promote efficient polymerization. This approach revealed that the nucleotide base, in addition to the energy released from hydrolysis, can be critical in specific biological functions. We also present data suggesting that increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation was the evolutionary pressure that drove the change in nucleotide preference in SpoIVA.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living organisms need energy to stay alive; in cells, this energy is supplied in the form of a small molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, a nucleotide that stores energy in the bonds between its three phosphate groups. ATP is present in all living cells and is often referred to as the energy currency of the cell, because it can be easily stored and transported to where it is needed.</p><p>However, it is unknown why cells rely so heavily on ATP when a highly similar nucleotide called guanosine triphosphate, or GTP, could also act as an energy currency. There are several examples of proteins that originally used GTP and have since evolved to use ATP, but it is not clear why this switch occurred. One suggestion is that ATP is the more readily available nucleotide in the cell.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, Updegrove, Harke et al. studied a protein that helps bacteria transition into spores, which are hardier and can survive in extreme environments until conditions become favorable for bacteria to grow again. In modern bacteria, this protein uses ATP to provide energy, but it evolved from an ancestral protein that used GTP instead.</p><p>First, Updegrove, Harke et al. engineered the protein so that it became more similar to the ancestral protein and used GTP instead of ATP. When this was done, the protein gained the ability to break down GTP and release energy from it, but it no longer performed its enzymatic function. This suggests that both the energy released and the source of that energy are important for a protein’s activity. Further analysis showed that the modern version of the protein has evolved to briefly hold on to ATP after releasing its energy, which did not happen with GTP in the modified protein.</p><p>Updegrove, Harke et al. also discovered that the levels of GTP in a bacterial cell fall as it transforms into a spore, while ATP levels remain relatively high. This suggests that ATP may indeed have become the source of energy of choice because it was more available.</p><p>These findings provide insights into how ATP became the energy currency in cells, and suggest that how ATP is bound by proteins can impact a protein’s activity. Additionally, these experiments could help inform the development of drugs targeting proteins that bind nucleotides: it may be essential to consider the entirety of the binding event, and not just the release of energy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>tubulin</kwd><kwd>MreB</kwd><kwd>septins</kwd><kwd>SpoVM</kwd><kwd>ppGpp</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramamurthi</surname><given-names>Kumaran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aravind</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM127088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jue D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1715710</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amador-Noguez</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reengineering the nucleotide-binding pocket of an extant ATPase to restore ancestral GTPase activity revealed an ATP-dependent intermediate required for function and suggested why the protein evolved to use ATP.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nucleotides have various functions in the cell, as coenzymes, signaling messengers, and the building blocks of genetic material. Nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) store energy in the form of their phosphate bonds. The free energy of the hydrolysis reaction involving the bond between the β- and the γ-phosphates is approximately 30 kJ/mol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg et al., 2007</xref>) and is used to drive a variety of energy-consuming biochemical reactions. Despite this similarity between different NTPs, enzymes usually display strong preferences toward a specific NTP. For example, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in general is the principal source of energy in a cell and is used by motor proteins to perform work, whereas hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) typically functions as a timer or switch, such as in proteins involved in signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberts, 2002</xref>). One explanation for this dichotomy is that the relative intracellular abundance of ATP in a cell drove the evolution of motors to use it as an energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rudoni et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Traut, 1994</xref>). Consistent with that notion, the eukaryotic ATPase motor proteins myosin and kinesin are evolutionarily members of the TRAFAC class of GTPases, having emerged from an ancestral GTPase, but have switched their nucleotide specificity to utilizing the more abundant nucleotide ATP to perform their energy-intensive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leipe et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we examine an unusual bacterial ATPase named SpoIVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramamurthi and Losick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roels et al., 1992</xref>) that is also from the TRAFAC class of GTPases and is exclusively found in sporulating members of the Firmicutes phylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>). We had previously shown that within the TRAFAC group, SpoIVA is closest to the Era GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>) which are switches involved in the maturation of 16S rRNA and assembly of the 30S ribosomal subunit and universally conserved across bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ji, 2016</xref>). Given the universal conservation of Era among bacteria and the narrow conservation of SpoIVA, we proposed a model in which SpoIVA emerged via a duplication event followed by rapid divergence from Era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>). This divergence from Era included not only multiple residue substitutions, but also the addition of two C-terminal domains in SpoIVA that are not present in Era (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Further, the most parsimonious explanation of the phyletic patterns of SpoIVA and Era is that they are not formally sister groups where both diverged from a common ancestor; rather, SpoIVA ATPase, which emerged specifically in sporulating Firmicutes, has the Era GTPase itself as its ancestor. Unlike myosin and kinesin, SpoIVA is not a motor protein. Instead SpoIVA is a cytoskeletal protein that assembles into a static polymer in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramamurthi and Losick, 2008</xref>). In the absence of an obvious motor function, which would necessitate high ATP utilization, the selective pressure that drove the evolution of nucleotide preference in SpoIVA has been unclear.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Predicted residues in SpoIVA evolved from an ancestral GTPase to bind ATP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence logo displaying conservation of amino acid residues in different members of the TRAFAC class of GTPases.

When <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> faces starvation, it metamorphoses into a structurally and chemically robust dormant cell type termed an endospore (hereafter a ‘spore’) that protects the cell’s genetic material from environmental insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Higgins and Dworkin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Setlow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stragier and Losick, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan and Ramamurthi, 2014</xref>).

Assembly of the coat begins with the construction of a basement layer, of which the major structural protein is SpoIVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peluso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Price and Losick, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramamurthi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramamurthi and Losick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roels et al., 1992</xref>). Unlike dynamic cytoskeletal proteins like actin and tubulin, where nucleotide binding drives polymerization and nucleotide hydrolysis is linked to polymer disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pollard and Goldman, 2018</xref>), SpoIVA polymerization requires ATP hydrolysis to form a nucleotide-free static polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The amino terminal half of the SpoIVA ATPase is the nucleotide-binding domain, which belongs to the TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castaing et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leipe et al., 2002</xref>). This domain harbors a Walker A motif that binds the γ-phosphoryl group of the bound ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walker et al., 1982</xref>), a Walker B motif that coordinates a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion required for ATP hydrolysis and, like TRAFAC GTPases, a sensor Thr (‘sensor T’) that detects the γ-phosphoryl of the bound nucleotide to trigger ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leipe et al., 2002</xref>). The classic TRAFAC GTPases which hydrolyze GTP contain a fourth motif (the so-called G4 motif), typically consisting of Asn and Lys separated by one residue before an Asp (NKxD) that confers guanine-binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leipe et al., 2002</xref>). Crystal structures revealed direct interactions between the side chain of the Asp and the base of a bound GTP through two H-bonds, and a coordination of a water molecule to the α-phosphate group of the bound nucleotide by the Lys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knihtila et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, the extended aliphatic side chain of the said Lys forms a hydrophobic wall to hold the guanine of the nucleotide in the active site. Substitution of the Asp in this motif with Asn abolished the guanine-binding specificity of Ras, also a GTPase of the TRAFAC clade, and switched its specificity to xanthine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weijland et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhong et al., 1995</xref>). Additionally, in TRAFAC GTPases the loop spatially adjacent to the NKxD motif (the so-called G5 motif) is proximal to the guanine and might contribute to some extent to their guanine specificity.</p><p>To understand the functional requirement for the evolution of SpoIVA from a GTPase to an ATPase, we sought to reformulate the active site of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity by restoring the NKxD motif, which is altered in SpoIVA, and by altering an SxE sequence in the loop associated with the G5 motif. We found that partial restoration of the NKxD motif and alteration of the SxE sequence resulted in a SpoIVA variant that hydrolyzed GTP in vitro slightly preferentially over ATP with reduced overall catalytic efficiency, similar to the in vitro activity of the Era GTPase from which SpoIVA was likely derived in the ancestral sporulating Firmicute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>). In parallel, disrupting the NKxD motif in Era and introducing the SxE sequence into the G5 motif to mimic SpoIVA resulted in an Era variant that preferentially hydrolyzed ATP in vitro. The altered SpoIVA was able to harness the energy released by GTP or ATP hydrolysis to drive a necessary conformational change in the protein but failed to ultimately polymerize specifically in the presence of GTP. We show that this was due to the inability of SpoIVA to form the equivalent of an ADP-dependent multimer in the presence of GTP, which we show is a necessary intermediate en route to functional SpoIVA polymerization. Additionally, we provide evidence that the extant SpoIVA polymerizes more efficiently than the altered variant in the presence of lower ATP concentration, similar to what is present during the end of sporulation. We propose that a pronounced reduction in intracellular GTP concentration relative to ATP during the late stages of sporulation could have driven the evolution of SpoIVA to utilize ATP instead of GTP to drive polymerization, a critical step in the morphogenesis of the spore cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Amino acid substitutions in the nucleotide-binding pocket could be responsible for the evolution of ATP-binding specificity in SpoIVA</title><p>Our earlier sequence-profile analysis along with site directed mutagenesis had shown SpoIVA to be a member of the TRAFAC class of GTPases with Era as its closest GTPase relative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>). Since SpoIVA is strictly restricted to the clade of Firmicutes that form endospores we reasoned that SpoIVA was a relatively late innovation that evolved via gene duplication and rapid divergence from Era. Given that Era is a functional GTPase and SpoIVA shows a clear preference for ATP over GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramamurthi and Losick, 2008</xref>) we sought to identify the potential changes in the active site that might have led to this shift in specificity. For relatively closely related proteins that diverged from a common ancestor, reconstruction of an ancestral state may be achieved based on phylogeny and using statistical methods across the entire length of the proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hochberg and Thornton, 2017</xref>). However, the phyletic patterns strongly indicate that the ultimate ancestor of SpoIVA was Era itself. Moreover, SpoIVA and Era have diverged too far from each other to successfully employ such an approach. Beyond myriad amino acid substitutions and insertions, SpoIVA has even acquired two C-terminal domain fusions that are not present in Era (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castaing et al., 2014</xref>), which is reminiscent of other examples where the acquisition of large appendages to ancestral proteins have generated novel functions beyond the ancestral function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escudero et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farr et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the number of variables involved when all residues are considered would result in too vast of a parameter space to analyze using a common ancestor reconstruction method. We therefore focused on the highly conserved N-terminal TRAFAC NTPase domain of SpoIVA and computed a sequence logo for SpoIVA, Era and various other families of the TRAFAC class of GTPases, especially those of the GIMAP-Septin-Dynamin clade which show a comparable tendency for forming oligomers or polymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, the amino acid conservation pattern of SpoIVA was superimposed on a topology diagram of the ancestral core TRAFAC GTPase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This allowed us to identify those conserved active site positions which were retained in the ancestral state in SpoIVA and those that were altered with respect to <italic>bona fide</italic> GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>The first three motifs (G1–3) respectively correspond to: the Walker A motif which binds the triphosphate of the NTP substrate; the sensor T which discriminates the GTP-bound state from the GDP-bound state; and the Walker B motif which chelates the catalytic Mg<sup>2+</sup> and senses the bound triphosphate along with the sensor T (G2) motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In SpoIVA, these three motifs are retained in the ancestral state indicating that SpoIVA binds and senses the triphosphate moiety of the NTP similar to the ancestral GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, notable changes are seen in the G4 and G5 motifs of SpoIVA. Of these, G4 is comprised of the final residue of strand 6 of the core GTPase domain and a characteristic single-turn helix that follows it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Among the GTPases closely related to SpoIVA, the G4 motif is of the form NKxD (where ‘x’ is any amino acid), for example, in Era and Eng (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The first position of this motif is typically either N or T in most families of the entire GTPase superfamily. Thus, SpoIVA retains the ancestral state in this position. This residue forms the ‘lower wall’ of the base-binding pocket of the active site and by itself does not appear to discriminate between the purines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). The next position is a K in most families of <italic>bona fide</italic> GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and the extended sidechain of this lysine forms the ‘lateral wall’ of the base-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Strikingly, this K is consistently substituted by an alcoholic (S/T) residue in the SpoIVA family. The next conserved position in G4 is the D, which is the most important determinant of guanine specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In SpoIVA it is again mostly substituted by either of several polar residues, such as K, H, N, or R. Notably, unlike in <italic>bona fide</italic> GTPases this position is poorly constrained in SpoIVA, suggesting a relaxation of selection, which might have allowed the emergence of ATP selectivity.</p><p>The G5 motif follows immediately after strand-7 of the core GTPase domain and typically displays the motif SAx in classical TRAFAC GTPases. This region forms the wall of the base-binding pocket opposite to that formed by the conserved lysine in G4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In the case of SpoIVA the position corresponding to the conserved S in the G5 motif is less constrained and is usually either N, D, or S. The next residue is usually a cysteine in SpoIVA. Hence, this residue is likely to be similar to A with respect to its hydrophobicity and is not situated close to the distinguishing atoms of the purine base of the bound nucleotide. Thus, it is unlikely to have a major effect on base selectivity. Two residues downstream of S, there is a position that contributes to the wall of the base-binding pocket. This position is not particularly conserved in TRAFAC GTPases as a whole but in SpoIVA is either acidic (D/E) or Q/N in 41% of the orthologs. Together, these observations suggested that the changes in the G4 (NKxD) and G5 (SxE) regions relative to the bona fide GTPases may have contributed to the emergence of ATP-specificity in SpoIVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The altered NKxD motif in G4 and SxE sequence in G5 mediate nucleotide specificity of SpoIVA</title><p>To determine the relative contributions of the altered NKxD and SxE motifs in G4 and G5, respectively, on nucleotide hydrolysis specificity of SpoIVA, we first substituted different residues in each motif, either individually or in several combinations. Next, we overproduced and purified the variants from <italic>E. coli</italic> and tested the efficiency of each variant in hydrolyzing ATP and GTP in vitro. As a control, we compared these activities to that of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Era GTPase that we purified using a similar protocol.

Wild-type (WT) SpoIVA displayed a catalytic efficiency of 4.2 ± 0.9 min<sup>−1</sup> mM<sup>−1</sup> for ATP, compared to just 1.3 ± 0.8 min<sup>−1</sup> mM<sup>−1</sup> for GTP, indicating that the protein hydrolyzed ATP approximately threefold more efficiently than GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). By comparison, Era did not display appreciable basal ATPase or GTPase activity, but upon incubation with an RNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the 16S rRNA sequence to which Era binds and which reportedly stimulates the enzymatic activity of Era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tu et al., 2011</xref>), Era hydrolyzed GTP with a catalytic efficiency of 0.7 ± 0.2 min<sup>−1</sup> mM<sup>−1</sup>, similar to the reported activity of <italic>E. coli</italic> Era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tu et al., 2011</xref>).

Restoring either the single Lys or the full NKxD motif resulted in decreased preference for ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Substituting both the Ser and Glu with Ala (to disrupt both positions with an amino acid with a short sidechain that is unlikely to perturb overall SpoIVA structure) in the context of the restored NKxD motif resulted in lowered catalytic efficiencies, similar to WT SpoIVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>: ‘NKxD AxA’). This change also increased the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for GTP, resulting in drastically reduced specificity for ATP relative to WT SpoIVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Changing the SxE sequence alone to AxA had a similar effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, ‘NSxR AxA’). Substituting the Glu alone in the SxE sequence with Ala (‘NSxR SxA’) mimicked the NSxR AxA variant with respect to nucleotide specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), but further lowered the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Finally, combining a restoration of just the Asp residue of the degenerate NKxD motif with disruption of just the Glu of the SxE sequence, resulted in an enzyme that displayed a similar catalytic efficiency to that of Era (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, ‘NSxD SxA’; hereafter referred to as ‘SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup>’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) with a slight preference for GTP over ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>To test if altering the G4 NKxD motif and introducing the SxE sequence in G5 were sufficient for the emergence of preferential ATPase activity, we changed the NKxD motif in Era to NSxR, to resemble the G4 sequence in SpoIVA, and substituted a glutamate at the end of the SAx sequence in Era to produce ‘SAE’ (thereby introducing an SxE motif) and tested the nucleotide hydrolysis activity of the evolved variant. Similar to WT Era, the evolved Era (Era<sup>ATPase</sup>) did not exhibit a basal NTPase activity, but upon stimulation with the 16S rRNA fragment, Era<sup>ATPase</sup> hydrolyzed ATP with a catalytic efficiency of 0.2 ± 0.1 min<sup>−1</sup> mM<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), but more curiously failed to specifically hydrolyze GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K</xref>).</p><p>The key alterations in shifting the NTPase activity of SpoIVA toward that of Era were to restore the Asp of the NKxD and replace the Glu of the SxE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Conversely, disrupting the NKxD motif of Era and introducing a Glu to create an SxE motif were sufficient to drive the preferential hydrolysis of ATP over GTP. The mutational analyses therefore indicate that the Asp of the NKxD motif contributes to nucleotide specificity and that the substitution of Asp to Arg seen in the extant <italic>B. subtilis</italic> SpoIVA contributes to altering the nucleotide-binding pocket to discriminate against GTP in favor of ATP. This is consistent with reported crystal structures of TRAFAC GTPases with a bound GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knihtila et al., 2015</xref>) that show that the Asp of the NKxD motif can interact with the base of the bound nucleotide. In addition, another report showed that changing the Asp to another residue can alter the nucleotide-binding preference of Ras GTPase from GTP to xanthine triphosphate (XTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weijland et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhong et al., 1995</xref>).

Consistent with this result, the SpoIVA variant harboring a Sensor T disruption (SpoIVA<sup>T*</sup>, which binds, but does not hydrolyze ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>]) displayed a similar conformational change as WT SpoIVA in the presence of ATP-γ-S and GTP-γ-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and SpoIVA<sup>T*</sup> binding to ATP. Together, this suggested that this intermediate conformational change is likely due to nucleotide binding and not due to slow hydrolysis of the bound nucleotide. Interestingly, the NKxD variant of SpoIVA, which exhibited elevated ATP and GTP hydrolysis levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), displayed a conformational change in the presence of ATP-γ-S and GTP-γ-S similar to SpoIVA<sup>A*</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that it did not stably undergo the initial conformational change that occurs upon binding the nucleotide. WT SpoIVA and SpoIVA<sup>T*</sup> exhibited a similar intermediate conformational change when incubated with ADP or GDP, but not the full conformational change that occurred upon nucleotide hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). A similar intermediate conformational change upon binding GDP relative to binding GTP has been reported for other TRAFAC GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coleman and Sprang, 1999</xref>). Similar to the non-hydrolyzable nucleotides, SpoIVA<sup>T*</sup> and the NKxD variant did not display any conformational change when incubated with ADP or GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Curiously, incubation of WT SpoIVA with either ADP-AlF<sub>x</sub> or GDP-AlF<sub>x</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) produced a conformational change that was similar to that produced upon full hydrolysis of the nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). This suggested that the transition state mimics the activated state facilitated by ATP hydrolysis that is responsible for the conformational change seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. As controls, incubation of the SpoIVA<sup>T*</sup>, which is devoid of the alcoholic residue found to be critical for stabilizing the transition state of the protein-nucleotide complex in TRAFAC GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coleman and Sprang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leipe et al., 2002</xref>), SpoIVA<sup>A*</sup>, or the NKxD variant with ADP-AlF<sub>x</sub> or GDP-AlF<sub>x</sub> did not exhibit a similar conformational change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Taken together, the results suggest that simply binding to ADP or GDP is insufficient to produce the full conformational change in SpoIVA required for polymerization. Instead, hydrolysis of an NTP molecule, while bound to the active site, is required for rearranging SpoIVA into a polymerization-competent state. The data are also consistent with a model in which rapid turnover of the bound NTP is incompatible with producing such a conformational change.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ATP, but not GTP, hydrolysis drives in vitro polymerization of SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup></title><p>Next, we tested the nucleotide-dependent polymerization rates of the SpoIVA variants by measuring the size distribution of polymerized SpoIVA molecules over time using dynamic light scattering (DLS).

Fully polymerized SpoIVA is devoid of any bound nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>), but we wondered if SpoIVA would form an intermediate multimeric complex en route to polymerization whose formation would be dependent specifically on ADP binding before the hydrolyzed nucleotide was released. To test this, we first incubated 2 µM purified SpoIVA, below the threshold concentration for polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), either in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of ATP or GTP, and then separated the products by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). In the absence of nucleotide or the presence of GTP, SpoIVA migrated as a single peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, top left; pink and gray traces). Quantitative mass imaging of this peak by employing interferometric scattering mass spectrometry (iSCAMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Young et al., 2018</xref>) revealed a mass of 103 ± 12 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), similar to a predicted mass for a SpoIVA dimer of 114 kDa. Diluting the peak into a low salt buffer revealed an additional peak at 59 ± 8 kDa, similar to the predicted mass for a SpoIVA monomer of 57 kDa, along with the presumed dimeric peak of 109 ± 14 kDa corresponding to a SpoIVA dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Addition of ATP resulted in shifting most of the protein to the void volume of the SEC column, indicating the formation of a larger complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, top left; blue trace), even though the experiment was performed using a SpoIVA concentration that was below its critical concentration for polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, neither SpoIVA<sup>T*</sup> in the presence ATP or GTP, nor WT SpoIVA in the presence of either ATP-γ-S or ADP, formed a larger complex, indicating that ATP, but not GTP, hydrolysis is required for producing the species in the void volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, top right and bottom left). Interestingly, incubation of SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup> with ATP, but not GTP, partially shifted a population into the void volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, bottom right), indicating that the reengineered SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup> retained its specific dependence on ATP instead of GTP in forming the polymerization-competent intermediate, despite being able to hydrolyze both NTPs. Since the mass of the void volume peak was varied and too large to examine using iSCAMS, we employed size exclusion with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Some et al., 2019</xref>), which revealed a range of molecular weights ranging from 2 × 10<sup>3</sup> kDa to 10<sup>6</sup> kDa, suggesting multimers containing at least ~36 monomers of SpoIVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Examination of this void volume by negative stain and transmission electron microscopy revealed a species with a distinct structure that extensively self-interacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). To check if this larger SpoIVA species may harbor an associated nucleotide, we examined the same peaks that eluted from the SEC column using 254 nm wavelength. Incubating WT SpoIVA or SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup> with GTP did not reveal a significant absorbance at 254 nm for fractions containing protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, top left and bottom right; pink traces), but the protein peaks of the sample in the void volume when incubated with ATP displayed significant absorbance at 254 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, blue traces), suggesting the presence of nucleotide in this fraction. Neither SpoIVA<sup>T*</sup> incubated with ATP nor WT SpoIVA incubated with ATP-γ-S or ADP displayed significant absorbance at 254 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, top right and bottom left), suggesting that the nucleotide present in the void volume multimer of WT SpoIVA is likely ADP retained in the active site after hydrolysis. To confirm this, we extracted the nucleotide from the void volume fraction by denaturing the protein. Separation of the extracted material by SEC revealed that it eluted at a similar volume as ADP, not ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We next tested if the SpoIVA-ADP complex in the void volume observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> is a functional intermediate that can subsequently polymerize once its concentration exceeds the threshold concentration for polymerization. We therefore first incubated purified SpoIVA at low concentration (2 µM, below the threshold concentration for polymerization; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) in the presence and absence of ATP. Half of each sample was then subjected to buffer exchange by SEC to remove free nucleotide. The desalted protein was then concentrated 20-fold using pressure dialysis after which polymerization was assayed by the formation of insoluble SpoIVA in the pellet fraction after ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In parallel, select supernatant and pellet fractions were separated by SEC to detect ATP and ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–J</xref>). Only samples that were incubated with ATP and whose concentration was increased displayed appreciable SpoIVA in the pellet fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Importantly, removing free ATP prior to concentrating the sample also resulted in SpoIVA polymerization, suggesting that pre-incubation with ATP produces a functional ADP-bound SpoIVA multimeric intermediate that can polymerize once its threshold concentration for polymerization is subsequently achieved. Interestingly, while the protein-containing pellet fraction did not contain any bound nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>), the supernatant fraction contained ATP and ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), likely from ATP-bound SpoIVA that had not polymerized and consistent with the release of ADP upon SpoIVA polymerization.</p><p>Taken together, the results are consistent with a model in which SpoIVA, at a low concentration that does not promote polymerization, hydrolyzes ATP to undergo a conformational change and subsequently assembles into heterogeneous high molecular weight multimers that retain the ADP product of hydrolysis.

In contrast, while hydrolysis of GTP drove a conformational change in SpoIVA similar to what was achieved with ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), GTP hydrolysis did not permit formation of the high molecular weight intermediate (and therefore did not permit polymerization), nor did the protein retain GDP after hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Extant SpoIVA, but not SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup>, polymerizes in the presence of limiting level of ATP</title><p>As sporulation proceeds, intracellular ATP levels 2 hr after the induction of sporulation were reported to reach a high of ~1.5 mM while the level of GTP drops to a low of &lt;0.06 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lopez et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lopez et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ochi et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ochi et al., 1981</xref>). This relative abundance of ATP could therefore explain the evolutionary pressure that drove the switch in nucleotide-binding preference from GTP to ATP in SpoIVA. However, the time point at which these measurements were performed is before SpoIVA exerts its function during sporulation. We therefore harvested sporulating cells at various time points by vacuum filtration, extracted total nucleotides using organic solvent, and employed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to quantify the relative abundance of individual nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). Immediately after induction of sporulation, ATP levels remained relatively constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; blue trace, compare ‘pre-induction’ to 0 hr; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), but increased almost twofold by the first hour, before returning to pre-sporulation levels in the second hour.

Assuming a <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cell volume of 2.38 fL and using calculated LC-MS detection efficiencies for ATP and GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fung et al., 2020</xref>), this corresponds to a pre-induction intracellular concentration of ATP of 2.3 mM ±0.89 mM in casein hydrolysate media; the concentration of ATP 3.5 hr after the induction of sporulation corresponds to 1.6 mM ± 0.25 mM, and 0.81 mM ± 0.084 mM at t = 5 hr, after achieving a concentration of 4.5 mM ± 0.044 mM at t = 1 hr. In contrast, GTP, which was present initially at 0.65 mM ± 0.33 mM plummeted to 0.071 mM ±0.034 mM immediately upon induction of sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, pink trace; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Over the next 3.5 hr, GTP levels rose approximately threefold, and ended up twofold higher than at t = 0 after 5 hr. This corresponded to an approximately eightfold excess of ATP over GTP at t = 3.5 hr (intracellular concentration of 0.20 mM ±0.034 mM GTP), and an approximately fivefold excess of ATP at t = 5 hr (intracellular concentration of 0.16 mM ±0.012 GTP).

However, when we examined SpoIVA polymerization at different concentrations of ATP, we observed that while neither SpoIVA nor SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup> were able to polymerize in the presence of 0.06 mM ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), WT SpoIVA, but not SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup>, was able to efficiently polymerize in the presence of an intermediate concentration of ATP (1.5 mM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), similar to what was observed for WT SpoIVA using 4 mM ATP. Thus, although SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup> promiscuously hydrolyzed ATP and GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J</xref>) and could polymerize with excessive ATP (albeit at a slower rate; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6G</xref>), it was unable to polymerize under limiting concentration of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The limiting amounts of ATP (1.5 mM, the approximate amount of intracellular ATP between 3.5 hr and 5 hr of sporulation) therefore suggests a selective pressure that could have driven the initial amino acid substitutions required to switch nucleotide preference from GTP to ATP in SpoIVA and subsequent substitutions to enhance polymerization activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we examined an unusual bacterial cytoskeletal protein, SpoIVA, that hydrolyzes ATP to drive the formation of static polymers. We previously reported that the SpoIVA ATPase is ancestrally derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>) from an Era-like GTPase, a pan-bacterial ribosomal maturation protein belonging to the TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leipe et al., 2002</xref>). We proposed that this likely occurred via a gene duplication event followed by a rapid divergence from the ancestral gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>). To understand the selective pressure underlying the switch in nucleotide specificity of the extant SpoIVA and the mechanistic details governing its function, we sought to restore its ancestral enzymatic (GTPase) activity by re-engineering its nucleotide-binding pocket and examining how the altered protein functioned in vivo and in vitro. Achieving this required altering amino acids in two loops near the base of the bound NTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). First, we partially restored the highly conserved NKxD motif on the G4 loop that has been implicated in conferring GTP-binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dever et al., 1987</xref>) and is highly conserved among GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leipe et al., 2002</xref>), but is altered in SpoIVA. Second, we altered the sequence (SxE in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> SpoIVA) in the G5 loop that is less conserved among GTPases (SAx). This approach resulted in a protein whose enzymatic activity operated in a parameter space similar to that of the ancestral Era GTPase and hydrolyzed GTP with a slight preference over ATP in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and 1</xref>). Additionally, the altered protein was able to exploit the energy released by hydrolysis of either ATP or GTP to drive a critical conformational change required for polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Despite the ability of this protein to undergo an initial conformational change upon hydrolyzing either nucleotide, the protein only polymerized in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), suggesting that the nucleotide base, and not just the energy released from nucleotide hydrolysis, was required for protein function.</p><p>This requirement for ATP led us to propose that the scarcity of GTP during the late stages of sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) could have helped drive the evolution of SpoIVA to preferentially utilize ATP. Indeed, amino acid starvation and the onset of stationary phase are known to result in a reduction in GTP and GDP levels, which coincides with an increase in the production of the nucleotide alarmones (p)ppGpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kriel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ochi et al., 1981</xref>). This drop in GTP level has also been implicated in the initiation of sporulation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lopez et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ochi et al., 1982</xref>), possibly through derepressing the activity of the CodY transcription factor that represses sporulation initiation genes by directly sensing GTP via its ligand-binding GAF domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aravind and Ponting, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brinsmade, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sonenshein, 2005</xref>). Here, we showed that GTP and GDP scarcity continued even 3.5–5 h after the initiation of sporulation, when SpoIVA is actively assembling the spore coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peluso et al., 2019</xref>), which suggests a selective pressure that drove the switch in nucleotide specificity in SpoIVA from GTP to ATP. Consistent with this notion, we observed that physiological levels of intracellular ATP, but not GTP, facilitate the requisite conformational changes in SpoIVA and SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). This pressure caused by low levels of GTP is likely constrained by the fact that (p)ppGpp actively inhibits GTP production; in fact, artificially elevating GTP levels during nutrient limitation was shown to be detrimental to the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kriel et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the apparent requirement for low GTP levels during sporulation likely drove SpoIVA to utilize the more abundant ATP, rather than force the cell to generate more GTP.</p><p>One puzzling observation was that SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup>, which promiscuously hydrolyzed ATP and GTP, functioned similar to the extant SpoIVA in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which led us to wonder why the protein needed to have evolved further. However, when we employed a more sensitive assay which monitored the kinetics of SpoIVA polymerization in vitro, we found that, at an intermediate concentration of ATP that resembles the in vivo intracellular concentration of ATP during the late stages of sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), the extant SpoIVA polymerized more robustly than did SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup>. Thus, after GTP levels have dropped at the end of the sporulation program, and when ATP also gradually depletes, the extant SpoIVA has apparently evolved to better utilize ATP to drive efficient polymerization. We can speculate that the evolution from hydrolyzing GTP to ATP likely started with changing the Lys in the NKxD motif of Era to Ser in the ancestral SpoIVA, since any combination of SpoIVA mutants tested in this study that retain the Lys was not functional in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), likely due to elevated nucleotide hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, this substitution appears to have modulated the enzyme activity, probably allowing the appropriate conformational changes to occur upon nucleotide binding. The next likely change was the loss of the Asp in the G4 NKxD motif, which was shown previously to confer GTP specificity to other TRAFAC GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cool et al., 1999</xref>), and which resulted in a slight increase in catalytic efficiency and preference for ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), yet did not abrogate SpoIVA function in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Finally, the substitutions in the G5 loop such as the emergence of a polar position two residues downstream of the serine (<italic>Glu in B. subtilis</italic>) in the G5 loop of the extant SpoIVA contributed to the higher catalytic efficiency and preference for ATP we observe in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and the more efficient polymerization we observed at the lower ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Consistent with this model we find this mutational route to yield the most direct stepwise progression of catalytic efficiency of NTP hydrolysis from Era to extant SpoIVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Our studies also revealed a stable polymerization intermediate that could explain the specific functional dependence of SpoIVA on ATP. At a low concentration of SpoIVA, which did not permit polymerization, we observed that SpoIVA formed a heterogeneous population of high molecular weight multimers in the presence of ATP, and not GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Further experiments revealed that formation of these multimers required ATP hydrolysis and that, in the absence of polymerization, the multimers bound the hydrolyzed nucleotide (ADP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) and were capable of polymerizing after subsequent removal of free ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–J</xref>). Our working model for SpoIVA polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) proposes that ATP hydrolysis results in the formation of high molecular weight SpoIVA multimers that stably bind ADP (when SpoIVA is present below the critical concentration for polymerization).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for the nucleotide-specific polymerization of SpoIVA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Depicted is a SpoIVA dimer (green equilateral triangles; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) that binds to ATP, resulting in a conformational change. Hydrolysis of the bound ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) drives a second conformational change in SpoIVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E</xref>). The inorganic phosphate is released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>), but the ADP remains bound temporarily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), which we propose mediates multimerization of SpoIVA to form an assembly intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). At high enough concentration of SpoIVA, the ADP is released as SpoIVA multimers form static polymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–J</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) In the presence of high concentration of GTP, GTP hydrolysis by SpoIVA drives a conformational change in the protein similar to that observed in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, GDP is prematurely released, SpoIVA fails to form the assembly intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>), and thus SpoIVA polymerization does not occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65845-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Several GTPases of the septin-GIMAP-dynamin clade within the TRAFAC class form oligomeric or polymeric assemblies typically in the proximity of lipid membranes and are involved in several aspects of membrane dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwefel et al., 2010</xref>). SpoIVA represents a further independent example of the emergence of such polymerization activity within the TRAFAC class. However, some aspects of its dynamic oligomerization into higher order structures specifically resemble certain members of the septin-GIMAP-dynamin clade of GTPases. In particular, the ADP-dependent multimerization of SpoIVA is reminiscent of the manner in which septins multimerize when bound to GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zeraik et al., 2014</xref>). Since the final SpoIVA polymer is nucleotide-free (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>), the model predicts that polymerization of SpoIVA multimers, which only occurs when the concentration of SpoIVA exceeds a threshold concentration, releases the bound ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The transient binding of ADP to a polymerization intermediate is consistent with our previous observation that while phosphate is rapidly released upon ATP hydrolysis, release of the resulting ADP is slightly delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, although the extant SpoIVA can hydrolyze GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the residues required to retain the hydrolyzed nucleotide are presumably no longer present, resulting in GDP release, which precludes formation of the NDP-bound multimeric intermediate required for polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This situation in a static structural protein, where either nucleotide may be accommodated but only one nucleotide promotes full function, is reminiscent of the binding of GTP by the enzyme adenylate kinase, wherein GTP binding arrests the protein in a catalytically inhibited conformation, but ATP binding permits large structural changes in the enzyme required for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rogne et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Multiple examples in biology feature GTP-binding proteins that most commonly exploit nucleotide binding and hydrolysis as a timer or switch to relay a signal, whereas ATP is usually used by proteins participating in energy-intensive processes to perform work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberts, 2002</xref>). Since SpoIVA ultimately forms a static polymer and does not perform obvious work like a motor protein, the purpose of its ATP utilization had been mysterious. One implication of our model is that SpoIVA retained the ancestral ‘switch’ function of TRAFAC GTPases (nucleotide hydrolysis-dependent triggering of a conformational change). Indeed, it is likely that the precursor of SpoIVA was initially recruited for a structural role due to the capacity of GTPases to form nucleotide-dependent oligomeric assemblies in proximity to membranes as also observed in the GIMAP-septin-dynamin clade. However, as it became fixed for this function in the context of sporulation, SpoIVA appears to have substituted ATP for GTP as the molecule that mediates the switch because of the relative scarcity of GTP during the late stages of sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lopez et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lopez et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ochi et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ochi et al., 1981</xref>). Functionally, this activity also resembles that of certain ATPases in the STAND clade of P-loop NTPases of the AAA+ class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leipe et al., 2004</xref>). These NTPases, which include the apoptosis regulator Apaf-1 and the bacterial AfsR-like transcription regulators, employ ATP (and in some cases GTP) hydrolysis to transmit a conformational change to an effector domain to convey a signal, rather than perform a motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Danot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leipe et al., 2004</xref>). In the future, detailed structural analyses of SpoIVA will likely yield insights into additional residues that evolved to increase the specificity of ATP binding and provide an atomic-scale mechanism for ATP-dependent multimerization and polymerization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Calbiochem, Millipore) was added to 1 mM ﬁnal concentration to induce protein production and each culture was grown for 4 hr at 37°C. Harvested cells (which could be stored at −80°C) were resuspended in 25 ml of ice-cold Buffer A (50 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) and disrupted by French Pressure Cell Press (SLM Aminco) at 12,000 psi. All subsequent steps were performed on ice. Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 1 hr at 4°C and the cleared lysate was loaded on a single gravity column containing 3 ml of Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN), pre-equilibrated with ice-cold Buffer A, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Upon flow-through of the clarified lysate, the column was washed with 50 ml Wash Buffer I (Buffer A containing 20 mM imidazole), followed by 4 ml Wash Buffer II (Buffer A containing 80 mM imidazole). Protein was eluted with 10 ml ice-cold Elution buffer (Buffer A containing 250 mM imidazole). Imidazole was removed from eluted fractions using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare; 3.3 ml eluate/PD-10 desalting column) and eluted using 4 ml Buffer A. Peak fractions were identiﬁed using NanoDrop A<sub>280</sub> (ND-1000, Thermo Scientific), pooled, separated by ion exchange chromatography (Mono Q 5/50, GE Healthcare), and then eluted with a step-wise gradient of 150–1000 mM NaCl; His<sub>6</sub>-SpoIVA routinely eluted at 0.4 M NaCl. Puriﬁed protein was stored at 4°C and was used in less than 48 hr after puriﬁcation due to precipitation of the protein upon prolonged storage. For long-term storage, samples were flash-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C. To assess the multimerization of SpoIVA and variants, 2 µM purified WT or T* SpoIVA variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaing et al., 2013</xref>) was incubated with no NTP, 4 mM ATP, or 4 mM GTP in Buffer B (50 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) for 4 hr at 37°C. 700 µl of each sample was then passed through a 0.22 µm filter and separated using a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) with Buffer B at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. For assessing the presence of ATP and ADP, where indicated, samples were heated at 95°C for 20 min to release protein bound nucleotide, centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and the supernatant separated using Superdex 30 Increase 10/30 GL size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) with 50 mM Tris at pH 7.5 at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min.

The authors identified changes in active site amino acids that accomplished the change in nucleotide specificity.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Resurrection of ancestral GTPase activity in an extant ATPase reveals a nucleotide base requirement for function&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Setlow (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Indeed, while all of us thought that your study addresses an interesting research question and that the mutagenesis and general characterization of the mutant proteins was well performed, the expert reviewers identified several shortcomings in your study. These shortcomings were on one hand related to missing experimental data that seem essential to support the conclusions of your manuscript and on the other hand the somewhat biased experimental setup.</p><p>While ancestor resurrection can be a powerful approach to provide insights into protein evolution and specialization, your study was not considered to follow the usual approaches that allow the identification of ancestral proteins.

However, the published data on this aspect seem to have addressed a time point of max. 2 hr after sporulation induction, which might be before SpoIVA's function. Getting definitive data for levels of ATP/GTP in the sporulating cell at around the time that SpoIVA is active would therefore be crucial to support your central argument. While the reviewers appreciate that these experiments are not trivial, definitive data on this point using current technology could be important not only for this manuscript but for the sporulation field as a whole.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, Updegrove and colleagues investigated the role of ATP versus GTP hydrolysis in the oligomerization of SpoIVA during <italic>B. subtilis</italic> sporulation. Authors form the same group previously showed that SpoIVA contains a TRAFAC class GTPase domain that uses ATP hydrolysis rather than GTP hydrolysis to perform its function. They further previously showed that ATP hydrolysis rather than ATP binding is required to induce conformational changes in the SpoIVA subunit that drive incorporation into nucleotide-free SpoIVA polymeric filaments. In the current study the authors re-engineered the binding pocket of SpoIVA toward the (presumed) ancestral counterpart displaying equal catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) toward ATP and GTP. Interestingly they find that, unlike ATP hydrolysis, GTP hydrolysis does not support SpoIVA polymerization in vitro. This indicates that apparently also the nucleotide base plays a role in protein function, rather than just the energy release from phosphodiester bond hydrolysis. Although this is a very interesting finding per se, mechanistic insights regarding either the processes leading to protein oligomerization or the presumed role of the nucleotide base in this process are rather limited. I also have a number of questions and doubts regarding the experimental support for some of the claims that are being made, as outlined below.</p><p>1) It is not entirely clear to me what the added value is of the re-engineering toward an ancestral protein with equal k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> values for GTP and ATP for the final conclusions. Wild-type SpoIVA displays only a relatively marginal preference (somewhat more than three-fold) for ATP over GTP? Moreover, wild-type SpoIVA in fact uses GTP more efficiently than the resurrected SpoIVA. Why didn't the authors just use wild-type SpoIVA to show that GTP does not induce polymerization in vitro?</p><p>2) In Figure 2—figure supplement 1 the Michaelis-Menten curves for GTP and ATP hydrolysis are shown. Also, the resulting k<sub>cat</sub> and K<sub>M</sub> values should be reported (rather than just k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>).</p><p>From the curves it seems that the K<sub>M</sub> values for ATP and GTP hydrolysis are rather severely affected for the resurrected SpoIVA (NSxD SxA), potentially leading to a large error on the fitted parameters (due to saturation not being reached). Under these circumstances one can also doubt how much of the protein is being bound under the substrate conditions used in most other experiments (generally 4 mM ATP or GTP is used which seems to be not saturating for ATP).</p><p>3) Subsection “ATP, but not GTP, hydrolysis drives in vitro polymerization of resurrected SpoIVA<italic>”</italic> and Figure 4A/B. The authors make the observation that mutants NKxR SxE, NKxD SxE, NKxD AxA are not able to utilize the energy released from hydrolysis of either ATP or GTP to drive conformational changes in the protein. This while these mutants hydrolyze ATP or GTP equally well, and even better, than wild-type SpoIVA. This observation is both rather strange and intriguing. However, to prove that the conformational change and protection from proteolysis is really due to hydrolysis and not merely to nucleotide binding, it is required that this experiment is also performed in presence of ADP/GDP, non-hydrolyzing analogues of ATP and GTP (e.g. ATPgammaS or GTPgammaS), and potentially also transition state analogues such as ADP.AlFx and GDP.AlFx.</p><p>Related to the remark above: the experiments shown in Figure 4A are done with 4 mM ATP or GTP and thus under multiple turnover conditions. This means that every enzyme molecule presumably went through subsequent rounds of substrate turnover. The main nucleotide state the protein resides in at any particular moment would thus depend on the relative rate of substrate binding, chemical turnover and product release. Could the authors comment on the main nucleotide state SpoIVA would be in during limited proteolysis?</p><p>4) Subsection “Formation of an ADP-bound SpoIVA multimeric intermediate is required for polymerization”. The authors report that addition of ATP to SpoIVA, below its critical concentration of polymerization, resulted to a shift of the peak on SEC toward the void volume.</p><p>– This seems to contradict what was reported in Castaing et al., 2013, where the authors (from the same group) report that &quot;presence or absence of ATP did not affect the oligomerization state of IVA&quot; at a concentration of 2µM.</p><p>– The SEC-MALS experiment should also be performed in presence of ADP (and preferentially a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, which differs from the strategy of using a protein variant where one of the main crucial switch residues has been mutated!).</p><p>– Subsection “Formation of an ADP-bound SpoIVA multimeric intermediate is required for polymerization” and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C: In the SEC-MALS experiment the authors find a peak (see above) in the void volume, and the MALS analysis reveals a varying range of molecular masses ranging from 10E6 to 5.10E3 kDa. The authors interpret this as &quot;at least 36 monomers&quot; and in Figure 7 this becomes ∼ 16 dimers. Using a subunit molecular mass of 57kDA, a quick calculation shows that the peak would contain species ranging between 35 and about 15000 subunit copies, which might just as well correspond to aggregates rather than an &quot;on-pathway&quot; intermediate. The authors could for example use (negative stain) EM to investigate the nature of the species in the void volume and make that distinction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper describes work on the SpoIVA protein essential for spore coat assembly during sporulation of the bacterial spore-former <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. SpoIVA uses ATP hydrolysis to drive its polymerization on the outside of the developing spore, providing a framework for coat assembly. However, SpoIVA appears to have evolved from an ancestor that preferentially used GTP not ATP. The authors have made multiple amino acid changes in residues involved in NTP hydrolysis/recognition, converting present SpoIVA to a protein using GTP as well as ATP – at least in vitro. The catalytic efficiency of the wt and ultimate mutant (SpoIVAresurrected) protein in vitro, was ~4-fold higher with ATP than GTP for wt SpoIVA but ~1 for SpoIVAresurrected. This difference is likely bigger in vivo since intracellular [ATP] is ~ 5-fold higher than [GTP]. Since [GTP] is reported to fall significantly in sporulation, the authors suggest that this factor is what drove the evolution of SpoIVA to preferentially use ATP.</p><p>The authors' mutagenesis, analyses of wt and mutant proteins' ATP and GTP hydrolysis in vitro at different [NTP], in vitro polymerization of proteins with either NTP, and sporulation efficiency with the wt, resurrected strain and other mutants all seems well done. Surprisingly, the resurrected SpoIVA protein completely complemented sporulation of a spoIVA mutant.</p><p>1) Following all the data in the ms and drawing conclusions was difficult since there was no Table summarizing mutants' behavior in vivo and in vitro. It was also difficult to assess the likely preference of ATP/GTP in vivo, as presumably the catalytic efficiencies reported for the variants in vitro is at saturating [ATP] and [GTP] and in vivo [GTP] is usually ~5-fold lower than [ATP] and presumably much less early in sporulation (see #2). Overall, it was not easy to see why SpoIVA likely preferred ATP over GTP in sporulation for both the wt and resurrected strain. A Table summarizing various properties of various SpoIVA proteins in vitro and in vivo would be helpful to the reader.</p><p>2) The basis for suggesting that low GTP levels in sporulation drove changes in NTP preference in SpoIVA is work from Ernst Freese years ago that showed significant drops in [GTP] upon sporulation induction by various conditions, and this may be correct. However, this work reported results only for 2 hr after sporulation induction, and probably before SpoIVA functions. Whether GTP levels are low this late in sporulation is not known. Indeed, since protein and RNA synthesis continue in the mother cell during sporulation, GTP must be continuously available. Unfortunately, there are no analyses of NTPs' levels throughout sporulation.</p><p>3) The NTP levels determined by Freese were from culture samples filtered and then the filters floated on formic acid; this took ~8 sec. While values for energy charge (ATP + 0.5 ADP/ATP + AMP + ADP) were what one would have expected for growing bacteria, if GTP turns over more rapidly than ATP, GTP levels determined might be lower than they really are.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript, Updegrove et al., use the unique ATPase SpoIVA from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> as a model to investigate a fundamental question: Does nucleotide identity dictate hydrolysis-driven protein function? In previous work, the authors pointed out that TRAFAC GTPases, and in particular bacterial Era, likely share a common ancestor. SpoIVA is a cytoskeletal protein that uses its ATPase activity to form terminal polymers in an initial step of Bacillus spore formation. Hence, it appears that SpoIVA evolved ATPase activity from a GTPase scaffold to cope with the cellular conditions met during spore formation. Specifically, as the authors argue in the current manuscript, this change may have been driven by limiting GTP concentrations under conditions that drive spore formation, whereas ATP would still be available at higher levels under the same conditions.</p><p>To investigate the mechanistic consequences of turning SpoIVA into an Era-like GTPase, targeted mutagenesis at well-established signature motifs that determine substrate preference in these enzymes was employed. One particular mutant, called SpoIVA-resurrected, does not discriminate between ATP or GTP, hydrolyzing both substrates at near-equal efficiency and at efficiencies similar to Era (although with reduced ATPase activity compared to wild-type SpoIVA). In cells, SpoIVA-resurrected supports sporulation at levels similar to wild-type SpoIVA. In tryptic digests, wild-type and &quot;resurrected&quot; SpoIVA are both stabilized by ATP and GTP. For wild-type SpoIVA, polymerization (above a critical protein concentration for polymerization) and an intermediate (below a critical protein concentration) was detected only with ATP. The intermediate was shown to corresponds to an ADP-bound, post-hydrolysis state. Finally, it was shown that SpoIVA-resurrected has comparatively reduced sensitivity to ATP concentrations, with wild-type SpoIVA polymerizing at much lower ATP levels.</p><p>While the work addresses a fundamental question, major concerns regarding the approach used to investigate the evolution of functional specialization of GTPases and ATPases dampen enthusiasm for this study. Also, the molecular mechanism responsible for the biochemical differences between SpoIVA and SpoIVA-resurrected remains enigmatic, which, together with alternative explanations for the apparent differences in polymerzation and other caveats, may limit the perceived impact.</p><p>1) Ancestor resurrection has become a popular method for rationalizing the evolution of structural and/or functional properties in related proteins. Usually, the approach involves statistical methods to predict the evolution of proteins or domains based on phylogeny, taking into account conservation across their entire sequence. Here, the authors focus exclusively on functional motifs in the active site of SpoIVA (and Era). This is a fairly targeted analysis that does not take into account residues in the periphery of the nucleotide binding site (or the protein as a whole) that could contribute to substrate specificity, catalytic efficiency, and/or switching. One concern is that by doing so, the authors may miss residues or regions in the protein, which may co-evolve with the active-site motifs, shaping the functional properties of the entire protein.</p><p>It is recommended to use one of the now common approaches to resurrect the last common ancestor of SpoIVA and Era (see e.g. 10.1146/annurev-biophys-070816-033631), and study its properties in an unbiased fashion (e.g., What sequence motifs emerge? What is its activity and substrate profile? Does it polymerize and/or form hydrolysis-dependent oligomers?).</p><p>2) The authors use Era, &quot;ancestral Era GTPase&quot;, and the ancestor interchangeably (e.g., subsection “The altered NKxD motif in G4 and SxE sequence in G5 mediate nucleotide specificity of SpoIVA”, but common throughout the manuscript). However, Era appears to be an extant enzyme that likely evolved independently after the emergence of SpoIVA, which may have further contributed to the specialization of the two proteins compared to a common ancestor. Careful separation between extant Era and SpoIVA and predicted common ancestors would avoid the potential for confusion.</p><p>3) If the targeted changes in the primary active site motifs fully recapitulate the evolutionary and functional differences between SpoIVA and Era, one may predict that the corresponding changes in Era would result in SpoIVA-like properties. This would be a crucial experiment to consider for this study.</p><p>4) While the type of mutations introduced into SpoIVA was guided by sequence comparison with Era-type GTPases, it appears that the authors chose the mutant they refer to as the resurrected ancestor based on the activity profile that matches most closely the catalytic characteristics of Era, and not necessarily based on the phylogenic analysis. This practice introduces bias that may hamper the analysis concerning the evolution of substrate specificity.</p><p>In this context, it is also not clear why the authors assume that the last common ancestor of SpoIVA and Era had Era-like hydrolysis efficiencies and substrate preference.</p><p>5) The authors also did not consider the potential impact the register shift in G5 between SpoIVA (sequence SxE) and Era (sequence SA) may have, only focusing on the sequence register found in SpoIVA. It is conceivable that the additional residue in this motif arose to accommodate an ATP preference and ATPase-driven mechanism.</p><p>6) It is not clear whether the defects in polymerization characteristics of the SpoIVA-resurrected mutant can be attributed to the lower ATPase activity compared to wild-type SpoIVA (or other subtle changes introduced by the mutations). It is also not clear whether SpoIVA-resurrected forms a similar ATPase-dependent intermediate that was oberserved with wild-type SpoIVA (at protein concentrations below the threshold for polymerization). This is an important experiment since the differences between ATP and GTP in their capacity to drive intermediate formation could be explained by the different ATPase vs GTPase efficiencies of the wild-type protein; SpoIVA-resurrected has overall lower catalytic activity compared to wild-type, and it does not support polymerization. Hence, there is a possibility that the observed differences can be attributed to catalytic efficiency (maybe in addition to the nature of the nucleotide base).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65845.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Additionally, we have made two changes that clarify our approach:</p><p>1) We have modified Figure 1C to accentuate the fact that SpoIVA contains additional (unique) domains compared to Era (the gray ovals for the additional domains have been enlarged).</p><p>2) We understand that the term “resurrection” might have been construed as following a specific computational approach.

In the revised manuscript, in collaboration with Profs. Jade Wang and Daniel Amador-Noguez (University of Wisconsin), we report the levels and calculated intracellular concentrations of ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP, ADP, GDP, CDP, UDP, AMP, GMP, CMP, UMP, and the nucleotide alarmones ppGpp and pGpp immediately prior to and after induction of sporulation, and at t = 1, 2, 3.5, and 5 h after sporulation induction. The results, presented in a new Figure 6 revealed that ATP levels are indeed ~5-8-fold higher than GTP, depending on the time of sporulation. Moreover, we show that the reduced level of ATP promoted robust polymerization of the extant (WT) SpoIVA, but not the reengineered SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup>, suggesting that, along with scarcity of GTP, reduced ATP levels could provide the selective pressure that drove SpoIVA to optimally utilize ATP. We agree that this data will be useful to the sporulation community as a whole.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study, Updegrove and colleagues investigated the role of ATP versus GTP hydrolysis in the oligomerization of SpoIVA during <italic>B. subtilis</italic> sporulation.

This while these mutants hydrolyze ATP or GTP equally well, and even better, than wild-type SpoIVA. This observation is both rather strange and intriguing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and were also initially baffled by this result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, to prove that the conformational change and protection from proteolysis is really due to hydrolysis and not merely to nucleotide binding, it is required that this experiment is also performed in presence of ADP/GDP, non-hydrolyzing analogues of ATP and GTP (e.g. ATPgammaS or GTPgammaS), and potentially also transition state analogues such as ADP.AlFx and GDP.AlFx.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the requested experiments and the results are now displayed in a new Figure 4C-F, where we compare conformational changes in SpoIVA after exposure to ATP/GTP, ATP-γ-S/GTP-γ-S, ADP/GDP, and ADP-AlFx/GDP-AlFx; the data are now discussed extensively in a new paragraph (subsection “Hydrolysis of either ATP or GTP can drive a conformational change in SpoIVA”). The results of the experiment now permit the conclusion that simply binding to ADP or GDP is insufficient to produce the full conformational change in SpoIVA required for polymerization. Instead, SpoIVA polymerization requires two things: (1) the hydrolysis of an NTP molecule, and (2) retention of the substrate within the active site, as evidenced by the ability of ADP-AlFx/GDP-AlFx, but not ADP/GDP, to produce a conformational change similar to ATP/GTP hydrolysis. Additionally, the data allowed us to suggest that rapid turnover (hydrolysis and release) of an NTP is incompatible with producing the conformational change. This turned out to be an incredibly informative set of experiments- we thank the referee for suggesting it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the remark above: the experiments shown in Figure 4A are done with 4 mM ATP or GTP and thus under multiple turnover conditions. This means that every enzyme molecule presumably went through subsequent rounds of substrate turnover. The main nucleotide state the protein resides in at any particular moment would thus depend on the relative rate of substrate binding, chemical turnover and product release. Could the authors comment on the main nucleotide state SpoIVA would be in during limited proteolysis?</p></disp-quote><p>Since the proteolysis experiment occurs after 4 hours of exposure to excess ATP or GTP, and at a concentration below the critical concentration for polymerization, the SpoIVA in these experiments is likely in the ADP/GDP bound state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Formation of an ADP-bound SpoIVA multimeric intermediate is required for polymerization” The authors report that addition of ATP to SpoIVA, below its critical concentration of polymerization, resulted to a shift of the peak on SEC toward the void volume.</p><p>– This seems to contradict what was reported in Castaing et al., 2013, where the authors (from the same group) report that &quot;presence or absence of ATP did not affect the oligomerization state of IVA&quot; at a concentration of 2µM.</p></disp-quote><p>We also recognized this discrepancy, which is what prompted us to modify the polymerization model to include an ADP-bound, higher molecular weight, polymerization-competent intermediate. We can provide three possible explanations to explain the difference. First, compared to Castaing et al., the SpoIVA purification protocol is slightly different. After Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography yields three separate peaks of SpoIVA. In 2013 (Castaing et al.,) we determined that the SpoIVA population in the third peak polymerized most robustly in an ATP-dependent manner and therefore used that fraction for the report. Later, we discovered, using DLS and negative stain TEM, that peak 3 was also the most heterogeneous in terms of size and hydrodynamic radius, suggesting that this fraction may have already formed the polymerization intermediate (which may be why it readily polymerized). The second peak yielded largely homogeneous SpoIVA that was clearly a dimer, which is the fraction that we have used in this study, and which clearly formed the heterogeneous polymerization-competent assembly intermediate upon ATP addition. Secondly, in Castaing et al., we used a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (MW range: 10,000 to 600,000 Da) to separate SpoIVA products after the size exclusion chromatography step; in the current report we used a Superose 6 column (MW range: 5,000-5,000,000 Da), which has a larger separation range. A final possible explanation, which is likely less relevant, is that the Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration used for polymerization reactions differed. In Castaing et al., (and earlier in Ramamurthi et al., 2008), we used 10 mM MgCl2 for polymerization reactions. At this concentration, polymerization reactions were routinely inconsistent in that some preparations of the wild type protein would not polymerize. At that time, we (incorrectly) attributed this to batch-to-batch variations in protein purification. Subsequent to those reports, we carefully titrated each buffer component and discovered that 5 mM MgCl2 in the reaction buffer surprisingly gave us extremely consistent polymerization reactions. Thus, a combination of improved protein purification techniques and reaction conditions allowed us in this to more carefully isolate reaction intermediates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The SEC-MALS experiment should also be performed in presence of ADP (and preferentially a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, which differs from the strategy of using a protein variant where one of the main crucial switch residues has been mutated!).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we thank the reviewer for suggesting this experiment. In the revised Figure 5B-C, we now report that incubation of WT SpoIVA with either ADP or the non-hydrolyzable ATP-γ-S analogue of ATP abrogates formation of the ADP-bound polymerization intermediate. Taken together with the inability of the SpoIVA sensor T-variant that is able to bind, but not hydrolyze, ATP, we can now more confidently conclude that ATP hydrolysis is a requirement for formation of the polymerization intermediate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Formation of an ADP-bound SpoIVA multimeric intermediate is required for polymerization” and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C: In the SEC-MALS experiment the authors find a peak (see above) in the void volume, and the MALS analysis reveals a varying range of molecular masses ranging from 10E6 to 5.10E3 kDa. The authors interpret this as &quot;at least 36 monomers&quot; and in Figure 7 this becomes ∼ 16 dimers. Using a subunit molecular mass of 57kDA, a quick calculation shows that the peak would contain species ranging between 35 and about 15000 subunit copies, which might just as well correspond to aggregates rather than an &quot;on-pathway&quot; intermediate. The authors could for example use (negative stain) EM to investigate the nature of the species in the void volume and make that distinction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now analyzed the void volume fraction by TEM. The images, reported in a new Figure 5D, indicate somewhat regularly shaped particles that clump together in solution, which may explain the variability of size in this fraction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper describes work on the SpoIVA protein essential for spore coat assembly during sporulation of the bacterial spore-former <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. SpoIVA uses ATP hydrolysis to drive its polymerization on the outside of the developing spore, providing a framework for coat assembly. However, SpoIVA appears to have evolved from an ancestor that preferentially used GTP not ATP. The authors have made multiple amino acid changes in residues involved in NTP hydrolysis/recognition, converting present SpoIVA to a protein using GTP as well as ATP – at least in vitro. The catalytic efficiency of the wt and ultimate mutant (SpoIVAresurrected) protein in vitro, was ~4-fold higher with ATP than GTP for wt SpoIVA but ~1 for SpoIVAresurrected. This difference is likely bigger in vivo since intracellular [ATP] is ~ 5-fold higher than [GTP]. Since [GTP] is reported to fall significantly in sporulation, the authors suggest that this factor is what drove the evolution of SpoIVA to preferentially use ATP.</p><p>The authors' mutagenesis, analyses of wt and mutant proteins' ATP and GTP hydrolysis in vitro at different [NTP], in vitro polymerization of proteins with either NTP, and sporulation efficiency with the wt, resurrected strain and other mutants all seems well done. Surprisingly, the resurrected SpoIVA protein completely complemented sporulation of a spoIVA mutant.</p><p>1) Following all the data in the ms and drawing conclusions was difficult since there was no Table summarizing mutants' behavior in vivo and in vitro. It was also difficult to assess the likely preference of ATP/GTP in vivo, as presumably the catalytic efficiencies reported for the variants in vitro is at saturating [ATP] and [GTP] and in vivo [GTP] is usually ~5-fold lower than [ATP] and presumably much less early in sporulation (see #2). Overall, it was not easy to see why SpoIVA likely preferred ATP over GTP in sporulation for both the wt and resurrected strain. A Table summarizing various properties of various SpoIVA proteins in vitro and in vivo would be helpful to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have now included a new Table S2 that summarizes all of the in vivo and in vitro data for the behavior of the different SpoIVA variants. In addition, as requested by reviewer 1, Supplementary file 2 also contains the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub> values used to calculate the catalytic efficiencies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The basis for suggesting that low GTP levels in sporulation drove changes in NTP preference in SpoIVA is work from Ernst Freese years ago that showed significant drops in [GTP] upon sporulation induction by various conditions, and this may be correct. However, this work reported results only for 2 hr after sporulation induction, and probably before SpoIVA functions. Whether GTP levels are low this late in sporulation is not known. Indeed, since protein and RNA synthesis continue in the mother cell during sporulation, GTP must be continuously available. Unfortunately, there are no analyses of NTPs' levels throughout sporulation.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we utilized LC-MS to measure ATP and GTP levels at various time points after induction of sporulation. In addition, we assessed the levels of CTP, UTP, ADP, GDP, CDP, UDP, AMP, GMP, CMP, UMP, and the nucleotide alarmones ppGpp and pGpp. These data are presented in a new Figure 6C-6F and show that ATP levels are ~8-fold higher than that of GTP at t=3.5 hours after induction of sporulation, when SpoIVA is maximally active. ATP levels remain ~5-fold higher at t=5 hours. The data also provide a global landscape of nucleotide availability as sporangia proceed to dormancy that we hope will be a valuable reference for sporulation researchers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The NTP levels determined by Freese were from culture samples filtered and then the filters floated on formic acid; this took ~8 sec. While values for energy charge (ATP + 0.5 ADP/ATP + AMP + ADP) were what one would have expected for growing bacteria, if GTP turns over more rapidly than ATP, GTP levels determined might be lower than they really are.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In the manuscript, Updegrove et al., use the unique ATPase SpoIVA from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> as a model to investigate a fundamental question: Does nucleotide identity dictate hydrolysis-driven protein function? In previous work, the authors pointed out that TRAFAC GTPases, and in particular bacterial Era, likely share a common ancestor. SpoIVA is a cytoskeletal protein that uses its ATPase activity to form terminal polymers in an initial step of Bacillus spore formation. Hence, it appears that SpoIVA evolved ATPase activity from a GTPase scaffold to cope with the cellular conditions met during spore formation. Specifically, as the authors argue in the current manuscript, this change may have been driven by limiting GTP concentrations under conditions that drive spore formation, whereas ATP would still be available at higher levels under the same conditions.</p><p>To investigate the mechanistic consequences of turning SpoIVA into an Era-like GTPase, targeted mutagenesis at well-established signature motifs that determine substrate preference in these enzymes was employed. One particular mutant, called SpoIVA-resurrected, does not discriminate between ATP or GTP, hydrolyzing both substrates at near-equal efficiency and at efficiencies similar to Era (although with reduced ATPase activity compared to wild-type SpoIVA). In cells, SpoIVA-resurrected supports sporulation at levels similar to wild-type SpoIVA. In tryptic digests, wild-type and &quot;resurrected&quot; SpoIVA are both stabilized by ATP and GTP. For wild-type SpoIVA, polymerization (above a critical protein concentration for polymerization) and an intermediate (below a critical protein concentration) was detected only with ATP. The intermediate was shown to corresponds to an ADP-bound, post-hydrolysis state. Finally, it was shown that SpoIVA-resurrected has comparatively reduced sensitivity to ATP concentrations, with wild-type SpoIVA polymerizing at much lower ATP levels.</p><p>While the work addresses a fundamental question, major concerns regarding the approach used to investigate the evolution of functional specialization of GTPases and ATPases dampen enthusiasm for this study. Also, the molecular mechanism responsible for the biochemical differences between SpoIVA and SpoIVA-resurrected remains enigmatic, which, together with alternative explanations for the apparent differences in polymerzation and other caveats, may limit the perceived impact.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating the fundamental question we are trying to address and have addressed each of the specific concerns that they raised with additional experiments to more clearly reveal a molecular mechanism of SpoIVA polymerization</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Ancestor resurrection has become a popular method for rationalizing the evolution of structural and/or functional properties in related proteins. Usually, the approach involves statistical methods to predict the evolution of proteins or domains based on phylogeny, taking into account conservation across their entire sequence. Here, the authors focus exclusively on functional motifs in the active site of SpoIVA (and Era). This is a fairly targeted analysis that does not take into account residues in the periphery of the nucleotide binding site (or the protein as a whole) that could contribute to substrate specificity, catalytic efficiency, and/or switching. One concern is that by doing so, the authors may miss residues or regions in the protein, which may co-evolve with the active-site motifs, shaping the functional properties of the entire protein.</p><p>It is recommended to use one of the now common approaches to resurrect the last common ancestor of SpoIVA and Era (see e.g. 10.1146/annurev-biophys-070816-033631), and study its properties in an unbiased fashion (e.g., What sequence motifs emerge? What is its activity and substrate profile? Does it polymerize and/or form hydrolysis-dependent oligomers?).</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that our use of the term “resurrection” could have implied a particular computational approach that has certainly been successful in objectively reconstructing ancestral proteins. It is clear that we have not used that approach; therefore, in the revised manuscript, we have completely eschewed the use of the term and instead refer to our mutagenesis study as a “reformulation” or “reengineering” of the enzyme’s active site.</p><p>The resurrection methods to which the reviewer refers can be successfully used for relatively closely related proteins to reconstruct a common ancestor: for example, we could have used it to reconstruct the ancestor of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Era and <italic>E. coli</italic> Era and potentially “resurrect” it.</p><p>Instead, we needed to use our current approach in place of the methodology to which the reviewer refers because of the specific aspects of the evolutionary divergence between SpoIVA and Era:</p><p>1) The approach mentioned by the reviewer is well-suited for proteins that diverge from a distinct common ancestor. However, with SpoIVA and Era, there is an unusual situation in which there is no SpoIVA homolog that exists outside of sporulating Firmicutes. Its closest homolog is Era, which is a universally conserved bacterial protein and is an extant enzyme. Thus, the phyletic patterns of SpoIVA and Era indicate that SpoIVA was derived from an ancestral Era rather than the two being sister groups descending from a distinct reconstructable common ancestor. As we reported previously (Castaing et al., 2013) the simplest explanation is that SpoIVA evolved from Era, likely via gene duplication and followed by rapid divergence after paralog formation. The ancestor of SpoIVA, effectively, is Era itself. We realize that this evolutionary situation was not clearly explained in the text, since we simply referenced our earlier work. We have therefore included additional text that explains the evolution of SpoIVA (please see subsection “Amino acid substitutions in the nucleotide binding pocket could be responsible for the evolution of ATP binding specificity in SpoIVA”).</p><p>2) Further, SpoIVA has even acquired two C-terminal domain fusions that are not present in Era (now more prominently denoted in the schematic in Figure 1C). Moreover, in the process of diverging from Era SpoIVA has accumulated myriad substitutions along with unique insertions, which add considerable uncertainty to any complete reconstructions of the ancestral intermediates.</p><p>When all these are considered, it would result in too vast of a parameter space to analyze using the approach that the reviewer suggested and accordingly the number of reengineering steps involved would be currently infeasible. Therefore, despite the merits of the suggested approach, the example of SpoIVA and Era precludes employing it. Hence, we had to restrict ourselves to manipulating a limited but functionally clearly defined set of features of the TRAFAC GTPase domain in SpoIVA for which we have extensive experimental and computational evidence for how they function. Accordingly, we manipulated highly conserved residues known to participate in catalysis and, guided by sequence conservation and structure. In the process we accounted even for peripheral residues that we predicted to affect active site properties.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use Era, &quot;ancestral Era GTPase&quot;, and the ancestor interchangeably (e.g., subsection “The altered NKxD motif in G4 and SxE sequence in G5 mediate nucleotide specificity of SpoIVA”, but common throughout the manuscript). However, Era appears to be an extant enzyme that likely evolved independently after the emergence of SpoIVA, which may have further contributed to the specialization of the two proteins compared to a common ancestor. Careful separation between extant Era and SpoIVA and predicted common ancestors would avoid the potential for confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the different labels for the same protein can be confusing, and therefore have changed most references to the protein as simply “Era”. As mentioned above, Era is indeed an extant enzyme, just like SpoIVA, but it certainly did not evolve after SpoIVA emerged. Furthermore, Era and SpoIVA do not appear to share a distinct common ancestor in the typical sense. Rather, Era is a universally conserved bacterial protein, while SpoIVA is entirely restricted to the clade of sporulating Firmicutes. Thus, the simplest model is that Era is indeed the ancestor and that SpoIVA emerged, likely via gene duplication, from Era and subsequently diverged away from Era. As mentioned above, we have now included a much more detailed description in the text of our previous work (subsection “Amino acid substitutions in the nucleotide binding pocket could be responsible for the evolution of ATP binding specificity in SpoIVA”) that explains this evolutionary relationship between SpoIVA and Era.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) If the targeted changes in the primary active site motifs fully recapitulate the evolutionary and functional differences between SpoIVA and Era, one may predict that the corresponding changes in Era would result in SpoIVA-like properties. This would be a crucial experiment to consider for this study.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a bold proposal! We had initially considered performing this test, but ultimately concluded that it would be outside the scope of this study because although we initially argued that these residues were necessary for preferential ATPase activity, we were not prepared to state that they were sufficient to distinguish between ATP and GTP. That said, we decided to try the reviewer’s suggested experiment, and the results are now displayed in a new Figure 2A. Changing the “NKxD” motif of Era to “NSxR” found in SpoIVA, and introducing a Glu to Era to introduce an “SxE” motif similar to that of SpoIVA remarkably (we think) resulted in preferential hydrolysis of ATP compared to GTP when Era was stimulated. We thank the reviewer for challenging us to perform this experiment!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) While the type of mutations introduced into SpoIVA was guided by sequence comparison with Era-type GTPases, it appears that the authors chose the mutant they refer to as the resurrected ancestor based on the activity profile that matches most closely the catalytic characteristics of Era, and not necessarily based on the phylogenic analysis. This practice introduces bias that may hamper the analysis concerning the evolution of substrate specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, phylogenetic analysis similar to what the reviewer proposed would be feasible when the proteins are relatively closely related, but not at the evolutionary divergence between SpoIVA and Era. SpoIVA harbors, in addition to amino acid changes, two C-terminal domains that are not present in Era. To get around this insurmountable issue, we made various intermediate states and chose the activity state that most closely resembled Era, the protein from which SpoIVA likely evolved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this context, it is also not clear why the authors assume that the last common ancestor of SpoIVA and Era had Era-like hydrolysis efficiencies and substrate preference.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, Era itself is the most parsimonious likely ancestor to SpoIVA. SpoIVA is undetectable outside of the Firmicutes phylum and SpoIVA is most closely related to Era. Thus, we are faced with the unusual situation where Era itself gave rise to the extant SpoIVA- not that SpoIVA and Era had a distinct last common ancestor from which each diverged as descendent sister groups. Since almost all members of the TRAFAC family of GTPases (and certainly proteins in the Era lineage of enzymes other than SpoIVA) possess GTPase activity, we humbly suggest that it is not unreasonable to presume that the ancestor of SpoIVA would possess a substrate preference for GTP, not ATP, and that its enzymatic activity would closely reflect that of an Era GTPase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors also did not consider the potential impact the register shift in G5 between SpoIVA (sequence SxE) and Era (sequence SA) may have, only focusing on the sequence register found in SpoIVA. It is conceivable that the additional residue in this motif arose to accommodate an ATP preference and ATPase-driven mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>There may be a misunderstanding regarding our strategy for employing the alanine substitution and where exactly the glutamate resides in SpoIVA. To clarify, across the TRAFAC GTPases, the sequence simply happens to be “SA”, wherein the Ala does not contribute to catalysis or recognition of the purine in any way. Thus, the “SxE” equivalent sequence in Era is “SAx”, where the second “x” just happens to be an “A” in most TRAFAC GTPases. In Era it tends to be most frequently C or A which can provide the same small hydrophobic sidechain to effectively play a role no different from the A in the other GTPases. In SpoIVA, the E in the third position is an evolutionarily constrained residue (preferentially polar than hydrophobic). In certain groups of TRAFAC GTPases, the position after SA can be conserved (for example, Ras has a K) but in Era, the position following “SA” is not under any evolutionary constraint. The preference for a polar residue at that position appears to have therefore emerged specifically in the SpoIVA lineage. From a structural viewpoint, examination of TRAFAC GTPases indicates that, especially in the dimeric state, the third position can be proximal to the purine of the bound nucleotide thereby potentially affecting nucleotide specificity of the enzyme. To inactivate the E in SpoIVA, we employed a strategy common in site-directed mutagenesis, which is to simply substitute a residue of interest with A (which harbors a short sidechain and is unlikely to cause gross structural changes) to produce “SxA”. This strategy was NOT an effort to move the A one residue over, as the reviewer seems to have interpreted. Rather, it was to substitute the polar residue “E” in the SxA sequence. We hope this clarifies our approach and logic.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, to evolve ATPase activity in Era as suggested by the reviewer, we introduced a glutamate after the conserved “A” in Era (to produce “SAE”, thereby recapitulating the “SxE” found in SpoIVA) because (1) we predicted that it resides in the binding site of SpoIVA, and (2) we predict that it is a new state that exists on top of ground GTPase state. In other words, we propose that ATP binding is an acquired state. Thus, we did not introduce a register shift, and the alanine substitution strategy was completely unrelated to the coincidental “A” that occupied the “x” position in Era. To avoid confusion, we have now referred to the corresponding Era sequence as “SAx” to indicate that we are not introducing a register shift and have added sentences that more clearly compare the sequences in this region and explains our mutagenesis strategy (Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is not clear whether the defects in polymerization characteristics of the SpoIVA-resurrected mutant can be attributed to the lower ATPase activity compared to wild-type SpoIVA (or other subtle changes introduced by the mutations). It is also not clear whether SpoIVA-resurrected forms a similar ATPase-dependent intermediate that was oberserved with wild-type SpoIVA (at protein concentrations below the threshold for polymerization). This is an important experiment since the differences between ATP and GTP in their capacity to drive intermediate formation could be explained by the different ATPase vs GTPase efficiencies of the wild-type protein; SpoIVA-resurrected has overall lower catalytic activity compared to wild-type, and it does not support polymerization. Hence, there is a possibility that the observed differences can be attributed to catalytic efficiency (maybe in addition to the nature of the nucleotide base).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important experiment. We have now tested if the SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup> variant forms the assembly intermediate at a low protein concentration (under non-polymerization conditions). The results are presented in a new Figure 5B-C and indicate that (1) this variant is capable of forming the ADP-associated assembly intermediate, albeit at an expected lower efficiency than WT, and (2) that the variant does NOT form the intermediate in the presence of GTP. Taken together, the results allow us to conclude that the SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup> variant is able to utilize ATP to polymerize but unable to utilize GTP to polymerize because it fails to form the critical NDP-bound intermediate that is required for the assembly of the nucleotide-free polymer. We thank the referee for suggesting this experiment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
