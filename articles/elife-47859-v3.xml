major DNMT that methylates mammalian genomes during early development. Mutations in human <italic>DNMT3B</italic> disrupt genome-wide DNA methylation patterns and result in ICF syndrome type 1 (ICF1). To study whether normal DNA methylation patterns may be restored in ICF1 cells, we corrected <italic>DNMT3B</italic> mutations in induced pluripotent stem cells from ICF1 patients. Focusing on repetitive regions, we show that in contrast to pericentromeric repeats, which reacquire normal methylation, the majority of subtelomeres acquire only partial DNA methylation and, accordingly, the ICF1 telomeric phenotype persists. Subtelomeres resistant to de novo methylation were characterized by abnormally high H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), and short-term reduction of H3K4me3 by pharmacological intervention partially restored subtelomeric DNA methylation. These findings demonstrate that the abnormal epigenetic landscape established in ICF1 cells restricts the recruitment of DNMT3B, and suggest that rescue of epigenetic diseases with genome-wide disruptions will demand further manipulation beyond mutation correction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>telomere</kwd><kwd>ICF syndrome</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>subtelomere</kwd><kwd>DNMT3B</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1362/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selig</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Telethon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GGP15209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matarazzo</surname><given-names>Maria R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>PON/MISE</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-2020 FESR F/050011/01-02/X32</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matarazzo</surname><given-names>Maria R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MIUR/CNR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Epigenomics Flagship Project (EPIGEN)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matarazzo</surname><given-names>Maria R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Correction of the DNA methyltransferase 3B gene in ICF1 syndrome fails to rescue the abnormal DNA hypomethylation at subtelomeric regions due to accompanied epigenetic abnormalities in these regions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CpG methylation is an essential chemical modification involved in the regulation of DNA accessibility to the transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). Changes in the DNA methylation landscape may drastically alter gene expression and downstream phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dor and Cedar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, establishment of DNA methylation patterns during development is strictly regulated. De novo DNA methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases 3A and 3B (DNMT3A and DNMT3B), which methylate many genomic sites redundantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Antonio et al., 2012</xref>). However, DNMT3B is the chief DNMT in charge of de novo methylation in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huntriss et al., 2004</xref>), and the majority of repetitive regions are exclusively methylated by DNMT3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okano et al., 1999</xref>). While there are indications that de novo methylation is primarily regulated at the level of DNMT3B recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al., 2015</xref>), the exact rules that govern the establishment of methylation patterns are yet unclear. Several of the factors suggested to influence DNMT3B recruitment are chromatin modifications, non-coding RNAs, and binding of RNA polymerase II and specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gatto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenfield et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hackett and Surani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith and Meissner, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Knockout of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> in mice leads to embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okano et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ueda et al., 2006</xref>). In humans, <italic>DNMT3B</italic> is one of four genes that lead to the rare autosomal recessive ICF (Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability and Facial anomalies) syndrome when mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">von Bernuth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Greef et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thijssen et al., 2015</xref>). All ICF subtypes exhibit DNA hypomethylation at various genomic regions, including pericentromeric satellite 2 and 3 repeats, that consequently fail to condense properly during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 1999</xref>). However, ICF1, caused by bi-allelic loss of function mutations in <italic>DNMT3B</italic> (always with some residual activity), differs from the remaining ICF subtypes by its relatively unperturbed centromeric methylation and striking hypomethylation at subtelomeric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Toubiana et al., 2018</xref>). The mechanistic basis for this phenotypic distinction between ICF syndrome subtypes is yet undeciphered.</p><p>Subtelomeres, the regions immediately adjacent to telomeres, consist of CpG-rich repetitive DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cross et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Lange et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stong et al., 2014</xref>) that undergoes DNA methylation during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Lange et al., 1990</xref>). While in several organisms the telomeric and subtelomeric chromatin share similar heterochromatic marks with centromeric and pericentromeric regions, the chromatin status at human telomeres and subtelomeres is less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galati et al., 2013</xref>). Approximately two thirds of human subtelomeres include at close proximity to the TTAGGG-telomeric repeats CpG-rich promoters that transcribe the long non-coding RNA TERRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diman and Decottignies, 2018</xref>). In ICF1 syndrome, severe subtelomeric hypomethylation is accompanied by elevated levels of TERRA transcripts and accelerated telomere shortening that leads to premature senescence in ICF1 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yehezkel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yehezkel et al., 2013</xref>). Certain telomeres are more prone to shorten in ICF1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sagie et al., 2017a</xref>), suggesting that when DNMT3B is defective, subtelomeric-specific characteristics contribute in cis to the degree of telomere loss.</p><p>The molecular abnormalities in ICF1 embryos are anticipated to initiate during the first days of development, when DNMT3B, the major DNMT present and active at that stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hackett and Surani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uysal et al., 2015</xref>), fails to properly methylate its targets. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) mimic this stage in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidson et al., 2015</xref>) and therefore are a potent tool to study methylation abnormalities occurring in developing ICF embryos. Indeed, fibroblast-like cells (FLs) derived from ICF1 iPSCs, recapitulated the abnormal telomeric phenotype and entered premature senescence due to accelerated telomere shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sagie et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Ectopic expression of WT DNMT3B in ICF1 fibroblasts fails to rescue hypomethylation at either pericentromeric repeats or at subtelomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yehezkel et al., 2013</xref>). One explanation for this scenario is that conditions permitting de novo methylation of repetitive sequences are restricted to the implantation stage. Here, we utilize ICF1 iPSCs to analyze the factors that regulate subtelomeric methylation during early development. To this end, we generated isogenic ICF1 iPSCs with and without <italic>DNMT3B</italic> mutations by genome editing. We show that, despite the restored methylation capacity of DNMT3B, the majority of subtelomeric regions did not reacquire normal DNA methylation due to restricted binding of the corrected DNMT3B. Our data demonstrate that several factors influence the capacity to recruit DNMT3B to subtelomeres, including abnormal TERRA transcription and trimethylation of H3K4 (H4K4me3). Accordingly, pharmacological reduction of H3K4me3 levels allowed partial restoration of subtelomeric DNA methylation. Thus, rescuing the abnormal DNA methylation patterns in ICF1 syndrome requires additional manipulations beyond mutation correction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CRISPR/Cas9 correction of <italic>DNMT3B</italic> mutations in ICF iPSCs restores the catalytic activity of DNMT3B</title><p>Homology-directed repair (HDR) by CRISPR/Cas9 editing was implemented to rescue the catalytic activity of DNMT3B in two iPSCs derived from ICF1 patients pR and pG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sagie et al., 2014</xref>) (all further reference to ICF patients or cells relates to ICF1 only) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We aimed to correct at least one allele in each ICF iPSC, as carriers for ICF syndrome have a normal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sagie et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sagie et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yehezkel et al., 2008</xref>). Following this procedure, we identified two homozygous corrected clones for pR iPSCs, cR7 and cR35, obtained at passages 24 and 27, respectively. For pG iPSCs we identified two corrected clones, cG13 and cG50, at passages 15 and 17, respectively. These two clones had corrected the mutation leading to a premature stop codon in <italic>DNMT3B</italic> and maintained a missense mutation in the catalytic domain of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Western analysis indicated that DNMT3B protein levels both prior and post correction in ICF iPSCs do not differ substantially from those of WT iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether correction of <italic>DNMT3B</italic> restored the catalytic capacity of DNMT3B, we studied the methylation status of pericentromeric satellite 2 repeats by Southern analysis of samples digested with a methylation sensitive restriction enzyme.

All four corrected clones, cR7, cR35, cG13 and cG50 (three to four passages after clone isolation), showed a significant shift of hybridization to higher molecular weight bands, indicating that these regions had undergone significant de novo methylation early after correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

When focusing on regions with high CpG density, it was evident that subtelomeres varied in the degree of methylation acquired following correction and there was no clear association between CpG density and the capacity to regain DNA methylation at subtelomeres. Some subtelomeres remained notably hypomethylated, such as 1q, 2p, 5p and 11q. Many subtelomeres regained partial methylation, such as 2q, 10q, 13q and 21q. Only subtelomere 4p restored DNA methylation to normal levels in all corrected clones. When we examined in detail the methylation status of the TERRA promoter repeats, we found that all three repeat families were substantially protected from de novo methylation following correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To study the methylation dynamics of TERRA promoters at specific subtelomeres with high sequencing coverage and at different time points after <italic>DNMT3B</italic> correction, we performed targeted high throughput sequencing of subtelomere-specific amplicons generated from bisulfite converted DNA.

Several of the tested amplicons (5p, 2p, 13q, 1q/21q, 2q/4q) remained drastically hypomethylated, even after prolonged passaging (reaching up to 54 passages in the case of cR7).</p><p>Conversely, other subtelomeric regions (9p/Xq, 2q/4q/10q, and 10q) regained intermediate to high levels of methylation.

Similar to the analysis of the entire 2 kb subtelomeric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), specific subtelomeric regions that were initially more methylated in ICF iPSCs regained methylation more readily in comparison to severely hypomethylated regions. When comparing all corrected clones, we could observe that cG13 and cG50 regained methylation at a faster rate than cR7 and cR35, even though pR iPSCs were corrected at both mutated alleles in comparison to only one allele in pG iPSCs. However, in general, the four corrected clones behaved very similarly, reinforcing the former conclusion that methylation at subtelomeres is conducted in a highly regulated manner.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated that the capacity of a specific genomic region to undergo de novo methylation was dependent on DNMT3B recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al., 2015</xref>). To test whether the degree of restored methylation was correlated with DNMT3B binding, we determined the enrichment of DNMT3B at individual subtelomeres by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Indeed, ChIP revealed that TERRA promoter regions with persisting hypomethylation in ICF iPSC, such as 2p, 5p and 11q, were poorly enriched for DNMT3B binding in comparison to WT iPSCs, even following correction. Conversely, the binding of the corrected DNMT3B at promoter regions that partially or fully regained DNA methylation (10q/13q/19q and 7q, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) was comparable to the binding of the WT DNMT3B in the control iPSC. As expected, the fully remethylated region of satellite 2 in the corrected clones was highly enriched with DNMT3B. Based on the combined data describing DNA methylation and DNMT3B binding at TERRA promoters, we could conclude that the capacity to undergo de novo subtelomeric methylation by the corrected DNMT3B was clearly correlated with DNMT3B recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>High TERRA levels persist following <italic>DNMT3B</italic> correction</title><p>We previously demonstrated that TERRA levels are significantly elevated in ICF iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sagie et al., 2014</xref>). The persisting hypomethylation of at least several TERRA promoters in the corrected ICF IPSCs, suggested that TERRA would continue to be upregulated from a subgroup of subtelomeres. To confirm this assumption, we determined TERRA levels at individual telomere ends in ICF iPSCs at early and late time points following <italic>DNMT3B</italic> correction by subtelomere-specific quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

To this end, we differentiated pR iPSCs, its corrected cR7 and cR35 clones at 3 and 23 passages following correction, respectively, as well as WT iPSCs. We then isolated fibroblast-like (FLs) cells and passaged them continuously while documenting their population doublings (PDs). The passages at which we differentiated cR7 and cR35 were chosen based on the similar telomere lengths of both clones at those time points.

The methylation changes between cR7 iPSCs and FLs were more noticeable compared to cR35, probably because this clone was differentiated at a very early time point following correction, when most subtelomeres had scarcely regained methylation. The persisting presence of DNMT3B1, the catalytically active isoform of DNMT3B, during the first stages of embryoid body (EBs) formation, could lead to additional subtelomeric methylation before this active isoform was silenced in the terminally differentiated FLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sagie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yehezkel et al., 2011</xref>).

As prolonged treatment with OICR-9429 leads to considerable cell death, we could subject the cells to this small molecule for 72 hr, after which we confirmed that this short treatment reduced H3K4me3 enrichment at subtelomeres, as demonstrated for subtelomere 2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, left panel).

Several factors have been implicated in regulation of DNMT3B recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gatto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenfield et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hackett and Surani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith and Meissner, 2013</xref>), however, the exact rules that direct, or conversely, inhibit DNMT3B binding, are still not completely resolved. In this study we took advantage of iPSCs derived from ICF fibroblasts to advance our understanding of these rules. ICF iPSCs provide a cell system that on the one hand mimics the embryonic stage at which de novo methylation occurs, including the expression of the full length DNMT3B1 isoform, and on the other hand has an inherently hypomethylated genome. Correction of the mutated <italic>DNMT3B</italic> gene in these cells by genome editing, allowed us to trace events of remethylation at various genomic regions. Comparing the hypomethylated starting point with the methylation status following <italic>DNMT3B</italic> correction is advantageous over the opposite approach where DNMT3B is deleted in pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horii et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2015</xref>), as the removal of DNMT3B from normally methylated human embryonic stem cells does not substantially alter genome-wide DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2015</xref>). This may be attributed to a limited role of DNMT3B in methylation maintenance in iPSCs compared to de novo methylation. The comparison of isogenic ICF iPSCs prior and post <italic>DNMT3B</italic> correction, enabled the precise identification of de novo methylation events that could be attributed solely to the recovered enzyme activity. Using such comparisons, we verified that very early following isolation of the corrected clones, satellite 2 hypomethylation, a hallmark of ICF syndrome, was reversed and these regions reached methylation levels highly comparable to those in WT iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). De novo methylation of pericentromeric repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) not only confirmed that the catalytic activity of DNMT3B was restored, but also that, in contrast to somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yehezkel et al., 2013</xref>), iPSCs provide a cellular milieu that can support de novo methylation.</p><p>To ask whether additional genomic regions restored normal DNA methylation following the rescue of DNMT3B, we focused our attention on subtelomeric regions which are also drastically hypomethylated in <italic>DNMT3B</italic>-mutated ICF patients, and are associated with a distinct telomeric phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yehezkel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yehezkel et al., 2013</xref>). However, telomeric regions differ from pericentromeric regions in their epigenetic marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Negishi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenfeld et al., 2009</xref>), and defects in centromeric, pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions vary among subtypes of ICF syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Toubiana et al., 2018</xref>), pointing to disparities in DNA methylation regulation between these various classes of repetitive regions. This suggested that the dynamics of methylation acquisition following <italic>DNMT3B</italic> correction may follow a different course at subtelomeres compared to pericentromeric repeats. Moreover, even among human subtelomeres, despite sharing high sequence similarity, variations exist in GC skewing, in CpG density and in presence of TERRA promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sagie et al., 2017b</xref>). These properties were proposed to contribute to variability in subtelomeric hypomethylation, in DNA:RNA hybrid levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sagie et al., 2017b</xref>), as well as in the propensity of telomeres to shorten in ICF syndrome cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sagie et al., 2017a</xref>) and could also affect the capability to restore DNA methylation. Indeed, the current study further emphasizes the variability among human subtelomeres, as not all subtelomeres regained methylation at the same rate and to the same degree following correction of <italic>DNMT3B</italic>.</p><p>Surveying the subtelomeres following correction clearly illustrated the partial methylation rescue of these regions, even following numerous passages in culture. Strikingly, the four corrected clones, originating from two patient iPSCs, carrying different <italic>DNMT3B</italic> mutations, demonstrated consistent patterns of remethylation at the majority of subtelomeres, highlighting the tight regulation of this process. The various subtelomeres could be roughly divided into three categories: those that acquired methylation readily, those that gradually regained methylation over time, and those that persistently remained hypomethylated even after prolonged passaging in culture. Noticeably, subtelomeres from the first group were those that displayed initially higher methylation levels in ICF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>) and also tended to undergo a certain degree of de novo methylation during the generation of iPSCs from the ICF fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These subtelomeres may either be characterized by chromatin that is more accessible to DNMT3B, whether mutated or not, or may be partially recognized by DNMT3A, which is also expressed in pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2015</xref>), albeit at much lower levels, and may partially compensate for the lack of DNMT3B activity.</p><p>Previous studies had suggested that de novo methylation is regulated by DNMT3B recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al., 2015</xref>) and our findings confirmed the correlation between DNMT3B binding and the capacity to undergo methylation at subtelomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The differential reacquisition of methylation at various subtelomeres provided us with a unique opportunity to identify factors in cis and <italic>trans</italic> that support or restrain DNMT3B binding at these regions. We postulated that transcriptional activity and associated chromatin modifications play a significant role in determining the accessibility of a specific subtelomeric region to DNMT3B. Analysis of TERRA expression revealed that most of the TERRA promoters were highly active both prior and post correction, and this transcriptional activity persisted also at late passages following correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, several subtelomeres which do express TERRA, such as 10p/18p and 2q/4q/10q, underwent full or partial DNA methylation following correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) suggesting that TERRA expression solely could not explain the failure to recruit DNMT3B to subtelomeric regions.</p><p>Transcriptionally active promoters are usually marked by H3K4 trimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buratowski and Kim, 2010</xref>), an epigenetic mark shown to inhibit recruitment of DNMT3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morselli et al., 2015</xref>). Enrichment of H3K4me3 at TERRA promoters, was found to be correlated with TERRA levels in human fibroblasts and cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caslini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Negishi et al., 2015</xref>), and this was also the case for subtelomeres in ICF fibroblasts and iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). We postulated that this enrichment would persist at a subset of TERRA promoters even after <italic>DNMT3B</italic> editing and prevent the recruitment of the corrected DNMT3B. Indeed, subtelomeres that remained hypomethylated following correction were found in most cases to remain significantly enriched with H3K4me3 in comparison to WT iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Consistently, when we partially reduced H3K4me3 levels at subtelomeres in corrected ICF iPSC clones by pharmacological interference, we found an increase in subtelomeric methylation that is less pronounced at highly H3K4me3 enriched subtelomeres such as 2p and 5p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we could conclude that transcriptional activity at subtelomeres and H3K4 trimethylation are factors that discourage DNMT3B binding to subtelomeres and therefore prevent the restoration of the normal DNA methylation patterns following DNMT3B correction. Nevertheless, some subtelomeres did not completely adhere to these rules. Subtelomere 11q stands out in this respect, demonstrating that despite relatively low H3K4me3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), it remained severely hypomethylated following correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, TERRA expression from 11q remained significantly high compared to WT iPSCs, even in the corrected clones. Together this suggests the existence of additional unidentified factors that play roles in directing de novo methylation at subtelomeres and remain to be identified in future studies.</p><p>Telomeres provide protection to chromosome ends and their epigenetic properties are essential for their maintenance and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galati et al., 2013</xref>).

The failure to reacquire normal methylation patterns following rescue of DNMT3B’s catalytic capacity, and the consequential lack of phenotypic rescue, illustrate the challenges in treating genetic diseases that affect the entire epigenome. In the case of ICF syndrome, although the primary defect which initiates during implantation is manifested as abnormal DNA methylation, ICF somatic cells, such as the fibroblasts from which the iPSCs were established, display in addition to the disrupted DNA methylation patterns, abnormal histone modifications and transcriptional activity, at least as much as demonstrated at telomeric regions. These abnormal features prevail in the ICF iPSCs and consequentially, the epigenetic landscape encountered by the corrected DNMT3B is significantly altered in comparison to that present during normal embryonic development. A question arises whether the ability to overcome the persisting epigenetic memory and fully rescue the methylation defects in ICF cells may be feasible in stem cells corresponding to earlier developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu, 2017</xref>). Reversion of primed human stem cells to a naïve state is accompanied by a significant global reduction in DNA methylation and H3K9me3 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pastor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takashima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), thus rendering the chromatin to a more open conformation. Specifically at CpG rich promoters, an increase in active histone modifications (H3K4me2/3) was apparent in naïve stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). As we show that the high H3K4me3 levels constitute a major barrier to DNA methylation recovery at subtelomeres, we do not anticipate that a shift to a more naïve state will assist in overcoming the permissive ground state of ICF syndrome chromatin, which is impeding the binding of the corrected DNMT3B. However, we cannot exclude that H3K4me3 levels may show a distinct profile at TERRA promoters in the naïve state, and in addition, that a varying repertoire of transcription factors could alleviate the permissive epigenetic landscape, allowing the binding of DNMT3B. Exploring this possibility awaits future studies in which corrected ICF iPSCs will be reverted into a more naïve state. Nevertheless, the success in treating patients with genome-wide epigenetic perturbations, will require additional steps beyond the correction of the genetic mutation responsible for initiation of the disease. Specifically for ICF syndrome, we demonstrated the proof of principle that such a strategy, as temporary removal of H3K4me3, may partially recover DNA methylation at subtelomeres.</p><p>In this study we largely focused on the DNA methylation dynamics at subtelomeric regions. We envision that future genome-wide studies of the epigenetic characteristics in ICF iPSCs prior and post <italic>DNMT3B</italic> correction will further decode the rules that dictate DNMT3B recruitment to chromatin. Understanding these rules will contribute to future design of therapy for ICF syndrome patients, and will be relevant to additional pathological states, such as cancer, in which normal DNA methylation patterns are likewise perturbed.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (human)</td><td valign="top"><italic>DNMT3B1</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org">www.ensembl.org</ext-link></td><td valign="top">ENST00000328111.6</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (human; Female – pR, cR7, cR35; Male – pG, cG13, cG50, UN1-22, FSE-5m)</td><td valign="top">iPSC lines</td><td valign="top">This paper; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shinnawi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sagie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yehezkel et al., 2011</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Cell lines maintained in S.

To arrest the crosslinking, glycine was added to 0.125 M. Fixed cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 780 g for 5 min at 4°C. The cells were rinsed with ice cold phosphate buffered solution (PBS) and pelleted by centrifugation at 780 g for 5 min at 4°C. Cells were then resuspended in 6 ml of lysis buffer (100 mM PIPES pH 8.0, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP40 and protease inhibitor cocktail (11873580001, MERCK)), centrifuged at 780 g for 5 min at 4°C and washed in cold PBS by additional centrifugation under the same conditions. Cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of nuclei lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.8% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and protease inhibitor cocktail) and sonicated (using the Bioruptor UCD-200, Diagenode, NJ, USA) under conditions that gave a range of DNA fragments between 200–1000 bp. Following sonication, the lysed chromatin was centrifuged at 9300 g to eliminate debris, and the supernatant containing the soluble chromatin was separated to a new tube. ChIP for H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 was performed by incubating 80 μg of chromatin diluted in 1 ml of ChIP dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 140 mM NaCl and protease inhibitor cocktail) with 3.5 μg of each of the antibodies (H3K4me3: ab8580, Abcam, Cambridge, UK, H3K9me3: ab8898,Abcam). ChIP for H3K36me3 was carried out with 5 μg of antibody (ab9050, Abcam). Immunoprecipitated complexes were recovered with protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (sc-2003, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), washed with high salt buffer (PBS, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) and wash buffer (100 mM, 500 mM, 1% NP-40 and 1% Sodium deoxycholate), reverse crosslinked by resuspending the beads in 200 μl of 1% SDS, 0.1 M Sodium bicarbonate and 200 mM NaCl at 67°C for two hours.

To determine enrichment of DNMT3B binding, chromatin from iPSCs was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-DNMT3B (Diagenode Cat # C15410218) using Magna ChIP (17–610, MERCK). qPCR was performed on the immunoprecipitated samples using primers described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. Results were expressed as site occupancy (normalization was done relative to an amplified negative region in the same sample) to exclude technical variations between samples. At first, a normalization to the input amount was calculated and then, the obtained percentage of input was used to calculate the enrichment over the percentage of input of a negative control region (Hoxa7 TSS, GAPDH promoter, or Myoglobin exon 2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Treatment with OICR-9429</title><p>OICR-9429 (SML1209, MERCK) was dissolved in DMSO at a stock concentration of 1 mM.

Selig and colleagues addresses the important question of whether epigenetic defects caused by mutations in epigenetic regulators can be restored after gene correction. The authors use patient specific iPSCs to show that repair of the DNMT3B mutation that causes human ICF1 syndrome is unable fully restore the ICF1-related epigenetic abnormalities those cells. These findings are important for anyone interested in developing translational approaches in disorders such as ICF1. When using patient-specific cells for either iPSC-based disease modeling or for regenerative approaches, gene-corrected cells will likely require additional interventions to restore the persistent epigenetic defects. The work is also of intriguing for the community interested in basic aspects of DNA methylation, as it demonstrates a remarkable specificity of the methylation defects restricted to repeats at subtelomeric but not pericentromeric regions. Furthermore, high expression of the long non-coding RNA TERRA and the functional link of H3K4 methylation to the persistent methylation defects point to a mechanistic hierarchy and define key restriction factors for establishing proper methylation levels. Finally, the study raises the question of whether this finding will apply to other disease models affecting epigenetic regulators. It will also be intriguing to test whether specific pluripotent states such as the use of naïve rather than primed state human iPSCs may overcome the observed methylation defects in combination or instead of strategies that directly inhibit H3K4 methylation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Persistent epigenetic memory impedes rescue of the telomeric phenotype in human ICF iPSCs following DNMT3B correction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dirk Hockemeyer (Reviewer #1), Lea Harrington (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript addresses the dynamics of DNA methylation by DNMT3B during early development using a human ICF syndrome iPSC line and its gene corrected, isogenic counterpart. The work demonstrates that in the gene-corrected iPSC line pericentromeric but not subtelomeric regions restore normal methylation patterns and that the persistent defects in subtelomeric methylation are associated with persisting disease phenotypes in iPSC-derived fibroblasts. Interestingly, subtelomeric regions resistant to de novo methylation are characterized by high H3K4me3 levels and expression of the telomeric repeat-containing long non-coding RNA TERRA. Finally, the authors demonstrate that more complete subtelomeric methylation cells can be achieved following pharmacological inhibition of H3K4me3 in gene-corrected iPSCs.</p><p>Overall, all the reviewers found the work of considerable interest and the findings intriguing. There were however, several points that should be addressed in a revised manuscript as detailed below.</p><p>Essential revision:</p><p>1) Confirming proper expression levels for DNMT3B in the gene corrected clones: it would be important to demonstrate that the levels of DNMT3B were back to physiological levels after gene correction and thereby to rule out partial rescue of levels.</p><p>2) Telomere length-dependent senescence of DNMT3B-restored fibroblasts: We encourage the authors to perform TERT overexpression experiments (as in their past studies) to address whether TERT expression can rescue senescence phenotype in the differentiated fibroblasts. The reviewers think that show experiments can be completed within the 2 months period, and that either result would be a valuable addition to further strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>3) Data consistency about telomere length: The authors should discuss / explain the apparent discrepancy in the telomere length data in Figure 5D vs Figure 1D (for example in Figure 1D, the same corrected clones have shorter telomeres than the parental iPSCs).</p><p>4) Discussing limitations of the model system: The hiPSC cultures used in these studies represent a relatively late (epiblast) state of development that may be too late for achieving full remethylation. There is currently no ideal system; the use of a &quot;naïve&quot; hiPSC culture system might be of uncertain value given the controversies about the proper conditions for naive pluripotency in the human system. Furthermore, such studies would be too extensive as a revision request. Nevertheless, we think it is important for the authors to discuss the limitations of the current system used, as it could impact the conclusions about translation – e.g. the possibility of achieving more complete remethylation when using a more naïve pluripotent culture condition and derivatives from those more naïve cells in the future.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47859.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revision:</p><p>1) Confirming proper expression levels for DNMT3B in the gene corrected clones: it would be important to demonstrate that the levels of DNMT3B were back to physiological levels after gene correction and thereby to rule out partial rescue of levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously reported DNMT3B protein levels in ICF iPS pG prior to CRISPR correction. In this iPS we expected a priori a reduction in protein levels due to the premature stop codon in one of the DNMT3B alleles which could lead to nonsense mediated decay. However, despite this mutation, protein levels seemed normal. We published this in Sagie et al., 2014 in Supplemental Figure S2A. In ICF iPS pR which are homozygous to a missense mutation, we did not necessarily expect significantly lower protein levels, although missense mutations could theoretically destabilize the protein.</p><p>To ensure that indeed the protein levels in all of the corrected clones are within a normal range, we performed western analysis with an anti-DNMT3B antibody. We focused our analysis on the 3B1 and 3B2 isoforms which are the isoforms that contain the catalytic domain of DNMT3B. For normalization of the loaded protein levels we used an anti-actin antibody. The results of this analysis indicate that DNMT3B1+2 protein levels in the isogenic ICF iPSCs are equal or higher than those of WT-iPSCs. We are therefore confident that the partial rescue of methylation at subtelomeres is not a consequence of low levels of corrected DNMT3B.</p><p>We added a sentence in the manuscript describing these findings, and a figure displaying the western analysis (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Telomere length-dependent senescence of DNMT3B-restored fibroblasts: We encourage the authors to perform TERT overexpression experiments (as in their past studies) to address whether TERT expression can rescue senescence phenotype in the differentiated fibroblasts.

Its results indeed strengthen the conclusions that premature senescence in the corrected FLs is due to accelerated telomere shortening.</p><p>To note, the frozen FLs did not thaw well because they were already close to senescence when frozen. However, cR7 FLs, derived from the corrected pR7 iPSCs did partially survive the thawing and we succeeded in immortalizing them with a lentiviral plasmid containing hTERT. We determined the population doubling of the infected cells during continuous culturing for approximately 40 days, and compared the growth curve with that of non-infected cR7 FLs. While the non-infected cells entered senescence after approximately a month, the hTERT-expressing cR7 cells were rescued from premature senescence and continued to proliferate for over 40 days. SA-β-Gal staining confirmed that the non-infected culture entered senescence, but not the hTERT-expressing culture.</p><p>The results of this experiment are described in the manuscript in the paragraph starting with “Fibroblast-like cells derived from the corrected ICF iPSCs enter premature senescence”, and are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Data consistency about telomere length: The authors should discuss / explain the apparent discrepancy in the telomere length data in Figure 5D vs Figure 1D (for example in Figure 1D, the same corrected clones have shorter telomeres than the parental iPSCs).</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to respond to two issues:</p><p>a) The finding that corrected clones have shorter telomeres than the parental iPSCs reflects a phenomenon described previously by several groups, including ours. iPSC clones may show different telomere length dynamics during prolonged growth in culture, even if they have a common parental origin. As far as we are aware, the mechanism behind this phenomenon is not understood. We now refer to this point in the Results section when describing the TRF analysis in Figure 1D.</p><p>b) Apparent discrepancy in telomere length data in Figure 5D vs Figure 1D: we carefully checked the two blots and can explain the source of this apparent discrepancy. We first want to point out that in Figure 1, the samples are digested with <italic>MspI</italic>, while in Figure 5 they are digested with <italic>HinfI</italic>. We performed a Southern analysis that confirmed that the TRF sizes of several DNA samples are very similar when digested with each of these two enzymes.</p><p>One factor that can partially explain the apparent inconsistency in telomere lengths of samples from equal or very similar passages lies in the different extent of DNA separation of both gels. The DNA in the gel that produced Figure 1D was separated over a longer distance than that of 5D and therefore the molecular weights between 4-10kb have much better separation, emphasizing the lower molecular weight smear. Another factor we recently discovered that influences the molecular weights of the TRF hybridization smear is related to a technical issue that arises during long-range electrophoreses of DNA: when separating the DNA on a very wide and large apparatus, a slight defect in the uniformity of the electric field causes a gradient to form in the extent of separation across the width of the gel. The DNA in the lanes positioned nearer the side of the apparatus that contains the contact point of the cathode wire migrates slightly faster. In the original figures, we marked the Southerns according to the size markers in the lane furthest away from the cathode wire. However these marker sizes do not represent accurately the sizes at the other end of the gel. To ensure that this indeed explains the alleged discrepancy, we quantitated telomere lengths using “MATELO” software (Yehezkel et al., 2011), this time using the size markers closest to the analyzed lanes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref> demonstrates that when quantified in this manner, the mean telomere lengths of each of the samples are very similar between both gels. In the table, we designate the marker to which each sample was aligned to.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2" valign="top"/><th colspan="2">Mean Telomere Length</th></tr><tr><th valign="top">MspI-<italic>digested (Figure 1D)</italic></th><th valign="top">HinfI-<italic>digested (Figure 5D)</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">pR</td><td valign="top">Left marker – 7.2 Kb</td><td valign="top">Left marker – 7.00 Kb</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">cR7</td><td valign="top">Left marker – 6.4 Kb</td><td valign="top">Left marker – 6.9 Kb</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">cR35</td><td valign="top">Right marker – 6.6 Kb</td><td valign="top">Left marker – 6.7 Kb</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">WT1</td><td valign="top">Right marker – 10.0 Kb</td><td valign="top">Right marker – 10.4 Kb</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>To provide a more accurate estimation of molecular sizes, we now include in all the TRF blots a size marker at each side of the gel.

We quote studies that show that in naïve stem cells the chromatin acquires a more open conformation in comparison to primed stem cells, including lower DNA methylation levels, lower H3K9me3 and higher H3K4me3 at CpG-rich promoters. We therefore do not anticipate that reverting the cells to a naïve state will necessarily rescue the methylation defects at subtelomeres. However, we state in the discussion that: “However, we cannot exclude that H3K4me3 levels may show a distinct profile at TERRA promoters in the naïve state, and in addition, that a varying repertoire of transcription factors could alleviate the permissive epigenetic landscape, allowing the binding of DNMT3B”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
