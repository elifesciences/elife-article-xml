ubiquitin ligase complex to induce the degradation of specific neomorphic substrates via polyubiquitination in conjunction with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, which have until now remained elusive. Here we show that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBE2G1 and UBE2D3 cooperatively promote the K48-linked polyubiquitination of CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> neomorphic substrates via a sequential ubiquitination mechanism. Blockade of UBE2G1 diminishes the ubiquitination and degradation of neomorphic substrates, and consequent antitumor activities elicited by all tested CMs. For example, UBE2G1 inactivation significantly attenuated the degradation of myeloma survival factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 induced by lenalidomide and pomalidomide, hence conferring drug resistance. UBE2G1-deficient myeloma cells, however, remained sensitive to a more potent IKZF1/3 degrader CC-220. Collectively, it will be of fundamental interest to explore if loss of UBE2G1 activity is linked to clinical resistance to drugs that hijack the CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> to eliminate disease-driving proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40958.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells routinely breakdown damaged or unwanted proteins to recycle their building blocks. In humans, most of these unwanted proteins are first tagged with a chain of smaller proteins called ubiquitin, in a process known as ubiquitination. Three kinds of enzymes – named E1, E2 and E3 – act one after the other to recruit and transfer ubiquitin onto the protein. Any problem with this protein-disposal system may cause diseases including cancers.</p><p>Several drugs such as thalidomide are known to hijack the ubiquitination process by binding to the E3 enzyme. Instead of targeting unwanted proteins, the E3 enzyme-drug complex targets proteins that are driving a disease. These drugs are particularly useful for treating blood cancers. The problem is patients often become resistant to these drugs, and not always because the activity of the E3 enzyme is impaired. An alternative suspect would be an E2 enzyme, but the role of these enzymes remains unclear.</p><p>Lu et al. have now asked whether a faulty E2 enzyme can lead to drug resistance in a form of blood cancer called multiple myeloma. The experiments tested how proteins relevant for the growth of cancerous myeloma cells were degraded in the presence of different drugs. Genes for the E2 enzymes were inactivated one at a time using a gene editing approach to see which ones would affect the degradation of the proteins and result in drug resistance. Two E2 enzymes, UBE2G1 and UBE2D3, were found to be critical.</p><p>UBE2D3 first links the disease-driving proteins with one ubiquitin before UBE2G1 can subsequently assemble a chain of ubiquitin proteins. If either of these E2 enzymes was missing from myeloma cells treated with drugs, the disease-driving proteins could not be properly tagged with ubiquitin. This interfered with the degradation of the proteins and allowed the myeloma cells to continue to grow. Yet, myeloma cells that did not have UBE2G1 and were resistant to certain drugs could still respond to other more potent drugs. This suggests that the success of the drugs depends on UBE2G1. Therefore, a better understanding of the activity of this E2 enzyme may be useful for the development of future anticancer drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>cereblon</kwd><kwd>immunomodulatory drugs</kwd><kwd>cereblon modulating agents</kwd><kwd>PROTAC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cereblon-based small-molecule degraders rely on the sequential action of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBE2G1 and UBE2D3 to assemble K48-linked polyubiquitin chains on cereblon neomorphic substrates, resulting in their proteasomal degradation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a highly regulated component of the protein homeostasis network that dictates multiple cellular processes in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998</xref>). Through the orchestrated actions of ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) and ubiquitin-ligating enzymes (E3), the ε-amine of a lysine residue in a target protein is covalently conjugated with K48- or K11-linked poly-ubiquitin chains, thereby marking the target protein for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pickart, 2001</xref>). Recently, repurposing the Cullin-Ring E3 ligase complexes CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> (Cul4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN) and CRL2<sup>VHL</sup> (Cul2-RBX1-EloB/C-VHL) with small-molecule degraders to remove disease-driving proteins otherwise considered ‘undruggable’ has emerged as a novel therapeutic modality that has the potential to transform drug discovery and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bondeson and Crews, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lebraud and Heightman, 2017</xref>).</p><p>There are two types of small-molecule degraders that have been used to date. The first is represented by the immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) thalidomide (THAL), lenalidomide (LEN) and pomalidome (POM), as well as other cereblon modulating agents CC-122, CC-220, and CC-885. This class of molecule docks into a tri-tryptophan pocket in the thalidomide-binding domain of cereblon, the substrate receptor of CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>, to create a hotspot for protein-protein interactions thereby enhancing the binding of unique neomorphic substrate to cereblon, resulting in substrate ubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischer et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chamberlain et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matyskiela et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Petzold et al., 2016</xref>). All three IMiD drugs promote the degradation of two hematopoietic transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 to achieve anti-myeloma activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krönke et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2014a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gandhi et al., 2014</xref>), whereas only LEN targets CK1α for effective degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krönke et al., 2015</xref>), which is presumably linked to its efficacy in myelodysplastic syndrome with chromosome 5q deletion. CC-220 is a significantly more potent IKZF1 and IKZF3 degrader than IMiD drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matyskiela et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakayama et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schafer et al., 2018</xref>), and it is currently in clinical trials for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and systemic lupus erythematosus. By contrast, CC-885 is the only aforementioned cereblon modulating agent that allows cereblon to recognize translation termination factor GSPT1 for ubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matyskiela et al., 2016</xref>). The second type of small-molecule degraders is generally referred to as a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sakamoto et al., 2001</xref>), which is composed of two linked protein binding ligands, with one engaging a target protein and the other interacting with an E3 ubiquitin ligase such as CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> or CRL2<sup>VHL</sup> to trigger proximity-induced substrate ubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deshaies, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neklesa et al., 2017</xref>). Many PROTACs have been described recently, but the clinical value of this approach has not yet been established.</p><p>CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> belongs to the multi-subunit cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) family containing over 200 members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lehti et al., 2013</xref>). The mammalian cullin scaffold proteins (including Cul1, Cul2, Cul3, Cul4A, Cul4B, Cul5, and Cul7) bring their substrates into close proximity with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, thereby enabling effective substrate ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lehti et al., 2013</xref>). SCF(Skp1-Cul1-F-box)<sup>Cdc4</sup>, the founding member of the cullin-RING E3 ligase family, was first discovered in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, in which SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup> works in conjunction with a single E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34 to promote the polyubiquitination of a variety of SCF substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Feldman et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Skowyra et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blondel et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Perkins et al., 2001</xref>). Human Cdc34/UBE2R1 can substitute for yeast Cdc34 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> underscoring their functional conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plon et al., 1993</xref>). However, in contrast to its dominant role in catalyzing the ubiquitination of SCF substrates in yeast, Cdc34 coordinates ubiquitination with UBE2D3/UbcH5c via a sequential ubiquitination mechanism to improve reaction rate and efficiency in human cells. In brief, Cdc34 acts as an ubiquitin chain elongation enzyme that assembles the K48-linked ubiquitin chains on mono-ubiquitins pre-conjugated to SCF substrates by UBE2D3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pan et al., 2004</xref>). Such sequential ubiquitination by two E2 enzymes was first reported for the anaphase-promoting complex ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodrigo-Brenni and Morgan, 2007</xref>). More recently, the RING1-IBR-RING2 (RBR) E3 ligase ARIH1 was shown to tag client substrates of CRL1, CRL2 and CRL3 with monoubiquitin, thereby enabling CDC34-dependent K48-linked ubiquitin chain elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scott et al., 2016</xref>). This finding points to a potentially more prevailing mechanism of ubiquitin chain priming and extending carried out by two distinct E2s. Several ubiquitin conjugation E2 enzymes have been reported to regulate CRL4 substrates as well. For instance, in response to UV irradiation, the CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> ligase complex mediates the proteolysis of Cdt1 with the help of E2 enzymes UBE2G1 and its paralog UBE2G2, while working together with a different E2 enzyme UbcH8/UBEL6 to trigger the degradation of p21 and Set8 in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shibata et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the proven cellular efficacy and clinical success of many cereblon modulating agents, it remain unknown whether unique ubiquitin E2 enzymes control the ubiquitination of each specific cereblon neomorphic substrate, and whether loss of E2 enzymes contributes to resistance to these agents.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>UBE2G1 is the dominant ubiquitin E2 enzyme that governs the destruction of cereblon neomorphic substrates induced by cereblon modulating agents</title><p>The clinical course of multiple myeloma typically follows a recurring pattern of remission and relapse with resistance to IMiD drugs based combination regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harousseau and Attal, 2017</xref>). Such relapse is not frequently associated with cereblon downregulation and/or mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kortüm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qian et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, we reasoned that resistance to IMiD drugs in myeloma could be ascribed to reduced degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 as a result of inactivation of other essential components of the CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> ligase complex, for instance the E2 ubiquitin conjugation enzyme. To look for such proteins, we devised a high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 screen approach to monitor the effect of individual knockout of a gene of interest on POM-induced degradation of IKZF1 protein tagged with enhanced ProLabel (ePL), a small β-galactosidase N-terminal fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and created a single guide RNA (sgRNA) library containing three sgRNAs for each of the 41 annotated E2 enzymes in the human genome, as well as three non-targeting sgRNAs in arrayed format (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The ePL tag complements with the large β-galactosidase C-terminal fragment to form an active enzyme that hydrolyzes substrate to emit a chemiluminescent signal, allowing the measurement of ePL-IKZF1 fusion protein level in a high-throughput fashion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40958.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of UBE2G1 as the most critical ubiquitin E2 enzyme that mediates the pomalidomide-induced degradation of IKZF1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the design of the CRISPR screen to identify E2 enzyme(s) regulating the CM-induced degradation of ePL-tagged IKZF1 in 384-well array format.

We chose U937 cells for assessing the effect of individual gene knockout on POM-induced IKZF1 degradation because we were able to express the ePL-tagged IKZF1 fusion protein below the level of endogenous IKZF1 protein and POM can induce the efficient degradation of both endogenous and ePL-tagged IKZF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Four days post transduction, cells were seeded into 384-well plates pre-dispensed with either DMSO vehicle control or POM at varying concentrations. Sixteen hours after incubation, IKZF1 degradation was assessed using the ePL luminescent assay. As expected, cereblon knockout completely abrogated the degradation of ePL-tagged IKZF1 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using this approach we then evaluated the effect of individual knockout of each E2 enzyme on ePL-IKZF1 degradation induced by POM. Out of 41 E2 enzymes, UBE2G1 and to a lesser extent UBE2M, UBE2D3, and UBE2D2/UbcH5b, when depleted, imposed statistically significant inhibition on the ePL-IKZF1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D,F,I</xref>).</p><p>UBE2M, also called UBC12, is a NEDD8-conjuating enzyme, which regulates, via neddylation, the activity of all Cullin Ring E3 ligases including CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gong and Yeh, 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pan et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, MLN4924, an inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soucy et al., 2009</xref>), prevented the degradation of ePL-IKZF1 induced by POM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2V</xref>). The effect of UBE2M knockout, however, was much less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>). Given the well-established role of UBE2M in cell proliferation and survival, we reasoned that this difference could be explained by that U937 cells only with partial UBE2M loss survived four days after CRISPR gene editing. Consistent with this notion, cellular fitness was markedly reduced by 48 hr treatment of MLN2924 at concentrations that elicited near-complete blockage of POM-induced IKZF1 degradation in the U937_Cas9_ePL-IKZF1 cell line used in the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2V,W</xref>).</p><p>CRISPR knockout of UBE2G1 also attenuated the destabilization of endogenous IKZF1 by POM in U937 cells, and this defect could be rescued by wild-type UBE2G1, but not a UBE2G1 enzymatically-dead mutant (C90S, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Knockout of UBE2D3, on the other hand, showed very little effect on the degradation of endogenous IKZF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that there are additional E2 enzyme(s) modulating the degradation of IKZF1 cooperatively with UBE2G1. To identify such E2(s), we evaluated the effect of double knockout of UBE2G1 and one of the 41 E2 enzymes on IKZF1 degradation using a dual gRNA-directed gene knockout approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we surveyed the protein expression level of UBE2G1 in myeloma cell lines with variable sensitivity to LEN and POM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). LEN sensitive cell lines MM1S, OPM2, DF15 and NCI-H929 displayed higher expression level of UBE2G1 than LEN medium-sensitive cell line ANABL-6 and LEN resistant cell lines EJM, L363, SKMM-2, CAG and ARH-77, and more strikingly UBE2G1 expression in SKMM-2 was undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As expected, reintroduction of UBE2G1 wild-type but not C90S mutant significantly augmented the antiproliferative effect of both LEN and POM, which was linked to the enhanced degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

In this work, we provide evidence that CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> deploys the same mechanism to mark its neomorphic substrates with K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains for proteasomal degradation. Mechanistically, UBE2D3 transfers the first ubiquitin onto the lysine residue(s) of the cereblon neomophic substrate, thereby enabling UBE2G1 to assemble the K48-linked ubiquitin chains onto the initial anchor ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This orchestrated action between UBE2D3 and UBE2G1 closely resembles the cooperativity of UBE2D3 and Cdc34 in promoting IκBα polyubiquitination mediated by SCF<sup>βTRCP2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2010</xref>), except that unlike Cdc34, UBE2G1 does not possess the ability to transfer ubiquitin onto substrates without prior ubiquitin conjugation. UBE2G1 was known to produce K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains in the absence of an E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2015</xref>), but UBE2G1 cannot promote GSPT1 ubiquitination in the absence of CC-885 or Cul4A-Rbx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), indicating that close proximity of UBE2G1 to cereblon neomorphic substrates bridged by CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> is required to increase the processivity of UBE2G1 at physiological concentrations. This provides an explanation to how cereblon modulating agents can induce effective substrate degradation via K48-linked polyubiquitination, as well as speaks to the potential role of UBE2G1 in mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of other CRL4 cognate and/or neomorphic substrates. This is supported by the impaired degradation of p21 and RBM39 induced by UV irradiation and E7070 treatment, respectively, in 293T <italic>UBE2G1-/-</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).</p><p>Although UBE2D3 and UBE2G1 cooperatively regulate the ubiquitination of cereblon neomorphic substrates, ablation of UBE2D3 exhibited very little impact on substrate degradation as compared to loss of UBE2G1, suggesting that additional E2s might fulfill the role of UBE2D3, for example, other UBE2D family proteins with a high degree of sequence homology including UBE2D1/UbcH5a, UBE2D3, and UBE2D4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Indeed, UBE2D1 and UBE2D2 acted synergistically with UBE2G1 in catalyzing the in vitro ubiquitination of GSPT1 in the presence of CC-885, whereas cooperativity among UBE2D1, UBE2D2 and UBE2D3 cannot be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Knockout of UBE2D1, UBED2 or UBE2D4, however, did not further enhance the inhibition of POM-induced IKZF1 degradation imposed by UBE2G1 knockout in U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D,E</xref>). Below we consider various possible explanations for the surprising finding.</p><p>First, among all 4 UBE2D family proteins, UBE2D3 is likely the major but not the only E2 utilized by CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> to promote neomorphic substrate ubiquitination, possibly owing to their differences in interaction with CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>, binding affinity with CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> or simply relative protein abundance. Knockout of UBE2D3 could potentially remove the gridlock on CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>, enabling its binding with other UBE2D family proteins which otherwise are much less engaged by CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> under physiological conditions. If so, it is not surprising to observe the lack of cooperativity between UBE2G1 and UBE2D1, UBE2D2 or UBE2D4 in promoting IKZF1 degradation in UBE2D3 wild-type cells, as well as the lesser effect of UBE2D3 knockout on IKZF1 degradation than that of UBE2G1 knockout. Second, it is possible that similar to UBE2M/UBC12, UBE2D1, UBE2D2 or UBE2D4 is essential in U937 cells, and therefore only cells with partial inactivation of these three proteins survived after CRISPR knockout, resulting in the underestimation of their involvement in IKZF1 ubiquitination. Third, redundancy among UBE2D1, UBE2D2 and UBE2D4 in replacing the function of UBE2D3 could also prevent the identification of their cooperativity with UBE2G1 by a single gene inactivation approach as used in our screen. Further studies exploiting the combinatorial inactivation of UBE2D3 with one, two or all three remaining UBE2D family proteins will best address this issue. Lastly, we could not rule out the following less satisfying explanations: 1) ineffective gene editing efficiency of the sgRNAs we used to knockout UBE2D1, UBE2D2 and UBE2D4; 2) insufficient assay sensitivity leading to failure in detecting subtle changes of IKZF1 degradation conferred by double knockout of UBE2G1 with less critical E2(s) versus UBE2G1 knockout alone; 3) indirect impact of UBE2D3 inactivation or off-target effect of UBE2D3 sgRNAs on IKZF1 ubiquitination.</p><p>It is also interesting to point out that UBE2D3 knockout further blocked the degradation of IKZF1 in UBE2G1 deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), whereas the in vitro reconstituted ubiquitination assay clearly suggests that these two enzymes work in sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although double knockout of UBE2G1 and UBE2D3 significantly blocked the ubiquitination and degradation of IKZF1 in U937 and 293 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), this effect is still much less pronounced than that of CRBN knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating the existence of additional mechanism(s) modulating IKZF1 degradation. Based on the following observations, we speculate that UBE2D family proteins or other yet-to-be-identified E2(s) could promote the assembly of mixed polyubiquitin chains on cereblon neosubstrates in the absence of UBE2G1, resulting in their ineffective yet significant degradation. First, UBE2D1 and to a lesser extent UBE2D2 are capable of catalyzing CC-885-dependent in vitro polyubiquitination of GSPT1 without the help of UBE2G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>, lanes 2, 4 and 6). Second, UBE2D2 knockout impaired the POM-induced degradation of ePL-tagged IKZF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Third, UBE2D3 overexpression promoted in vivo polyubiquitination of IKZF1 in 293T <italic>UBE2G1-/-; UBE2D3-/-</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), as well as the degradation of GSPT1 in 293T <italic>UBE2G1-/-</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, we might also underappreciate the role of additional ubiquitin chain extending E2(s) that could functionally substitute for UBE2G1. For instance, a UBE2G1 paralog UBE2G2, which was shown to cooperate with UBE2G1 to mediate the polyubiquitination of Cdt1 by CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shibata et al., 2011</xref>), could play a similar redundant role in coordinating the ubiquitin chain assembly on cereblon neomorphic substrates. However, significant loss of cellular fitness following UBE2G2 knockout in the presence or absence of UBE2G1 in U937 cells could prevent the identification of UBE2G2 in our screen. Further experimentation is again required to explore these hypotheses. Taken together, we postulate that the CM-induced proteolysis of cereblon neomorphic substrates is both redundantly and cooperatively regulated by UBE2D family proteins and UBE2G1/2, with UBE2G1/2 playing a key role in enhancing the rate and extent of K48-linked substrate ubiquitination, resulting in rapid and efficient substrate degradation.</p><p>Although loss of UBE2G1 conferred resistance to LEN and POM in human myeloma cell lines, it remains to be seen whether UBE2G1 deficiency occurs in human myeloma patients with inherent or acquired resistance to IMiD drug treatment, especially those with normal cereblon expression. The myeloma cell line SKMM-2, which lost both copies of the <italic>UBE2G1</italic> gene (based on gene copy number characterization in Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia), and has undetectable UBE2G1 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), was derived from a human myeloma patient who never received any prior treatment with IMiD drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eton et al., 1989</xref>), warranting the further clinical evaluation of UBE2G1 activity in myeloma patients. Given that UBE2G1 inactivation conferred resistance to all CMs tested and also to cereblon-based PROTACs, patient stratification approaches based on UBE2G1 status might be applicable to the development of IMiD drugs and other novel cereblon modulating agents for a variety of human diseases. Lastly, CC-220, a novel CM that targets IKZF1 and IKZF3 for degradation much more effectively than does LEN or POM, retained strong antitumor activity at clinically achievable concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schafer et al., 2018</xref>) in UBE2G1-deficient myeloma cells, suggesting that human patients with resistance to CM drugs owing to diminished UBE2G1 function may be responsive to next-generation CMs that possess higher efficiency and/or potency for degrading the same target protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Forty-eight hours post transfection, cells were treated with 10 μM MG-132 (R and D systems) with or without an increased concentrations of pomalidomide as indicated. Eight hours later, cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS and resuspended in 1 mL PBS. Twenty uL of the cell suspension was boiled in LDS loading buffer, and the remaining cells were collected via centrifugation and lysed in Buffer C (6M guanidine-HCL, 0.1M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). Next, whole cell extracts were sonicated for 12 pulses, and mixed with 20 μL of HisPur Ni-NTA Magnetic Beads (Thermofisher) at 37°C for 4 hr. Ni-NTA beads were then washed three times with Buffer C, three times with Buffer D (1 vol of Buffer C: 3 volumes of Buffer E), and three times with Buffer E (25 mM Tris.CL, 20 mM imidazole, pH 6.8). Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2x LDS loading buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Rabbit anti-human CRBN65 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Celgene, San Diego, CA); rabbit anti-human GSPT1 polyclonal antibody (pAb; Abcam, #ab49878), rabbit anti-human IKZF1 mAb (Cell Signaling, #14859), rabbit anti-human IKZF3 mAb (Cell Signaling, #15103), rabbit anti-human CK1α pAb (Abcam, #ab108296), rabbit anti-human ZFP91 pAb (LifeSpan Biosciences, #LS-B14788), mouse anti-human UBE2G1 mAb (Santa Cruz, #SC-100619), rabbit anti-human UBE2G1 pAb (Abcam, #SC-101371), mouse anti-human UBE2D3 mAb (Abcam, #ab58251), rabbit anti-human UBE2D3 pAb (Sigma, #SAB2102622), rabbit anti-human Cul4A pAb (Cell Signaling, #2699), rabbit anti-human DDB1 pAb (Cell Signaling, #5428), rabbit anti-human Rbx1 pAb (Cell Signaling, #4397), rabbit anti-human Cdt1 mAb (Cell Signaling, #8064), rabbit anti-human Cdt2 pAb (Cell Signaling, #A300-948A), rabbit anti-human Set8 pAb (Cell Signaling, #2996), rabbit anti-human RBM39 pAb (Sigma, #HPA001591), rabbit anti-human p21 mAb (Cell Signaling, #2947), rabbit anti-human p27 mAb (Cell Signaling, #3686), rabbit anti-human c-Myc mAb (Cell Signaling, #5605), rabbit anti-human BRD4 pAb (Abcam, #ab128874), mouse anti-penta-HIS mAb (Qiagen, #34660), mouse anti-human Actin mAb (Sigma, #A5316) and mouse anti-human Tubulin mAb (Sigma, #T9026)(Sigma) were used as primary antibodies.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Wade Harper as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Lu et al. reported the identification of two ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes, UBE2G1 and UBE2D3, that function cooperatively with the CRL4-DDB1-CRBN ubiquitin E3 ligase complex to polyubiquitinate neomorphic substrates in the presence of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and their derivative compounds. The authors identified the two E2s with a CRISPR-CAS screen, in which the effect on the pomalidomide-induced IKZF1 degradation was monitored with all human E2 enzymes individually knocked out. With both in vitro and in vivo polyubiquitination assays, the authors have further revealed that the two E2s, UBE2D3 and UBE2G1, act sequentially to build mono- and K48-linked polyubiquitin chain on the CRBN substrates. Last but not least, the authors provided evidence suggesting that UBE2G1 downregulation confers drug resistance to lenalidomide and pomalidomide, but not CC-220, a more potent IMiD derivative.</p><p>Overall speaking, the significance of the study is three-fold. First, proper mapping of cognate E2s for specific E3s has been a major gap in the field of protein ubiquitination. Although several E2s, such as CDC34 and RAD6, have been successfully paired with their E3s, thanks to early genetic studies, the majority of E2s and E3s have not been functionally associated. This problem compromises the significance of many biochemical studies, in which the activity of an E3 is usually established or examined with a promiscuous, but not necessarily relevant, E2. In the case of CRL E3s, which share the same RBX1 RING subunit, it has been particularly perplexing that CDC34 works well with SCF/CRL1, but not other CRL subfamilies. This study has elegantly addressed this question, at least for CRL4. Second, the sequential actions of UBE2D3 and UBE2G1 provide an interesting explanation for why the CRL4-CRBN E3 requires two different E2 enzymes to polyubiquitinate its substrates. The mechanism is highly reminiscent of the sequential functions of UBE2D3 and CDC34 with SCF. Third, the CRL4-DDB1-CRBN E3 complex represents the first ubiquitin ligase which is reprogrammed by a class of clinically used drugs for neo-substrate degradation. The findings of this study offer us a better understanding of drug resistance mechanisms and might guide the development of future generations of IMiDs.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After reviewer consultation, it is recommended that the paper be accepted with only minor revisions (see below), which hopefully will allow rapid publication. Although a recent previous paper reported similar results, the current study was clearly performed contemporaneously, is highly complementary, and fits easily within <italic>eLife</italic>'s editorial policy on overlapping papers.</p><p>1) The Petroski and Deshaies review used for CRLs is terribly out of date, being published in 2005. There are several more recent CRL reviews that could be used instead or in addition to this paper.</p><p>2) In the last paragraph of the Introduction, the authors discuss the sequential reaction of UbcH5 and Cdc34 in the context of specific SCFs. This however may be a minor pathway compared with the apparently much more widespread use of the ARIH1 co-E3 for priming substrate ubiquitylation (see Pubmed: 27565346). Minimally the ARIH1 model should be mentioned as an additional mechanism for initial transfer of Ub to substrate followed by chain assembly with Cdc34. In reality, since ARIH1 is a RBR E3 (receiving Ub from UbcH7), once could consider this mechanism as just being 2 different E2s.</p><p>3) In Figure 3, the cell lines should be indicated with the gels, not just in the legend in order to make it easier to follow.</p><p>4) In the last paragraph of the subsection “UBE2G1 is the dominant ubiquitin E2 enzyme that governs the destruction of cereblon neomorphic substrates induced by cereblon modulating agents”, the authors conclude that UBE3G1 might be specific for CUL4 E3s given that its deletion didn't affect 2 SCF targets. However, there are no experiments that rule out a role for other CRLs, so this sentence should be modified. It is also not clear whether UBE2G1 works for some or all other CRL4 complexes normally.</p><p>5) Abstract: The authors claim that their data suggest that &quot;loss of UBE2G1 activity might be a resistance mechanism to drugs that hijack the CRL4CRBN to eliminate disease-driving proteins, and that this resistance mechanism can be overcome by next-generation CMs that destroy the same targeted protein more effectively&quot;. The statement should be removed from the Abstract as there is no data showing that a change in UBE2G1 activity actually occurs during the development of drug resistance.</p><p>6) In the second paragraph of the subsection “UBE2G1 is the dominant ubiquitin E2 enzyme that governs the destruction of cereblon neomorphic substrates induced by cereblon modulating agents”, the use of U937 cells in the CRISPR screen needs to be justified.</p><p>7) Figure 1—figure supplement 2 was mentioned before Figure 1—figure supplement 1C. Additionally, in the subsection “UBE2G1 is the dominant ubiquitin E2 enzyme that governs the destruction of cereblon neomorphic substrates induced by cereblon modulating agents”, 'co-treatment' is confusing. Is there another drug in the experiment?</p><p>8) Subsection “UBE2G1 is the dominant ubiquitin E2 enzyme that governs the destruction of cereblon neomorphic substrates induced by cereblon modulating agents”, fourth paragraph. Although the authors' results clearly suggest that there should be at least another E2 that act in parallel to UBE2G1 to degrade IKZF1 (the effect of UbE2G1 knockout is much smaller than that of E3 knockout), surprisingly, the double sgRNA screen did not reveal any additional E2s that can mediate IKZF1 degradation. It is also surprising that knockout of Ube2D3 could enhance the effect of UBE2G1 knockout although the model suggests that the two enzymes work in sequence. I feel that these data are not explained well. The authors should keep in mind that UBE2D3 is a quite promiscuous E2 and works with many E3s. Thus, the effect of UBE2D3 knockout may not always be direct. This could be addressed to a large degree by re-wording of the text.</p><p>9) Subsection “UBE2G1 is the dominant ubiquitin E2 enzyme that governs the destruction of cereblon neomorphic substrates induced by cereblon modulating agents”, fifth paragraph.

There are several more recent CRL reviews that could be used instead or in addition to this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing out this obvious negligence to us. A more recent CRL review article (Lehti et al., 2013) is now cited as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the last paragraph of the Introduction, the authors discuss the sequential reaction of UbcH5 and Cdc34 in the context of specific SCFs. This however may be a minor pathway compared with the apparently much more widespread use of the ARIH1 co-E3 for priming substrate ubiquitylation (see Pubmed: 27565346). Minimally the ARIH1 model should be mentioned as an additional mechanism for initial transfer of Ub to substrate followed by chain assembly with Cdc34. In reality, since ARIH1 is a RBR E3 (receiving Ub from UbcH7), once could consider this mechanism as just being 2 different E2s.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the great suggestion. The sequential ubiquitination of SCF substrates carried out by ARIH1/UbcH7 and CRL/Cdc34 is now discussed in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 3, the cell lines should be indicated with the gels, not just in the legend in order to make it easier to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. All gels are now labeled with the cell line names indicated at the top of each figure panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the last paragraph of the subsection “UBE2G1 is the dominant ubiquitin E2 enzyme that governs the destruction of cereblon neomorphic substrates induced by cereblon modulating agents”, the authors conclude that UBE3G1 might be specific for CUL4 E3s given that its deletion didn't affect 2 SCF targets. However, there are no experiments that rule out a role for other CRLs, so this sentence should be modified. It is also not clear whether UBE2G1 works for some or all other CRL4 complexes normally.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comment. We have changed the wording to “[…] indicating the specific regulation of CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> by UBE2G1”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Abstract: The authors claim that their data suggest that &quot;loss of UBE2G1 activity might be a resistance mechanism to drugs that hijack the CRL4CRBN to eliminate disease-driving proteins, and that this resistance mechanism can be overcome by next-generation CMs that destroy the same targeted protein more effectively&quot;. The statement should be removed from the Abstract as there is no data showing that a change in UBE2G1 activity actually occurs during the development of drug resistance.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is merely a speculation that UBE2G1 loss could contribute to resistance to cereblon-repurposing drugs in human patients, even though loss of UBE2G1 expression in human cancer cell lines tested did confer resistance to immunomodulatory drugs and their derivatives. We have removed the claim and changed the wording to “Collectively, it will be of fundamental interest to explore if loss of UBE2G1 activity is linked to clinical resistance to drugs that hijack the CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> to eliminate disease-driving proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the second paragraph of the subsection “UBE2G1 is the dominant ubiquitin E2 enzyme that governs the destruction of cereblon neomorphic substrates induced by cereblon modulating agents”, the use of U937 cells in the CRISPR screen needs to be justified.</p></disp-quote><p>The cell line selection criteria we applied for the CRISPR screen were the following:</p><p>1) A cell line that expresses endogenous IKZF1, which can be used as an internal control to determine the expression level of the ePL-tagged IKZF1 stability reporter. We tried to keep the expression level of the ePL-IKZF1 fusion protein comparable to that of endogenous IKZF1, so that the ePL-IKZF1 fusion protein will not saturate the ubiquitination/degradation machinery controlling the pomalidomide-induced IKZF1 degradation. Thus, the ePL-IKZF1 reporter could be used to monitor the degradation of IKZF1 under near-physiological conditions. For this reason, myeloma, DLBCL and AML cell lines which express endogenous IKZF1 are our best screen models. We successfully generated a U937 cell line stably expressing ePL-IKZF1 at a level below its endogenous protein (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>2) A cell line in which pomalidomide could induce robust degradation of IKZF1 without affecting cell proliferation and survival during the course of the ePL assay. Since a cell-autonomous effect of pomalidomide on cell proliferation and/or survival would obscure the readout of the ePL-IKZF1 reporter, myeloma and DLBCL cell lines which depend on IKZF1 and IKZF3 for survival were not chosen for the screen. It was shown previously that lenalidomide could induce the degradation of IKZF1 in a neddylation- and proteasome-dependent manner in U937 cells (Lu et al., Science 2014). We have confirmed that pomalidomide could also induce the cereblon-dependent degradation of IKZF1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) without affecting cellular fitness (data not shown).</p><p>3) A cell line that has a high lentiviral transduction efficiency and quickly recovers after lentiviral infection. Lentiviral transduction inhibits cell proliferation for several days in many DLBCL and myeloma cell lines. Moreover, considering the potential essential function of many E2s for cell proliferation and/or survival, we think that long term culture of cells following CRISPR knockout of essential E2s will lead to enrichment of clones with less inactivation of the respective E2s, and therefore we could potentially underestimate their effects on pomalidomide-induced IKZF1 degradation. In our hand, U937 AML cell line fits this criteria better than other AML cell lines tested.</p><p>Justification for the use of U937 cells is now added in the main text: “We chose U937 cells for assessing the effect of individual gene knockout on POM-induced IKZF1 degradation, because we were able to express the ePL-tagged IKZF1 fusion protein below the level of endogenous IKZF1 protein, and POM can induce the efficient degradation of both endogenous and ePL-tagged IKZF1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 1—figure supplement 2 was mentioned before Figure 1—figure supplement 1C. Additionally, in subsection “UBE2G1 is the dominant ubiquitin E2 enzyme that governs the destruction of cereblon neomorphic substrates induced by cereblon modulating agents”, 'co-treatment' is confusing. Is there another drug in the experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1C is now changed to Figure 1—figure supplement 2V.</p><p>We apologize for the confusion. “Co-treatment” means that U937 cells were incubated with both pomalidomide and MLN4924. The text now reads:</p><p>“Indeed, MLN4924, an inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (Soucy et al., 2009), prevented the degradation of ePL-IKZF1 induced by POM (Figure 1—figure supplement 2V).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “UBE2G1 is the dominant ubiquitin E2 enzyme that governs the destruction of cereblon neomorphic substrates induced by cereblon modulating agents”, fourth paragraph. Although the authors' results clearly suggest that there should be at least another E2 that act in parallel to UBE2G1 to degrade IKZF1 (the effect of UbE2G1 knockout is much smaller than that of E3 knockout), surprisingly, the double sgRNA screen did not reveal any additional E2s that can mediate IKZF1 degradation. It is also surprising that knockout of Ube2D3 could enhance the effect of UBE2G1 knockout although the model suggests that the two enzymes work in sequence. I feel that these data are not explained well. The authors should keep in mind that UBE2D3 is a quite promiscuous E2 and works with many E3s. Thus, the effect of UBE2D3 knockout may not always be direct. This could be addressed to a large degree by re-wording of the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewers’ comment that our observation is quite perplexing. In agreement with the independent finding made by Dr. Ben Ebert’s lab (Sievers QL et al., Blood 2018), UBE2G1 could promote the K48-linked ubiquitin chain assembly on IKZF1 only when primed with monoubiquitin(s) by UBE2D3. Logically one would expect knockout of UBE2D3 should have similar effect on the degradation of IKZF1 as did UBE2G1 inactivation. We also agree with the reviewers that one should expect to identify additional E2s mediating IKZF1 ubiquitination in addition to UBE2D3, based on the differential effect of UBE2G1 knockout and CRBN knockout.</p><p>One explanation, as the reviewer clearly pointed out, is that there might be another E2 that we missed in the screen, and the effect of UBE2D3 knockout could be indirect. Given the redundant role of UBE2D family proteins in catalyzing the in vitro ubiquitination of GSPT1 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), and the potential redundancy between UBE2G1 and its paralog UBE2G2 (although this mechanism has not been validated in our manuscript), we proposed several hypotheses to address the reviewers’ concern (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Subsection “UBE2G1 is the dominant ubiquitin E2 enzyme that governs the destruction of cereblon neomorphic substrates induced by cereblon modulating agents”, fifth paragraph. Please link each substrate with a specific panel. It is hard to scan through panels scattered in 4 different figures in order to follow each of the substrates mentioned here.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the great suggestion. Each substrate is now linked to specific panels. The text now reads:</p><p>“Ablation of UBE2G1 significantly diminished the degradation of IKFZ1 (Figures 3A, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B), IKZF3 (Figures 3A, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B) and ZFP91 (Figures 7B, and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B, D) by LEN, POM, and CC-220, as well as CK1α degradation (Figures 7B, and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B, D) by LEN in OPM2, DF15 and MM1S myeloma cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors refer to different lanes in immunoblots, but the lanes are not labeled.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our negligence. The lanes in Figures 4A-E, Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, 2B, Figures 5A-C, and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C are now labeled.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Subsection “UBE2G1 mediates the ubiquitination of cereblon neomorphic substrates”, last paragraph: why does expression of UBE2D3 in UBE2G1 knockout cells partially rescue the degradation phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>Although UBE2D3 alone could only promote the monoubiquitination of CRBN neosubstrates IKZF1 and GSPT1 in vitro (Figure 4A and 4B), overexpressed UBE2D3 induced monoubiquitination and to a lesser extent polyubiquitination of IKZF1 in 293T UBE2G1-/- cells (Figure 5B). It is possible that other E2s such as UBE2G2 could still cooperate with overexpressed UBE2D3 to enhance the rate of CRBN neosubstrate ubiquitination degradation. Alternatively, UBE2D3 itself could indirectly promote neosubstrate ubiquitination and degradation in cells, though this effect may not be physiologically relevant. Nevertheless, the differential effect of FLAG-tagged UBE2D3 wild-type and C85S mutant on GSPT1 degradation in 293T UBE2G1 -/- cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B), suggests that FLAG-UBE2D3 is a functional enzyme.</p><p>According to the <italic>eLife</italic>’s publication guideline, we made a few additional changes: 1) rename all supplementary figures and supplementary file; 2) add raw source data for all graphs; 3) reword the Abstract due to word count limit; 4) add a key resources table.</p></body></sub-article></article>
