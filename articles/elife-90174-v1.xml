multidrug resistance and mediates the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of many drugs (Juliano and Ling, 1976; Ueda et al., 1986; Sharom, 2011). Decades of structural and biochemical studies have provided insights into how Pgp binds diverse compounds (Loo and Clarke, 2000; Loo et al., 2009; Aller et al., 2009; Alam et al., 2019; Nosol et al., 2020; Chufan et al., 2015), but how they are translocated through the membrane has remained elusive. Here, we covalently attached a cyclic substrate to discrete sites of Pgp and determined multiple complex structures in inward- and outward-facing states by cryoEM. In conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations, our structures trace the substrate passage across the membrane and identify conformational changes in transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) as regulators of substrate transport. In mid-transport conformations, TM1 breaks at glycine 72. Mutation of this residue significantly impairs drug transport of Pgp in vivo, corroborating the importance of its regulatory role. Importantly, our data suggest that the cyclic substrate can exit Pgp without the requirement of a wide-open outward-facing conformation, diverting from the common efflux model for Pgp and other ABC exporters. The substrate transport mechanism of Pgp revealed here pinpoints critical targets for future drug discovery studies of this medically relevant system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ABC transporter</kwd><kwd>P-glycoprotein</kwd><kwd>mechanism</kwd><kwd>substrate translocation</kwd><kwd>covalent ligand</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM structure</kwd><kwd>outward-facing conformation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118594</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Qinghai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM148675</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Qinghai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM141216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Urbatsch</surname><given-names>Ina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100020278</institution-id><institution>South Plains Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Urbatsch</surname><given-names>Ina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sonderforschungsbereich 944</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moeller</surname><given-names>Arne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01ED2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moeller</surname><given-names>Arne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CHE-2203284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sonderforschungsbereich 1557</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moeller</surname><given-names>Arne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INST 190/196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moeller</surname><given-names>Arne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

In the blood-brain, blood-testis, and blood-placenta barriers, Pgp protects and detoxifies sanctuaries from xenobiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schinkel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borst and Schinkel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fromm, 2004</xref>). Of central importance for many chemotherapeutic treatments, Pgp is a major determinant of drug bioavailability and pharmacokinetics and confers multidrug resistance in several diseases, most notably cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szakács et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gottesman and Ling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giacomini et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, evasion, selective inhibition, and modulation of Pgp transport are important goals in drug development, but are hindered by a lack of detailed understanding of the drug transport mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waghray and Zhang, 2018</xref>).</p><p>For Pgp and ABC transporters in general, ATP binding, hydrolysis, and subsequent release of the cleaved products (inorganic phosphate and ADP) fuel large-scale conformational changes that ultimately result in translocation of substrates across the membrane bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rees et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>). In inward-facing (IF) conformations, the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) are separated, and substrates can access a large binding cavity that is open to the lower membrane leaflet and cytoplasm. ATP-induced dimerization of the NBDs promotes large rearrangements of the transmembrane domains (TMDs) from an IF to an outward-facing (OF) conformation, from which the substrate is released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Januliene and Moeller, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verhalen et al., 2017</xref>). Pgp structures with bound substrates and inhibitors in IF conformations have revealed one or more overlapping binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loo and Clarke, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nosol et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szewczyk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alam et al., 2018</xref>). Multimodal binding mechanisms for chemically related compounds have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chufan et al., 2015</xref>), including access of hydrophobic ligands from the lipid-protein interface to the binding sites of Pgp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nosol et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szewczyk et al., 2015</xref>). However, structural data that elucidate how substrates are shuttled across the lipid bilayer to the extracellular space are unavailable at present. So far, only a single OF structure of mammalian Pgp has been described, but without detectable substrate density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Chen, 2018</xref>). Most insights into the transport pathway arise from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which are also limited by the scarcity of available structural details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Göddeke and Schäfer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCormick et al., 2015</xref>). Consequently, the molecular mechanics that move the substrate through the transmembrane passage have remained elusive. To address this fundamental question and overcome the dynamic and transient nature of substrate translocation, we tethered a substrate molecule covalently to specific residues along the putative translocation pathway of Pgp and utilized cryoEM to capture Pgp structures with bound substrate during various stages of transport.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Covalent ligand design for Pgp labeling</title><p>For covalent labeling of Pgp, we synthesized a derivative of the previously published QZ-Ala tripeptide substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szewczyk et al., 2015</xref>), by substituting one of the three Ala with Cys that is disulfide-linked to a 2,4-dinitrophenyl thiolate group (designated AAC-DNPT, see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). QZ-Ala is a strong ATPase stimulator and subject to Pgp transport as evidenced by its reduced cytotoxicity in cells overexpressing Pgp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szewczyk et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, we have measured Pgp-mediated transport of QZ-Ala in the MDCK-ABCB1 monolayer permeability assay (see Materials and methods). The efflux ratio (R<sub>E</sub>) of QZ-Ala was determined as 2.5. In the presence of the Pgp inhibitor cyclosporin A, R<sub>E</sub> was 0.9, indicating that the Pgp-specific transport of QZ-Ala was inhibited. Derivatizing QZ-Ala is simplified by its structural symmetry, which reduces the complexity of modifying this transport substrate for attachment to Pgp in different states. Furthermore, attachment of DNPT strongly activates disulfide exchange, allowing rapid and efficient crosslinking between the cyclic peptide and accessible cysteines. Free DNPT, released during crosslinking, is bright yellow. This provides a simple, visible readout that can be monitored with a UV-Vis spectrometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Four single-Cys mutants of Pgp (Pgp335, Pgp978, Pgp971, and Pgp302) were generated for crosslinking, and mutations were chosen near the two previously reported QZ-Ala binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szewczyk et al., 2015</xref>). L335C in transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) and V978C in TM12 are situated at symmetric positions on opposing TMD halves, while L971C is located two helical turns above V978 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Residues L335C, V978C, as well as I302C located in TM5 were previously shown to be labeled with verapamil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loo and Clarke, 2001</xref>). Based on the appearance of the yellow DNPT byproduct, Pgp335 and Pgp978 reacted with AAC-DNPT within minutes, while Pgp971 and Pgp302 did not. Even after extended incubations only background absorbances were detected comparable to Cys-less Pgp (CL-Pgp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Only after adding Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATP to fuel substrate translocation, Pgp971 reacted with AAC-DNPT, but Pgp302 did not (data not shown). Covalent attachment of the cyclic peptide AAC was further validated by high-resolution mass spectrometry of trypsin-digested peptide fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). The presence of non-covalent transport substrates such as QZ-Ala or verapamil increase ATP hydrolysis in CL-Pgp and the single Cys mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5a</xref>). Similar to QZ-Ala, AAC-DNTP stimulated ATPase activity of CL-Pgp at low concentrations; with half-maximal enhancement of activity (EC50) seen at submicromolar concentrations, suggesting that it also acts as substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5b</xref>).

Comparing the ligand positions between the IF and OF structures, in IF335-2lig to OF335-1lig, and IF978-2lig to OF978-1lig, the covalently attached ligand pivots around the respective Cys residue by almost 180°, moving it further up the translocation tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4a, b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>).

The ligand position and orientation in OF335-1lig and OF978-1lig overall coincide well, with the latter shifting up slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4d</xref>).

In simulations starting from OF978-1lig at T=400 K, we observed movement and release of the non-covalently bound substrate to the extracellular side moderated by interactions between the ligand and hydrophobic residues in the upper part of TM1 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). The intermediate steps coincided well with the conformations observed in cryoEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). Without any bias imposed, the substrate progressed to a position closely matching OF971-1lig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4b</xref>). Then, while TM1 gradually refolded from the intracellular side, the substrate wiggled out to form transient interactions with the still unstructured extracellular part of TM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Importantly, the substrate escaped without Pgp experiencing a wide opening of the extracellular region. After the substrate left the exit tunnel, TM1 continued to refold to attain a straight helix configuration like OF335-nolig at the end of the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In a simulation starting from OF335-1lig performed at T=330 K, a similar release pathway was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). As the only difference, the substrate has not fully dissociated from the protein after 2.5 μs, with weak interactions persisting at the top part of TM1 from the extracellular side. Importantly, this is a configuration observed also in higher temperature simulations but with much shorter lifetime. Overall, with exception of TM1, motions in Pgp to accommodate the moving substrate were mostly limited to small dilations of the transmembrane helices, supporting our observations from cryoEM.</p><p>Our cryoEM structures and MD simulations revealed an important regulatory role of TM1 during substrate transport, emphasizing the helix-breaking G72. Therefore, we mutated this residue, which is highly conserved in mammalian Pgp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), to a helix-stabilizing alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">López-Llano et al., 2006</xref>) and tested the mutant’s ability to export structurally diverse fungicides and to convey drug resistance in vivo. Compared to the wild-type and CL-Pgp, the G72A mutant expressed normally in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), but showed significantly reduced growth resistance to the test drugs including doxorubicin, FK506, and valinomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). As drug transport was severely impaired, we further investigated the mutant’s ATPase activity. In presence of transport substrates such as FK506, valinomycin, or verapamil, the ATPase activity of WT Pgp was significantly stimulated; however, the G72A mutant displayed only low levels of basal ATPase activity (in the absence of drug) and the response to drug stimulation was greatly diminished over a range of concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–g</xref>). To reveal potential structural consequences responsible for the loss of function, we performed cryoEM on the Pgp335 G72A mutant after crosslinking the single cysteine L335C with AAC-DNTP and stabilizing the OF complex with Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATP and vanadate in a post-hydrolysis intermediate state. After multi-model classification, two conformations emerged. The first conformation, resolved at 3.0 Å, shows no substrate bound in analogy to OF335-nolig. The second dominant conformation is, however, much more heterogenous, resulting in a reduced and anisotropic resolution of approximately 4.6 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here, the NBDs are well resolved but several transmembrane helices are missing, including TM1 in which residue G72A is located. The structural disorder, observed in the transmembrane region, is likely a result of the tethered ligand, causing local distortion of the surrounding α-helices as TM1 may not be able to kink at G72 in the mutant, which could explain its impaired transport function. Collectively, the significant differences in drug resistance profiles and drug-stimulated ATP hydrolysis rates between the G72A mutant and WT-Pgp along with our structural findings substantiate and highlight the key role of TM1 for the regulation of substrate transport in Pgp.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data suggest a mechanism for how Pgp mediates substrate transport. Transport commences in the IF conformation with binding of the substrate. Upon ATP-induced NBD dimerization, the transporter converges into an OF conformation in which the intracellular gate is closed. The presence of the substrate in the OF conformation of Pgp dislocates TM1 at A63 and introduces a sharp kink at G72, forcing the helix to unwind partially between TM1 and TM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This enlarges the extracellular loop which shields the transmembrane tunnel from the extracellular environment and guides the substrate to move up the translocation tunnel, allowing TM1 to gradually restabilize. During the last stages of transport (OF971-1lig to OF335-nolig), the TM1-TM2 regulatory loop straightens, and the substrate-interacting hydrophobic residues (M74 and F78) rotate and pivot away from the tunnel, which facilitates the escape of the substrate from the transporter. Although OF971-1lig captured a post-hydrolysis state, we cannot rule out the possibility of ligand release prior to ATP hydrolysis, when it is not covalently bound. Notwithstanding, the proposed TM1 kinking and straightening mechanism of substrate expulsion would obviate the requirement for the Y-shaped, wide-open OF conformation reported for multiple bacterial ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ward et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dawson and Locher, 2006</xref>), suggesting a substrate-dependent transport mechanism in Pgp, or else a divergence of mechanisms among ABC transporters.</p><p>For the OF335-2lig structure, observed in the same dataset as OF335-1lig and OF335-nolig, we hypothesize that the hydrophobic nature of the substrate promotes the binding of two substrate molecules to each other. MD simulations with this structure as a starting conformation reveal no separation of the two molecules, suggesting that they might be treated as one bigger substrate in the transport event. With the binding positions differing between OF335-1lig and OF335-2lig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplements 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), neither the cryoEM structure nor the simulations allow conclusions about a possible transport mechanism of two ligands at this point.</p><p>How ABC transporters move substrates through the lipid bilayer has been a long-standing question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). The scarcity of high-resolution structures of substrate-bound OF conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chaptal et al., 2022</xref>), especially in the highly transient intermediate states, has severely limited our understanding of this vital process. Here, we were able to determine eight high-resolution structures of the archetypical ABC transporter Pgp, revealing the underlying molecular mechanics of substrate translocation. In general, the large number and diversity of ABC transporters, and the even wider variety of their substrates, make it unlikely that a universal substrate translocation mechanism will emerge. Our strategy of stalling the otherwise highly transient intermediates in this process through crosslinking and subsequent high-resolution cryoEM analysis could serve as a blueprint to understand the transport mechanisms of lipid transporters as well as other members of the transporter family.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Synthesis of compounds and analysis</title><p>The synthesis route and compound numbers are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.

We used a time step of 0.002 ps in all simulations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft, TG performed cryoEM and single particle analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft, DW conducted ligand synthesis and crosslinking, identified Pgp single Cys mutants, performed biochemical characterization, and optimized and prepared Pgp samples for mass spectrometry and cryoEM studies</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, KP built molecular models</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing, HJ conducted molecular dynamics simulations</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, NT assayed G72A function</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, JZ expressed Pgp mutants</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing, PZ performed mass spectrometric characterization of crosslinking</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft, DJ assisted with cryoEM experiments and data analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, ILU assisted with the mutant design and Pgp labeling experiments</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, AM designed and supervised the cryoEM research</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, QZ conceived and initiated the project, designed the research, and coordinated collaborations</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>CryoEM data collection, refinement, and validation statistics.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-90174-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Summary of cryoEM data for the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) mutants.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-90174-supp2-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Equilibration protocol for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-90174-supp3-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-90174-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All cryoEM density maps have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank under accession numbers EMD-14754, EMD-14755, EMD-14756, EMD-14758, EMD-14759, EMD-14760, EMD-14761, EMD-15687 and EMD-17630.

is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Weakness: Although the cross-links stimulate ATP hydrolysis, further controls are needed to convince me that the TM1 conformations observed in the structures are physiologically relevant, since they have been trapped by &quot;large&quot; substrates covalently-tethered by crosslinks.</p></disp-quote><p>Our response: Reviewer 1 raised concerns about the relatively large size of our covalently attached AAC substrate that would potentially distort TM1 in Pgp. We would like to clarify that AAC has a molecular weight of 462 Da, which, in comparison to many known Pgp substrates ranging from 250 to over 1,000 Da, is not a large compound. For instance, the few other Pgp substrates mentioned in our manuscript all have a comparable or larger size: verapamil, 455 Da; doxorubicin, 544 Da; FK506, 804 Da; valinomycin, 1,111 Da; cyclosporin A, 1,203 Da.</p><p>Furthermore, AAC was strategically attached to a site distant from TM1 in the inwardfacing Pgp conformation. After it was exported to the outward-facing state, several TM helices accommodate the compound. The observation that only TM1 exhibited significant conformational changes suggests its potential role in the transport mechanism. This hypothesis is supported by our findings, where a conservative substitution (G72A) in TM1 resulted in a dramatic loss of transport function for various drug substrates and impaired verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p><p>I understand the need for an unconventional approach to understanding the translocation pathway. What would help to support this model is to cross-link a much smaller substrate, as the one used is quite large and could potentially distort TM1 in the outward-state when cross-linked.</p></disp-quote><p>Our response: We thank the reviewer for this recommendation, and we have outlined plans for future experiments involving other substrates, including smaller ones, to further investigate our proposed model. However, it is important to acknowledge that conducting these studies will require a significant amount of effort and resources, which we believe extend beyond the scope of our current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In unbiased MD simulations starting from the IF state are there any simulations where the substrate follows the same path as proposed here?</p></disp-quote><p>Our response: All our MD simulations were performed in the outward-facing state to focus on potential substrate release pathways. Starting MD simulations from the inwardfacing state would introduce complexities in capturing the necessary domain motions and nucleotide binding and hydrolysis required for substrate translocations. Therefore, we opted not to perform MD studies starting from the inward-facing state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Weakness: There is much to like about the experimental work here but I am less sanguine on the interpretation. The main idea is to covalently link via disulfide bonds a model tripeptide substrate under different conditions that mimic transport and then image the resulting conformations. The choice of the Pgp cysteine mutants here is critical but also poses questions regarding the interpretation. What seems to be missing, or not reported, is a series of control experiments for further cysteine mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>Our response: Reviewer 2 raised concerns about the interpretation of our results and suggested the need for additional mutant designs to validate our proposed TM1 mechanism. Firstly, we believe that the observed TM1 conformational changes are valid in our cryoEM structures, despite the use of different conditions and several mutants to capture Pgp in the outward-facing state.</p><p>Regarding the G72A mutant, we consider it conclusive that this single point mutation in the TM1 has a profound effect. Importantly, the G72A mutant was readily expressed and purifiable as a stable protein. We were able to resolve a high-resolution structure of the G72A mutant (without the substrate), confirming that the protein is not generally destabilized but properly folded.</p><p>Above all, we appreciate the Reviewer’s suggestion to explore additional mutations and intend to do so in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p><p>I am sold on the results regarding TM1 conformational changes as they are evident in the cryoEM structures. However, the set of states compared between mutants are not biochemically equivalent: for 335 and 978 they used an ATP-impaired Pgp whereas for 971 they used what appears to be WT, and the conformation was imaged presumably subsequent to ATP hydrolysis and Vanadate trapping. This is significant if the authors were unable to trap the OF in the impaired mutant background and should be highlighted. I have to believe that they tried that condition but I could be wrong.</p></disp-quote><p>Our response: We acknowledge the point made by the Reviewer about the biochemical equivalence of mutant states and the potential significance of using an ATP-impaired mutant for trapping the outward-facing conformation of 971. We have not yet attempted to use the ATPase-deficient 971C mutant for crosslinking and intend to address this question in future studies.</p><p>In our current approach, we used the ATPase-active 971C for two specific reasons:</p><p>1. Our biochemistry data, as shown in Fig 1C, indicates that 971C only crosslinks in the presence of ATP hydrolysis conditions. Vanadate trapping was employed to stabilize the outward-facing conformation.</p><p>2. Based on our experience, we have observed that the conformations of ATP-bound (mutant) and vanadate-trapped states of an ABC transporter are structurally equivalent at this resolution level of our study (see ref. 21: Hoffmann et al. NATURE 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors propose a new model for substrate translocation. It is based on three mutants and a number of structures. If the authors were not challenging the current dogma I would not have written the next comment. Considering the impact of the findings, I would have designed a couple more cysteine mutants based on their model. For instance, this pathway has a number of stabilizing interactions, can't they make a mutant that preserves conformational switching but eliminates substrate translocation? I like the G97A mutant result but I am worried that the effect could just be a general destabilization or misfolding as part of the cryoEM particles seem to suggest. The authors advance one interpretation of the disorder observed in this mutant but it could easily be my interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>Our response: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to design additional mutants to further validate our proposed model for substrate translocation. We agree that this would be highly valuable, considering the potential impact of our findings. However, given the time-intensive nature of our approach, we believe that presenting these additional designs in a future study is a reasonable course of action.</p><p>Regarding the G72A mutation, we believe that our current data fully supports our model and the role of TM1 in regulating the Pgp activity. Importantly, we would like to emphasize that the G72A mutant was readily expressed and purifiable as a stable protein. Additionally, our cryoEM structural determination of the G72A mutant at high resolution confirmed that the protein is not generally destabilized but properly folded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are a couple of troubling methodological questions that I want the authors to address or clarify:</p><p>1. In the methods they report that the final sample for cryoEM was prepared on a SEC devoid of detergent. It is obvious that the sample was folded but I was wondering why the detergent was removed? Was that critical for observing these structures with multiple ligands? Did they observe any lipids in their cryoEM?</p></disp-quote><p>Our response: We avoid detergent in the buffer on final SEC purification. This step is to remove free detergent from the background which helps during cryoEM imaging. Of course, this cannot be done with every detergent but due to the very low CMC of LMNG it is possible. By now, we have verified this method for several other transporters with the same success. While this procedure helps us to obtain better images it is not necessary to obtain specific conformations or ligand bound states, nor does it affect these states or conformations.</p><p>In our cryoEM structures , we did observe multiple cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHS) molecules on the outer transmembrane surface of Pgp.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Can the authors comment on why labeling was carried out in the presence of ATP? Does it matter if the substrate was added prior to ATP and incubated for a few minutes?</p></disp-quote><p>Our response: For every dataset, we first added the substrate to be cross-linked and afterwards added the ATP. In the cases of 335C and 978C, labeling was successful before ATP was added, as evidenced by the inward-facing structures with cross-linked substrate. However, for 971C, cross-linking only occurred after the addition of ATP. We interpret this data to suggest that the 971 site is inaccessible to the substrate in the inward-facing state, and cross-linking can only occur after the transporter transitions to outward-facing state. This is in line with our inward-facing structure which does not show a cross-linked substrate, and our biochemical data shown in Fig 1C, where 971C only crosslinked in the presence of ATP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. I am not an expert on MD simulations and I understand that carrying out simulations at higher temperatures used to be a trick to accelerate the process. Is this still necessary? Why didn't the author use approaches such as WESTPA?</p></disp-quote><p>Our response: Most so-called enhanced sampling methods, including WESTPA, explicitly define a reaction coordinate for the process of interest, usually based on intuition or prior studies. If this coordinate is chosen poorly, enhanced sampling usually fails, either because the sampling becomes inefficient or because the sampling biases the transition pathway (or both). Lacking reliable intuition or prior knowledge on which motions would result in substrate release, we chose temperature to speed up the process. High temperature largely avoids the introduction of an any bias through the definition of a progress coordinate. By contrast, the weighted ensemble method underlying WESTPA is a great method to simulate unbiased dynamics of a process with a known progress coordinate, but unfortunately requires to choose a progress coordinate prior to the simulation and will then mostly sample the process along this progress coordinate, because this is the only direction in which sampling is improved. High temperature MD on the other hand accelerates all processes in the system under study. Indeed, we have now confirmed that the pathway found at high temperature is also feasible at near-ambient conditions.</p><p>In new simulations, we have now observed a similar release pathway at T=330 K. As the only difference, the substrate has not fully dissociated from the protein after 2.5 us, with weak interactions persisting at the top part of TM1 from the extracellular side. Importantly, this is a configuration observed also in higher temperature simulations but with much shorter lifetime.</p><p>In response, we now included these new findings and a new Extended Data Fig. 15 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. One way to show that the two substrates binding mode is biochemically relevant is to measure Vmax at different substrate concentrations. One would expect a cooperative transition if that interaction is mechanistically important.</p><p><bold>Reviewer 3 (Public Review):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 3 for recommending the acceptance of our manuscript as is.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p><p>Page 4, last line: Pgp302 should be Pgp1302.
