While they share the capacity of immune suppression, their stabilities are different, with iTregs losing their phenotype upon stimulation or under inflammatory milieu. Epigenetic differences, particularly methylation state of <italic>Foxp3</italic> CNS2 region, provide an explanation for this shift. Whether additional regulations, including cellular signaling, could directly lead phenotypical instability requires further analysis. Here, we show that upon TCR (T cell receptor) triggering, SOCE (store-operated calcium entry) and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) nuclear translocation are blunted in tTregs, yet fully operational in iTregs, similar to Tconvs. On the other hand, tTregs show minimal changes in their chromatin accessibility upon activation, in contrast to iTregs that demonstrate an activated chromatin state with highly accessible T cell activation and inflammation related genes. Assisted by several cofactors, NFAT driven by strong SOCE signaling in iTregs preferentially binds to primed-opened T helper (T<sub>H</sub>) genes, resulting in their activation normally observed only in Tconv activation, ultimately leads to instability. Conversely, suppression of SOCE in iTregs can partially rescue their phenotype. Thus, our study adds two new layers, cellular signaling and chromatin accessibility, of understanding in Treg stability, and may provide a path for better clinical applications of Treg cell therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Treg</kwd><kwd>stability</kwd><kwd>calcium signal</kwd><kwd>NFAT</kwd><kwd>chromatin accessibility</kwd><kwd>iTreg</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31370878</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31630023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81621002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-166155</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-156334</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN/03748-2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multidimensional study of signaling pathways and epigenomics investigates how TCR (T cell receptor) signaling and chromatin landscape interpaly and impact on Treg stability.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key to maintain peripheral immune tolerance and to block excessive inflammatory reactions. There are two main populations of Tregs. The prototypical one originates from the thymus (tTreg), sharing a developmental program similar to conventional T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rudensky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sakaguchi et al., 2008</xref>). Their TCRs are believed to have higher basal affinity to MHC (major histocompatibility antigen), and express Foxp3 during CD4 single positive period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fontenot et al., 2005</xref>). The other population originates from the periphery (pTregs) via conversion of Tconvs, arising during inflammation with proper antigenic stimulation and inductive cytokine environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curotto de Lafaille et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apostolou and von Boehmer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cobbold et al., 2004</xref>). iTregs, mimicking the induction of pTregs, is a type of Tregs induced in vitro in the presence of TGF-β (tumor growth factor ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fantini et al., 2004</xref>). While iTregs share similarity in suppressive capacities to Tregs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shevach and Thornton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Singh et al., 2009</xref>), they are different from tTregs in several aspects, particularly regarding their stabilities. Although tTregs in some occasions show certain levels of plasticity, their phenotypes are mostly stable, both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rubtsov et al., 2010</xref>). iTregs induced in vitro are more labile with marked loss of Foxp3 expression after activation, limiting the duration of their suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Floess et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). The short life of iTregs is also a roadblocker of the clinical use of Treg cell therapy, as they cannot be used as an alternative source to replace numerically limited tTregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koenecke et al., 2009</xref>); and in cases where iTregs are raised with targeted specificities, they carry concerns of potential self-reactivity following the loss of Foxp3.</p><p>The stability of tTregs is established prior to their exit from the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ohkura et al., 2013</xref>). In the thymus, Foxp3 works with other transcription factors, such as NFAT and c-Rel to maintain a steady transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hill et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Samstein et al., 2012</xref>). At the same time, the extensive demethylation of <italic>Foxp3</italic> CNS2 is also critical to their stable phenotype, an event likely taking place before Foxp3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Samstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohkura et al., 2012</xref>). While epigenetic differences provide a possible explanation of Treg stability, it is more probable that multiple factors collectively contribute to the difference. Unlike Tconvs that undergo expansion, attrition, and memory states after activation, tTregs lose signature changes and return to their original state following activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van der Veeken et al., 2016</xref>). This persistence in phenotype of tTregs is certainly beneficial to the host, yet mechanisms for this maintenance, in contrast to the lack thereof in iTregs are incompletely understood. Previous work suggests that TCR signal as well as ensuing Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities are weaker in tTregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sumpter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vaeth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yan et al., 2015</xref>), whether the reduced TCR signaling strength is the root of tTreg stability remains an intrigue, particularly strong TCR engagement facilitates iTregs’ loss of phenotype.</p><p>Here, we report a surprising finding that may contribute to the iTregs’ phenotypical change after their activation. We found that ligation of TCR induces long vibration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in Tconvs that lasts for hours, as typically expected in the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) activation. Initially similar, this vibration is quickly diminished in tTregs, correlating with their reduced response to TCR stimulation. In contrast, in iTregs, this Ca<sup>2+</sup> vibration is indistinguishable from Tconvs. The sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal leads to a strong NFAT activation in iTregs. Regarding chromatin accessibility, with the aid of our initial observation of iTregs from the perspective of activated Tconv, we found iTregs also show an ‘activated’ chromatin state with T cell activation and inflammation related genes highly open. We demonstrate that the NFAT nuclear translocation driven by sustained calcium signal allows its direct access to prime-opened T<sub>H</sub> genes and upregulate their expression, destabilizing iTregs. As expected, blocking CRAC channel reverses the loss of Foxp3 in iTregs in vitro and in vivo. Our work therefore suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and accessible chromatin state in iTregs are two key causes in their loss of stability following activation, which may be of important value to understand how these two populations of Tregs operate in the disease conditions and lead to better applications of iTregs in the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>iTregs use a suppression mechanism similar to that of tTregs</title><p>In our previous work, we found that Tregs show strong binding to DCs, which is a key mechanism for blocking DC’s ability to engage other Tconvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). The strong binding is due to low basal calcium oscillation of tTregs in the steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), which leads to diminished mCalpain activation and commensurate reduced internalization of LFA-1. Furthermore, our previous study showed the low calcium oscillation is maintained by reduced expression of endosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Ryr2 by Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). To ascertain that this regulation is also central to iTregs, we produced iTregs from Tconvs. With plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 and in the presence of TGF-β, iTregs were induced and the percentage was maximized on day 2. We found that in vitro iTregs show stronger suppression than tTregs on OT-II proliferation in response to epitope peptide loaded DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In accordance with the stronger suppression, single-cell force spectroscopy analysis showed that iTregs possessed apparent binding to DCs, even stronger than tTregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, iTregs also showed increased binding force compared with activated Tconvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting the strong binding force is a common feature of both types of Tregs, but not Tconvs. We measured the expression of Foxp3 more precisely, and noticed that the protein-level expression of Foxp3 reached its peak on day 2 after the induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). With the accumulation of Foxp3 protein, basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation in the treated Tconvs was gradually diminished, with the former leading the latter roughly by 1 day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As expected, the transcription level of Ryr2 was suppressed both in iTregs and tTregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that the strong binding force with DC may come from reduced calcium oscillation as a result of Foxp3-mediated suppression of Ryr2 transcription. While Ryr2 expression may be regulated by Foxp3, the induction efficiency of Foxp3 was not affected by Ryr2 knock out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, we show iTregs can apply a suppression mechanism similar to tTregs, which operates via the indirect inhibition via DC blockage. We do not know why iTregs show a stronger suppression than tTregs, an event maybe related to their activation in the induction process.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>iTreg share similar suppressive mechanism to tTregs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of suppressive activity between tTreg and iTreg.

To study the molecular basis for the weak response in tTregs, we first monitored the early SOCE intensity in iTregs and tTregs, we found the first wave of SOCE in iTregs was slightly higher than Tconvs and tTregs, but there was no discernable difference between tTregs and Tconvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, the phosphorylation of CD3ζ was similar in Tconv and nTreg immediately after TCR crosslink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As full T cell activation requires sustained SOCE activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dolmetsch et al., 1998</xref>), we extended the observation time window. As SOCE signal is synchronized upon initial TCR trigger, each individual T cell SOCE oscillation hours into activation is no longer in unison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Borgne et al., 2016</xref>), we therefore recorded Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in individual cells.

Indeed, in contrast to iTregs and Tconvs, tTregs’ NFATc1 and c2 failed to translocate into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Upon detailed analysis, in iTregs, anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation led a quick drop in cytoplasmic NFAT in 2 hr, with moderate accumulation of NFAT in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This was followed by continuous synthesis of NFAT in the cytoplasm and accumulation of nuclear NFAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Serfling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2002</xref>). While tTregs are known to have reduced NFAT activation in response to TCR ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sumpter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nayak et al., 2009</xref>), our results pointed to a truncated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response likely to be the molecular basis for this phenotype. With this association potentially established, we wondered if the length of SOCE itself is sufficient to explain the stability difference between iTregs and tTregs. Non-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> membrane permeability modifier such as ionomycin resulted in large-scale cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), we therefore used SERCA inhibitor Thapsigargin (TG). Blocking SERCA leads to endosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> reloading blockage that leads to continuous translocation of STIMs to the plasma membrane–ER junction and Orai channel opening. In contrast to indiscriminating Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, pure SOCE activation was not followed by significant cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). As expected, some tTregs treated with TG lost their Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

In the PCA plot, tTregs showed fewer changes after activation compared to Tconvs, while iTregs were closer to activated Tconv cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In differential peak heatmap clustered by cell type, Tconvs became more accessible in ‘Activation Region’ after activation, and with a dramatic increase in the overall accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, the changes of tTregs after activation are limited, the majority of tTreg-specific accessible region, named ‘Treg Region’, were not changed. Also the activation region opening seen in Tconvs were not more accessible in tTregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). All of these characteristics indicated that tTreg phenotype is highly ensured by their low TCR responsiveness which potentially led to their refusal to change chromatin accessibility seen in Tconvs following activation.</p><p>When comparing iTregs with the others, we found iTregs were highly accessible in activation region found in activated Tconvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). However, only a few Treg-specific peaks shown in Treg region were opened in iTregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, E</xref>). For further analysis, we isolated Treg-specific peaks. It was clear that most of them were opened in tTregs but showed little accessibility in iTregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). For example, <italic>Foxp3</italic> and <italic>Ctla4</italic>, expressed in both tTregs and iTregs, show high accessibility in resting and activated tTregs, but were closed or only partially opened in iTregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

Additionally, genes related to inflammation cytokine and function such as <italic>Il12rb2</italic>, <italic>Il9</italic>, and <italic>Gzmc</italic> are included. These genes display elevated accessibility upon T cell activation, partially open in activated tTreg cells. However, all of them exhibit high accessibility in iTreg cells.</p><p>Overall, we showed that at the gene expression level, iTregs have acquired some Treg features, but the chromatin accessibility was mostly trapped in activated Tconv state, not only with regard to the closed Treg genes, but also with genes associated with T activation and inflammation highly opened. The latter is expected to be mainly closed in genuine Tregs in accordance with their lower responsiveness to TCR triggering. We speculate that this ‘unconverted’ chromatin accessibility, especially the highly opened activated genes will contribute to iTreg instability upon TCR stimulation. It is therefore interesting whether NFAT accumulated in nuclei driven by sustained calcium oscillation will indeed target those genes for an activation state unfit for their phenotypical stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SOCE and NFAT directly leads to phenotypical instability in iTregs</title><p>To further validate the role of calcium and NFAT in iTreg instability, we used inhibitors cyclosporine A (CsA) and CM-4620 to suppress calcium signal and NFAT, respectively.

Another SOCE inhibitor BTP2 was also verified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Thus, NFAT and calcium signaling blockage were correlated to iTreg stability. As control, inhibition of NF-κB (BAY 11-7082), c-Jun (SP600125), or a c-Jun/c-Fos complex (T5224) had no discernable effect, or in one case, possibly further reduction in stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

From the differential gene expression and PCA, we found that iTregs upon restimulation showed significant differences from the resting state at the transcriptome level, and this difference could be substantially reduced with inhibition of calcium or NFAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As shown in the PCA plot, calcium/NFAT-blocked iTregs were significantly closer to the resting state than the unstable ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, inhibition of calcium or NFAT can significantly improve the stability of iTregs as reflected by transcriptomic identity. In addition, the large overlap (about 80%) of genes that were rescued by CM-4620 and by CsA further supported that calcium signaling change the fate of iTregs mainly through NFAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Among the genes rescued by CM-4620 and CsA, they can be further divided into two groups. Members of the first group were downregulated upon restimulation and the downregulation was blocked by inhibition of calcium and NFAT. This result indicating that these genes are downregulated by NFAT. Among these genes, several of them are critical for functions and stability of Tregs, such as <italic>Foxp3</italic>, <italic>Id3</italic>, <italic>Il10rb</italic>, <italic>Sema4a</italic>, <italic>Tgfbr1/2</italic>, <italic>Ms4a4b</italic>, and <italic>Nlrp6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In the functional analysis of these genes, we found that Rap-1 pathway, PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and Foxo pathway were significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Loss of these genes was therefore consistent with the phenotype of iTreg instability.</p><p>The other group had genes that were otherwise upregulated after restimulation, but failed to do so with CM-4620 or CsA, indicating that these genes are upregulated by NFAT.

Therefore, we first checked the chromatin accessibility around the TSS in those genes and found that this group of genes was significantly more accessible in iTregs than in tTregs and Tconvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As shown in the genome browser view, <italic>Il21</italic>, <italic>Il12rb2</italic>, and <italic>Tbx21</italic> were more open in iTregs, even more so than the activated Tconvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Further analysis revealed that NFAT significantly increased their binding to the TSS regions on upregulated Th genes after restimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), while showing little change on downregulated Treg genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As shown by <italic>Il21</italic>, <italic>Tbx21</italic>, and <italic>Il12rb2</italic>, after activation, NFAT accumulated at the sites that were prime-opened resulting in their increased expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Therefore, the enhanced chromatin accessibility revealed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> was indeed approached by the large amount of NFAT, leading to T cell polarization toward other directions with a sole reciprocal loss of polarization toward Tregs. This tendency may to some extent explain the rapid loss of iTreg phenotype.</p><p>As one potential counter argument, NFAT is ostensibly essential to the development of tTregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). In the induction of iTregs, NFAT in collaboration with SMAD is also critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vaeth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tone et al., 2008</xref>). It is therefore intriguing why NFAT re-activation after iTreg formation may serve as a key factor in compromising iTreg stability. To resolve those seemingly contradictory regulations, we performed NFAT motif enrichment analysis. The results showed that putative BATF, AP-1(Fos/Jun), and RORg-binding sites were highly enriched in restimulation state specific regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). For the preference of different cofactors to different gene subsets, SMAD family tended to bind to genes that were downregulated by NFAT, for example, Foxp3, while AP-1 and RORg preferred binding to genes that were upregulated by NFAT, such as T<sub>H</sub> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Taken together, our results appear to suggest that upon restimulation of iTregs, NFAT prefers to cooperate with AP-1/RORg to promote the expression of prime-opened T<sub>H</sub> gene expression, and at the same time denies the SMAD programming that may be critical to maintain Treg functions and stabilities. Certainly, how much this selective cooperation between NFAT and other transcriptional factors contributes to iTreg instability remains speculative until large-scale ChIP-seq analyses are performed on the players involved.</p><p>According to the Cut&amp;Tag data, the secretion levels of IL-21 in tTreg and iTreg were also examined by ELISA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, tTreg did not secrete IL-21 regardless of activation status (undetectable), while iTreg did not secrete IL-21 at resting state but they did so after 48 hr of restimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). The secretion of IL-21 was inhibited by CsA and CM-4620 treatment. This observation aligns with our findings where nuclear binding of NFAT to gene loci of these cytokines enhanced their expression, pushing iTreg unstable under inflammatory conditions. These findings further underscore the likelihood that the inhibition of calcium and NFAT signaling might contribute to the stabilization of iTreg by suppressing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Reduction of SOCE enhances iTreg stability and suppressive potential</title><p>Given that sustained calcium signal and NFAT translocation can directly disrupt iTreg stability, we asked whether manipulation of calcium signaling or NFAT can conversely be used to stabilize those cells. As Treg suppression assays require the participation of other T cells which are sensitive to inhibitory agents added indiscriminately, after regular iTreg induction, we overexpressed a dominant negative ORAI (DN-ORAI), whose single monomer incorporation will lead to a functionally disabled ORAI hexamer, to control the SOCE signal upon iTreg restimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mignen et al., 2008</xref>).

Beyond the basal regimens of anti-CD3, anti-CD28, IL-2, and TGF-β, several additional factors have been reported to enhance the stability of iTregs, including the use of retinoic acid, rapamycin, vitamin C, and AS2863619 as well as removal of CD28 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akamatsu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mikami et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). We observed if those new additions in some ways altered the state of TSDR as well as the the openness of activation region. Our findings revealed that rapamycin and AS tended to close the activation region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), while Vc, removal of CD28, and AS increased the accessibility of Treg genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results indicate that different treatments have varied impacts on the activation region and Treg region. Hence, the selective and combinatorial use of those factors is an interesting proposal in the generation of more stable iTregs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>tTregs are different from other subsets of CD4 T cells in the thymic determination of their phenotype. To some extent, this centric determination is closer to CD4/CD8 demarcation, rather than other polarizations in the peripheral environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rudensky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sakaguchi et al., 2008</xref>). The stable phenotype, even after activation, is critical to provide the baseline immune suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rubtsov et al., 2010</xref>). pTregs/iTregs are driven by the environment. It is logical that those cells should be deprived of their suppressive ability when are no longer needed to avoid unnecessary accumulation of those cells. The current understanding is that during thymic development, <italic>Foxp3</italic> CNS2 region is selectively demethylated, allowing several transcriptional factors, such as Ets1 and Foxp3 itself to binding to this location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Samstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohkura et al., 2012</xref>). This is one of several epigenetic features that maintain the stability, and TCR signaling in tTregs does not change the pre-established hypomethylation state. Induced Tregs, on the other hand, use a different program that relies on the binding of SMADs to the CNS1 region to initiate <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tone et al., 2008</xref>). This SMAD binding mediated transcription is dependent on <italic>Foxp3</italic> H3K4me3 modification. In the absence of SMAD, H3K4me3 is partially lost, resulting in iTreg phenotypical shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tone et al., 2008</xref>). Withstanding this paradigm, iTregs do not immediately lose Foxp3 expression upon TGF-β withdrawal, the loss of Foxp3 is evident hours or days after TCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Selvaraj and Geiger, 2007</xref>). This indicates that while the epigenetic alterations are necessary, an activation event is required to drive the loss of phenotype. This notion is subtly echoed by the limited TCR signaling in tTregs, implying that the hyporesponsiveness to TCR ligation may be a critical feature to maintain their stability.</p><p>We observed differences between tTregs and iTregs in calcium signal and Th gene accessibility. tTregs utilize both truncated calcium signal and conserved chromatin accessibility to systematically reduce their TCR responsiveness, ensuring their stability. In contrast, iTregs retain the full strength of the TCR signaling, particularly the sustained vibration of SOCE signal, the key factor that drives NFAT synthesis and nuclear translocation. With the help of several cofactors, such as AP-1, NFAT caused the high expression of these T<sub>H</sub> genes, which subsequently subverts the original differentiation of iTregs, leading to their instability. Direct inhibition of SOCE signaling and NFAT can enhance iTreg stability in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Previous observations also showed that the calcium signal in tTreg is weaker than that in Tconvs, and NFAT activity is suppressed in tTregs. The weaker Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in previous reports was seen as early as 10 min into activation, this contradiction likely reflects the experimental settings and stimulation strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, in line with our results, inhibition of NFAT by low-dose CsA increased the number of tTreg in atopic dermatitis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandt et al., 2009</xref>). It seems reasonable to establish an inverse association between SOCE signal and Treg stability. In our analysis of the RNA-seq and chromatin accessibility data, we did not identify any particular mechanism that may account for the distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal patterns in tTregs and iTregs. However, in contrast to Tconvs and iTregs, there must be a negative signal loop that blunts SOCE vibration in tTregs. We tried to sustain the calcium signaling in tTregs forcibly by thapsigargin, and indeed observed loss of Foxp3. However, as we at the moment cannot appreciate the finesse of this regulation, the underlying molecular details will require much more delicate approaches rather the brutal force of ER store depletion. In our view, future investigation in this direction may lead to better understanding of Treg biology as well as innovations in clinical Treg cell therapy.</p><p>Our results are consistent with the understanding that Treg-specific hypomethylation is crucial for tTregs to stably express their Treg-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Samstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohkura et al., 2012</xref>). Those epigenetic changes are mostly absent in iTregs, resulting in their instability. The differences of accessibility in Treg genes were also observed in our ATAC-seq data. Therefore, current treatments such as vitamin C and CD28 blockage applied to achieve demethylation and accessibility of Treg genes in iTregs are worthy attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mikami et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yue et al., 2016</xref>). However, our work indicates that at least in ATAC-seq analyses, there are a cluster of activation and differentiation-related peaks present in iTregs that remain silent in tTregs upon TCR stimulation. Critically, these peaks were targeted by abundant NFAT in the iTreg nuclei following activation, leading to the upregulation of Th genes. This tendency of deviation away from Tregs may be another key player to iTreg instability. Our effort to produce highly stable iTregs would likely require a combined approach to demethylate Treg-specific genes and at the same time to block the activation and differentiation-related genes. In our work, targeting NFAT signaling during the restimulation phase appeared to be a potential method. Other ways that can directly close these genes will also likely be beneficial.</p><p>In this work, we stress the importance of NFAT signal in the instability of iTregs. Previous research has also unveiled the adverse effects of other TCR signaling pathways on Treg stability, such as NF-κB and mTOR. As all those factors may contribute to the shift in phenotype, it is out of scope of this report to directly compare all those factors. However, the value of this report is the identification of a key difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling under TCR ligation that may explain the stability differences between iTregs and tTregs, which may open the door for additional regulations given the key role of SOCE activity in T cell activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice were in CD45.2 C57BL/6 background unless noted otherwise.

The authors revealed that, unlike thymus-derived Tregs (tTreg) with blunted calcium signaling and NFAT activation, iTregs respond to TCR restimulation with fully activated SOCE and NFAT similar to activated conventional T cells. Activated NFAT binds to open chromatin regions in genes related to T helper cells, increases their expression, and leads to the instability of iTreg cells. On the other hand, inhibition of the SOCE/NFAT pathway by chemical inhibitors could partially rescue the loss of Foxp3 expression in iTreg upon restimulation. The conclusion of the study is unexpected since previous studies showed that NFAT is required for Foxp3 induction and iTreg differentiation (Tone Y et al, Nat Immunol. 2008, PMID: 18157133; Vaeth M et al, PNAS, 2012, PMID: 22991461). Additionally, Foxp3 interacts with NFAT to control Treg function (Wu Y et al, Cell, 2006, PMID: 16873067). The data presented in this study demonstrated the complex role NFAT plays in the generation and stability of iTreg cells.</p><p>Several concerns are raised from the current study.</p><p>1. Previous studies showed that iTregs generated in vitro from culturing naïve T cells with TGF-b are intrinsically unstable, and prone to losing Foxp3 expression due to lack of DNA demethylation in the enhancer region of the Foxp3 locus (Polansky JK et al, Eur J Immunol., 2008, PMID: 18493985). It is known that removing TGF-b from the culture media leads to rapid loss of Foxp3 expression. In the current study, TGF-b was not added to the media during iTreg restimulation, therefore, the primary cause for iTreg instability should be the lack of the positive signal provided by TGF-b. NFAT signal is secondary at best in this culturing condition.</p><p>This point has been addressed in the revision. Figure Q1 could be added to the manuscript as a supplementary figure.</p><p>2. It is not clear whether the NFAT pathway is unique in accelerating the loss of Foxp3 expression upon iTreg restimulation. It is also possible that enhancing T cell activation in general could promote iTreg instability. The authors could explore blocking T cell activation by inhibiting other critical pathways, such as NF-kb and c-Jun/c-Fos, to see if a similar effect could be achieved compared to CsA treatment.</p><p>This point has been sufficiently addressed in the revision.</p><p>3. The authors linked chromatin accessibility and increased expression of T helper cell genes to the loss of Foxp3 expression and iTreg instability. However, it is not clear how the former can lead to the latter. It is also not clear whether NFAT binds directly to the Foxp3 locus in the restimulated iTregs and inhibits Foxp3 expression.</p><p>This point has been addressed in the rebuttal. Could the authors incorporate their comments in the rebuttal into the discussion section of the revised manuscript?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88874.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The phenotypic instability of in vitro-induced Treg cells (iTregs) has been discussed for a long time, mainly in the context of the epigenetic landscape of Treg-signature genes; e.g. Treg-specifically CpG-hypomethylated Foxp3 CNS2 enhancer region.

The authors focused on the difference between iTreg and nTreg cells from the perspective of their control of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE)-mediated cellular signaling, and they clearly showed that the sustained SOCE signaling in iTreg and nTreg cells led to phenotypic instability. Moreover, the authors pointed out the correlation between the incomplete conversion of chromatin configuration and the NFAT-mediated control of effector-type gene expression profile in iTreg cells. These findings potentially cultivate our understanding of the cellular identity of regulatory T cells and may shed light on the therapeutic use of Treg cells in many clinical contexts.</p><p>The authors demonstrated the biological contribution of Ca2+ signaling with the variable methods, which ensure the reliability of the results and the claims of the authors. iTreg cells sustained SOCE-signaling upon stimulation while natural Treg cells had lower strength and shorter duration of SOCE-signaling.

Further investigation is needed to understand how these genes contribute to Foxp3 gene instability exactly. With our limited insight, there may be two possibilities. 1. IL-21 directly affects Foxp3 through its impact on certain inflammation-related transcription factors (TFs). 2. There could be an indirect relationship where NFAT has a greater tendency to bind to those inflammatory TFs when iTreg instability appears, promoting the upregulation of these Th genes like in activated T cells, while being less likely to bind to SMAD and Foxp3, representing a competitive behavior. We at the moment cannot comprehend the intricacies that lead to the differential effects on T helper genes and Treg related genes.</p><p>With that said, we have previously attempted to explore the direct effect of NFAT on Foxp3 gene locus. Foxp3 transcription in iTregs primarily relies on histone modifications such as H3K4me3 (Tone et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2011) rather than DNA demethylation (Ohkura et al., 2012; Hilbrands et al., 2016). Previous studies have reported that NFAT and SMAD3 can together promote the histone acetylation of Foxp3 genes (Tone et al., 2008). In our previous set of experiments, we simultaneously obtained information of NFAT binding sites and H3K4me3. In Foxp3 locus, we observed a decreasing trend in NFAT binding to the CNS3 region of Foxp3 in restimulated iTregs compared to resting iTregs (Author response image 3). Additionally, the H3K4me3 modification in the CNS3 region of Foxp3 decreased upon iTreg restimulation, but inhibiting NFAT nuclear translocation with CsA could maintain this modification at its original level (Author response image 3).</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>The NFAT binding and histone modification on Foxp3 gene locus.</title><p>Genome track visualization of NFAT binding profiles and H3K4me3 profiles in Foxp3 CNS3 locus in two batches of dataset.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88874-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Based on these preliminary explorations, it is concluded that NFAT can directly bind to the Foxp3 locus, and it appears that NFAT decreases upon restimulation, resulting in a decrease in H3K4me3, ultimately leading to the close association of NFAT and Foxp3 instability. However, due to limited sample replicates, these data need to be verified for more solid conclusions. We speculate that during the induction of iTregs, NFAT may recruit histone-modifying enzymes to open the Foxp3 CNS3 region, and this effect is synergistic with SMAD. When instability occurs upon restimulation, NFAT binding to Foxp3 weakens due to the absence of SMAD's assistance, subsequently reducing the recruitment of histone modifications enzyme and ultimately inhibiting Foxp3 transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) Some concerns about data processing and statistic analysis.</p><p>The authors did not provide sufficient information on statistical data analysis; e.g. lack of detailed descriptions about</p><p>-the precise numbers of technical/biological replicates of each experiment</p><p>-the method of how the authors analyze data of multiple comparisons...

I wonder whether human PBMC-derived iTreg cells are similarly regulated.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a rather complicated issue, human T cells express FoxP3 upon TCR stimulation (PNAS, 103(17): 6659–6664), whose function is likely to protect T cells from activation induced cell death, and does not offer Treg like properties. In contrast in mice, FoxP3 can be used as an indicator of Treg. Currently, this is not a definitive marker for Treg in human, our FoxP3 based readouts do not apply. Nevertheless, we have now investigated whether inhibiting calcium signaling or NFAT could enhance the stability of human iTreg. As shown in Author response image 4, we found that the proportion of Foxp3-expressing cells did not show significant changes across the different conditions, while the MFI analysis revealed that CsA-treated iTreg exhibited higher Foxp3 expression levels compared to both restimulated iTreg and rest iTreg. However, CM4620 had no significant effect on Foxp3 stability, consistent with the observation of its limited efficacy in suppressing human iTreg long term activation. In summary, our results suggest that inhibiting NFAT signaling through CsA treatment can help maintain higher levels of Foxp3 expression in human iTreg.</p><fig id="sa3fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Effect of inhibiting NFAT and calcium on human iTreg stability.</title><p>Human naïve CD4 cells from PBMC were subjected to a two-week induction process to generate human iTreg.

Because iTreg cells, after induction, already exhibit inherent chromatin instability, with highly-open inflammatory genes. Furthermore, when iTreg cells were restimulated, the subsequent change in chromatin accessibility was relatively limited and not rescued by NFAT inhibitor treatment (Author response image 5). Therefore, in the case of iTreg cells, we propose that NFAT exploits the easy access of those inflammatory genes, leading to rapid destabilization of iTreg cells in the short term.</p><p>In contrast, tTreg cells possess a relatively stable chromatin structure in the beginning, it would be interesting to investigate whether NFAT or calcium signaling could disrupt chromatin accessibility during the activation or expansion of tTreg cells. It is possible that NFAT might cause the loss of the originally established demethylation map and open up inflammatory loci, thereby inducing a shift in gene transcriptional profiles, equally leading to instability.</p><fig id="sa3fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Chromatin accessibility of Rest, Retimulated, CsA/ORAIinh treated restimulated iTreg.</title><p>PCA visualization of chromatin accessibility profiles of different cell types.

At this point, the stabilized iTregs can be used to measure the influence of SOCE/NFAT on iTreg instability.</p></disp-quote><p>In the study conducted by Polansky, it was observed in Figure 1 that prolonged exposure to TGF-β fails to induce stable Foxp3 expression and demethylation of the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR). Based on this finding, we could consider exploring alternative approaches to obtain a more stabilized iTreg population. One such approach could be isolating Foxp3+helios-Nrp1- iTreg cells directly from the peripheral in vivo, which are also known as pTregs. Generally, pTreg cells generated in vivo tend to be more stable compared to iTreg cells induced in vitro, and they already exhibit partial demethylation of the Treg signature, as shown in Fig 6C (Polansky JK et al, Eur J Immunol., 2008, PMID: 18493985). Investigating the role of NFAT and calcium signaling in pTreg cells would provide further insights into the additional roles of NFAT in Treg phenotypical transitions, particularly its role in chromatin accessibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3, NFAT binding to the inflammatory genes in iTreg cells was even stronger than in activated T conventional cells. This is possibly due to Tconv cells being stimulated only once while iTregs were restimulated. A fair comparison should be conducted with restimulated activated conventional T cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3 demonstrates the accessibility of inflammatory gene loci, rather than NFAT binding. Comparing restimulated Tconvs with restimulated iTreg cells is indeed a valuable suggestion, as their activation state and polarization in iTreg directions could lead to distinct chromatin accessibility. Although one is activated long term regularly and the other is activated long term under iTreg polarization, it is highly likely that the chromatin state of both activated Tconvs and iTreg cells is highly open, especially in terms of the accessibility of inflammatory genes. This may provide us with a new perspective to understand iTreg cells, but will unlikely affect our central conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the in vivo experiment in Figure 6, a control condition without OVA immunization should be included as a baseline.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed this experiment in the absence of OVA, as depicted in Author response image 6.

The cell death induced by CsA and CM-4620 is not consistent, indicating that there may not be a direct proportional relationship between cell death and the expression of Foxp3 and Treg identity.</p><fig id="sa3fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 9.</label><caption><title>Relationship of cell death and Foxp3 stability in restimulated iTregs.</title><p>Sorted Foxp3-GFP+ iTregs were rested for 1d, then restimulated by anti-CD3 and CD28 in the presence of CsA or CM-4620.

As shown in Author response image 10, tTreg did not secrete IL-21 regardless of activation status (undetectable), while iTreg did not secrete IL-21 at resting state but exhibited IL-21 secretion after 48 h of activation. Moreover, the secretion of IL-21 was inhibited by CsA and CM-4620 treatment. This observation aligns with our earlier findings where we observed nuclear binding of NFAT to gene loci of these cytokines, enhancing their expression and pushing iTreg unstable under inflammatory conditions. These findings further underscore the likelihood that the inhibition of calcium and NFAT signaling might contribute to the stabilization of iTreg by suppressing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines.</p><fig id="sa3fig10" position="float"><label>Author response image 10.</label><caption><title>IL-21 secretion in tTreg and iTreg upon activation.</title><p>iTregs and tTregs were sorted and restimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, in the presence of CsA and CM-4620.

As a result, we expect significant differences in the nuclear localization and activity of NFAT between iTreg and tTreg cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 6C, what does the FCM plot between Foxp3-CFSE look like?</p><p>The authors can discuss the mechanism of ORAI-DN-mediated through such analysis; e.g. the possibility that selective proliferation defect by ORAI-DN in Foxp3- cells led to an increased percentage of Foxp3, not only just unstable transcription of Foxp3.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an in vitro experiment to assess the suppressive effect of iTreg on Tconv proliferation.

However, it is important to note that the Treg cells used in our study were isolated from the spleen of 2-4-month-old Foxp3-GFP or Foxp3-RFP mice. The CD4+ T cells were first enriched using the CD4 Isolation kit, and the FACSAriaII was utilized to collect CD4+ Foxp3-GFP/RFP+ Treg cells. Subsequently, Helios and Nrp-1 staining revealed that the majority of these cells were nTreg, with only approximately 6% being pTreg.

The reason for employing intracellular staining is that we used Foxp3-IRES-GFP mice, where GFP and Foxp3 are not fused into a single protein, existing as separate proteins after expression. Therefore, during induction, the appearance of GFP protein might potentially represent the presence of Foxp3. However, in cases of Foxp3 instability, the degradation of GFP protein may not be entirely synchronized with that of Foxp3 protein, making GFP an unreliable indicator of Foxp3 expression levels. As a result, for the purification of pure iTreg cells, we used Foxp3-GFP/RFP fluorescence, while for observing instability, we employed intranuclear staining of Foxp3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 6B, the captions were lacking in the two graphs on the right side</p></disp-quote><p>The two restimulation conditions, 0.125+0.25 and 0.25+0.5, have been added into Fig 6B right side.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure S2, the annotation of the x-y axis was missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lack of reference at line 292.</p></disp-quote><p>Reference 42-46 were added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the method section, the authors should note the further product information of antibodies and reagents to enhance reproducibility and transparency.
