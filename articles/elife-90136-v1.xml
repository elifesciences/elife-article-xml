evolutionarily conserved pathway for specifying binary neuronal fates, yet how it specifies different fates in different contexts remains elusive. In our accompanying paper, using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lamina neuron types (L1-L5) as a model, we show that the primary homeodomain transcription factor (HDTF) Bsh activates secondary HDTFs Ap (L4) and Pdm3 (L5) and specifies L4/L5 neuronal fates. Here we test the hypothesis that Notch signaling enables Bsh to differentially specify L4 and L5 fates. We show asymmetric Notch signaling between newborn L4 and L5 neurons, but they are not siblings; rather, Notch signaling in L4 is due to Delta expression in adjacent L1 neurons. While Notch signaling and Bsh expression are mutually independent, Notch is necessary and sufficient for Bsh to specify L4 fate over L5. The Notch<sup>ON</sup> L4, compared to Notch<sup>OFF</sup> L5, has a distinct open chromatin landscape which allows Bsh to bind distinct genomic loci, leading to L4-specific identity gene transcription. We propose a novel model in which Notch signaling is integrated with the primary HDTF activity to diversify neuron types by directly or indirectly generating a distinct open chromatin landscape that constrains the pool of genes that a primary HDTF can activate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>notch</kwd><kwd>homeodomain</kwd><kwd>neuronal fate</kwd><kwd>lamina</kwd><kwd>chromatin landscape</kwd><kwd>Bsh</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ideas Grant APP1185220</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>Owen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Notch signaling specifies binary neuronal fates through its integration with primary homeodomain activity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The extraordinary computational power of our brain depends on the vast diversity of neuron types characterized initially by transcription factor (TF) combinatorial codes, followed by neuron-type-specific functional attributes such as cell surface molecules, neurotransmitters, and ion channels. It has been well documented how initial neuronal diversity is generated: in both invertebrate and vertebrate, spatial and temporal factors act combinatorially in progenitors to generate diverse and molecularly distinct progeny, and asymmetric Notch signaling between two newborn sister neurons further diversifies neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bello-Rojas and Bagnall, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erclik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holguera and Desplan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pierfelice et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spana and Doe, 1996</xref>). Yet, it remains unclear how Notch signaling controls binary neuronal fate. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that controls many aspects of nervous system development, and the outcome of Notch signaling often depends on its context-dependent integration with other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bray, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006</xref>). While most progenitor spatial and temporal factors are not maintained in neurons, our companion paper shows that the primary HDTF Bsh (Brain-specific homeobox) is persistently expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> lamina neurons, allowing it to couple initial fate decision to subsequent circuit formation and expression of a spectrum of neuronal functional genes, such as neurotransmitters and ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). This leads to the hypothesis that Notch signaling integrates with the primary HDTF activity to diversify neuron types. To test this, we use the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lamina, the first ganglion in the optic lobe, to ask whether and how Notch signaling acts with the Bsh HDTF to diversify lamina neuron types.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> lamina has only five intrinsic neuron types (L1-L5), which are analogous to bipolar cells in the vertebrate visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</xref>). During late larval and early pupal stages, lamina progenitor cells (LPCs) give rise to L1-L5 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernandes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 1998</xref>). The cell bodies of each lamina neuron type are localized in a layer-specific manner. L2/L3 cell bodies are intermingled in the most distal layer while L1, L4, and L5 form distinct layers progressively more proximal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Each lamina neuron type expresses unique TF markers: L1, L2, and L3 neurons express Zfh1/Svp, Bab2, and Zfh1/Erm, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2023</xref>), while L4 and L5 neurons express the HDTFs Bsh/Ap and Bsh/Pdm3, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hasegawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Our accompanying paper shows that Bsh is initiated in LPCs and maintained in L4 and L5 neurons, while Ap and Pdm3 are initiated in L4 and L5 neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Based on their initiation order, we refer to Bsh as a ‘primary’ HDTF and Ap/Pdm3 as ‘secondary’ HDTFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Bsh activates Ap and Pdm3 and specifies L4 and L5 fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). However, it remains unknown how a single primary HDTF Bsh activates two different secondary HDTFs and specifies two distinct neuron types (L4 and L5). Could Notch signaling distinguish L4 and L5 fates?</p><p>Here, we elucidate the role of Notch and the primary HDTF Bsh in specifying L4 and L5 neuronal fates, resulting in the following findings. (1) Differential Notch signaling distinguishes L4 and L5 neurons. Unlike in the medulla, central brain, and ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mark et al., 2021</xref>), this is not due to an asymmetric partition of a Notch pathway component between sister neurons. Newborn L4 and L5 neurons are differentially exposed to the Notch ligand Delta expressed in L1, leading to asymmetric Notch activation in L4 but not L5. (2) Previously, the relationship between the primary HDTF Bsh and Notch signaling was unknown. Here, we show while Notch and Bsh expression are mutually independent, they act together to differentially specify L4 and L5 fates. (3) How Notch controls binary neuronal fates has remained elusive. We hypothesize that Notch signaling might regulate chromatin accessibility. Indeed, we find that compared to Notch<sup>OFF</sup> L5 neurons, Notch<sup>ON</sup> L4 neurons exhibit a distinct open chromatin landscape which shapes distinct Bsh genome-binding loci, resulting in L4-specific gene transcription. We propose that Notch signaling regulates the chromatin landscape in L4 neurons, leading to L4-distinct Bsh genomic binding and L4-specific Bsh-dependent gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Notch signaling is activated in newborn L4 neurons but not L5</title><p>Binding of a Notch ligand in one cell to Notch in an adjacent cell results in the translocation of the Notch intracellular domain (N-ICD) into the nucleus and the subsequent transcription of Notch target genes, including Hey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Monastirioti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To test whether L4 and L5 are Notch<sup>ON</sup>/Notch<sup>OFF</sup> siblings, we used twin-spot MARCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2009</xref>) to trace two sibling neurons, which are divided from a single LPC cell, as a GFP and RFP pair. If L4 and L5 neurons are siblings generated from an LPC asymmetric division, we predict L4 and L5 to be an invariant RFP and GFP pair. In contrast, we found the GFP and RFP pair are either both L4 neurons or both L5 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>). This rules out an obligate asymmetric division to produce L4/L5 siblings and suggests that differential Hey expression is due to differential contact with an extrinsic Notch ligand.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>L1 neurons express Delta and activate Notch signaling in adjacent L4 neurons</title><p>We tested the possibility that the asymmetric Notch signaling between L4 and L5 is due to an extrinsic exposure of L4 to Delta expression, one of the two Notch ligands in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muskavitch, 1994</xref>). We found that during lamina neurogenesis, Delta is specifically expressed in L1 neurons which are adjacent to L4 neurons but not L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Furthermore, we found that Delta is also expressed in the Tailless<sup>+</sup> (Tll<sup>+</sup>) LPCs in the same row as the L1 neurons, suggesting that LPCs may be more heterogeneous than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apitz and Salecker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). To test whether the L1-specific transcription factor Svp is required to activate or maintain Delta expression in L1, we knocked down Svp expression in the lamina. We found that Svp expression is indeed almost gone following Svp-knockdown (Svp-KD), yet Delta and Hey expression remains unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that Delta expression in L1 neurons might be inherited from Delta-expressing LPCs instead of being activated by Svp.

Indeed, Delta-KD shows the absence of Delta expression in the lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E’ and F’</xref>). Importantly, reduced Delta expression abolished Hey expression in the newborn L4, showing that Delta expression in L1 neurons is required for activating Notch in L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F”</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that Delta expressed in L1 neurons activates Notch signaling in L4 but not L5 neurons, making the Delta-Notch pathway a strong candidate for acting together with Bsh activity to differentially specify L4 and L5 fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Bsh without Notch signaling activates Pdm3 and specifies L5 neuronal fate</title><p>To test whether the asymmetric Notch signaling between newborn L4 and L5 enables Bsh to differentially specify distinct L4 and L5 fates, we first performed Notch loss of function in the lamina using 27G05-Gal4 and UAS-Notch-RNAi. We found that this genotype caused embryonic lethality, so to preserve Notch function during early development, we performed conditional Notch-KD (N-KD) using Gal80<sup>ts</sup>. We inactivated the Gal80<sup>ts</sup> activity, which abrogates the suppression of 27G05-Gal4, from the beginning of the third instar stage to ensure the N-KD during lamina neurogenesis. During lamina neurogenesis, in controls, the Notch reporter Hey is expressed in newborn L4 neurons, followed by Bsh activation of Ap and Pdm3 and specification of L4 and L5 fates, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–B</xref>”). In contrast, in N-KD, Hey expression becomes absent, and Bsh now activates Pdm3 but not Ap and specifies L5 fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>”). During late pupal stages after the completion of lamina neurogenesis, control Bsh<sup>+</sup> lamina neurons include both Ap<sup>+</sup> L4 neurons and Pdm3<sup>+</sup> L5 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). In N-KD, however, Bsh<sup>+</sup> lamina neurons are mainly Pdm3<sup>+</sup> L5 neurons, although the number of Bsh<sup>+</sup> lamina neurons remains unaffected, suggesting that more L5 neurons are generated at the expense of L4 in N-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–J</xref>).

Taken together, we propose that Notch signaling creates a distinct open chromatin landscape leading to distinct Bsh-bound loci in L4 neurons, and thus generating L4-specific Bsh-dependent gene transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway for controlling binary cell fates in worms, flies, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bray, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ehebauer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jukam and Desplan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pierfelice et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pinto-Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>), yet its mechanism has been unclear. Here, we discovered that transient Notch signaling in newborn neurons diversifies neuron types by integrating with the primary HDTF. The primary HDTF Bsh with Notch signaling specifies L4 fate, while Bsh alone specifies L5 fate. The Notch<sup>ON</sup> L4, compared to Notch<sup>OFF</sup> L5, has a distinct open chromatin landscape which allows Bsh to bind distinct genomic loci, leading to L4-specific identity gene transcription. Notch signaling and Bsh expression are mutually independent. In the absence of Bsh, the Notch<sup>ON</sup> and Notch<sup>OFF</sup> neurons with ectopic HDTF Zfh1 adopt L3 and L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2023</xref>) fates, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Together, based on our findings, we propose a novel model in which the unique combination of the primary HDTF and open chromatin landscape specifies distinct neuron types.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model; see the discussion section for details.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90136-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Does Notch signaling regulate chromatin landscape independently of a primary HDTF? It seems likely based on the following observation: in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval ventral nerve cord, motor and sensory hemilineages are generated in a Notch-dependent manner; all premotor neurons are Notch<sup>ON</sup>, with Notch<sup>ON</sup> neurons sharing similar anatomical and functional properties, despite expressing distinct HDTFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heckscher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mark et al., 2021</xref>), possibly due to the common chromatin landscape regulated by Notch signaling. An important future direction would be to test whether Notch<sup>ON</sup> neurons retain the same chromatin landscape in the absence of the primary HDTF, for example Bsh.</p><p>Despite the important roles of Notch signaling in development, its function in lamina development was unknown. Here, we discovered that L1 neurons express Delta and activate Notch signaling in adjacent newborn L4 but not in the more distant L5. L3 is also adjacent to the Delta<sup>+</sup> L1; might L3 be a Notch<sup>ON</sup> neuron? If so, it would use a different effector, as Hey is not expressed in newborn L3 neurons. Yet, it seems likely for several reasons: (1) like L4, newborn L3 neurons are strictly adjacent to Delta<sup>+</sup> L1; (2) Asymmetric Notch signaling between L3 and L1 would allow Zfh1 to differentially specify L3 and L1 neuronal fates; (3) in Bsh-KD, Notch signaling with ectopic Zfh1 specifies ectopic L3 neuron type. To tackle this, an intriguing approach would be profiling the genome-binding targets of endogenous Notch in newborn neurons. This will identify novel genes as Notch signaling reporters in neurons. Besides lamina neurons, we also detected Delta expression in a small pool of LPCs in the L1 row and the Notch target E(spl)-mγ expression in the L4 row, raising the hypothesis that Delta-expressing LPCs may rise to L1 neurons while E(spl)-mγ-expressing LPCs may rise to L4 neurons. This also suggests that LPCs are more heterogeneous than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apitz and Salecker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernandes et al., 2017</xref>). It would be interesting to characterize the molecular heterogeneity of LPCs using scRNA-seq and explore the potential role of Notch signaling in this population.</p><p>It is well known that Notch signaling controls binary cell fates. Yet, its mechanism remains unclear. We found that Notch signaling and primary HDTF Bsh activity are integrated to specify two distinct neuron types: L4 and L5. Notch signaling directly or indirectly generates an L4-distinct open chromatin landscape which specifies L4-distinct Bsh-bound loci, resulting in L4-specific Bsh-dependent gene transcription. This is consistent with in vitro findings of Notch function. In cultured mammalian cells, upon Notch activation, Notch transcription complexes recruit p300, which acetylates H3K27 and produce a large increase in H3K27 acetylation levels, an active enhancer marker, across the entire breadth of super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oswald et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, Notch activation induces a robust increase in H3K56 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bray, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Skalska et al., 2015</xref>). One intriguing future direction would be testing whether Notch signaling directly generates an open chromatin landscape in vivo.</p><p>Our brain function depends on the vast diversity of neuron types. The role of TFs in specifying neuron types has been well-studied. For example, each temporal transcription factor (TTF) acts transiently in progenitors to generate specific neuron types during its expression window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2013</xref>). While most TTFs are not maintained in neurons, their function is likely maintained by another TF, for example HDTF, which is persistently expressed in neurons. Indeed, HDTFs function as terminal selectors and control the expression of neuronal identity genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cros and Hobert, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hobert, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reilly et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reilly et al., 2020</xref>). The primary HDTF Bsh specifies L4 and L5 neuronal fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). However, the role of open chromatin in specifying neuron type is less well characterized. In vitro, during the programming of mouse embryonic stem cells to neurons, proneural factors Ascl1 and Neurogenin2 establish distinct chromatin landscapes, resulting in induced neurons with different subtype identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aydin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we found that Bsh with Notch signaling specifies L4 fate, while Bsh alone specifies L5 fate. The Notch<sup>ON</sup> L4, compared to Notch<sup>OFF</sup> L5, has a distinct open chromatin landscape which allows Bsh to bind distinct genomic loci, leading to L4-specific identity gene transcription. Furthermore, in Bsh-KD, L3 and L1 are ectopically generated at the expense of L4 and L5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This elegant one-to-one fate switch (L4 &gt;L3; L5 &gt;L1) raises an open question: would newborn L4 and L3 share the open chromatin landscape, which is distinct from the one shared by newborn L5 and L1? Our findings provide a testable model that the unique combination of the primary HDTF and open chromatin landscape specifies distinct neuron types.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Data availability</title><p>All resources will be provided upon request.

For TaDa in L5, homozygous tubP-GAL80[ts]; 6–60 Gal4 UAS-myristoylated-tdTomato males were crossed to homozygous virgin females (FlyORF-TaDa line for Dam; Bsh-TaDa line for Bsh:Dam). Crosses were reared at 18 °C. To perform TaDa in L4 and L5 neurons during the synapse formation window, we collected pupae with the age of 46 hr APF and moved them to 29 °C to activate 31C06-Gal4 (L4) or 6–60 Gal4 (L5) for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Then lamina were dissected (age equivalent at 25 °C: 76 hr APF) in cold PBS within one hour and stored at –20 °C immediately until sufficient laminae were collected for each group—about 70 lamina from 35 pupae. The published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>) TaDa experimental pipeline was followed with a few modifications. Briefly, DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) digested with DpnI (NEB, Ipswich, MA) overnight, and cleaned up using Qiagen PCR purification columns. DamID adaptors were ligated using T4 DNA ligase (NEB, Ipswich, MA) followed by DpnII (NEB, Ipswich, MA) digestion for 2 hr and PCR amplification using MyTaq HS DNA polymerase (Bioline, Memphis, Tennessee).

As the overall Bsh binding profiles between L4 and L5 neurons were highly correlated, the binding profiles of all replicates were quantile normalized prior to further analysis.</p><p>Differentially open regions in the Dam-alone dataset, and differentially-bound regions in the Bsh binding dataset, were identified using NOIseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tarazona et al., 2015</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hatch et al., 2021</xref>) at a threshold of q=0.85.

The alternative hypothesis was that Bsh-bound targets or open chromatin would be enriched for genes expressed in the same lineage.

They propose a model in which differential Notch activity generates different chromatin landscapes in presumptive L4 and L5, allowing the differential binding of the primary homeodomain TF Bsh (as described in the co-submitted paper), which in turn activate downstream genes specific to either neuronal type. The requirement of Notch for L4 vs. L5 fate is well supported, and complete transformation from one cell type into the other is observed when altering Notch activity. However, the role of Notch in creating differential chromatin landscapes is not directly demonstrated. It is only based on correlation, but it remains a plausible and intriguing hypothesis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors are successful in characterizing the role of Notch to distinguish between L4 and L5 cell fates. They show that the Notch pathway is active in L4 but not in L5. They identify L1, the neuron adjacent to L4 as expressing the Delta ligand, therefore being the potential source for Notch activation in L4. Moreover, the manuscript shows molecular and morphological/connectivity transformations from one cell type into the other when Notch activity is manipulated.</p><p>Using DamID, the authors characterize the chromatin landscape of L4 and L5 neurons. They show that Bsh occupies distinct loci in each cell type. This support their model that Bsh acts as a primary selector gene in L4/L5 that activates different target genes in L4 vs L5 based on the differential availability of open chromatin loci.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript presents an interesting example of how Notch activity cooperates with TF expression to generate diverging cell fates. Together with the accompanying paper, it helps thoroughly describe how lamina cell types L4 and L5 are specified and provides an interesting hypothesis for the role of Notch and Bsh in increasing neuronal diversity in the lamina during evolution.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Differential Notch activity in L4 and L5:</p><p>● The manuscript focuses its attention on describing Notch activity in L4 vs L5 neurons. However, from the data presented, it is very likely that the pool of progenitors (LPCs) is already subdivided into at least two types of progenitors that will rise to L4 and L5, respectively. Evidence to support this is the activity of E(spl)-mɣ-GFP and the Dl puncta observed in the LPC region. Discussion should naturally follow that Notch-induced differences in L4/L5 might preexist L1-expressed Dl that affect newborn L4/L5. Therefore, the differences between L4 and L5 fates might be established earlier than discussed in the paper. The authors should acknowledge this possibility and discuss it in their model.</p><p>● The authors claim that Notch activation is caused by L1-expressed Delta. However, they use an LPC driver to knock down Dl. Dl-KD should be performed exclusively in L1, and the fate of L4 should be assessed.</p><p>● To test whether L4 neurons are derived from NotchON LPCs, I suggest performing MARCM clones in early pupa with an E(spl)-mɣ-GFP reporter.</p><p>● The expression of different Notch targets in LPCs and L4 neurons may be further explored. I suggest using different Notch-activity reporters (i.e., E(spl)-GFP reporters) to further characterize these differences. What cause the switch in Notch target expression from LPCs to L4 neurons should be a topic of discussion.</p><p>Notch role in establishing L4 vs L5 fates:</p><p>● The authors describe that 27G05-Gal4 causes a partial Notch Gain of Function caused by its genomic location between Notch target genes. However, this is not further elaborated. The use of this driver is especially problematic when performing Notch KD, as many of the resulting neurons express Ap, and therefore have some features of L4 neurons. Therefore, Pdm3+/Ap+ cells should always be counted as intermediate L4/L5 fate (i.e., Fig3 E-J, Fig3-Sup2), irrespective of what the mechanistic explanation for Ap activation might be. It's not accurate to assume their L5 identity. In Fig4 intermediate-fate cells are correctly counted as such.</p><p>● Lines 170-173: The temporal requirement for Notch activity in L5-to-L4 transformation is not clearly delineated. In Fig4-figure supplement 1D-E, it is not stated if the shift to 29{degree sign}C is performed as in Fig4-figure supplement 1A-C.</p><p>● Additionally, using the same approach, it would be interesting to explore the window of competence for Notch-induced L5-to-L4 transformation: at which point in L5 maturation can fate no longer be changed by Notch GoF?</p><p>L4-to-L3 conversion in the absence of Bsh</p><p>● Although interesting, the L4-to-L3 conversion in the absence of Bsh is never shown to be dependent on Notch activity. Importantly, L3 NotchON status is assumed based on their position next to Dl-expressing L1, but it is not empirically tested. Perhaps screening Notch target reporter expression in the lamina, as suggested above, could inform this issue.</p><p>● Otherwise, the analysis of Bsh Loss of Function in L4 might be better suited to be included in the accompanying manuscript that specifically deals with the role of Bsh as a selector gene for L4 and L5.</p><p>Different chromatin landscape in L4 and L5 neurons</p><p>● A major concern is that, although L4 and L5 neurons are shown to present different chromatin landscapes (as expected for different neuronal types), it is not demonstrated that this is caused by Notch activity.
