Biological stability of human telomerase RNA (hTR) relies on H/ACA proteins, but other eukaryotes use other RNP assembly pathways. To investigate additional rationale for human telomerase assembly as H/ACA RNP, we developed a minimized cellular hTR. Remarkably, with only binding sites for telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), minimized hTR assembled biologically active enzyme. TERT overexpression was required for cellular interaction with minimized hTR, indicating that H/ACA RNP assembly enhances endogenous hTR-TERT interaction. Telomere maintenance by minimized telomerase was unaffected by the elimination of the telomerase holoenzyme Cajal body chaperone TCAB1 or the Cajal body scaffold protein Coilin. Surprisingly, wild-type hTR also maintained and elongated telomeres in TCAB1 or Coilin knockout cells, with distinct changes in telomerase action. Overall, we elucidate trafficking requirements for telomerase biogenesis and function and expand mechanisms by which altered telomere maintenance engenders human disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18221.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18221.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18221.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most cells in the human body can only divide a certain number of times before they die. This is because regions called telomeres at the ends of the cell’s DNA get shorter every time the cell divides, to the point that they disappear and halt cell growth. Particular types of cells – including some stem cells and cancer cells – can avoid death and continue to divide indefinitely because they produce an enzyme called telomerase that extends the telomere regions.</p><p>The process by which the telomerase enzyme binds to and lengthens the DNA has several stages and involves many different proteins. One of the stages involves moving telomerase from the sites where it is assembled within the cell to a place where it can find telomeres in need of elongation (different areas within the cell compartment called the nucleus). Structures inside the nucleus called Cajal bodies were thought to help the enzyme bind to the telomeres. It is not clear why the process of extending telomeres is so complex.</p><p>Vogan et al. engineered altered versions of telomerase that use simpler pathways to bind to and act on telomeres and inserted them into ‘pluripotent’ stem cells and cancer cells from humans. The experiments show that a pathway that helps to move the enzyme from its normal storage place in the nucleus is less important for extending telomeres in cancer cells than in pluripotent stem cells. Unexpectedly, Cajal bodies are not critical for bringing telomerase into contact with the telomeres in either cell type.</p><p>The findings show that many of the proteins involved in extending telomeres in cells are not strictly essential. The simplified pathway developed by Vogan et al. opens up new opportunities to study the details of how telomerase extends telomeres.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18221.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18221.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>telomerase</kwd><kwd>Cajal bodies</kwd><kwd>human embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>genome editing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 HL079585</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Kathleen</given-names></name><name><surname>Vogan</surname><given-names>Jacob M</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiaozhu</given-names></name><name><surname>Youmans</surname><given-names>Daniel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hockemeyer</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hockemeyer</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Cajal body chaperone TCAB1 and scaffold protein Coilin are not required for telomerase activity in human cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic chromosome stability relies on end-protective telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnoult and Karlseder, 2015</xref>). In most organisms, end-protective telomeric chromatin assembles on a tract of simple-sequence DNA repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Lange, 2010</xref>), for example the human repeat of TTAGGG on the strand with 3’OH terminus. Maintenance of this telomeric repeat array requires <italic>de novo</italic> repeat synthesis by the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) reverse transcriptase telomerase to balance the repeat erosion inherent in DNA-dependent DNA-polymerase replication of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackburn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hug and Lingner, 2006</xref>). Telomerase extends chromosome 3' ends by copying a template within the telomerase RNA subunit (hTR in human cells), using an active site in the telomerase reverse transcriptase protein (TERT). The intricate co-folding and co-function of telomerase RNA and TERT obliges a step-wise RNP assembly process and generates a network of protein- and RNA-domain interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackburn and Collins, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmidt and Cech, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cellular RNP biogenesis involves transit through and concentration in specific nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Machyna et al., 2013</xref>). Trafficking pathways differ depending on the diverse steps of RNA processing, modification, and RNP assembly that give a transcript its fate and function. Among the best-studied RNP transit points are Cajal bodies, defined as foci of the protein Coilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nizami et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Machyna et al., 2015</xref>). Enzymes resident in Cajal bodies catalyze numerous RNA processing and modification reactions as well as RNP assembly and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Machyna et al., 2013</xref>). Beyond RNA processing and RNP biogenesis factors, Cajal bodies also recruit regulatory complexes such as CDK2-cyclinE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2000</xref>) and have widespread influence on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the multiplicity of functions ascribed to Cajal bodies, including critical roles in vertebrate telomerase function described below, it remains unclear whether their formation is a cause or consequence of associated RNP biogenesis pathways.</p><p>Curiously, ciliate, fungal, and vertebrate telomerases follow entirely different RNP biogenesis pathways, which are directed by telomerase RNA interaction with a La-motif protein, Sm proteins, or H/ACA proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egan and Collins, 2012a</xref>). In human cells, telomerase shares the same mature H/ACA proteins (dyskerin, NHP2, NOP10, GAR1) and H/ACA RNP biogenesis chaperones as the intron-encoded small nucleolar (sno) or small Cajal body (sca) RNPs that catalyze cleavage and pseudouridylation of ribosomal and small nuclear RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiss et al., 2010</xref>). Because precursor hTR is released from its site of synthesis as an autonomous transcript rather than the spliced intron lariat of other human H/ACA RNAs, it is sensitized to degradation in dyskeratosis congenita (DC) patient cells with a mutation of an H/ACA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egan and Collins, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sarek et al., 2015</xref>). Also, unlike other H/ACA RNAs, hTR requires a 5' trimethylguanosine cap to prevent 5'-3' exonuclease processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchell et al., 1999</xref>). Models for vertebrate telomerase RNA trafficking suggest an initial transit of Cajal bodies, where 5' trimethylguanosine cap modification is thought to occur, followed by localization to nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egan and Collins, 2012a</xref>). Subsequent RNP trafficking from nucleoli to steady-state concentration in Cajal bodies depends on the binding of the Cajal body chaperone and telomerase holoenzyme protein TCAB1/WDR79/WRAP53β to an hTR 3' stem-loop CAB-box motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Venteicher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tycowski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhong et al., 2011</xref>), which is present in both stem-loops of an H/ACA scaRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiss et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, this trafficking complexity could represent only a subset of the necessary cellular directions for human telomerase biogenesis and function.</p><p>The human telomerase holoenzyme subunits that localize active RNP to Cajal bodies are considered crucial for telomerase action at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmidt and Cech, 2015</xref>). Transient telomere colocalization with a Cajal body can be detected in S-phase, when telomerase acts at chromosome ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jády et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tomlinson et al., 2006</xref>). Evidence for Cajal body delivery of telomerase to telomeres builds from studies depleting TCAB1 or Coilin using RNA interference, which reduced or eliminated hTR colocalization with telomeres and induced telomere shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Venteicher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stern et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>). DC patient cells with biallelic TCAB1 mutations have short telomeres and fail to maintain telomere length even with the up-regulated telomerase expression in induced pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batista et al., 2011</xref>). With all of this experimental support for Cajal body delivery of human telomerase to telomeres, it is puzzling that mouse telomerase RNA does not localize to Cajal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tomlinson et al., 2010</xref>). Also, recently, Coilin gene knock-out (KO) in HeLa cells generated two clonal cell lines that maintained telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we address the significance of human telomerase biogenesis and trafficking pathways for active RNP assembly and function at telomeres. As a new approach, we first bypassed the endogenous hTR stability requirement for H/ACA proteins. Remarkably, we found that a minimal hTR (hTRmin) containing only binding sites for TERT can assemble active RNP in cells, and this active RNP can maintain stable telomere length homeostasis. TERT overexpression was required for cellular assembly with hTRmin, suggesting that hTR H/ACA RNP assembly enhances TERT interaction at scarce endogenous telomerase subunit levels. KO of TCAB1 or Coilin did not alter hTRmin RNP function at telomeres. Surprisingly, TCAB1 KO or Coilin KO was also permissive for hTR telomerase to maintain telomeres. In cancer and pluripotent stem cell lines with endogenous hTR and TERT expression, TCAB1 KO resulted in a slow decline of telomere length followed by stable telomere length homeostasis. We conclude that aside from conferring hTR stability and facilitating active telomerase assembly in cells with scarce TERT, hTR assembly as H/ACA RNP is not essential. Also, Cajal body localization is not essential for hTRmin or hTR telomerase to maintain stable telomere length homeostasis. Our findings illuminate the influences of nuclear trafficking on human telomerase biogenesis and action at telomeres, account for why telomerase biogenesis pathways can be so divergent in eukaryotic evolution, and give new interpretation to the mechanisms by which different telomerase subunit mutations impose human disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human telomerase can be liberated from H/ACA RNP assembly</title><p>To test the significance of H/ACA RNP biogenesis for human telomerase function at telomeres, we sought to bypass the essential role of this pathway in the protection of hTR from degradation while preserving hTR-TERT interaction and RNP catalytic activity. The H/ACA-motif 5' stem of hTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) separates two hTR regions that are critical for binding of TERT and catalytic activity: the template/pseudoknot (t/PK) and conserved regions (CR) 4/5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Previously we joined these two regions with a spacer to create hTRmin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which in combination with TERT reconstitutes a minimized active telomerase in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu and Collins, 2014</xref>).

For example, we interchanged the hTRmin 5’ end as no leader, endogenous hTR quadruplex-forming leader (LeaderG), or a mutant leader (LeaderC) that eliminates one of the four adjacent guanosine tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sexton and Collins, 2011</xref>). We also tested 6 or 14 nucleotide (nt) lengths of single-stranded RNA spacer separating the t/PK and CR4/5 regions. For 3'-end formation, we tested the MALAT1 triplex motif with or without an adjacent RNase P cleavage site mimicking a pre-tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2012</xref>). We also omitted or included a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDV RZ), which can increase hTR accumulation by stabilizing the precursor 3' end with an exonuclease-resistant 2',3' cyclic phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egan and Collins, 2012b</xref>).</p><p>We first assessed hTRmin accumulation in transiently transfected 293T cells, using an expression context previously optimized for hTR that exploits the U3 snoRNA promoter to direct transcription by RNA Polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu and Collins, 2003</xref>). Accumulation of hTRmin to a level detectable by Northern blot required both the RNA triplex and the RNase P site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We next tested if this cellular hTRmin could form active RNP. We transiently co-expressed hTRmin or hTR with 3xFLAG-tagged (F) TERT in the telomerase-negative U2OS cell line and assayed for telomeric primer extension by immunopurified TERT. Cellular reconstitution with hTRmin yielded lower RNA accumulation and proportionally lower overall activity than reconstitution with hTR, but hTRmin and hTR telomerase RNPs had similar profiles of repeat synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For continued optimization, we next compared hTRmin accumulation with no 5’ leader, LeaderG, or LeaderC and with 6 nt versus 14 nt spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), all with the RNA triplex and RNaseP cleavage site. The presence of a 5’ leader increased accumulation, and the quadruplex-mutant LeaderC was as good or better than the native hTR LeaderG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Also, the 6 nt spacer between t/PK and CR4/5 was as good or better than the 14 nt spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). HDV RZ addition downstream of the MALAT1 3' processing elements improved hTRmin accumulation from some transfected constructs but did not notably increase accumulation of the optimal LeaderC-containing hTRmin with 6 nt spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which in subsequent experiments we designate LhTRmin for distinction from the leader-less hTRmin.</p><p>To confirm that removal of the H/ACA motif eliminated all interactions with H/ACA proteins, we expressed epitope-tagged TERT, dyskerin, or TCAB1 with hTR or LhTRmin in telomerase-negative VA-13 cells, immunopurified the tagged protein using FLAG antibody resin, and detected bound RNA by Northern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). As expected, TERT, dyskerin, and TCAB1 each bound hTR whereas only TERT bound LhTRmin. As in 293T cells, in VA-13 cells both leader-free hTRmin and LhTRmin accumulated, with LhTRmin being optimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The robust 3' end protection activity of the MALAT1 triplex was evident when it was appended to full-length hTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; note that mature hTR sometimes migrates as a doublet due to in-gel folding). To compare the cellular localizations of LhTRmin and hTR, we overexpressed LhTRmin or hTR with TERT by transient transfection. While hTR concentrated in nuclear puncta as expected, LhTRmin distributed throughout the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Transfection of cells lacking endogenous hTR (see below) confirmed that hTRmin and LhTRmin have a diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution distinct from that of hTR or hTR with a CAB-box mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Together the studies above establish that cellular hTRmin and LhTRmin escape the confines of H/ACA RNP assembly.</p><p>We next tested whether hTRmin or LhTRmin could accumulate when stably expressed from an integrated transgene. In the near-diploid HCT116 human colon carcinoma cell line, we used a zinc finger nuclease that introduced a double-stranded DNA break at the AAVS1 safe-harbor locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hockemeyer et al., 2009</xref>) to integrate an RNA expression cassette and a neomycin resistance cassette. After selection, the polyclonal population of targeted cells was assayed for RNA accumulation by Northern blot. Consistent with results from transient transfection, LhTRmin accumulation exceeded that of hTRmin, with or without a downstream HDV RZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Stably expressed hTRmin was barely detectable, and even LhTRmin accumulated to a level lower than endogenous hTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Therefore, the MALAT1 3' processing elements do not confer as much accumulation to minimized hTR as does an embedded H/ACA RNP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Catalytically active telomerase supports telomere maintenance without H/ACA proteins or TCAB1</title><p>Successful cellular biogenesis of hTRmin telomerase RNP allowed us to test whether H/ACA proteins have post-biogenesis influences on telomerase function at telomeres.

RNA expression was directed by the U3 snoRNA promoter, and protein expression was driven by the strong and constitutive CAGGS promoter. Polyclonal populations of transgene-containing cells were selected and immediately assayed for telomerase subunit expression and telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Transgene expression of GFP, LhTRmin, hTRmin, or TERT alone did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lanes 2 and 4–6). However, LhTRmin or hTRmin with TERT OE did generate active telomerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lanes 7–8). TERT co-expression did not affect hTRmin biological accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, compare lanes 4–5 to lanes 7–8). Parallel results were confirmed using the independent hTR KO clonal cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). In addition, we tested telomerase activity rescue of hTR KO cells or hTR KO cells with AAVS1 TERT OE by lentiviral introduction of LhTRmin. Only with TERT OE did lentiviral expression of LhTRmin produce active telomerase, whereas lentiviral expression of hTR rescued hTR KO without TERT OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Telomerase activity levels in the hTRmin telomerase cell lines were within an order of magnitude of the telomerase level in parental HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). From these experiments we conclude that hTR assembly as H/ACA RNP strongly stimulates hTR interaction with TERT when both subunits are at very low expression levels, but this role of H/ACA RNP assembly can be bypassed by increasing the cellular availability of TERT.</p><p>The hTR KO cell lines lacking active telomerase ultimately entered an interval of pervasive cell death with dramatic membrane blebbing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, yellow arrowheads) at ~70 days post-targeting, corresponding to ~70 population doublings. In stark contrast, all of the telomerase-positive polyclonal cell cultures and clonal cell lines proliferated over many months of continuous passage with normal morphology and doubling time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Therefore, the catalytically active hTRmin telomerase RNPs conferred indefinite cellular proliferative capacity.</p><p>We next tested the hTR KO cell lines with AAVS1 transgenes for rescue of telomere shortening.

We suggest that differences in telomerase subunit expression levels could in part reflect epigenetic differences introduced upon transgene integration, which was an independent event in each clonal cell line.

Surprisingly, telomeres shortened more gradually in the TCAB1 KO clonal cell lines, followed by stable telomere length homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The starting point of telomere length in TCAB1 KO clonal cell lines mirrored the amount of telomerase activity in cell extract (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, left panel), but after more than half a year of continuous growth, telomere lengths in all of the TCAB1 KO clonal cell lines stabilized at a few kbp shorter than telomeres in the parental cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, right panel). In comparison, telomeres in Coilin KO clonal cell lines cultured in parallel remained near the length of telomeres in the parental HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We conclude that in HCT116 cells, neither TCAB1 nor Coilin is required for a stable telomere length homeostasis.</p><p>Stable telomere length maintenance in the TCAB1 KO cells with endogenous telomerase was unexpected. To determine whether this finding is general, we investigated the consequence of TCAB1 or Coilin KO in the human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line WIBR#3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiba and Hockemeyer, 2015</xref>). Clonal hESC lines with TCAB1 or Coilin KO were generated using the same approach that was successful in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). As observed for HCT116 cells, hESC lines lacking TCAB1 or Coilin were viable with no evident change in cell morphology or proliferation. TCAB1 accumulated in Coilin KO cells, and Coilin accumulated in TCAB1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Neither TCAB1 KO nor Coilin KO affected telomerase activity assayed in cell extract beyond the range of clonal variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Coilin remained localized to Cajal bodies in TCAB1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Over many months of continuous culture, hESCs lacking TCAB1 experienced very gradual telomere shortening followed by telomere length maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). The rate of telomere shortening was slow compared to telomere shortening in TERT KO hESC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sexton et al., 2014</xref>). The hESCs lacking Coilin retained telomere lengths comparable to the parental hESC culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Clonal hESC lines that had undergone targeting but retained the wild-type genotype also did not demonstrate telomere shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, lanes labeled wild-type).</p><p>To confirm that telomere shortening in TCAB1 KO cells was directly linked to the loss of TCAB1, we introduced a TCAB1 transgene to TCAB1 KO cells by integration at AAVS1. TCAB1 KO HCT116 cells ectopically expressing F-tagged TCAB1 regained telomere length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Likewise, TCAB1 KO hESCs ectopically expressing F-tagged TCAB1 regained telomere length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). As a control for complete TCAB1 loss-of-function, we targeted the TCAB1 KO cells above, which have an exon 2 disruption shortly after the translation start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), for successful homozygous disruption of downstream exon 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3E</xref>).

Overall, based on the assays described above, we conclude that TCAB1 and Cajal bodies are not essential for hTR telomerase to maintain telomeres at a stable length homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TCAB1 is not required for rapid telomere elongation by telomerase overexpression</title><p>In human somatic cells that remain telomerase-positive, stimulation to proliferate can be accompanied by dramatic telomerase activation and telomere length gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weng et al., 1997</xref>). This rapid increase in telomere length could depend on telomerase assistance by TCAB1 and/or Cajal bodies in a manner not required for maintaining length homeostasis. We therefore tested TCAB1 and Coilin KO cells for their ability to support rapid telomere elongation upon an increase in telomerase expression, achieved by integrating transgenes for hTR and TERT overexpression at AAVS1.</p><p>The parental, TCAB1 KO, and Coilin KO HCT116 cells with integrated hTR and TERT transgenes acquired ~2-fold elevated hTR and ~5-fold elevated telomerase catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These High-Telomerase (HiT) polyclonal cell cultures had increased telomere length by the first time point after selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Telomere elongation was rapid in TCAB1 KO HiT cell cultures, reaching the limit of length discrimination almost immediately. Rapid telomere elongation in TCAB1 KO cells is consistent with telomere elongation in wild-type HeLa cells by overexpression of CAB-box-mutant hTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu and Collins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cristofari et al., 2007</xref>). In comparison, Coilin KO HiT cells had less telomere elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results were replicated in an independently performed HiT conversion of the same cell lines (not shown). Telomeres in both TCAB1 KO and Coilin KO cells elongated upon expression of a truncated POT1 compromised for binding to single-stranded telomeric-repeat DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loayza and De Lange, 2003</xref>), expressed by transgene integration at AAVS1 (data not shown). No obvious hTR foci were detected in HCT116 HiT cells lacking TCAB1 or Coilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that the hTR foci detected in HeLa cells lacking Coilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>) are challenging to detect. We conclude that if telomerase is abundant, TCAB1 is not required to support telomerase-mediated elongation of even relatively long telomeres. Integrating all of the findings of this study, we conclude that human telomerase H/ACA RNP assembly is essential not only for the biological stability of hTR but also for active RNP biogenesis at scarce subunit expression levels. In addition, H/ACA RNP assembly gives endogenous-level hESC telomerase the ability to maintain long telomeres. Remarkably, all of these H/ACA RNP assembly roles can be bypassed using hTRmin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This plasticity of telomerase RNP biogenesis and holoenzyme composition informs mechanisms of telomerase diversification across eukaryotes.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18221.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Cajal bodies promote telomere elongation upon increased telomerase expression level.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot, northern blot, and QTRAP characterization of TCAB1 KO and COIL KO HCT116 cells overexpressing hTR and TERT at AAVS1 (HiT).

We set out to uncover the rationale for a vertebrate telomerase evolutionary gain of H/ACA RNP biogenesis. H/ACA RNP biogenesis confers hTR biological stability, but across eukaryotes, telomerase RNA stability can be conferred by diverse other RNP assembly pathways. To bypass the essential role of H/ACA proteins in hTR cellular stability, we designed hTRmin RNAs containing the activity-essential hTR motifs and a 3’ triplex structure but not an H/ACA motif. Although hTRmin did not bind H/ACA proteins or TCAB1, it did assemble catalytically active telomerase. The opposite TER redesign strategy was used to test the significance of the relative positioning of a large number of holoenzyme protein binding motifs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> TLC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zappulla et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mini-T retains all of the holoenzyme protein interactions but condenses the length of spacing between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zappulla et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Initially we expected the biological function of hTRmin-TERT RNPs to require tethering to Cajal bodies or telomeres. Instead, hTRmin-TERT RNPs supported stable telomere maintenance without any supplementary trafficking instructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, left). Therefore, most telomerase holoenzyme proteins may serve indirect roles in telomerase function that are readily adapted to evolutionary divergence of nuclear architecture and its cell cycle regulation. Other than hTR biological stability, the contributions of H/ACA RNP assembly, TCAB1, and Cajal bodies to endogenous human telomerase function could all be accounted for by changes in subunit and RNP distribution within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, right).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18221.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Multiple traffic pathways for human telomerase biogenesis and action at telomeres.</title><p>At left, hTRmin telomerase assembles and acts at telomeres without supplemental trafficking instructions.

Cellular assembly of minimized hTRmin into catalytically active telomerase RNP required a higher than endogenous expression level of TERT. One simple model for this influence would be that H/ACA RNP biogenesis directs trafficking of assembly-competent hTR to meet assembly-competent TERT. Based on the cell cycle regulation of human telomerase subunit synthesis and subunit exchange in assembled RNPs, we have suggested that active RNP assembly may occur with only newly synthesized TERT and/or hTR subunits prior to their steady-state distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vogan and Collins, 2015</xref>). Newly synthesized subunits could meet in Cajal bodies, as pre-mature hTR transits to acquire 5' cap trimethylation, or in nucleoli. Additional non-exclusive possibilities for cellular role(s) of hTR H/ACA RNP assembly in active RNP biogenesis include hTR folding, which would parallel the precedent from ciliate telomerase biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stone et al., 2007</xref>), and/or exclusion of non-productive hTR-protein interactions.</p><p>In both HCT116 cells and hESCs, TCAB1 KO led to telomere shortening followed by telomere length homeostasis. As one model to account for these results, TCAB1 could influence the subnuclear distribution of active RNP between nucleoli and nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, right). This change in distribution would have different influence on the amount of new telomeric repeat synthesis depending on telomerase expression level and other variables across human cell types. Of note, we have not ruled out an influence of TCAB1 related to its proposed function in DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henriksson and Farnebo, 2015</xref>). However, in studies here it is striking that TCAB1 KO affected telomere length only in cells with hTR telomerase, not in cells with hTRmin telomerase. Therefore, TCAB1 functions directly related to active telomerase assembly and trafficking are more logical hypotheses.</p><p>Consistent with a contemporary study of Coilin KO in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), we found that Coilin KO in HCT116 cells or in hESCs was permissive for stable telomere length maintenance. Coilin KO clonal cell lines generated in this work had telomere lengths similar to the parental cell lines. Because Coilin KO cells with endogenous telomerase levels have apparently unperturbed telomere length homeostasis, we suggest that they will be useful for visually tracking telomerase interactions with telomeres without the complication of Cajal body clustering of active with inactive hTR. Curiously, Coilin KO HCT116 cells had dampened telomere elongation upon an increase in telomerase expression. This could reflect less synergistic telomerase RNP loading on telomeres. Alternately, Cajal bodies could coordinate telomerase with other factors important for telomere synthesis, or they could safeguard telomere integrity. Our results support a paradigm of nuclear bodies as zones that draw factors together to fine-tune the likelihood of their physical association or functional cooperation rather than their interaction or reaction specificity.</p><p>Previous studies did not anticipate the genetic consequences of TCAB1 and Coilin KOs. For example, opposite the impact of TCAB1 and Coilin KOs on telomere lengths described above, previous studies found that endogenous hTR colocalization with telomeres was reduced more by Coilin depletion than TCAB1 depletion and overexpressed hTR colocalization with telomeres was reduced more by TCAB1 depletion than by Coilin depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stern et al., 2012</xref>).

We suggest that TCAB1 mutations reduce telomere length in early human development and in somatic cells with long telomeres.

HCT116 cell lines were selected with 300 µg/ml hygromycin, 1 µg/ml puromycin, or 300 µg/ml G418. hESC gene editing was performed by electroporation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sexton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiba and Hockemeyer, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Lentiviral transduction</title><p>Lentivirus was produced in 293T cells by calcium phosphate transfection with the packaging plasmid, psPAX2, the envelope plasmid, pMD2.G, and with transgene constructs in the DUET011 backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>). Cell transfection media was replaced at 24 hr post-transfection and virus was harvested 48 hr post-transfection. Virus-containing media was applied to HCT116 cells in the presence of 5 µg/ml polybrene (Sigma) for 24 hr before a media change. At 48 hr post-infection, transduced cells were selected with 300 µg/ml hygromycin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>PCR genotyping</title><p>Genomic DNA was prepared as described above for telomere restriction fragment analysis. Between 50–100 ng of genomic DNA was used as the template for PCR using the Q5 polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA). For PCR confirmation of gene editing, PCR primers were designed to generate amplicon size differences between loci with or without a drug resistance cassette. Paired PCR primers complementary to genomic loci had one primer complementary to a region also in the donor plasmid and the other primer complementary to a region beyond the donor plasmid homology. A third primer against either the hygromycin or puromycin resistance cassette was included that would generate an amplicon size for cassette-containing alleles that was either smaller or larger than amplicons from alleles lacking the cassette.</p><p>For TCAB1 exon 2 and Coilin exon 1 PCRs, a hygromycin cassette primer (PGK hygro: 5'-AGGCTGATCAGCGGTTTAAACTTAGCCTCCCCTACCCGGTAGAATTC-3'; or hygro pA: 5’-CTAGTGGATCCGAGCTCGGTACCAGATGCGGTGGGCTCTATGGC-3’) was paired with the following locus-specific primers:</p><p>Coil_FWD: 5'-TAGTGGATCCGAGCTCGGTACCACCACTGCTCCTGGCCTCTAGTTAC-3', Coil_REV: 5'-AGGCTGATCAGCGGTTTAAACTTAAGAACTGAAGCCGAAGCGCTGG-3', TCAB_FWD1: 5'-CTAGTGGATCCGAGCTCGGTACCAGGAAGGCTTTCCGTAATATCACACCCTAACG-3', and TCAB_REV1: 5'-AGGCTGATCAGCGGTTTAAACTTACAGAAAGTTCTTGCTCCTCGATTCGAGGACTC-3'. An alternative set of TCAB1 locus primers was also used for additional validation of the lines: TCAB1_FWD2: 5’-CTAGTGGATCCGAGCTCGGTACCAGCGGTGCTAAGGAACACAGTGCTTTCAAAAG-3’, and TCAB1_REV2: 5’-AGGCTGATCAGCGGTTTAAACTTAGGCATCCCTCTCCTAGAAAACTGG-3’.</p><p>For TCAB1 exon 8 PCR, a primer against the puromycin resistance cassette (PGK_PURO: 5’-GGCGCACCGTGGGCTTGTACTCGGTCATGGTGGCGGGATGCAGGT CGAAAGGCCCG-3’) was combined with two loci primers (TCAB1_ex8_FWD: 5’-CCAAGGCCAACCAGCTGGTCAAAGGACTGCTTC-3’, and TCAB1_ex8_REV:5’-CTCAGCATCCTGGAGACAAGGAACAGGACCTGGAGT-3’). For TERT locus PCR, another primer against the hygromycin cassette was used (TERT_hygro: 5'-CTCACCGCGACGTCTGTCGAGAAG-3') with the following locus-specific primers: TERT_FWD 5'-CTAGTGGATCCGAGCTCGGTACCAGCGGCGCGAGTTTCAGGCAG-3', and TERT_REV 5'-AGGCTGATCAGCGGTTTAAACTTAAACGGCAGACTTCGGCTGGCAC-3'.</p><p>For TERC locus PCR, a puromycin resistance cassette primer (5’-TGAAGCCGAGCCGCTCGTAGAA-3’) was combined with locus-specific primers: hTR_FWD 5’-GTGGATCCGAGCTCGGTACCACCCACTGAGCCGAGACAAGATTC-3’ and hTR_REV 5’-GAAAGCGAACTGCATGTGTGAGCCG-3’. Some primers had 5’ regions complementary to the pcDNA3.1 vector to facilitate cloning, for which DNA was gel-excised, purified, and ligated into pcDNA3.1 (Thermo). DH5a cells were then transformed and several colonies were sequenced.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Southern blots</title><p>Cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM DTT), treated with RNase A for 30 min at 37°C, followed by proteinase K treatment for 4 hr to overnight at 50°C. DNA was then purified using phenol-isoamyl alcohol-chloroform, followed by precipitation with isopropanol and NaCl. After pelleting, the DNA was washed twice with ethanol and resuspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA). DNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Two to 8 µg of DNA was then digested with MboI and AluI for 6 hr to overnight before electrophoresis in a 0.7% agarose gel in 1X TAE. The agarose gel was then vacuum dried at 50°C for 1 hr. The dried gel was then denatured with 0.5 N NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl for 30 min at 50°C. The gel was washed twice with 4X SSC + 0.1% SDS and subsequently blocked with Church's buffer for 30 min at 50°C. <sup>32</sup>P-end-labeled telomeric repeat probe (T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3)3</sub> and <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probe made by random-priming of HinDIII lambda phage digest ladder (NEB) and/or the O'generuler 1 kbp plus DNA ladder (Thermo) were added. Probes were hybridized overnight at 50°C. The membrane was then extensively washed in 4X SSC + 0.1% SDS at 40°C before screen exposure and imaging on a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jessica Brown and Joan Steitz for the M1 expression vector.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Carol Greider (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jonathan Alder (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months, so please let us know if you have any questions first.</p><p>This manuscript by Vogan et al. provides strong evidence that a minimal telomerase RNA functions to elongate telomere in vivo in human cells. Recognizing that over evolution, telomerase RNAs in different species have acquired different 3' ends, the author test whether the box H/ACA 3' region of hTR is needed for telomerase to function at telomeres. They demonstrate that the H/ACA-interacting regions of hTR are dispensable if modifications are made to stabilize the RNA. The authors use the cleaver trick of putting an alternative stable 3' end from the MALAT1 triplex structure on the 3' end of hTR and find that when expression levels are sufficiently high, this minimal hTR functions to elongate telomeres in transformed human cells and hES cells. They go on to test the importance of TCAB1 and Coilin in telomere length maintenance and show they are not required for telomere elongation in vivo. This paper is important because it establishes that the minimal region for the human telomerase RNA does not require the 3' region or several accessory proteins. The work expands our understanding of the roles of TCAB1 and Coilin, which have been the subject of some controversy.</p><p>The manuscript does not need additional experiments but requires additional clarification of experiments presented and should be significantly rewritten to make it clearer and more concise. In places the manuscript is a bit confusing to follow and there are a number of changes that will greatly help clarify the conclusions.</p><p>Specific scientific points:</p><p>1) In the Introduction the authors should site Zappulla 2005 Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2005. This group showed that a minimal telomerase RNA also functions in yeast, and similar to what is shown here, this smaller RNA needs to be expressed at a higher level perhaps to overcome inefficient assembly. Referring to this previous work in yeast would strengthen this argument made in this manuscript as the minimal RNA requirement is conserved.</p><p>2) In the second paragraph of the subsection “Human telomerase can be liberated from its H/ACA RNP identity”: the description of the different version of the hTR min here is very confusing. This section should be rewritten to clarify what each construct has, and not just say 'we tested various lengths...&quot; Lay out each component (RNA domain) and why it is being used, and explain what the &quot;LeaderG means. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows this well, but need to write about this clearly.</p><p>3) It is not clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> whether telomerase activity can be increased with increasing amounts of hTRmin expression (as it can be with hTR <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), has this been tested? Or is it only hTERT over expression that stabilizes hTRmin?</p><p>4) In the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Catalytically active telomerase supports telomere maintenance without H/ACA proteins or TCAB1” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>: The authors state that the hTR KO cell lines lacking active telomerase ultimately entered senescence, however no time frame or passage number is given. Ideally clonogenic survival or growth curve would be appropriate to present. Simple pictures of cells cannot demonstrate the heterogeneity in the population of cells thus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> is not needed. Showing this picture does not help the reader, better to know how long it took the cells to die. Some discussion of this heterogeneity in viability would be very helpful. Also it would be very helpful to state passage numbers or days in culture to the 'time' arrow at the bottom of 2F.</p><p>5) Specifically it is important to understand whether some cells in the population continue to grow for some time? Are some cells able to escape short telomere phenotype cause by hTRmin or LhTRmin?</p><p>6) In the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Catalytically active telomerase supports telomere maintenance without H/ACA proteins or TCAB1”: The authors state, &quot;curiously these clonal lines had stable but distinct set points&quot;. I am not sure why they say 'curiously' as it is well established in the literature that the founder effect of a given telomere length sets the length distribution in the daughter cells and then the equilibrium is distributed around that founding length. This fact has been published by others in human cells and in fact was first seen in yeast (Shampay &amp; Blackburn PNAS 1988 Jan;85(2):534-8. Generation of telomere-length heterogeneity in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>).</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> the telomere lengths in cells expressing LhTRmin increase at 79 days post-targeting. How do these kinetics of elongation compare with time of elongation for expression of hTR (only 1 time point shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> for hTR)? Could the level of RNA expression affect the rates of elongation?</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> can the authors comment on the possible sources of variable expression of F-TERT. Presumably, these constructs have been integrated into the AAVS1 safe-harbor site. Do the differences arrive from different levels of the various hTRs?</p><p>9) In the third paragraph of the subsection “TCAB1 and Cajal bodies contribute distinct, non-essential regulations of telomerase”: As noted above, heterogeneity in set points does not necessarily have to come from variation of telomerase component levels. The founder effect can establish differences in telomere length distributions without altering the genetically determined set point equilibrium. This concept of concluding this is an altered 'set point' should be reconsidered throughout the manuscript. Their data for hTRmin function is strong, there is no need to confuse it with discussion of alterations of set point.</p><p>10) In the fifth paragraph of the subsection 2TCAB1 and Cajal bodies contribute distinct, non-essential regulations of telomerase”: The conclusion that TCAB1 allows cells with box H/ACA to maintain longer telomere is presented without stating what the RNA levels are. What are the hTR levels and the stability? Is there a shorter half-life of hTRmin? I do not think additional experiments are needed, however more concise conclusions would help. The longer telomeres may be due to a more stable RNA, not any function of TCAB1. This sentence/conclusion should be reworked.</p><p>11) In the last paragraph of the subsection “TCAB1 and Cajal bodies contribute distinct, non-essential regulations of telomerase”: the conclusion that is made &quot;that TCAB and Cajal bodies are not needed to maintain telomeres at a stable length&quot; does not accurately reflect the data shown. In the figure, clearly, telomeres get longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B and D</xref>). The authors should say something about this elongation and then make conclusion from that, before saying perhaps that minimal maintenance of telomeres does not require TCAB and Cajal bodies. But to ignore the large increase in length in the concluding sentence is dissonant with the results presented.</p><p>12) In the second paragraph of the subsection “TCAB1 and Coilin differentially affect telomerase ability to increase telomere length”: the authors state there is &quot;a 5 fold elevated telomerase catalytic activity&quot;.</p><p>However, TRAP is measured so they should state an increase in TRAP products, as they are not measuring telomerase catalytic activity rate.</p><p>13) In the second paragraph of the subsection “TCAB1 and Coilin differentially affect telomerase ability to increase telomere length”: The authors state, Coilin KO HiT cells exhibited much slower and dramatically blunted telomere elongation&quot; this statement does not reflect the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. While there is some difference in telomere elongation rate in TCAB1 KO and Colin KO cells, the overwhelming effect that is seen in these gels is dramatic telomere elongation. Some statement about the significant elongation is required for the reader to understand what subtle difference the authors are pointing to between the slightly different extents of the significant elongation. The words 'dramatically blunted' do not fit the data that is shown.</p><p>14) In the second paragraph of the subsection “TCAB1 and Coilin differentially affect telomerase ability to increase telomere length”: the authors say &quot;this is the first time a factor other than telomerase determine the extent of length gain&quot;. This sentence should be removed. It is well known that altering shelterin component levels affects length equilibrium, and it has been shown by several groups that ATM kinase activity regulates telomere elongation.</p><p>15) In the last paragraph of the subsection 2TCAB1 and Coilin differentially affect telomerase ability to increase telomere length”: The authors conclude from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> that there is no effect of Coilin KO on the level of telomere elongation in a Pot1 DeltaOB mutant background. However, it is striking that there is a strong effect in the TCAB KO that the authors do not comment on. Comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, it seems there is an equal but opposite effect of TCAB and Coilin KO. There is less elongation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> in the Coilin mutant, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> there is less elongation in the TCAB mutant. This is very confusing and the authors do not mention this at all. I would suggest that since the Pot1 DeltaOB mutant is not really a large part of this story, that this experiment should be removed from the manuscript. It does not add any important information and is not easy to interpret.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18221.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The manuscript does not need additional experiments but requires additional clarification of experiments presented and should be significantly rewritten to make it clearer and more concise.

We also liked the experiment because Coilin KO cells were not different from parental cells in telomere elongation by POT1 dOB, whereas they were different in telomere elongation by HiT. The problem comparing parental cells to TCAB1 KO cells with POT1 dOB expression is that the TCAB1 KO cells start out with shorter length. Net amount of telomere lengthening does appear less in TCAB1 KO than parental, but as a fold-increase from where they started, the two backgrounds are similar.</p></body></sub-article></article>
