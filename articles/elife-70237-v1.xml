Here, we describe a potent approach for noninvasive mapping of cancer-associated enzyme activity using a molecular sensor that acts on the vasculature, providing a diagnostic readout via local changes in hemodynamic image contrast. The sensor is targeted at the fibroblast activation protein (FAP), an extracellular dipeptidase and clinically relevant biomarker of brain tumor biology. Optimal FAP sensor variants were identified by screening a series of prototypes for responsiveness in a cell-based bioassay. The best variant was then applied for quantitative neuroimaging of FAP activity in rats, where it reveals nanomolar-scale FAP expression by xenografted cells. The activated probe also induces robust hemodynamic contrast in nonhuman primate brain. This work thus demonstrates a potentially translatable strategy for ultrasensitive functional imaging of molecular targets in neuromedicine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular imaging</kwd><kwd>protease</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>MRI</kwd><kwd>saimiri sciureus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24 MH109081</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jasanoff</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 NS103470</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jasanoff</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 EB031641</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jasanoff</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MIT Simons Center for the Social Brain</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jasanoff</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011671</institution-id><institution>G.

In the brain, performing such diagnoses is particularly complicated by the difficulty of obtaining biopsy samples for ex vivo analysis. The development of sensitive in vivo assays for tumor-associated proteins is therefore an important goal in brain cancer research and treatment. Extracellular proteases have emerged as notable hallmarks of pernicious cancers such as gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen and Colman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edwards et al., 2008</xref>). Several proteases are highly expressed on the surfaces of glioma cells and play key roles in infiltration of tumors into brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mentlein et al., 2012</xref>). These enzymes are thus attractive both as diagnostic markers and as targets for therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vandooren et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Verdoes and Verhelst, 2016</xref>). Because the profiles of protease expression differ among disease subtypes, detecting proteases on cancer cells in situ could be of critical importance in classifying and subsequently treating brain tumors.</p><p>Noninvasive measurement of tumor-associated protease activity inside the living brain is exceedingly challenging, but we recently introduced a family of ultrasensitive molecular probes with the potential to address this need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desai et al., 2016</xref>). The probes are derived from peptides that induce vasodilation and consequent hemodynamic contrast detectable by many brain imaging modalities, most prominently including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Protease sensors can be engineered by fusing such peptides to protease-labile blocking domains; enzymatic cleavage of the blocking moieties activates the sensors, creating an imaging signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This principle was illustrated in proof-of-concept experiments that employed vasoactive probes (vasoprobes) based on the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a 37-residue molecule that induces dilation of intracerebral arterioles with a 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) below 10 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCulloch et al., 1986</xref>), approaching the low doses of radiotracers used in nuclear imaging. Importantly, CGRP is a potent endogenous vasodilator in humans, raising prospects that CGRP-based vasoprobes could be applied as non-immunogenic imaging agents in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brain et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howden et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Warren et al., 1992</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design of fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-sensitive vasoactive imaging probes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) FAP-sensitive vasoprobes are constructed by fusing the vasoactive peptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (cyan) via a FAP-cleavable linker to a steric blocking domain (green) that prevents CGRP from acting on its receptor when present.

Following treatment with FAP, the activity of each blocked vasoprobe is increased to levels approaching that of native CGRP, however. The greatest FAP-mediated change in CGRP receptor agonism is observed for construct (5), which contains two tandem cleavage sites and exhibits EC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.7 Â± 0.2 nM and 0.20 Â± 0.01 nM before and after FAP processing, respectivelyâa 34-fold increase in activity.

HEK293 cell lines were generated by stable transfection with constructs encoding human FAP with the fluorescent marker mKate2 (test) or mKate2 only (control) and assessed for enzymatic activity in cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Measurements calibrated with known amounts of FAP indicated activity equivalent to 8.5 Â± 4.6 nM soluble enzyme (mean Â± SD, n = 3), corresponding to an estimated mean of 8.5 pmol FAP per 10<sup>6</sup> test cells. Approximately 3 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> test or control cells were implanted at bilaterally symmetric sites in rat striatum and adapted to their environment over 1 day prior to imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

For the sake of simplicity, the model assumes that hemodynamic signal changes are directly proportional to the activated probe concentration and that enzymatic processing obeys first-order kinetics, as expected from published FAP kinetic constants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edosada et al., 2006</xref>) relevant to FAPVap concentrations used in our experiments. A key parameter in this model is the effective first-order rate constant for product formation from FAPVap, <italic>k</italic>. This rate constant is approximately equal to <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>[FAP]/<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> in the MichaelisâMenten formalism, where <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> are the turnover rate and Michaelis constants, [FAP] is the local enzyme concentration, and the FAPVap concentration is much lower than <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic>, as we expect in our experiments. Realistic parameter choices allow our model to approximate the observed time course of MRI signal change in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, including the slow initiation of MRI responses and protracted increase in image signal that extends past the FAPVap infusion period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This behavior is observed under conditions where the efflux rate is zero for both FAPVap and its CGRP* product. Variation of parameter choices alters the shape of the profile, however; for instance, modeling probe dynamics with 10-fold greater FAP concentration or inclusion of a moderate FAPVap removal rate constant (0.01 s<sup>â1</sup>) leads to a roughly linear increase in CGRP* concentration during infusion, followed by a flat asymptote.</p><p>Fitting of the resulting model to actual data enables estimation of <italic>k</italic> values from our imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Calculations assume a probe infusion rate of 0.11 nM/s, computed based on the infusion rate, FAPVap concentration, and region of interest (ROI) volume used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>. The three time courses corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> were optimally approximated using <italic>k</italic> values ranging from 1.2 Ã 10<sup>â4</sup> to 6.8 Ã 10<sup>â4</sup> s<sup>â1</sup>, hemodynamic response coefficients of 0.5â1.0%/nM, and rate constants for FAPVap and CGRP* removal all below 10<sup>â3</sup> s<sup>â1</sup>.

To detect tumor-associated protease activity, we introduce the FAP-responsive vasoprobe FAPVap, which undergoes a 34-fold increase in activity upon enzymatic cleavage. Using this probe, we demonstrate both spatial localization and pseudo-quantitative characterization of FAP activity over wide fields of view in rodent brains harboring xenografts that display FAP expression comparable to patient-derived tumor cell lines. We also show that the vasoprobe-based contrast mechanism is effective in primates, illustrating the translational applicability of our technology. This study therefore establishes a clinically plausible avenue for brain cancer imaging and provides previously unreported readouts of disease-related enzymatic activity in situ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Soleimany and Bhatia, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The approach presented here exploits the high potency of vasoactive imaging agents and their consequent advantages for noninvasive detection of dilute molecular targets in live subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ohlendorf et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, vasoprobes like FAPVap are activatable and can be imaged at nanomolar concentrations, even though they do not contain radioactive or magnetic components. Previous efforts to map cancer-associated enzymes in vivo have employed radiotracers for nuclear imaging, superparamagnetic particles for <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI, paramagnetic contrast agents for <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>-weighted MRI, and diamagnetic agents for heteronuclear or chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brindle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hingorani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Narunsky et al., 2014</xref>). Among these modalities, the radioactive and superparamagnetic species can both be detected with high sensitivityâat nanomolar or subnanomolar levelsâbut suffer from other limitations. Radiotracers in particular are not activatable, meaning that they give rise to background signal and must undergo pharmacokinetic partitioning in order to report enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holland et al., 2013</xref>). Superparamagnetic particles can undergo activation, but their large sizes inhibit delivery to tissue. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic MRI contrast agents are suitable for a number of elegant target-responsive molecular imaging strategies, but high concentrations of these probes are required for most applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wahsner et al., 2019</xref>); this complicates delivery, incurs potential toxicity, and limits prospects for detection of nanomolar-scale targets.</p><p>Because FAPVap is far more active as an imaging agent after proteolysis, the time courses of contrast induced by FAPVap provide information about FAP enzyme kinetics in vivo. We used this property to compute a map of FAP-catalyzed product formation rates. Our analysis was based on simplifying assumptions that might require refinement in future studies. For instance, assumptions about probe infusion and washout rates could be solidified by explicitly measuring probe concentration time courses using a CGRP derivative or similar peptide-based probe, perhaps using an alternative image contrast mechanism. The assumption of linearity of the hemodynamic contrast signal could be avoided by incorporating CGRP receptor activation characteristics into the data-fitting procedure or by using an exogenous vasodilator like CO<sub>2</sub> to experimentally define the ceiling of hemodynamic contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 1998</xref>). In vivo specificity of the responses could also be more thoroughly probed; here, we used controls in which FAP was absent, but further controls could utilize inhibitors of FAP or of CGRP-mediated hemodynamic responses. CGRP receptor inhibitors could also be employed to block potential side effects of FAPVap-generated CGRP, which can act as a causal factor in migraine attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edvinsson, 2019</xref>). Despite the potential for improvements, the measurements we report here in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> provide readouts that are stable over independent experiments and demonstrate that the xenograft microenvironment permits both qualitative and quantitative vasoactive molecular imaging in the brain.</p><p>In translating FAPVap to larger animal models and eventually to humans, noninvasive brain-wide probe delivery strategies are highly desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lelyveld et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we used an intra-CSF infusion method that permits relatively low injected doses of the contrast agent to spread over wide fields of view inside the rat brain, but not the periphery. This mode of delivery is similar to clinically applied intrathecal injection methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capozza et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fowler et al., 2020</xref>), and with optimization would not require cranial surgery. In the future, even less invasive delivery routes could also be accessible, however, for instance by conjugating FAPVap to bloodâbrain barrier-permeating carrier proteins such as anti-transferrin receptor antibodies and then injecting the conjugates intravascularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pardridge, 2017</xref>). The low concentrations at which vasoprobes act are likely to make them especially amenable to such approaches. Vasoactive sensors like FAPVap thus offer unique opportunities for spatially comprehensive functional evaluation of molecular targets in brain cancer and other neurological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Peptide synthesis and conjugation</title><p>CGRP-like peptides were made by solid-state synthesis at the MIT Koch Institute Biopolymers lab, oxidatively cyclized, and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Injection cannulae were then lowered into the previously implanted cannula guides. The Hamilton syringes were then placed in a remote infuse/withdraw dual syringe pump (PHD 22/2000; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), and 3 ÂµL of cell suspension (~0.3 million cells) was injected over 30 min at a rate of 0.1 ÂµL/min.

Their cages were equipped with a variety of perches and enrichment devices, and they received regular health checks and behavioral assessment from attending veterinarians and researchers.</p><p>For in vivo optical imaging during application of vasoprobe agents, a resealable chamber with an optically clear glass window and ports for drug application was custom-designed and 3D-printed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The circular polycarbonate chamber had a central opening of 5 mm diameter over which a clear glass coverslip (Werner Instruments, Holliston, MA) was placed for optical imaging. Two pairs of silicone O-rings sandwiched the glass coverslip, and a finely threaded polycarbonate O-ring was used to tighten the assembly and prevent any leakage. The chamber was equipped with an inlet and an outlet port, at opposite ends, for controlled fluid circulation at a specified rate via a syringe infusion pump.</p><p>In preparation for the procedure to surgically implant the optical imaging chamber, a single monkey was placed on food restriction overnight. On the day of the surgery, the animal was premedicated with atropine (0.04 mg/kg) and sedated with ketamine (30 mg/kg), both given intramuscularly. Following intubation, anesthesia was induced with 3% sevoflurane and later maintained at 1.5% sevoflurane mixed with O<sub>2</sub>. Sensors and electrodes for continuous recording of heart rate, oxygen saturation, electrocardiograms, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>, and rectal temperature were attached and intravenous (IV) catheter was placed in the saphenous vein for infusion of fluids and drugs during the surgery and recovery period. Once the animal acquired a stable plane of anesthesia, it was placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A thin layer of sterile eye lubricant was applied to protect against corneal drying. A single bolus dose of intravenous dexamethasone (0.4 mg/kg) was provided to guard against brain swelling. The scalp and fascia were removed in layers via blunt dissection to expose the implant site, and craniotomy was performed with a diameter large enough to tightly fit the lower pedestal of the optical chamber, which was then cemented to the skull with C&amp;B Metabond. A small cap covering the optical chamber was held in place with four skull screws custom-designed in-house from MRI-compatible, medical grade PEEK. The fascia and scalp were then sutured around the implant.</p><p>After surgery, the animal was provided with anti-inflammatory pain relief medications and antibiotics as prescribed by the attending veterinary staff. The animal was then allowed to recover and extubated once fully conscious.

Following standard food restriction and premedication protocols, the animal was intubated and anesthetized with 3% sevoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic frame. In preparation for imaging, the area around the optical chamber was cleaned and disinfected with betadine and alcohol scrubs, and a Steri-Drape (3M, St. Paul, MN) with an opening to expose the imaging chamber was placed over the monkeyâs head. The optical chamber cover was removed, and the area was flushed with sterile prewarmed saline to remove any tissue and debris. The optical window was replaced by fresh sterile glass coverslip and sealed tightly after carefully removing any air bubbles.

Illumination was regulated using a xenon arc lamp. A green band-pass filter (550 Â± 25 nm) was used to provide optimal vascular contrast. A 100 nM CGRP (human Î±-CGRP, Sigma-Aldrich) solution was prepared in aCSF. To establish imaging baselines, aCSF alone was continuously infused (30 ÂµL/min) through the inlet port for 5 min prior to CGRP infusion; images were acquired continuously throughout. Fluid was extracted from the imaging chamber through the outlet port at an equal rate in order to maintain a constant pressure. At the end of the baseline period, the CGRP solution was infused at a rate of 30 ÂµL/min.</p><p>Data were temporally down-sampled to 1 Hz and processed further in MATLAB.

The tube was fitted to span the distance from the mouth to the manubrium sternum. Prior to intubation, a single spray of the topical anesthetic Cetacaine (Cetylite Industries, Pennsauken, NJ) was delivered to the glottis to reduce the incidence of laryngospasm. The ET was coated with lidocaine hydrochloride oral topical solution and inserted into the trachea using a stylet and laryngoscope (size 1 Macintosh blade). Successful ET placement was determined by observing motion of hairs held at the opening of the ET connector, condensation on a mirror, and expansion/contraction of a latex covering placed at the end of the ET connector. The cuff on the ET was then inflated with air. The ET was secured with a velcro strap customized with a 15 mm opening that fit around the ET connector and wrapped around the head.</p><p>Anesthesia was reduced to 2.5% sevoflurane and an IV catheter was placed in the saphenous vein.

The IV line was then used to deliver lactated Ringerâs solution (7.5 mL/kg/hr). A one-time dose of anticholinergic glycopyrrolate (0.004 mg/kg IM) was provided at the same time. The animal was placed on mechanical ventilation (SAR-830 Series Small Animal Ventilator, CWE, Inc) and anesthesia was further reduced to 2% sevoflurane in oxygen (0.5â0.6 L O<sub>2</sub>/min), while the animal was positioned in a custom cradle incorporating ear bars and head restraint.</p><p>In preparation for infusion of vasoprobe and control solutions during MRI, the previously implanted chamber for optical imaging was gently opened by removing the glass cover slip. A 22G Teflon cannula was inserted in the cortex in the radial direction to a depth of 6 mm below cortical surface. The cannula was connected to the infusion pump via polyvinyl tubing (3 mm internal diameter). A similar cannula was placed in a different location, 5 mm away and at a depth of 10 mm, for infusion of aCSF control solution via a small craniotomy. Sevoflurane was then reduced in three incremental steps over 30 min to achieve 0.6% (in balance of oxygen) expired sevoflurane level, measured with a SurgiVet V9004 Capnograph (Smiths Medical, St. Paul, MN). Ventilation was maintained at a rate between 34 and 39 breaths per minute with an inspiration time of 0.5 s and expiration duration of 1.1 s. Breathing rate and end-tidal anesthetic were continuously monitored throughout subsequent imaging, and animal core temperature was maintained at approximately 37Â°C using a heating blanket.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wafik El-Deiry as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) in vivo experiments presented utilize HEK293 cells and not GBM tumor cells. In addition, FAP expression is driven by an exogenous transgene. Besides the practicality of this approach, the biological significance of the experimental design is a weakness since the claim is made that the FAP sensor can detect &quot;tumor associated enzyme activity&quot;. A careful survey of patient derived samples should be conducted to provide confidence that FAPVap can detect a majority of GBM. In addition, a FAP positive tumor model should be investigated.</p><p>2) There is an analysis of FAP catalysis rate, k, based on time course imaging in Figure 3H, however a range of catalysis rates were observed. From this reviewer's knowledge, for a known substrate and protease, the catalysis rate would be expected to be constant. An explanation of the observations made in Figure 3H would be useful.</p><p>3) While the total amount of FAP per cell was measured, it would be useful if it was put in the context of physiologically-relevant values.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Critique:</p><p>The described findings are an extension of their published work that first described the FAP sensor. In the current paper, the FAP sensor is optimized and used in rodent models to demonstrate that the sensor activation can be detected through local changes in hemodynamic image contrast using T2 and T2* MRI.

The safety of the FAPVap should be discussed since the released CGRP in FAP positive tissues may lead to unintended pathophysiology.</p><p>(5) The novelty of the described studies is in the finding that MRI can be used to detect FAP catalytic activity using MRI. This is impressive, as are the in vitro studies that quantitatively evaluate the sensitivity of the FAPVap sensor. However, in vivo titration experiments would be informative to get a better understanding of the sensitivity of the FAPVap when MRI is used as a readout in the brain.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The flow of Figure 1 would be easier to understand if panel D appeared before panel C.</p><p>There is an analysis of FAP catalysis rate, k, based on time course imaging in Figure 3H, however a range of catalysis rates were observed.

Our results show that U138 cells activate the FAPVap probe to an extent similar to the FAP-expressing cell line we used for our in vivo experiments. Both cell types display FAP activity at levels corresponding to approximately 1 pg FAP/cell. We have also surveyed a range of patient-derived glioma cell lines discussed in the literature; the cells we studied display FAP activity in an intermediate range, with a majority of glioma lines surpassing U138 cells in activity, while some cell lines display lower FAP levels. This further supports plausibility of our approach for clinically relevant imaging of FAP activity in brain cancer. Our new data is presented in a revised version of Figure 4, with corresponding results text on p. 9, as well as further textual adjustments elsewhere in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is an analysis of FAP catalysis rate, k, based on time course imaging in Figure 3H, however a range of catalysis rates were observed.

In this regard, <italic>k</italic> differs from the <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> defined in standard Michaelis-Menten nomenclature, which is indeed a constant independent of enzyme concentration. Instead, the product formation rate constant we utilize is approximately equal to <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>[FAP]/<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> in the Michaelis-Menten formalism, where <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> are the turnover rate and Michaelis constants and [FAP] is the local enzyme concentration. This equivalence arises from the fact that FAPVap concentrations in our experiments (&lt; 100 nM) are much lower than reported FAP <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values for similar substrates (&gt; 10 ÂµM). Revised text clarifying these points has been added on p. 6 and 21. In addition, the kinetic model incorporating <italic>k</italic> is fully described by Equations 1-2 on p. 21 and diagrammed in Figure 2D. On pp. 8-9 of the revised paper, we further clarify with regard to Figure 3H that variation in <italic>k</italic> values is expected to arise primarily from variations in FAP concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While the total amount of FAP per cell was measured, it would be useful if it was put in the context of physiologically-relevant values.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised paper includes a direct comparison of enzymatic activity levels measured using FAPVap from purified FAP, FAP-expressing HEK cells, and the U138 human glioma cell line (new Figure 4A,B). Levels of FAP activity on both recombinant and tumor-derived cells are equivalent to roughly 1 pg FAP/cell. As also noted above, FAP expression by these cells is comparable to reported FAP expression on a number glioma cell lines, indicating its physiological relevance (see relevant text on p. 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Critique:</p><p>The described findings are an extension of their published work that first described the FAP sensor.

This is impressive, as are the in vitro studies that quantitatively evaluate the sensitivity of the FAPVap sensor. However, in vivo titration experiments would be informative to get a better understanding of the sensitivity of the FAPVap when MRI is used as a readout in the brain.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised paper, we have added a sensitivity analysis that utilizes data from the experiments of Figure 4, which cover a range of effective FAP levels observed over the ROIs we investigated. The analysis, shown in the new Figure 3âfigure supplement 2 and discussed on pp. 8-9, indicates that FAP concentrations of about 13 nM or more could be detectable in vivo at a single voxel level in individual animals according to the methods and data of Figure 4. What this concentration corresponds to in terms of number of FAP-expressing cells depends on the spatial distribution and FAP activity levels exhibited by the cells in question, but our in vitro data suggest that a density of 10<sup>3</sup> FAP-positive cells/ÂµL displays activity corresponding to ~10 nM FAP (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The flow of Figure 1 would be easier to understand if panel D appeared before panel C.</p></disp-quote><p>Data in the style of panel 1C is the basis for determining EC<sub>50</sub> values as presented in panel 1D, so we consider it more natural to keep the order as is.

From this reviewer's knowledge, for a known substrate and protease, the catalysis rate would be expected to be constant. An explanation of the observations made in Figure 3H would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new text to better explain the biochemical meaning of <italic>k</italic>, which functions as an effective first order rate constant for FAP-mediated product formation from FAPVap. In this regard, <italic>k</italic> differs from the <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> defined in standard Michaelis-Menten nomenclature, which is indeed a constant independent of enzyme concentration. Instead, the product formation rate constant we utilize is approximately equal to <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>[FAP]/<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> in the Michaelis-Menten formalism, where <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> are the turnover rate and Michaelis constants and [FAP] is the local enzyme concentration. This equivalence arises from the fact that FAPVap concentrations in our experiments (&lt; 100 nM) are much lower than reported FAP <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values for similar substrates (&gt; 10 ÂµM). Revised text clarifying these points has been added on p. 6 and 21. In addition, the kinetic model incorporating <italic>k</italic> is fully described by Equations 1-2 (p. 21) and diagrammed in Figure 2D. On pp. 8-9 of the revised paper, we further clarify with regard to Figure 3H that variation in <italic>k</italic> values is expected to arise primarily from differences in FAP local concentrations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please include c<sub>out</sub> as a parameter in the model in Figure 2D.

The dashed lines in Figure 2E have been reformatted to make them more distinct from the dotted lines. The apparent noise in Figure 3D increases because of signal drift trends that differ among subjects and thus increase the standard error of the mean value over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be useful if the plots in Figure 3G were mapped to the specific voxels they represent.</p><p>While the total amount of FAP per cell was measured, it would be useful if it was put in the context of physiologically-relevant values.</p></disp-quote><p>The plots in Figure 3G represent voxels evenly spaced over the white box in Figure 3F; this is now noted in the caption. The new data in Figure 4A compare FAP activity levels between the FAP-expressing HEK cells we used for in vivo experiments and the human-derived glioma cell line U138. The levels are the same and according to the standard curve of Figure 4B correspond to roughly 1 pg FAP/cell. In addition to these new data, we include a new sensitivity analysis of the data in Figure 3. The new analysis, presented in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2 and discussed on pp. 8-9, characterizes the concentration of FAP we would expect to be able to detect at a single voxel and single animal level using current methods. The resulting value of ~10 nM corresponds to a FAP-positive cell density of about 10<sup>3</sup> cells/ÂµL, according to data of Figure 2âfigure supplement 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
