This study explores how neurobiological units of analysis of cognitive abilities—multimodal neuroimaging and polygenic scores (PGS)—represent this connection. Using data from over 11,000 children (ages 9–10) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we applied multivariate models to predict cognitive abilities from mental health, neuroimaging, PGS, and environmental factors. Neuroimaging included 45 MRI-derived features (e.g. task/resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, diffusion imaging). Environmental factors encompassed socio-demographics (e.g. parental income/education), lifestyle (e.g. sleep, extracurricular activities), and developmental adverse events (e.g. parental use of alcohol/tobacco, pregnancy complications). Cognitive abilities were predicted by mental health (r = 0.36), neuroimaging (r = 0.54), PGS (r = 0.25), and environmental factors (r = 0.49). Commonality analyses showed that neuroimaging (66%) and PGS (21%) explained most of the cognitive–mental health link. Environmental factors accounted for 63% of the cognitive–mental health link, with neuroimaging and PGS explaining 58% and 21% of this environmental contribution, respectively. These patterns remained consistent over two years. Findings highlight the importance of neurobiological units of analysis for cognitive abilities in understanding the cognitive–mental health connection and its overlap with environmental factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Research Domain Criteria</kwd><kwd>cognitive abilities</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>neuroimaging</kwd><kwd>polygenic scores</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00zbf3d93</institution-id><institution>Health Research Council of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21/618</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pat</surname><given-names>Narun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00zbf3d93</institution-id><institution>Health Research Council of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24/838</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pat</surname><given-names>Narun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01jjkzv49</institution-id><institution>Neurological Foundation of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2350 PRG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pat</surname><given-names>Narun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01jmxt844</institution-id><institution>University of Otago</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pat</surname><given-names>Narun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multimodal neuroimaging explained 66% of the cognitive–mental health link in children, outperforming polygenic scores (21%), and accounted for 58% of the environmental contribution to this relationship.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cognitive abilities across various domains, such as attention, working memory, declarative memory, verbal fluency, and cognitive control, are often altered in several psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Millan et al., 2012</xref>). This is evident in recent meta-analyses of case-control studies involving patients with mood and anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramovitch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">East-Richard et al., 2020</xref>). Beyond typical case-control studies, the association between cognitive abilities and mental health is also observed when mental health varies from normal to abnormal in normative samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Morris et al., 2022</xref>). For instance, our study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Pat et al., 2022a</xref> found an association between cognitive abilities and mental health in a relatively large, non-referred sample of 9–10 year-old children from the ABCD study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Casey et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we measured cognitive abilities using behavioural performance across cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Luciana et al., 2018</xref>) while measuring mental health using a broad range of emotional and behavioural problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Achenbach et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, cognitive abilities are frequently considered crucial for understanding mental health issues throughout life, beginning in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramovitch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hankin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Morris and Cuthbert, 2012</xref>).</p><p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Insel et al., 2010</xref>), cognitive abilities should be investigated not only behaviourally but also neurobiologically, from the brain to genes. It remains unclear to what extent the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health is represented in part by different neurobiological units of analysis -- such as neural and genetic levels measured by multimodal neuroimaging and polygenic scores (PGS). To fully comprehend the role of neurobiology in the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health, we must also consider how these neurobiological units capture variations due to environmental factors, such as socio-demographics, lifestyles, and childhood developmental adverse events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Morris et al., 2022</xref>). Our study investigated the extent to which (a) environmental factors explain the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health, and (b) cognitive abilities at the neural and genetic levels capture these associations due to environmental factors. Specifically, we conducted these investigations in a large normative group of children from the ABCD study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Casey et al., 2018</xref>). We chose to examine children because, while their emotional and behavioural problems might not meet full diagnostic criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kessler et al., 2007</xref>), issues at a young age often forecast adult psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Reef et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Roza et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, the associations among different emotional and behavioural problems in children reflect transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Michelini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Pat et al., 2022a</xref>), making children an appropriate population to study the transdiagnostic aetiology of mental health, especially within a framework that emphasises normative variation from normal to abnormal, such as the RDoC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Morris et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Recently, several neuroscientists have developed predictive models using neuroimaging data from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of various modalities in the so-called Brain-Wide Association Studies (BWAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Marek et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Sui et al., 2020</xref>). BWAS aims to create models from MRI data that can accurately predict behavioural phenotypes in participants not included in the model-building process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dadi et al., 2021</xref>). In one of the most extensive BWAS benchmarks to date, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Marek et al., 2022</xref> concluded, ‘More robust BWAS effects were detected for functional MRI (versus structural), cognitive tests (versus mental health questionnaires), and multivariate methods (versus univariate).’ This benchmark has significant implications for using neuroimaging as a neural unit of analysis for cognitive abilities. First, while current BWAS may not be robust enough to predict mental health directly, it is more suitable for predicting cognitive abilities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Zhi et al., 2024</xref> for a similar conclusion). This aligns with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, which emphasises neurobiological units of analysis for <italic>functional domains</italic>, such as cognitive abilities, rather than mental health itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cuthbert and Insel, 2013</xref>). RDoC’s functional domains capture basic human functioning and include cognitive abilities along with negative/positive valence, arousal, and regulation, and social and sensory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Morris et al., 2022</xref>). Accordingly, the current study conducted BWAS to capture cognitive abilities rather than mental health.</p><p>The second implication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Marek et al., 2022</xref> benchmark is the support it provides for using multivariate algorithms, which draw MRI information simultaneously across regions/voxels, over massively univariate algorithms that draw data from one area/voxel at a time. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Marek et al., 2022</xref> study, which focused on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), our recent study on task-fMRI also found that multivariate algorithms performed superiorly, up to several folds, in predicting cognitive abilities compared to massively univariate algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Pat et al., 2023</xref>). The third implication is that the performance of neuroimaging in predicting cognitive abilities depends on MRI modalities. Previous research has used brain MRI data of different modalities to predict cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Vieira et al., 2022</xref>). For instance, many studies have used rs-fMRI, which reflects functional connectivity between regions during rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Dubois et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Keller et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rasero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Sripada et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Sripada et al., 2021</xref>). Others have utilised structural MRI (sMRI), which reflects anatomical morphology based on thickness, area, and volume in cortical/subcortical areas, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which reflects diffusion distribution within white matter tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Mihalik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rasero et al., 2021</xref>). While less common, task-fMRI, which reflects blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity relevant to each task condition, shows relatively good predictive performance, especially from specific contrasts, such as the 2-Back vs 0-Back from the N-Back working-memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barch et al., 2013</xref>) nor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Makowski et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Pat et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pat et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Sripada et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Tetereva et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>). A recent meta-analysis estimated the performance of multivariate methods in predicting cognitive abilities from MRI of different modalities at around an out-of-sample <italic>r</italic> of 0.42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Vieira et al., 2022</xref>). However, we and others found that this predictive performance could be further boosted by drawing information across different MRI modalities, rather than relying on only one modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pat et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rasero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Tetereva et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Tetereva and Pat, 2024</xref>). Therefore, the current study used opportunistic stacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Engemann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pat et al., 2022b</xref>). This multivariate modelling technique allowed us to combine information across MRI modalities with the added benefit of handling missing values. With opportunistic stacking, we created a ‘proxy’ measure of cognitive abilities (i.e. predicted value from the model) at the neural unit of analysis using multimodal neuroimaging.</p><p>Geneticists, like neuroscientists, have conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to explore the links between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and various behavioural phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bogdan et al., 2018</xref>). Similar to BWAS, GWAS can develop predictive models from genetic profiles, resulting in polygenic scores (PGS) that predict behavioural phenotypes in participants not included in the model-building process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). Several large-scale GWAS on cognitive abilities have been conducted, with some studies involving over 250,000 participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Davies et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Savage et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, researchers have used these large-scale GWAS to compute PGS for cognitive abilities and applied these scores to predict cognitive abilities in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allegrini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pat et al., 2022b</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allegrini et al., 2019</xref> found that PGS based on Savage et al.’s (2018) GWAS accounted for approximately 5.3% of the variance in cognitive abilities among 12-year-old children. The current study adopted this approach with children of a similar age in the ABCD study, creating a proxy measure of cognitive abilities at the genetic unit of analysis using PGS.</p><p>Environmental factors, broadly defined, significantly influence cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Duyme et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Pietschnig and Voracek, 2015</xref>). A classic example is the Flynn Effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Flynn, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Flynn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Rundquist, 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Williams, 2013</xref>), which describes the observed rise in cognitive abilities, as measured by various cognitive tasks, across generations in the general population over time, particularly in high-income countries during the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Pietschnig and Voracek, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Trahan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wongupparaj et al., 2017</xref>). Experts attribute the Flynn Effect to environmental factors such as improved living standards and better education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Rindermann et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, researchers have used multivariate algorithms to create proxy measures of cognitive abilities in children based on environmental factors, similar to approaches used in neuroimaging and polygenic scores (PGS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Kirlic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pat et al., 2022b</xref>). These environmental factors often include socio-demographic variables (e.g., parental income/education, area deprivation index, parental marital status), lifestyle factors (e.g. screen/video game use, extracurricular activities), and developmental adverse events (e.g. parental use of alcohol/tobacco before and after pregnancy, birth complications). Studies, including ours, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Kirlic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pat et al., 2022b</xref> have applied multivariate algorithms to predict cognitive abilities from various environmental factors in the ABCD study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Casey et al., 2018</xref>). In these predictive models, parental income/education, area deprivation index, and extracurricular activities are particularly important predictors of cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Kirlic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pat et al., 2022b</xref>). Following this approach, the current study created another proxy measure of cognitive abilities based on socio-demographics, lifestyles, and developmental adverse events.</p><p>In this study, inspired by RDoC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Insel et al., 2010</xref>), we (a) focused on cognitive abilities as a functional domain, (b) created predictive models to capture the continuous individual variation (as opposed to distinct categories) in cognitive abilities, (c) computed two neurobiological units of analysis of cognitive abilities: multimodal neuroimaging and PGS, and (d) investigated the potential contributions of environmental factors. To operationalise cognitive abilities, we estimated a latent variable representing behavioural performance across various cognitive tasks, commonly referred to as general cognitive ability or the g-factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Deary, 2012</xref>). The g-factor was computed from various cognitive tasks pertinent to RDoC constructs, including attention, working memory, declarative memory, language, and cognitive control. However, using the g-factor to operationalise cognitive abilities caused this study to diverge from the original conceptualisation of RDoC, which emphasises studying separate constructs within cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Morris et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Morris and Cuthbert, 2012</xref>). Recent studies suggest that including a general factor, such as the g-factor, in the model, rather than treating each construct separately, improved model fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Quah et al., 2025</xref>). The g-factor in children is also longitudinally stable and can forecast future health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Calvin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Deary et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, our previous research found that neuroimaging predicts the g-factor more accurately than predicting performance from separate individual cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Pat et al., 2023</xref>). Accordingly, we decided to conduct predictive models on the g-factor while keeping the RDoC’s holistic, neurobiological, and basic-functioning characteristics.</p><p>Using the ABCD study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Casey et al., 2018</xref>), we first developed predictive models to estimate the cognitive abilities of unseen children based on their mental health. These models enabled us to quantify the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health, thereby creating a proxy measure of cognitive abilities derived from mental health data. The mental health variables included children’s emotional and behavioural problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Achenbach et al., 2017</xref>) and temperaments, such as behavioural inhibition/activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Carver and White, 1994</xref>) and impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Zapolski et al., 2010</xref>). These temperaments are linked to externalising and internalising aspects of mental health and are associated with disorders like depression, anxiety, and substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Carver and Johnson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Johnson et al., 2003</xref>). Next, we built predictive models of cognitive abilities using neuroimaging, polygenic scores (PGS), and socio-demographic, lifestyle, and developmental adverse event data, resulting in various proxy measures of cognitive abilities. For neuroimaging, we included 45 types of brain MRI data from task-fMRI, rs-fMRI, sMRI, and DTI. For PGS, we used three definitions of cognitive abilities based on previous large-scale GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Davies et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Savage et al., 2018</xref>). For socio-demographic, lifestyle, and developmental adverse events, we included 44 features, covering variables such as parental income/education, screen use, and birth/pregnancy complications. Finally, we conducted a series of commonality analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Nimon et al., 2008</xref>) using these proxy measures of cognitive abilities to address three specific questions. First, we examined the extent to which the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health was represented in part by cognitive abilities at the neural and genetic levels, as measured by multimodal neuroimaging and PGS, respectively. Second, we assessed the extent to which this relationship was partly explained by environmental factors, as measured by socio-demographic, lifestyle, and developmental adverse events. Third, we tested whether the two neurobiological units of analysis for cognitive abilities, measured by multimodal neuroimaging and PGS, could account for the variance due to environmental factors. To ensure the stability of our results, we repeated the analyses at two time points (ages 9–10 and 11–12).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Predictive modelling</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Predicting cognitive abilities from mental health</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> illustrate the predictive performance of the Partial Least Square (PLS) models in predicting cognitive abilities from mental health features.

cognitive abilities and mental health is represented in part by cognitive abilities at the neural and genetic levels of analysis. We began by quantifying the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health, finding a medium-sized out-of-sample correlation of approximately <italic>r</italic>=0.36. This relationship was shared with neuroimaging (66% at baseline) and PGS (21% at baseline), based on two separate sets of commonality analyses. This suggests the significant roles of these two neurobiological units of analysis in shaping the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Morris and Cuthbert, 2012</xref>). We also found that the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health was partly shared with environmental factors, as measured by socio-demographics, lifestyles, and developmental adverse events (63% at baseline). In another set of commonality analysis, this variance due to socio-demographics, lifestyles, and developmental adverse events was explained by neuroimaging and PGS at 58% and 21%, respectively, at baseline. Accordingly, the neurobiological units of analysis for cognitive abilities captured the environmental factors, consistent with RDoC’s viewpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Morris et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, this pattern of results remained stable over two years in early adolescence.</p><p>Our predictive modelling revealed a medium-sized predictive relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health. This finding aligns with recent meta-analyses of case-control studies that link cognitive abilities and mental disorders across various psychiatric conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramovitch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">East-Richard et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike previous studies, we estimated the predictive, out-of-sample relationship between cognitive abilities and mental disorders in a large normative sample of children. Although our predictive models, like other cross-sectional models, cannot determine the directionality of the effects, the strength of the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health estimated here should be more robust than when calculated using the same sample as the model itself, known as in-sample prediction/association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Marek et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Yarkoni and Westfall, 2017</xref>). Examining the PLS loadings of our predictive models revealed that the relationship was driven by various aspects of mental health, including thought and externalising symptoms, as well as motivation. This suggests that there are multiple pathways—encompassing a broad range of emotional and behavioural problems and temperaments—through which cognitive abilities and mental health are linked.</p><p>Our predictive modelling created proxy measures of cognitive abilities based on two neurobiological units of analysis: neuroimaging and PGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Morris and Cuthbert, 2012</xref>). For neuroimaging, inspired by recent BWAS benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Engemann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Marek et al., 2022</xref>), we used a multivariate modelling technique called opportunistic stacking, which integrates information across various MRI features and modalities. Combining 45 sets of neuroimaging features resulted in relatively high predictive performance (out-of-sample <italic>r</italic>=0.54 at baseline), compared to using any single set. This finding aligns with previous research that pooled multiple neuroimaging modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Engemann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rasero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Tetereva et al., 2022</xref>). This level of predictive performance is numerically higher than that found in a recent meta-analysis, which mainly included studies using only one set of neuroimaging features, with an <italic>r</italic> of 0.42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Vieira et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, this performance level in predicting cognitive abilities is nearly the same as our previous attempt using a similar stacking technique to integrate MRI modalities in young adult samples from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Van Essen et al., 2013</xref>), which achieved an out-of-sample <italic>r</italic>=0.57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Tetereva et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, in the current study, the top contributing set of neuroimaging features, the 2-Back vs. 0-Back task fMRI, was consistent with previous studies using the HCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Sripada et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Tetereva et al., 2022</xref>). Altogether, this demonstrates the robustness of our proxy measure of cognitive abilities based on multimodal neuroimaging. In addition to predictive performance, opportunistic stacking offers the added benefit of handling missing values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Engemann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pat et al., 2022b</xref>), allowing us to retain data from 10,754 participants who completed the cognitive tasks at baseline and has at least one set of neuroimaging features. Consequently, with opportunistic stacking, we were more likely to retain MRI data from participants with higher fMRI noise, such as those with socioeconomic disadvantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cosgrove et al., 2022</xref>). More importantly, we demonstrated that the proxy measure based on multimodal neuroimaging explained the majority of the variance in the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health, underscoring its significant role as a neurobiological unit of analysis for cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Morris and Cuthbert, 2012</xref>).</p><p>For PGS, we created a proxy measure based on three large-scale GWAS on cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Davies et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Savage et al., 2018</xref>). Using PGS resulted in a numerically weaker predictive performance (out-of-sample <italic>r</italic>=0.25 at baseline) compared to multimodal neuroimaging. However, this predictive strength is still comparable to previous research. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allegrini et al., 2019</xref> used a different cohort of children and found R²=0.053 when applying PGS based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Savage et al., 2018</xref> to predict the cognitive abilities of 12-year-old children. Given that PGS based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Savage et al., 2018</xref> also drove the prediction in the current study, as seen in its feature importance, this similar level of predictive performance between <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allegrini et al., 2019</xref> and our study suggests consistency in the predictive performance of PGS. Despite this level of performance, PGS was able to explain some variance (21% at baseline) in the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health, indicating some capacity of PGS as a neurobiological unit of analysis for cognitive abilities.</p><p>There are multiple potential reasons why PGS performed much poorer than multimodal neuroimaging. First, unlike genes, the brain changes throughout development and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bethlehem et al., 2022</xref>), and so do cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hartshorne and Germine, 2015</xref>). This dynamic nature might make multimodal neuroimaging a better tool for tracing cognitive abilities. Second, there might be a mismatch in the age of participants between the original GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Davies et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Savage et al., 2018</xref>) and the current study. While the original GWAS conducted meta-analyses pooling data from participants aged 5–102, these studies might draw more heavily from older cohorts with large participant numbers, such as the UK Biobank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Sudlow et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allegrini et al., 2019</xref> also demonstrated that PGS performs better in predicting cognitive abilities in older children (aged 16) compared to younger ones (aged 12). Therefore, a more child-specific PGS might be needed to explain more variance in children. Thirdly, the PGS used here included only common SNPs and not rare variants. Recent studies using whole-genome sequence data have found that rare variants contribute to the heritability of complex traits, such as height and body mass index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Wainschtein et al., 2022</xref>). Given that cognitive abilities are also complex traits, future studies might need to examine if including rare variants can improve the predictive performance of PGS.</p><p>Similarly, our predictive modelling created proxy measures of cognitive abilities for environmental factors based on socio-demographics, lifestyles, and developmental adverse events. In line with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Kirlic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pat et al., 2022b</xref>), we could predict unseen children’s cognitive abilities based on their socio-demographics, lifestyles, and developmental adverse events with a medium-to-high out-of-sample <italic>r</italic>=0.49 (at baseline). This prediction was driven more strongly by socio-demographics (e.g. parent’s income and education, neighbourhood safety, area deprivation, single parenting), somewhat weaker by lifestyles (e.g. extracurricular activities, sleep, screen time, video gaming, mature movie watching, and parental monitoring), and much weaker by developmental adverse events (e.g. pregnancy complications). Importantly, proxy measures based on socio-demographics, lifestyles, and developmental adverse events captured a large proportion of the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health. Furthermore, this variance captured by socio-demographics, lifestyles, and developmental adverse events overlapped mainly with the neurobiological proxy measures. This reiterates RDoC’s central tenet that understanding the neurobiology of a functional domain, such as cognitive abilities, could help us understand the extent to which environments influence mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cuthbert and Insel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Insel et al., 2010</xref>). More importantly, all the results regarding neuroimaging, PGS, and socio-demographics, lifestyles, and developmental adverse events were reliable across two years during a sensitive period for adolescents.</p><p>This study has several limitations that might affect its generalisability. Firstly, the range of mental health variables was not exhaustive. While we covered various emotional and behavioural problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Achenbach et al., 2017</xref>) and temperaments, including behavioural inhibition/activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Carver and White, 1994</xref>) and impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Zapolski et al., 2010</xref>), we may still miss other critical mental health variables, such as psychotic-like experiences, eating disorder symptoms, and mania. Similarly, our ABCD samples were young and community-based, likely limiting the severity of their psychopathological issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kessler et al., 2007</xref>). Future work needs to test if the results found here are generalisable to adults and participants with stronger severity. Next, for cognitive abilities, while the six cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Luciana et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Thompson et al., 2019</xref>) covered most of the RDoC cognitive abilities/systems constructs, we still missed variability in some domains, such as perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Morris and Cuthbert, 2012</xref>). Additionally, several children (3274) did not complete all six cognitive tasks at follow-up, which might create a discrepancy between baseline and follow-up samples. However, the differences in social demographics, lifestyles, and developmental adverse events between participants who provided cognitive scores in the follow-up were minimal (Cohen’s d ranging from 0.007 to 0.092, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12">Table 12</xref>). Moreover, given that we found a similar pattern of predictive performance across the two time points, we believe excluding the children who did not complete the cognitive tasks at follow-up should not alter our conclusions.</p><table-wrap id="table12" position="float"><label>Table 12.</label><caption><title>The differences in social demographics, lifestyles, and developmental adverse events between

based on their relevance to cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Casey et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible to obtain higher predictive performance based on other fMRI tasks. For all analyses involving PGS, we limited our participants to children of European ancestry due to the lack of summary statistics from well-powered GWAS for cognitive abilities in non-European participants. This prevented us from fully leveraging the diverse samples in the ABCD study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Garavan et al., 2018</xref>). Future GWAS work with more diverse samples is needed to ensure equity and fairness in developing neurobiological units of analysis for cognitive abilities. Lastly, we relied on 44 variables of socio-demographics, lifestyles, and developmental adverse events included in the study, which might have missed some variables relevant to cognitive abilities (e.g. nutrition). The ABCD study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Casey et al., 2018</xref>) is ongoing, and future data might address some of these limitations.</p><p>Overall, aligning with the RDoC perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Morris and Cuthbert, 2012</xref>), our findings support the use of neurobiological units of analysis for cognitive abilities, as assessed through multimodal neuroimaging and Polygenic Scores (PGS). These measures explain (a) the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health and (b) the variance in this cognitive-ability-and-mental-health relationship attributable to environmental factors. Our results emphasise the importance of considering both neurobiology and environmental factors, such as socio-demographics, lifestyles, and adverse childhood events, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the aetiology of mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Insel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Morris et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>The ABCD study</title><p>We used data from the AABCD Study Curated Annual Release 5.1 (DOI:10.15154/z563-zd24) from two time points. The baseline included data from 11,868 children (5677 females and 3 others, aged 9–10 years), while the two-year follow-up included data from the same children two years later (10,908 children, 5181 females and 3 others). Although the ABCD collected data from 22 sites across the United States, we excluded data from Site 22 since this site only provided data from 35 children at baseline and none at follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Garavan et al., 2018</xref>). We also excluded 69 children based on the Snellen Vision Screener (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Luciana et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Snellen, 1862</xref>). These children either could not read any line on the chart, could only read the largest line, or could read up to the fourth line clearly but had difficulty reading stimuli on an iPad used for administering cognitive tasks (explained below).

The first task was Picture Vocabulary, which measured language comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Gershon et al., 2014</xref>). The second task was Oral Reading Recognition, which measured language decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bleck et al., 2013</xref>). The third task was Flanker, which measured conflict monitoring and inhibitory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Eriksen and Eriksen, 1974</xref>).

The fifth task was Picture Sequence Memory, which measured episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>). The sixth task was Rey-Auditory Verbal Learning, which measured memory recall after distraction and a short delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Daniel and Wahlstrom, 2014</xref>). Rey-Auditory Verbal Learning was sourced from Pearson Assessment, while the other five cognitive tasks were from the NIH Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bleck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Luciana et al., 2018</xref>). The ABCD study administered the Dimensional Change Card Sort and List Sorting Working Memory tasks from the NIH Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bleck et al., 2013</xref>) only at baseline, not at the two-year follow-up (see DOI: 10.15154/z563-zd24). Consequently, these two tasks were not analysed in the current study. Additionally, 3,274 children at follow-up did not complete some of these tasks and were therefore excluded from the follow-up data analysis.</p><p>We operationalised individual differences in cognitive abilities across the six cognitive tasks as a factor score of a latent variable, the ‘g-factor.’ To estimate this factor score, we fit the standardised performance of the six cognitive tasks to a second-order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of a ‘g-factor’ model, similar to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Pat et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pat et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Thompson et al., 2019</xref>). In this CFA, we treated the g-factor as the second-order latent variable that underpinned three first-order latent variables, each with two manifest variables: (1) ‘language,’ underlying Picture Vocabulary and Oral Reading Recognition, (2) ‘mental flexibility,’ underlying Flanker and Pattern Comparison Processing, and (3) ‘memory recall,’ underlying Picture Sequence Memory and Rey-Auditory Verbal Learning.</p><p>We fixed the variance of the latent factors to one and applied the Maximum Likelihood with Robust standard errors (MLR) approach with Huber-White standard errors and scaled test statistics. To provide information about the internal consistency of the g-factor, we calculated OmegaL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Jorgensen et al., 2022</xref>). We used the <italic>lavaan</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Rosseel, 2012</xref>) (version 0.6–15), <italic>semTools</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Jorgensen et al., 2022</xref>), and <italic>semPlots</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Epskamp, 2015</xref>) packages for this CFA of cognitive abilities.</p><p>We found the second-order ‘g-factor’ model to fit cognitive abilities well across the six cognitive tasks. This is evidenced by several indices if we apply the model to the whole baseline data: scaled and robust CFI (0.994), TLI (0.986), RMSEA (0.031, 90% CI [0.024-0.037]), robust SRMR (0.013), and OmegaL2 (0.78). See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> for the standardised weights of this CFA model.

The first set involved parental reports of children’s emotional and behavioural problems, as measured by the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Achenbach et al., 2017</xref>). We used eight summary scores: anxious/depressed, withdrawn, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, rule-breaking behaviours, and aggressive behaviours. For CBCL, caretakers rated each item as 0=not true (as far as you know), 1=somewhat or sometimes true, and 2=very true or often true. The third set assessed children’s temperaments, conceptualised as risk factors for mental issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Johnson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Whiteside and Lynam, 2003</xref>), using the Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, and Positive Urgency (UPPS-P) Impulsive Behaviour Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Zapolski et al., 2010</xref>) and the Behavioural Inhibition System/Behavioural Activation System (BIS/BAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Carver and White, 1994</xref>).

We organized the brain-MRI data into 45 sets of neuroimaging features, covering task-fMRI (including ENBack, stop signal (SST), and monetary incentive delay (MID) tasks), resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The ABCD provided details on MRI acquisition and image processing elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Hagler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Yang and Jernigan, 2023</xref>).</p><p>The ABCD study provided recommended exclusion criteria for neuroimaging data based on automated and manual quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Yang and Jernigan, 2023</xref>). Specifically, the study created an exclusion flag for each neuroimaging feature (with the prefix ‘imgincl’ in the ‘abcd_imgincl01’ table) based on criteria involving image quality, MR neurological screening, behavioural performance, and the number of repetition times (TRs), among others. We removed the entire set of neuroimaging features from each participant if any of its features were flagged or missing. We also detected outliers with over three interquartile ranges from the nearest quartile for each neuroimaging feature. We excluded a particular set of neuroimaging features from each participant when this set had outliers over 5% of the total number of its neuroimaging features.

Specifically, we treated one out of 21 sites as a test set and the rest as a training set for training predictive models. We then repeated the model-building process until every site was a test set once and reported overall predictive performance across all test sites. Within each training set, we applied 10-fold cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters of the predictive models. The nested leave-one-site-out cross-validation allowed us to ensure the generalisability of our predictive models to unseen sites. This is important because different sites involved different MRI machines, experimenters, and participants of other demographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Garavan et al., 2018</xref>). Next, data from children from the same family were collected from the same site. Accordingly, using leave-one-site-out also prevented data leakage due to family structure, which might inflate the predictive performance of the models, particularly those involving polygenic scores. Still, given the different number of participants in each site, one drawback for the nested leave-one-site-out cross-validation is that we ended up with some test sets with fewer participants than others. Accordingly, we provided a supplemental analysis using the classical nested cross-validation, which included ten non-overlapping outer folds, randomly chosen without considering the site information, as test sets and ten inner folds for hyperparameter tuning (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Briefly, the results of the leave-one-site-out cross-validation and classical nested cross-validation were close to each other, albeit classical nested cross-validation having slightly higher performance.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Predictive performance of leave one site out cross-validation vs 10-fold cross validation.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-105537-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To demonstrate the stability of the results across two years, we built the predictive models (including hyperparameter tuning) separately for baseline and follow-up data. We separately applied standardisation to the baseline training and test sets for both the target and features to prevent data leakage between training and test sets. To ensure similarity in the data scale across two time points, we used the mean and standard deviation of the baseline training and test sets to standardise the follow-up training and test sets, respectively. For cognitive abilities, which were used as the target for all predictive models, we applied this standardisation strategy both before CFA (i.e. to the behavioural performance of the six cognitive tasks) and after CFA (i.e. to the g-factor factor scores). Moreover, we only estimated the CFA of cognitive abilities using the baseline training set to ensure that the predictive models of the two time points had the same target. We then applied this estimated CFA model to the baseline test set and follow-up training and test sets. We examined the predictive performance of the models via the relationship between predicted and observed cognitive abilities, using Pearson’s correlation (<italic>r</italic>), coefficient of determination (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, calculated using the sum of square definition), mean-absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE).</p><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Predicting cognitive abilities from mental health</title><p>We developed predictive models to predict cognitive abilities from three sets of mental health features: CBCL and temperaments. We separately modelled each of these two sets and also simultaneously modelled the two sets by concatenating them into one set of features called ‘mental health.’ We implemented PLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Wold et al., 2001</xref>) as a multivariate algorithm for these predictive models. Note that while PLS is sometimes used for reducing the dimensionality of features within a dataset, here we utilised PLS in a predictive framework: we tuned and estimated PLS loadings in each training set and applied the final model to the corresponding test set. PLS decomposes features into components that capture not only the features' variance but also the target’s variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Wold et al., 2001</xref>). PLS has an advantage in dealing with collinear features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Dormann et al., 2013</xref>), typical for mental health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Caspi and Moffitt, 2018</xref>).</p><p>PLS has one hyperparameter, the number of components. In our grid search, we tested the number of components, ranging from one to the total number of features. We selected the number of components based on the drop in root mean square error (RMSE). We kept increasing the number of components until the component did not reduce 0.1% of the total RMSE.

Loadings for each PLS component show how much each feature contributes to each PLS component. The proportion of variance explained shows how much variance each PLS component captures compared to the total variance. We then compared loadings and the proportion of variance explained with the univariate Pearson’s correlation between each feature and the target. Note that because we could not guarantee that each training set would result in the same PLS components, we calculated loadings and the proportion of variance explained on the full data without splitting them into training and test sets. It is important to note that the loadings and the proportion of variance explained are for understanding the models, but for assessing the predictive performance and computing a proxy measure of cognitive abilities (i.e., the predicted values), we still relied on the nested leave-one-site-out cross-validation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Predicting cognitive abilities from neuroimaging</title><p>We developed predictive models to predict cognitive abilities from 45 sets of neuroimaging features.

As we showed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pat et al., 2022b</xref>), opportunistic stacking allowed us to handle missingness in the neuroimaging data without sacrificing predictive performance. Missingness in children’s MRI data is expected, given high levels of noise (e.g. movement artifact) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Fassbender et al., 2017</xref>).

The stacking layer, then, took these predicted values across 45 sets of neuroimaging features and treated them as features to predict cognitive abilities, thereby drawing information across (as opposed to within) sets of neuroimaging features. Importantly, we used the same training set across both layers, ensuring no data leakage between training and test sets. Opportunistic stacking dealt with missing values from each set of neuroimaging features by, first, duplicating each feature (i.e. each of 45 predicted values from the set-specific layer) into two features, resulting in 90 features. We then replaced the missing values in the duplicated features with either unrealistically large (1000) or small (–1000) values. Accordingly, we could keep the data as long as at least one set of neuroimaging features had no missing value. Using these duplicated and imputed features, we predicted cognitive abilities from different sets of neuroimaging features using Random Forest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Breiman, 2001</xref>). Ultimately, the stacking layer resulted in a predicted value of cognitive abilities based on 45 sets of neuroimaging features.</p><p>Random Forest generates several regression trees by bootstrapping observations and including a random subset of features at each split (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Breiman, 2001</xref>). To make a prediction, Random Forest aggregates predicted values across bootstrapped trees, known as bagging. We used 500 trees and turned two hyperparameters. First, ‘mtry’ was the number of features selected at each branch. Second, ‘min_n’ was the minimum number of observations in a node needed for the node to be split further. Using a Latin hypercube grid search of 3000 numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Dupuy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sacks et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Santner et al., 2003</xref>), we chose the pair of mtry, ranging from 1 to 90, and min_n, ranging from 2 to 2000, based on the lowest root mean square error (RMSE).</p><p>To understand how opportunistic stacking made predictions, we plotted Elastic Net coefficients for the set-specific layer and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lundberg and Lee, 2017</xref>) for the stacking layer, averaged across 21 test sites. For the set-specific layer, Elastic Net made a prediction based on the linear summation of its regularised, estimated coefficients, and thus, plotting the coefficient of each neuroimaging feature allowed us to understand the contribution of such feature. For the stacking layer, it is difficult to trace the contribution from each feature from Random Forest directly, given the use of bagging. To overcome this, we computed Shapley values instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Roth, 1988</xref>). Shapley values indicate the weighted differences in a model output when each feature is included versus not included in all possible subsets of features. SHAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lundberg and Lee, 2017</xref>) is a method to estimate Shapley values efficiently. Thus, SHAP allowed us to visualise the contribution of each set of neuroimaging features to the prediction in the stacking layer. Given that we duplicated the predicted values from each set of neuroimaging features in the stacking layer, we combined the magnitude of SHAP across the duplicates.</p><p>We fit Elastic Net and Random Forest using the <italic>glmnet</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Friedman et al., 2010</xref>) and ranger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Wright and Ziegler, 2017</xref>) packages, respectively, with the <italic>tidymodels</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Kuhn and Wickham, 2025</xref>) package as a wrapper.

We first selected the PGS threshold for each of the three definitions that demonstrated the strongest correlation with cognitive abilities within the training set. This left three PGSs as features for our predictive models, one for each definition. To control for population stratification in genetics, we regressed each PGS on four genetic principal components separately for the training and test sets. Later, we treated the residuals of this regression for each PGS as each feature in our predictive models. Similar to the predictive models for the set-specific layer of the neuroimaging features, we used Elastic Net here as an algorithm. Given that the genetic data do not change over time, we used the same genetic features for baseline and follow-up predictive models. We selected participants based on ancestry for predictive models involving polygenic scores, leaving us with a much smaller number of children (n=5776 vs. n=11,868 in the baseline).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Predicting cognitive abilities from socio-demographics, lifestyles, and developmental adverse events</title><p>We developed predictive models to predict cognitive abilities from socio-demographics, lifestyles and developmental adverse events, reflected in the 44 features.

To deal with missing values, we applied the following steps separately for baseline training, baseline test, follow-up training, and follow-up test sets. We first imputed categorical features using mode and converted them into dummy variables. We then standardised all features and imputed them using K-nearest neighbours with five neighbours. Note that in a particular site, the value in a specific feature was at 0 for all of the observations (e.g., site 3 having a crime report at 0 for all children), making it impossible for us to standardise this feature when using this site as a test set. In this case, we kept the value of this feature at 0 and did not standardise it.</p><p>Note that the ABCD study only provided some features in the baseline, but not the follow-up.

The out-of-sample relationship between observed and proxy measures of cognitive abilities based on specific features reflects variation in cognitive abilities explained by those features. For instance, the relationship between observed and proxy measures of cognitive abilities based on mental health indicates the variation in cognitive abilities that could be explained by mental health. Capitalising on this variation, we then used commonality analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Nimon et al., 2008</xref>) to demonstrate the extent to which other proxy measures captured similar variance of cognitive abilities as mental health.</p><p>First, to control for the influences of biological sex, age at interview and medication information, we residualised those variables from observed cognitive abilities and each proxy measure of cognitive abilities.

Their multimodal and multivariate prediction framework involves a novel opportunistic stacking model to handle complex types of information to predict variables that are important in understanding mental health-cognitive performance associations.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors are commended for incorporating and directly comparing the contribution of multiple imaging modalities (task fMRI, resting state fMRI, diffusion MRI, structural MRI), neurodevelopmental markers, environmental factors and polygenic risk scores in a novel multivariate framework (via opportunistic stacking), as well as interpreting mental health-cognition associations with latent factors derived from Partial Least Squares. The authors also use a large well-characterized and diverse cohort of adolescents from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study.

The authors also use a large well-characterized and diverse cohort of adolescents from the ABCD Study.

Even with its limitations, following RDoC allows us to investigate mental health holistically. In our case, RDoC enabled us to focus on (a) a functional domain (i.e., cognitive ability), (b) the biological units of analysis of this functional domain (i.e., neuroimaging and polygenic scores), (c) potential contribution of environments, and (d) the continuous individual deviation in this domain (as opposed to distinct categories). We are unaware of any framework with all these four features.</p><p>Focusing on modelling biological units of analysis of a functional domain, as opposed to mental health per se, has some empirical support from the literature. For instance, in Marek and colleagues’ (2022) study, as mentioned by a previous reviewer, fMRI is shown to have a more robust prediction for cognitive ability than mental health. Accordingly, our reasons for predicting cognitive ability instead of mental health in this study are motivated theoretically (i.e., through RDoC) and empirically (i.e., through fMRI findings). We have clarified this reason in the introduction of the manuscript.</p><p>We are aware of the debates surrounding the actual structure of functional domains where the originally proposed RDoC’s specific constructs might not fit the data as well as the data-driven approach (Beam et al., 2021; Quah et al., 2025). However, we consider this debate as an attempt to improve the characterisation of functional domains of RDoC, not an effort to invalidate its holistic, neurobiological and basicfunctioning approach. Our use of a latent-variable modelling approach through factor analyses moves towards a data-driven direction. We made the changes to the second-to-last paragraph in the introduction to make this point clear:</p><p>“In this study, inspired by RDoC, we (a) focused on cognitive abilities as a functional domain, (b) created predictive models to capture the continuous individual variation (as opposed to distinct categories) in cognitive abilities, (c) computed two neurobiological units of analysis of cognitive abilities: multimodal neuroimaging and PGS, and (d) investigated the potential contributions of environmental factors. To operationalise cognitive abilities, we estimated a latent variable representing behavioural performance across various cognitive tasks, commonly referred to as general cognitive ability or the gfactor (Deary, 2012). The g-factor was computed from various cognitive tasks pertinent to RDoC constructs, including attention, working memory, declarative memory, language, and cognitive control. However, using the g-factor to operationalise cognitive abilities caused this study to diverge from the original conceptualisation of RDoC, which emphasises studying separate constructs within cognitive abilities (Morris et al., 2022; Morris &amp; Cuthbert, 2012). Recent studies suggest an improvement to the structure of functional domains by including a general factor, such as the g-factor, in the model, rather than treating each construct separately (Beam et al., 2021; Quah et al., 2025). The g-factor in children is also longitudinally stable and can forecast future health outcomes (Calvin et al., 2017; Deary et al., 2013). Notably, our previous research found that neuroimaging predicts the g-factor more accurately than predicting performance from separate individual cognitive tasks (Pat et al., 2023). Accordingly, we decided to conduct predictive models on the g-factor while keeping the RDoC’s holistic, neurobiological, and basic-functioning characteristics.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper by Wang et al. uses rich brain, behaviour, and genetics data from the ABCD cohort to ask how well cognitive abilities can be predicted from mental-health-related measures, and how brain and genetics influence that prediction.

The ABCD samples align well with this framework.</p><p>We hope to extend this framework to include participants with neurological and psychiatric diagnoses in the future. We have begun applying neurobiological units of analysis for cognitive abilities, assessed through multimodal neuroimaging and polygenic scores (PGS), to other datasets containing more participants with neurological and psychiatric diagnoses. However, this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We have listed this as one of the limitations in the discussion section:</p><p>“Similarly, our ABCD samples were young and community-based, likely limiting the severity of their psychopathological issues (Kessler et al., 2007). Future work needs to test if the results found here are generalisable to adults and participants with stronger severity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of more practical concerns, much of the paper relies on comparing r or R2 measures between different tests.

Similar to our response to Reviewer 2’s Weakness #1, our approach has drawn inspiration from the RDoC framework, which emphasises the variation from normal to abnormal in normative samples (Morris et al., 2022). Subsampling the data would make us deviate from our original motivation.</p><p>Moreover, we used 17 mental healh variables in our predictive models: 8 CBCL subscales, 4 BIS/BAS subscales and 5 UPSS subscales. It is difficult to subsample them. Perhaps a better approach is to test the applicability of our neurobiological units of analysis for cognitive abilities (multimodal neuroimaging and PGS) in other datasets that include more extreme samples. We are working on this line of studies at the moment, and hope to show that in our future work.</p><p>Reviewer 2’s Weakness #4</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A minor query - why are only cortical features shown in Figure 3?</p></disp-quote><p>We presented both cortical and subcortical features in Figure 3. The cortical features are shown on the surface space, while the subcortical features are displayed on the coronal plane. Below is an example of these cortical and subcortical features from the ENBack contrast. The subcortical features are presented in the far-right coronal image.</p><p>We separated the presentation of cortical and subcortical features because the ABCD uses the CIFTI format (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/workbenchcommand/-cifti-help">https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/workbenchcommand/-cifti-help</ext-link>). CIFTI-format images combine cortical surface (in vertices) with subcortical volume (in voxels). For task fMRI, the ABCD parcellated cortical vertices using Freesurfer’s Destrieux atlas and subcortical voxels using Freesurfer’s automatically segmented brain volume (ASEG).</p><p>Due to the size of the images in Figure 3, it may have been difficult for Reviewer 2 to see the subcortical features clearly. We have now added zoomed-in versions of this figure as Supplementary Figures 4–13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the autors):</bold></p><p>(1) In the abstract, could the authors mention which imaging modalities contribute most to the prediction of cognitive abilities (e.g., working memory-related task fMRI)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Following this advice, we now mention which imaging modalities led to the highest predictive performance. Please see the abstract below.</p><p>“Cognitive abilities are often linked to mental health across various disorders, a pattern observed even in childhood. However, the extent to which this relationship is represented by different neurobiological units of analysis, such as multimodal neuroimaging and polygenic scores (PGS), remains unclear.</p><p>Using large-scale data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we first quantified the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health by applying multivariate models to predict cognitive abilities from mental health in children aged 9-10, finding an out-of-sample <italic>r</italic>=.36 . We then applied similar multivariate models to predict cognitive abilities from multimodal neuroimaging, polygenic scores (PGS) and environmental factors. Multimodal neuroimaging was based on 45 types of brain MRI (e.g., task fMRI contrasts, resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging). Among these MRI types, the fMRI contrast, 2-Back vs. 0-Back, from the ENBack task provided the highest predictive performance (<italic>r</italic>=.4). Combining information across all 45 types of brain MRI led to the predictive performance of <italic>r</italic>=.54. The PGS, based on previous genome-wide association studies on cognitive abilities, achieved a predictive performance of <italic>r</italic>=.25. Environmental factors, including socio-demographics (e.g., parent’s income and education), lifestyles (e.g., extracurricular activities, sleep) and developmental adverse events (e.g., parental use of alcohol/tobacco, pregnancy complications), led to a predictive performance of <italic>r</italic>=.49.</p><p>In a series of separate commonality analyses, we found that the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health was primarily represented by multimodal neuroimaging (66%) and, to a lesser extent, by PGS (21%). Additionally, environmental factors accounted for 63% of the variance in the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health. The multimodal neuroimaging and PGS then explained 58% and 21% of the variance due to environmental factors, respectively. Notably, these patterns remained stable over two years.</p><p>Our findings underscore the significance of neurobiological units of analysis for cognitive abilities, as measured by multimodal neuroimaging and PGS, in understanding both (a) the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health and (b) the variance in this relationship shared with environmental factors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Could the authors clarify what they mean by &quot;completing the transdiagnostic aetiology of mental health&quot; in the introduction? (Second paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.</p><p>We intended to convey that understanding the transdiagnostic aetiology of mental health would be enhanced by knowing how neurobiological units of cognitive abilities, from the brain to genes, capture variations due to environmental factors. We realise this sentence might be confusing. Removing it does not alter the intended meaning of the paragraph, as we clarified this point later. The paragraph now reads:</p><p>“According to the National Institute of Mental Health’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework (Insel et al., 2010), cognitive abilities should be investigated not only behaviourally but also neurobiologically, from the brain to genes. It remains unclear to what extent the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health is represented in part by different neurobiological units of analysis -- such as neural and genetic levels measured by multimodal neuroimaging and polygenic scores (PGS). To fully comprehend the role of neurobiology in the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health, we must also consider how these neurobiological units capture variations due to environmental factors, such as sociodemographics, lifestyles, and childhood developmental adverse events (Morris et al., 2022). Our study investigated the extent to which (a) environmental factors explain the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health, and (b) cognitive abilities at the neural and genetic levels capture these associations due to environmental factors. Specifically, we conducted these investigations in a large normative group of children from the ABCD study (Casey et al., 2018). We chose to examine children because, while their emotional and behavioural problems might not meet full diagnostic criteria (Kessler et al., 2007), issues at a young age often forecast adult psychopathology (Reef et al., 2010; Roza et al., 2003). Moreover, the associations among different emotional and behavioural problems in children reflect transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology (Michelini et al., 2019; Pat et al., 2022), making children an appropriate population to study the transdiagnostic aetiology of mental health, especially within a framework that emphasises normative variation from normal to abnormal, such as the RDoC (Morris et al., 2022).“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is unclear to me what the authors mean by this statement in the introduction: &quot;Note that using the word 'proxy measure' does not necessarily mean that the predictive model for a particular measure has a high predictive performance - some proxy measures have better predictive performance than others&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this sentence to address a previous reviewer’s comment: “The authors use the phrasing throughout 'proxy measures of cognitive abilities' when they discuss PRS, neuroimaging, sociodemographics/lifestyle, and developmental factors. Indeed, the authors are able to explain a large proportion of variance with different combinations of these measures, but I think it may be a leap to call all of these proxy measures of cognition. I would suggest keeping the language more objective and stating these measures are associated with cognition.”</p><p>Because of this comment, we assumed that the reviewers wanted us to avoid the misinterpretation that a proxy measure implies high predictive performance. This term is used in machine learning literature (for instance, Dadi et al., 2021). We added the aforementioned sentence to ensure readers that using the term 'proxy measure' does not necessarily mean that the predictive model for a particular measure has high predictive performance. However, it seems that our intention led to an even more confusing message. Therefore, we decided to delete that sentence but keep an earlier sentence that explains the meaning of a proxy measure (see below).</p><p>“With opportunistic stacking, we created a ‘proxy’ measure of cognitive abilities (i.e., predicted value from the model) at the neural unit of analysis using multimodal neuroimaging.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Overall, despite comments from reviewers at another journal, I think the authors still refer to RDoC more than needed in the intro given the restructuring of the manuscript. For instance, at the end of page 4 and top of page 5, it becomes a bit confusing when the authors mention how they deviated from the RDoC framework, but their choice of cognitive domains is still motivated by RDoC. I think the chosen cognitive constructs are consistent with what is in ABCD and what other studies have incorporated into the g factor and do not require the authors to further justify their choice through RDoC. Also, there is emerging work showing that RDoC is limited in its ability to parse apart meaningful neuroimaging-based patterns; see for instance, Quah et al., Nature 2025 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-55831-z">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-55831-z</ext-link>).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comment. We have addressed it in our Response to Reviewer 1’s summary, strengths, and weaknesses above. We have rewritten the paragraph to clarify the relevance of our work to the RDoC framework and to recent studies aiming to improve RDoC constructs (including that from Quah and colleagues).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) I am still on the fence about the use of 'proxy measures of cognitive abilities' given that it is defined as the predictive performance of mental health measures in predicting cognition - what about just calling these mental health predictors? Also, it would be easier to follow this train of thought throughout the manuscript. But I leave it to the authors if they decide to keep their current language of 'proxy measure of cognition'.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for your flexibility. As we explained previously, this ‘proxy measures’ term is used in machine learning literature (for instance, Dadi et al., 2021). We thought about other terms, such as “score”, which is used in genetics, i.e., polygenic scores (Choi et al., 2020). and has recently been used in neuroimaging, i.e., neuroscore (Rodrigue et al., 2024). However, using a ‘score’ is a bit awkward for mental health and socio-demographics, lifestyle and developmental adverse events. Accordingly, we decided to keep the term ‘proxy measures’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) It is unclear which cognitive abilities are being predicted in Figure 1, given the various domains that authors describe in their intro. Is it the g-factor from CFA? This should be clarified in all figure captions.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, cognitive abilities are operationalised using a second-order latent variable, the g-factor from a CFA. We now added the following sentence to Figure 1, 2, 4 to make this point clearer. Thank you for the suggestion:</p><p>“Cognitive abilities are based on the second-order latent variable, the g-factor, based on a confirmatory factor analysis of six cognitive tasks.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) I think it may also be worthwhile to showcase the explanatory power cognitive abilities have in predicting mental health or at least comment on this in the discussion. Certainly, there may be a bidirectional relationship here. The prediction direction from cognition to mental health may be an altogether different objective than what the paper currently presents, but many researchers working in psychiatry may take the stance (with support from the literature) that cognitive performance may serve as premorbid markers for later mental health concerns, particularly given the age range that the authors are working with in ABCD.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment.</p><p>It is important to note that we do not make a directional claim in these cross-sectional analyses. The term &quot;prediction&quot; is used in a machine learning sense, implying only that we made an out-of-sample prediction (Yarkoni &amp; Westfall, 2017). Specifically, we built predictive models on some samples (i.e., training participants) and applied our models to test participants who were not part of the model-building process. Accordingly, our predictive models cannot determine whether mental health “causes” cognitive abilities or vice versa, regardless of whether we treat mental health or cognitive abilities as feature/explanatory/independent variables or as target/response/outcome variables in the models. To demonstrate directionality, we would need to conduct a longitudinal analysis with many more repeated samples and use appropriate techniques, such as a cross-lagged panel model. It is beyond the scope of this manuscript and will need future releases of the ABCD data.</p><p>We decided to use cognitive abilities as a target variable here, rather than a feature variable, mainly for theoretical reasons. This work was inspired by the RDoC framework, which emphasises functional domains. Cognitive abilities is the functional domain in the current study. We created predictive models to predict cognitive abilities based on (a) mental health, (b) multimodal neuroimaging, (c) polygenic scores, and (d) environmental factors. We could not treat cognitive abilities as a functional domain if we used them as a feature variable. For instance, if we predicted mental health (instead of cognitive abilities) from multimodal neuroimaging and polygenic scores, we would no longer capture the neurobiological units of analysis for cognitive abilities.</p><p>We now made it clearer in the discussion that our use of predictive models cannot provide the directional of the effects</p><p>“Our predictive modelling revealed a medium-sized predictive relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health. This finding aligns with recent meta-analyses of case-control studies that link cognitive abilities and mental disorders across various psychiatric conditions (Abramovitch et al., 2021; East-Richard et al., 2020). Unlike previous studies, we estimated the predictive, out-of-sample relationship between cognitive abilities and mental disorders in a large normative sample of children. Although our predictive models, like other cross-sectional models, cannot determine the directionality of the effects, the strength of the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health estimated here should be more robust than when calculated using the same sample as the model itself, known as in-sample prediction/association (Marek et al., 2022; Yarkoni &amp; Westfall, 2017). Examining the PLS loadings of our predictive models revealed that the relationship was driven by various aspects of mental health, including thought and externalising symptoms, as well as motivation. This suggests that there are multiple pathways—encompassing a broad range of emotional and behavioural problems and temperaments—through which cognitive abilities and mental health are linked.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) There is a lot of information packed into Figure 3 in the brain maps; I understand the authors wanted to fit this onto one page, and perhaps a higher resolution figure would resolve this, but the brain maps are very hard to read and/or compare, particularly the coronal sections.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We agree with Reviewer 1 that we need to have a better visualisation of the feature-importance brain maps. To ensure that readers can clearly see the feature importance, we added a Zoom-in version of the feature-importance brain maps as Supplementary Figures 4 – 13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) It would be helpful for authors to cluster features in the resting state functional connectivity correlation matrices, and perhaps use shorter names/acronyms for the labels.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.</p><p>We have now added a zoomed-in version of the feature importance for rs-fmri as Supplementary Figure 7 (for baseline) and 12 (for follow-up).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) (Figures 4a and 4b): please elaborate on &quot;developmental adverse&quot; in the title. I am assuming this is referring to childhood adverse events, or &quot;developmental adversities&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for pointing this out. We meant ‘developmental adverse events’. We have made changes to this figure in the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) For the &quot;follow-up&quot; analyses, I would recommend the authors present this using only the features that are indeed available at follow-up, even if the list of features is lower, otherwise it becomes a bit confusing with the mix of baseline and follow-up features. Or perhaps the authors could make this more clear in the figures by perhaps having a different color for baseline vs follow-up features along the y-axis labels.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this advice. We have now added an indicator in the plot to show whether the features were collected in the baseline or follow-up. We also added colours to indicate which type of environmental factors they were. It is now clear that the majority of the features that were collected at baseline, but were used for the followup predictive model, were developmental adverse events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Minor: Makowski et al 2023 reference can be updated to Makowski et al 2024, published in Cerebral Cortex.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.
