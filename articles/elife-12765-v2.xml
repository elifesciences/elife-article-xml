VSG switching occurs by frequent homologous recombination, which is thought to require locus-specific initiation. Here, we show that a RecQ helicase, RECQ2, acts to repair DNA breaks, including in the telomeric site of VSG expression. Despite this, RECQ2 loss does not impair antigenic variation, but causes increased VSG switching by recombination, arguing against models for VSG switch initiation through direct generation of a DNA double strand break (DSB). Indeed, we show DSBs inefficiently direct recombination in the VSG expression site. By mapping genome replication dynamics, we reveal that the transcribed VSG expression site is the only telomeric site that is early replicating – a differential timing only seen in mammal-infective parasites. Specific association between VSG transcription and replication timing reveals a model for antigenic variation based on replication-derived DNA fragility.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12765.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12765.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12765.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The African trypanosome, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei,</italic> is a parasite that is transmitted between mammals by the tsetse fly, and causes a disease known as sleeping sickness in humans. Like many other parasites, trypanosomes have evolved ways to avoid being killed by their hosts. One such survival strategy involves the parasites constantly changing the molecules that coat their surface, which are the main targets recognized by their hosts’ immune systems. Switching one coat protein for another similar protein, a process called antigenic variation, allows a parasite to evade an attack and establish a persistent infection. Antigenic variation also makes it almost impossible to develop a vaccine that will offer lasting protection against the parasite.</p><p>Previous research suggested that a trypanosome might deliberately break its own DNA and then exploit a repair process to switch its current coat protein-encoding gene for another one located elsewhere within its genetic material. Devlin, Marques et al. now reveal that it is unlikely that trypanosomes use a specific enzyme to break DNA deliberately during coat switching. Instead, experiments using whole-genome sequencing suggest that coat-gene-switching might arise from the strategies trypanosomes use to copy their genetic material during cell division.</p><p>These findings bring researchers closer to understanding how trypanosomes start antigenic variation in order to evade their hosts’ immune responses. In addition, the findings suggest a new model that could help researchers answer an important question: how does the timing of genome copying vary from cell to cell? Nevertheless, the hypothesis proposed by Devlin, Marques et al. will now require rigorous testing. Future studies could also ask if other parasites use similar strategies to survive being attacked by their host’s immune systems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12765.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12765.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Trypanosoma</kwd><kwd>antigenic variation</kwd><kwd>Variant Surface Glycoprotein</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>DNA break</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD studentship, 093589</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Devlin</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/68784/2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marques</surname><given-names>Catarina A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project grant, 089172</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCulloch</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project grant, BB/K006495/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCulloch</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Centre award, 104111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCulloch</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mapping DNA replication timing, allied to genetic analysis of a RecQ repair helicase, reveals that antigenic variation in the African trypanosome may be initiated by locus-specific, replication-derived sequence instability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The growth and propagation of pathogens in vertebrates requires strategies to survive the host immune responses, in particular adaptive immunity. One such survival strategy, found widely in biology, is antigenic variation, which involves periodic switches in exposed pathogen antigens, thereby allowing a fraction of the infecting population to escape immune clearance. A number of strategies for antigenic variation have been described, though normally only one is employed in any given pathogen. In this regard, antigenic variation in the African trypanosome, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, is unusual, since here two apparently distinct approaches are adopted: recombination and transcription. Antigenic variation in <italic>T. brucei</italic> involves switches in the identity of the Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) expressed on the cell surface, where the protein forms a dense ‘coat’ that is believed to shield invariant antigens from immune recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>). At any given time an individual <italic>T. brucei</italic> cell in the mammal expresses only one <italic>VSG</italic> gene, due to transcriptional control mechanisms that ensure only one of ~15 <italic>VSG</italic> transcription sites, termed bloodstream expression sites (BES), is active. Such monoallelic expression is found in other antigenic variation systems, such as that involving the ~60 <italic>var</italic> genes in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guizetti and Scherf, 2013</xref>), as is the ability to switch the gene that is actively transcribed, eliciting antigenic variation. The nature of the monoallelic control and transcriptional switch mechanisms in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, and whether they share features with other pathogens, are still being unraveled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Horn, 2014</xref>). One complexity in understanding VSG transcriptional switching is the elaborate structure of the BES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hertz-Fowler et al., 2008</xref>), where the <italic>VSG</italic> is co-transcribed with many other genes, termed expression site-associated genes (ESAGs), from an RNA Polymerase I promoter. Despite some variation in <italic>ESAG</italic> composition between BES, two features appear invariant in all these sites: the <italic>VSG</italic> is always proximal to the telomere and is separated from the upstream <italic>ESAG</italic>s by an array of 70 bp repeats (which appear to be only found adjacent to <italic>VSG</italic>s in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marcello and Barry, 2007</xref>). Transcriptional switching occurs between the <italic>VSG</italic>s that occupy the BES, and is therefore limited by BES number. However, a second route of VSG switching relies upon recombination and can over-write the BES-resident <italic>VSG</italic>s, generating new VSG coats from a genomic archive of ~2000 <italic>VSG</italic>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cross et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marcello and Barry, 2007</xref>). In numerical terms, therefore, recombination is the major route for VSG switching. Indeed, recombination is a very widespread strategy for antigenic variation in eukaryotic and bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Palmer and Brayton, 2007</xref>), most likely because it drives antigen diversity, which prolongs infection and facilitates transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mugnier et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>VSG</italic> archive is distributed across the three chromosome classes that comprise the <italic>T. brucei</italic> nuclear genome. A small part of the archive is the BES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hertz-Fowler et al., 2008</xref>), which are found in the 11 diploid megabase chromosomes as well as in the ~5 aneuploid intermediate chromosomes. A larger part of the archive is found at the telomeres of ~100 minichromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wickstead et al., 2004</xref>), where <italic>ESAG</italic>s and BES promoters have not been found, suggesting this part of the archive is simply a store of silent <italic>VSG</italic>s for recombination. The largest silent store is composed of arrays of <italic>VSG</italic>s in the subtelomeres of the megabase chromosomes, where the majority of the <italic>VSG</italic>s are pseudogenes or partial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berriman et al., 2005</xref>). The strategies for <italic>VSG</italic> recombination in antigenic variation reflect the archive location and gene composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McCulloch et al., 2015</xref>). A minor route for switching is termed reciprocal <italic>VSG</italic> recombination, where telomeres are exchanged between two chromosomes, moving the <italic>VSG</italic> out of the active BES and moving a previously silent <italic>VSG</italic> into the active BES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rudenko et al., 1996</xref>). More common is <italic>VSG</italic> gene conversion, which can involve both intact and impaired <italic>VSG</italic>s, and involves deletion of the <italic>VSG</italic> in the BES and replacement by <italic>VSG</italic> sequence copied from the silent archive. Early in infections gene conversion of intact <italic>VSG</italic>s predominates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marcello and Barry, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Morrison et al., 2005</xref>) and, since the <italic>VSG</italic>s share little sequence homology, the reaction relies on flanking homology. ~90% of <italic>VSGs</italic> are flanked by 70 bp repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marcello and Barry, 2007</xref>), which provide upstream homology to guide recombination of virtually all genes in the archive. In addition, gene conversion of <italic>VSG</italic>s between BES can use extensive upstream homology: gene conversion can extend to downstream homology within and around the VSG open reading frame (ORF) or, if the silent <italic>VSG</italic> is telomeric, to the chromosome end. Impaired <italic>VSG</italic>s are seen as recombination substrates later in infections and here gene conversion differs from intact <italic>VSG</italic>s, since the reaction involves the production of a functional gene using homology within the ORF; indeed, multiple <italic>VSG</italic> donors are frequently recombined to generate novel ‘mosaic’ <italic>VSG</italic>s in a reaction termed segmental gene conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mugnier et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>All available evidence suggests switching of intact <italic>VSG</italic>s by recombination is catalyzed by homologous recombination (HR), a universally conserved reaction that directs repair of DNA damage and maintains replication fork progression genome-wide. Mutation of the central catalytic enzyme of HR, RAD51, impairs (but does not abolish) VSG recombination, including gene conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McCulloch and Barry, 1999</xref>). Consistent with that phenotype, mutation of <italic>T. brucei</italic> BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartley and McCulloch, 2008</xref>) and at least one of four RAD51 paralogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dobson et al., 2011</xref>) - factors that aid RAD51 function - has the same outcome. More recently, mutation of TOP3α or RMI1, which interact and may be components of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> RTR (RecQ/Sgs1-Top3/TOPO3α- Rmi1/BLAP75/18) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mankouri and Hickson, 2007</xref>), was shown to result in increased VSG switching, an effect that is RAD51-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim and Cross, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2011</xref>). The conclusion that antigenic variation can be executed by a non-specific, general repair pathway is not limited to <italic>T. brucei</italic>, as similar gene knockout studies in <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> implicate HR in pilin antigenic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cahoon and Seifert, 2011</xref>). However, VSG switching can occur at rates substantially higher than might be predicted for background mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turner, 1997</xref>) and may be focused to target the active BES, features that may suggest some mechanistic specialization or locus-specificity. As a result, recent work has explored how VSG switching might be initiated in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, leading to an association between elevated rates of switching and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). The evidence for this association is two-fold. First, controlled induction of the endonuclease I-SceI to specifically generate a DSB adjacent to the 70 bp in the active BES leads to a ~250 fold increase in VSG switching by recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boothroyd et al., 2009</xref>), an effect not seen when a DSB is induced in other locations in the active BES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boothroyd et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2013</xref>) or when the 70 bp repeats have been deleted from the active BES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boothroyd et al., 2009</xref>). Second, ligation-mediated PCR is able detect DNA breaks in the BES, with the lesions initially reported to be limited to the vicinity of the 70 bp repeats in the active BES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boothroyd et al., 2009</xref>), though later also reported in the silent BES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jehi et al., 2014</xref>) and found to be more widely distributed in the transcription units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Despite the emerging association between DNA DSBs and VSG switching, questions remain about the detailed mechanism(s) of VSG switch initiation. For instance, are DSBs generated directly in the active BES, such as through the action of an endonuclease, as occurs during <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mating type switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Haber, 2015</xref>)? Alternatively, might other processes lead more indirectly to break formation and elicit switching, such as the transcription, replication and DNA nicking events that initiate locus-directed recombination reactions during, respectively, immunoglobulin gene switching in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roth, 2014</xref>), mating type switching in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klar et al., 2014</xref>) and pilin antigenic variation in <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Obergfell and Seifert, 2015</xref>)? In this study, we have examined VSG switch initiation in two ways. First, we describe the impact on DNA repair and VSG switching caused by mutation of one of two <italic>T. brucei</italic> RecQ-like helicases, which we have named TbRECQ2. We show that loss of TbRECQ2 impairs DSB repair, consistent with the observation that the protein localizes to such lesions. Conversely, TbRECQ2 mutants display elevated rates of VSG switching, indicating it is unlikely that the direct formation of DSBs is the initiating event in VSG switching. Second, we provide evidence for strong association between replication timing and BES transcription, indicating that VSG switch initiation may be mechanistically linked to DNA replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>T. brucei</italic> RECQ2 is non-essential in bloodstream form cells and acts in DNA damage repair</title><p>Helicases are molecular motors that use energy released from nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis to unwind RNA, DNA or RNA:DNA hybrids. RecQ-like helicases are widespread Superfamily 2 DNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>), identifiable by homology with the first RecQ helicase described in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Umezu et al., 1990</xref>). <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, single-celled yeast, encode a single RecQ helicase: Rqh1 and Sgs1, respectively. In contrast, multicellular eukaryotes such as humans and <italic>Drosophila menaogaster</italic> possess multiple RecQ helicases, with five discernible in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hickson, 2003</xref>). RecQ helicases function in diverse aspects of genome maintenance. For example, human RECQ4 interacts with the replication factors MCM10 and MCM2-7, while RECQL4 interacts with CDC45 and GINS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Im et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). RecQ helicases also play roles in non-homologous end-joining, since human WRN interacts with XRCC4-ligase IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kusumoto et al., 2008</xref>), while human RECQ1 binds Ku70/80 and its depletion leads to reduced repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Parvathaneni et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, RecQ helicases act in both the initiation and execution of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haber, 2015</xref>), since the RTR complex promotes DNA DSB resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mimitou and Symington, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>), controls DNA annealing during strand invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fasching et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Spell and Jinks-Robertson, 2004</xref>), and ‘dissolves’ Holliday junction intermediates to limit crossover genetic exchange between chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cejka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hickson and Mankouri, 2011</xref>).</p><p>BLAST searches with multiple eukaryotic RecQ helicase sequences consistently revealed two well-aligned proteins encoded in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome, which we arbitrarily named TbRECQ1 (TriTrypDB gene accession number Tb427.06.3580) and TbRECQ2 (Tb427.08.6690). RNAi analysis suggests that TbRECQ1, which appears more distantly related to eukaryotic RecQ helicases than TbRECQ2, is essential (Devlin et al, unpublished). Protein domain predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) suggest that TbRECQ2 contains a conserved DEAD/DEAH box helicase domain, indicating potential ATP and nucleic acid binding activity, and a more C-terminal helicase domain that is found in helicases of multiple families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Linder, 2006</xref>). In addition, an HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain is predicted close to the C-terminus. In contrast to the two other domains, the HRDC domain appears limited to some RecQ helicases and RNase D homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Morozov et al., 1997</xref>), where it is probably involved in DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachrati and Hickson, 2003</xref>). However, HRDC domains are not found in all RecQ helicases; for example, three human RecQ helicases, WRN, BLM and RECQ1, each contain an HRDC, but it is absent in human RECQ4 and RECQ5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernstein et al., 2010</xref>).Thus, the prediction that TbRECQ2 contains an HRDC might suggest a function closer to the former human RecQ helicases. One domain that is limited to RecQ helicases is termed RQC (RecQ C-terminal), which may be involved in protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernstein et al., 2010</xref>), as well as in binding and unwinding dsDNA at branch points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kitano et al., 2010</xref>). Though this domain could not be predicted in TbRECQ2, it is also absent from or highly diverged in some other validated RecQ proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachrati and Hickson, 2003</xref>) and the evolutionary distance between <italic>T. brucei</italic> and the most characterised model eukaryotes may confound identification.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12765.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>T. brucei</italic> RECQ2 is non-essential and acts in genome repair.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representation of predicted protein domains in TbRECQ2.

Indeed, slowed growth was also apparent in the <italic>req2</italic>+/- mutants, suggesting a growth impediment after loss of one allele that becomes more severe in the null mutant. To ask if the growth change results from an impediment in completing a cell cycle stage or traversing between sequential stages, cells were stained with DAPI to visualise nuclear (N) and kinetoplast (K) DNA. Counting the relative numbers of the two <italic>T. brucei</italic> genomes allows a cytological assessment of the cell cycle stage of individual cells in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McKean, 2003</xref>), and we found no change in the proportion of 1N1K (G1-S phase), 1N2K (G2-M phase) or 2N2K (post M phase) cells in mutants relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, the growth impairment of the RECQ2 mutants is not due to detectable stalling at a discernible cell cycle stage or transition. Western blotting to detect the levels of Thr130 phosphorylated histone H2A (γ-H2A) revealed an increased signal in the <italic>recq2</italic>-/- mutants relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating this modification accumulates in the absence of the helicase to an extent comparable to that seen in WT or -/- mutants cells grown for 18 hr in 0.0003% MMS (see below). This form of phosphorylation of histone H2A is a modification seen after various genotoxic treatments in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glover and Horn, 2012</xref>), suggesting it is the kinetoplastid variant of a conserved eukaryotic chromatin alteration that acts a prelude to repair. Thus, accumulation of the histone variant in the <italic>recq2</italic>-/- mutants indicates an increased level of nuclear DNA damage, which appears not to impair cell cycle progression but may impede cell growth or survival.</p><p>To ask if TbRECQ2 contributes to genome repair in <italic>T. brucei</italic> survival of the mutants was compared with WT cells following exposure to three DNA damaging compounds: hydroxyurea (HU), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and phleomycin. HU depletes the cellular dNTP pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bianchi et al., 1986</xref>), resulting in stalled replication forks that can subsequently collapse and generate DNA breaks. MMS methylates purines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brookes and Lawley, 1961</xref>), which causes DNA breaks, at least in part through DNA repair activities targeting the alkylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lundin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wyatt and Pittman, 2006</xref>). MMS damage also perturbs replication, due to alkylated nucleotides blocking replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Groth et al., 2010</xref>). Phleomycin blocks the activity of DNA polymerase, inhibiting DNA synthesis and resulting in the formation of, primarily, DNA DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falaschi and Kornberg, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reiter et al., 1972</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> shows clonal survival assays, which revealed that the <italic>recq2-/-</italic> cells displayed a much increased sensitivity to MMS compared with WT. Indeed, at MMS concentrations at and above 0.0002%, <italic>recq2+/-</italic> survival was lower than WT. These data are consistent with the increased MMSsensitivity previously reported in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> SGS1 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mullen and Brill, 2000</xref>), as well as human and chicken DT40 <italic>blm-/-</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Imamura et al., 2001</xref>), and indicate TbRECQ2 is involved in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> response to MMS-induced damage.

In most cells no signal could be detected, though in the very small proportion (0.2%) that did show a signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), this was seen as a discrete puncta in the nucleus (data not shown). Such a pattern is reminiscent of localisation described for <italic>T. brucei</italic> RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dobson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glover et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartley and McCulloch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Proudfoot and McCulloch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trenaman et al., 2013</xref>), which is normally not seen in the cell, but localises in what have been described as foci in a small number of cells in the absence of induced damage. RAD51 foci are thought to be repair-related structures, as their numbers increase after damage, both in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and in many other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haaf et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tarsounas et al., 2004</xref>). As a result, we examined co-localisation of 12myc-TbRECQ2 and TbRAD51, detecting the latter by indirect immunofluorescence with polyclonal anti-RAD51 antiserum. To ask if the 12myc-TbRECQ2 signals might represent repair–related foci and, indeed, might be structurally associated with TbRAD51 foci, the cells were treated for 18 hr with phleomycin at 1 μg.mL<sup>-1</sup>, which has been shown to generate a majority of cells with TbRAD51 foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dobson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartley and McCulloch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trenaman et al., 2013</xref>). TbRAD51 foci were observed in ~2% of untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which is similar to previous studies and comparable with 12myc-TbRECQ2. After growth in phleomycin, 47% of cells contained one or more 12myc-TbRECQ2 foci and 44% of cells contained one or more TbRAD51 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Indeed, not only was the relative proportion of cells with 12myc-TbRECQ2 and TbRAD51 foci comparable in these conditions, but the pattern of foci accumulation was highly related: most cells contained a single focus of either protein, though some contained 2 or 3 discrete foci, while others had larger numbers (difficult to count accurately). Moreover, there was substantial overlap in the two signals, examples of which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. In the majority of cells in which 12myc-TbRECQ2 and TbRAD51 foci were seen (irrespective of the number of foci), the signals co-localised fully (~60% of cells with both foci, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In ~20% of cells with foci, the signal overlap was partial because the numbers of 12myc-TbRECQ2 and TbRAD51 foci were not equivalent in a single cell. Finally, in ~20% of cells there was no overlap, because 12myc-TbRECQ2 displayed foci but TbRAD51 did not, or vice versa. In summary, there appears to be pronounced similarity in behaviour and overlap in signal between 12myc-TbRECQ2 and TbRAD51 before and after phleomycin- induced damage. Whether the non-overlapping signals merely reflect incomplete resolution of one or other signal, or tell us that the proteins can act in subtly different manners (perhaps temporally or spatially), is unclear.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Loss of TbRECQ2 impairs survival of <italic>T. brucei</italic> cells after DNA double strand break induction</title><p>In order to test directly if TbRECQ2 acts in DNA DSB repair, we utilised two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) in which a single DNA DSB can be controllably induced in the genome (gift, David Horn). Both the HR1 (or INT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glover and Horn, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glover et al., 2008</xref>) and HRES (or TEL, VSG<sup>up</sup>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glover and Horn, 2014</xref>) cells have been modified such that expression of the I-SceI meganuclease is dependent upon addition of tetracycline (Tet) to alleviate transcriptional repression by the Tet repressor. HR1 and HRES cells differ in the location of the I-SceI recognition site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In HR1, the I-SceI site is located on chromosome 11, between genes Tb927.11.4530 and Tb927.11.4540 (tritrydb.org), and &gt;1 Mbp from the nearest telomere. Here, the I-SceI site is embedded within an <italic>RFP</italic> (red fluorescent protein)<italic>:PUR</italic> (puromycin N-acetyl transferase) fusion gene. The <italic>RFP:PUR</italic> gene is flanked by tubulin sequences for mRNA transplicing and polyadenylation. Thus, HR-directed repair after I-SceI-induced DSB formation could occur by recombination between chromosome 11a (containing the I-SceI site) and its homologue (11b), but could also occur ectopically with chromosome 1 (where the tubulin locus is found) using the short tubulin sequences on the <italic>RFP:PUR</italic> cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glover et al., 2008</xref>).

Analysis of the puromycin sensitivity of surviving clones showed, for both WT and <italic>recq2</italic>-/- HR1 cells, that all Tet-induced clones (n = 25) were puromycin sensitive and all uninduced clones (n = 6) were puromycin resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, a functional <italic>PUR</italic> gene was lost in all cases after I-SceI expression was induced, showing that DSB formation was successful and indicating repair is possible, though less efficient, in the absence of TbRECQ2. Broadly the same outcome was seen for the HRES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2013</xref>), the survival rate of HRES WT cells after I-SceI induction (~24%) was &gt;2-fold lower than HR1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating greater lethality when a DSB is made in the active BES. Nonetheless, the survival rate of the two <italic>HRES recq2-/-</italic> clones (13% and 14.8%) was again ~50% of HRES WT cells, suggesting loss of TbRECQ2 impairs survival in both loci. In fact, the level of impairment after loss of TbRECQ2 may be greater than the clonal survival assay predicts since, unlike in HR1, evaluating the puromycin sensitivity of recovered clones showed that 14% of survivors (n = 7) in one <italic>HRES recq2-/-</italic> clone and 70% (n = 10) in the other were puromycin resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data are most simply explained by a greater number of HRES <italic>recq2</italic>-/- mutants being recovered (relative to HR1 mutants) in which a DSB has not been induced, reflecting the very limited survival capacity of <italic>recq2</italic>-/- mutants after a DSB is made in the active BES. Despite this, PCR of the puromycin sensitive <italic>recq2</italic>-/- survivor clones showed that all had lost the <italic>VSG221</italic> gene (also called <italic>VSG 427–2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hertz-Fowler et al., 2008</xref>) and most had retained the <italic>ESAG1</italic> gene variant specific to the targeted BES (Figure 3D), a pattern consistent with previous analysis in WT HRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2013</xref>) cells and relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boothroyd et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, loss of TbRECQ2 does not result in a major shift in repair pathway after induction of a DNA DSB in the BES, meaning reduced survival in the mutants is best explained by less efficient execution of a predominant repair reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Loss of TbRECQ2 increases VSG switching by elevated telomeric recombination</title><p>In order to analyse the effect of TbRECQ2 loss onVSG switching we adapted an in vitro strategy of Povelones et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Povelones et al., 2012</xref>), which is conceptually related to an assay established by Kim and Cross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim and Cross, 2010;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2011</xref>). In this strategy, a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (<italic>TK</italic>) gene fused to a hygromycin resistance gene (<italic>HYG-TK</italic>) was inserted between the 70 bp repeats and <italic>VSG221</italic> in the active BES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Additionally, enhanced <italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>PUR</italic> genes were integrated downstream of the active BES promoter. Integration of the marker genes and the expected expression of GFP and VSG221 protein was confirmed by PCR and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).The parental cell line generated by these manipulations, <italic>GFP221hygTK</italic>, allows the nucleotide analogue ganciclovir (GCV) to be used to eliminate cells from the population that have not inactivated <italic>TK</italic>, which can occur through VSG switching events that can be distinguished by the presence and expression of the <italic>VSG221</italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> genes in the BES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In a transcriptional (in situ) switch VSG221 and GFP proteins are no longer expressed from the BES but both genes are retained. In contrast, cells that have switched by a gene conversion downstream of <italic>PUR-GFP</italic> (here termed VSG GC) retain GFP expression from the BES but have deleted <italic>TK</italic> and <italic>VSG221</italic> from the transcription unit. Longer range gene conversions are also possible that encompass the whole BES and lead to removal of both <italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>VSG221</italic>, though in the approach used here this reaction cannot be distinguished from events in which the BES is deleted without gene conversion and cells survive through a transcriptional switch (ES GC or in situ+ES del, respectively)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cross et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rudenko et al., 1998</xref>). Finally, in VSG switching by telomere exchange (telomere XO) GFP continues to be expressed from the BES, whereas VSG221 protein expression is silenced by moving the gene to another telomere.

The switching rate of the WT cells was then compared with the <italic>TbRECQ2</italic> mutants: cultures were grown for 48 hr in media lacking hygromycin or puromycin (allowing switch variants to arise) and then cloned by limiting dilution in antibiotic-free media containing GCV, allowing measurement of the number of cells in the diluted population that had inactivated <italic>TK</italic>. In the WT cells GCV resistant clones arose at a rate of ~1.5 x 10<sup>–5</sup>cells/generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), consistent with rates determined in comparable studies Kim and Cross, 2010a, 2011a; Povelones et al., 2012b). No change in rate was seen in the <italic>recq2</italic>+/- mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), but GCV resistant cells arose around 2-fold more frequently in the <italic>recq2</italic>-/- mutants (~3.2 x 10<sup>–5</sup> resistant cells/generation). To ask if this change could be explained by an alteration in VSG switching strategy, we used PCR and western blotting to determine the profile of <italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>VSG</italic> gene presence and protein expression in a selection of GCV resistant clones for each cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In broad agreement with observations made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Povelones et al. (2012)</xref>, in WT cells most GCV resistant clones had arisen either by in ES GC or in situ+ES del (~60%), with in situ switching the next most common process (~25%); VSG GC was rare (~10%), and we found no examples of telomere XO events. A virtually identical pattern of events was seen in the <italic>recq2</italic>+/- cells, consistent with the unaltered rate at which GCV resistant cells arose. In contrast, ~90% of GCV resistant clones in the <italic>recq2</italic>-/- mutants arose either by VSG GC (~50% of total) or telomere XO (~45%), indicating that the elevated rate in the null mutants is due to increased use of these recombination strategies. To test this interpretation further, the switching experiment was conducted in the presence of puromycin, which should prevent any events that inactivate expression of <italic>PUR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In these conditions, GCV resistant cells arose ~2–3 fold less frequently in the WT and <italic>recq2</italic>+/- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), consistent with their predominant use of in situ and ES GC or in situ+ES del events, whilst there was less impact on the <italic>recq2</italic>-/- cells, where VSG switching is largely downstream of <italic>PUR</italic>.

Expression of I-SceI was induced with Tet and, 12 and 24 hrlater, cells were stained with DAPI to visualize N and K DNA. Virtually all cells were categorised as either 1N1K, 1N2K or 2N2K, irrespective of whether I-SceI expression was induced or not. However, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glover and Horn, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glover et al., 2008</xref>), addition of Tet resulted in increased numbers of 1N2K cells, indicating impaired G2-M cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>).

In contrast, increased 1N2K cell numbers (~20% of the population) persisted until 24 hr after Tet addition in HRES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting the response to a DSB differs if the lesion is in the active BES or a chromosome-internal site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glover and Horn, 2014</xref>).

In HR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), a reduction in product was seen from 2 hr after Tet addition (20%) and this effect increased until around 8 hr (80%), with little change in PCR efficiency thereafter (8–72 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that I-SceI cleavage in HR1 cells is rapid and reaches a maximum within a cell cycle (~8 hr), an interpretation consistent with the timing of single-stranded DNA formation at I-SceI breaks detected by Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glover and Horn, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glover et al., 2008</xref>). Southern blotting suggests that allelic repair products in HR1 accumulate slowly over ~16–72 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glover et al., 2008</xref>), consistent with qPCR to detect duplication of the intact allele (data not shown). I-SceI target qPCR revealed a different response to I-SceI induction in HRES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Early in the time course, loss of PCR product was more rapid and more complete, with &lt;10% of uninduced product by 2–3 hr after Tet addition, suggesting I-SceI cleavage was at least as efficient in HRES cells as in HR1. However, in contrast with HR1, the levels of PCR product later in the reaction increased, in two distinct peaks (at ~20 and 30 hr post induction), to levels approaching that of the uninduced cells. Given that I-SceI cleavage is rapid, these data either suggest repair occurs efficiently in a manner that regenerates the I-SceI target, or repair is inefficient and cells that are subjected to I-SceI cleavage are killed, allowing those that have not suffered a DNA DSB to outgrow. Unlike for HR1, where most repair is mediated by allelic HR, I-SceI cleavage in HRES (or related cells) predominantly results in cells expressing a new VSG, whose identity cannot be easily predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boothroyd et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we used qPCR to ask about the fate of the BES <italic>VSG (VSG221</italic>) after I-SceI cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The abundance of the <italic>VSG221</italic> PCR product very closely matched that of the I-SceI target over the timecourse, and the recurrence of product indicates the initial, rapid loss of <italic>VSG221</italic> is not due to replacement by another <italic>VSG</italic>. To test this further, we performed immunofluorescence with anti-VSG221 antiserum, revealing that virtually all cells retained VSG221 on their surface 24 hr after Tet induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

MFAseq compares the relative depth of sequence read mapping in replicating (S phase) and non-replicating (here, G2) cells, allowing the sites and relative efficiencies of origins of replication to be determined, as well as inference on the timing and direction of replication genome-wide. In <italic>T. brucei</italic>, MFAseq has so far only been performed in procyclic cell forms (PCF), the insect stage of the parasite, and in the strain TREU927 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tiengwe et al., 2012</xref>), in which the repertoire of telomeric BES has not been characterized. Here, we performed MFAseq in PCF and BSF cells of <italic>T. brucei</italic> strain Lister 427, where all BES have been sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hertz-Fowler et al., 2008</xref>), allowing us to ask if differences between the life cycle stages, including gene expression changes, result in alterations in replication dynamics. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows MFAseq mapping for the eleven megabase chromosomes of <italic>T. brucei</italic>, excluding the BES, and comparing the patterns seen when early S or late S cells are compared with G2 phase cells. The MFAseq pattern of peak location was invariant when comparing early S BSF and PCF cells, and when comparing late S phase BSF and PCF cells. Even more strikingly, the relative heights of the MFAseq peaks in each chromosome were invariant between the two life cycle stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), as well as being invariant between <italic>T. brucei</italic> strains Lister427 and TREU927 (data not shown). Thus, neither differentiation between life cycle stages in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, nor extended growth of different <italic>T. brucei</italic> strains, leads to changes in the genomic sites used as origins, or changes in the timing programme of origin activation in the chromosome cores. Late S MFAseq has not previously been reported for <italic>T. brucei</italic>, though it was inferred that the number of origins (42) mapped using early-mid S phase cells might be an underestimate of ~2-fold, due to replication initiation at late acting origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tiengwe et al., 2012</xref>). This prediction appears to be inaccurate, as most of the peaks detected in the late S samples were merely wider than the early S peaks; indeed, in several locations early S peaks had merged as replication forks converged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Only five origins (dashed lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) were observed in the present data, both in the BSF and PCF cells, which were not predicted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tiengwe et al., 2012</xref>). All these were ‘weak’ origins, with low MFAseq peak heights, and it is possible that they were observed here due to the more compressed graphical representation, rather than being origins that are active in Lister 427 cells and not in TREU927. Using the localisation of TbORC1/CDC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tiengwe et al., 2012</xref>) and histone H4K10Ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Siegel et al., 2009</xref>) binding sites in the TREU927 genome as a guide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), it is clear these five origins localise to the boundaries of the polycistronic transcription units, as expected.

The PCF and BSF S and G2 sequence reads were used to perform MFAseq mapping to the 16 available contigs representing the 14 different BES, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. In these data, peaks cannot be discerned, as the sizes of the BESs are smaller than the distance covered by the replication forks at most origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, at the higher resolution used here, the MFAseq mapping is seen as multiple discrete points, corresponding to the median S/G2 read depth ratio in each of the 2.5 kbp ‘bins’ that span the BES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). For all but one of the BES, there was no clear difference between the MFAseq mapping in the BSF and PCF cells, either for early or late S phase. Moreover, there was no evidence that 13 of the 14 BES had been replicated, even in the BSF and PCF late S samples, since there was no consistent increase in S phase reads relative to G2: comparing the S/G2 ratios for each bin in each BES showed that the overall median S/G2 ration for most BES was ~1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These data suggest that 13 of 14 BES are replicated very late in S phase, similar to telomeres in other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rhind and Gilbert, 2013</xref>). BES1 was the single exception to the above trend. In this contig, BSF S phase reads (both early and late) across the BES were markedly elevated relative to G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), with overall median S/G2 ratios of 1.25 and 1.3 in early and late S, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This effect was limited to the BSF cells, however, since the PCF MFAseq data for BES1 (again in either early or late S) was comparable with all other BES, with S/G2 ratios ~1.0 (significantly different from BSF cells: p-value &lt; 0.0001). These data suggest that BES1, alone amongst the 14 BES, is replicated early, and this deviation from the late replication of other BES is limited to mammal-infective cells. BES1 differs from the other BES in being the actively transcribed site, encoding VSG221 in the BSF cells used in this study, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In PCF cells full transcription of all BES, including BES1, is silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rudenko et al., 1994</xref>) and the VSG coat is replaced with procyclin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

First, S/G2 ratios were derived using qPCR on DNA from cells expressing BES1 (<italic>VSG221</italic>), which had been used in the MFAseq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Using an origin-associated locus and a non-origin locus from chromosome 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) as controls, we observed early and late S/G2 qPCR ratios consistent with the former locus being early replicating and the latter late replicating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Furthermore, qPCR of <italic>VSG221</italic> in the same cells revealed early and late S/G2 ratios higher than the chromosome 5 origin locus, consistent with the <italic>VSG</italic> replicating very early (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). To ask if the early replication of <italic>VSG221</italic> is determined by transcription of BES1, we next examined cells generated by Glover et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glover et al., 2007</xref>) in which a Tet operator is inserted downstream of the BES1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In the absence of Tet, binding of the Tet repressor (TetR) blocks transcription elongation in BES1 and cells are selected that have switched to transcribing another <italic>VSG</italic> BES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aresta-Branco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glover et al., 2007</xref>). A recently derived clone of the BES1 TetR blockade cells was sorted into early S, late S and G2 populations, and qPCR performed on recovered DNA. Early and late S/G2 qPCR ratios for the chromosome 5 controls were lower in these experiments compared with the qPCR from the BES1 (VSG221) expressers, probably as a result of sorting differences in the selection of cells within the S phases or within G2. Nonetheless, the S/G2 ratio of the origin locus increased from early to late S, indicating replication progression. For <italic>VSG221</italic>, the early and late S/G2 ratios in the TetR blockade cells were much lower than in the BES1 (<italic>VSG221</italic>) expressing cells, being indistinguishable from the origin locus, indicating the pronounced early replication of this <italic>VSG</italic> is not seen when it is no longer transcribed. Immunofluorescence indicated that VSG121, whose gene is present in BES3 in this <italic>T. brucei</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hertz-Fowler et al., 2008</xref>), could be detected on the cell surface of most of the BES1 TetR blockade cells at the outset of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) and so we used qPCR to test the replication timing of this <italic>VSG</italic> in both cell types. qPCR of <italic>VSG121</italic> is complicated relative to <italic>VSG221</italic> because the gene is not only located in a BES: at least four <italic>VSG121</italic> copies are found within the subtelomeric <italic>VSG</italic> arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trenaman et al., 2013</xref>), whose replication timing is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tiengwe et al., 2012</xref>). Despite this, early and late S/G2 qPCR ratios for <italic>VSG121</italic> in BES1 (VSG221) expressing cells were lower than both the <italic>VSG221</italic> and chromosome 5 origin control locus values and were more comparable with the non-origin control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), consistent with late replication. In contrast, in the BES1 TetR blockade cells the <italic>VSG121</italic> S/G2 ratios were higher than both <italic>VSG221</italic> and the non-origin locus and, instead, were comparable with the origin control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Thus, despite the potentially confounding effect of <italic>VSG121</italic> array copies that may be late replicating, as well as uncertainty about the transcriptional status of all the VSG BES in these cells, these data suggest earlier replication of <italic>VSG121</italic> when the <italic>VSG221</italic>-containing BES1 is silenced and BES3 is at least one of the BES expressed in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> population.

VSG switch initiation has been modelled by the direct generation of a DSB in the active BES through the controlled expression and targeting of I-SceI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boothroyd et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glover and Horn, 2014</xref>), which results in VSG switching. However, to date there is little evidence for the direct formation of a DSB being the initiating strategy in VSG switching, despite data showing that breaks can be detected around the telomeric VSG (though with uncertainty as to whether these are limited to the active BES or to the 70 bp repeats)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boothroyd et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jehi et al., 2014</xref>). As a result, the nature of the lesions that first form in the BES to drive VSG switching, and the route by which the lesions are generated, is unclear. Indeed, several initiation models having been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barry and McCulloch, 2009</xref>): an uncharacterised endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry, 1997</xref>), telomere instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dreesen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hovel-Miner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jehi et al., 2014</xref>) and transcription-derived instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim and Cross, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2011</xref>). Here, we have tested the association between I-SceI-mediated DSB formation and VSG switching, revealing that endonuclease mediated DSB formation is unlikely to be the route for initiation of <italic>T. brucei</italic> antigenic variation. Instead, we reveal a remarkably precise association between DNA replication timing and transcription of the single active VSG BES in BSF cells, suggesting that replication may drive VSG switching.</p><p>To test the role of endonuclease-generated, BES-focused DSBs in the initiation of VSG switching, we first analysed the genome repair functions of one of two <italic>T. brucei</italic> RecQ-like proteins, TbRECQ2. Several lines of evidence indicate that TbRECQ2 localises to and repairs DNA breaks, including DSBs. First, <italic>T. brucei recq2</italic> null (-/-) mutants display impaired survival in the presence of three compounds that can cause DNA damage, including phleomycin, which is known to generate DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falaschi and Kornberg, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reiter et al., 1972</xref>). Second, TbRECQ2 protein relocalises to subnuclear foci after exposure to phleomycin and, critically, in these conditions the putative helicase displays pronounced colocalisation with TbRAD51, an enzyme that binds single-stranded DNA formed at DSBs to catalyse HR repair. Finally, <italic>T. brucei recq2</italic>-/- mutants display reduced survival relative to WT cells after I-SceI induction of DSBs, both in the active BES and elsewhere in the genome, arguing for impaired repair of this lesion. All the above findings are consistent with the activities of related RecQ helicases in other cells, where the enzymes are known to contribute widely to HR. In this regard, the repair and VSG switching (see below) phenotypes observed for TbRECQ2 are highly reminiscent of those described for <italic>T. brucei</italic> Topo3α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim and Cross, 2010</xref>) and RMI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim and Cross, 2011</xref>). Thus, it seems plausible that TbRECQ2, and not the other putative <italic>T. brucei</italic> RecQ-like helicase (TbRECQ1), interacts with these factors to form the <italic>T. brucei</italic> homologue of the RTR complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mankouri and Hickson, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Given the above evidence for TbRECQ2 repair functions, the enzyme provided a means to test the role of endonuclease-generated DSBs in the initiation of VSG switching. Loss of TbRECQ2 results in an increased rate of VSG switching, as a consequence of altered pathways of recombination: increased levels of telomere exchange and <italic>VSG</italic>-proximal gene conversion. Both these phenotypic outcomes are incompatible with the effects of TbRECQ2 loss on repair of I-SceI-mediated DSBs in the active BES, where the rate of repair is reduced and there is no change in repair pathway. The effects of TbRECQ2 loss on VSG switching are reminiscent of the phenotypes seen after mutation of Topo3α or RMI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim and Cross, 2010</xref>;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2011</xref>), providing more evidence that these factors act together in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Though VSG switching rates increase in each of the null mutants, the extent of this change is somewhat variable: a 2–3 fold increase in <italic>recq2-/-</italic> mutants, compared with 4-fold and 10–40 fold increases in <italic>rmi1</italic> and <italic>topo3α</italic> null mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim and Cross, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2011</xref>). The differing extent of VSG switching increase may be consistent with findings that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sgs1 and Top3-Rmi1 can act independently on strand exchange intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fasching et al., 2015</xref>), but may equally be explicable by subtle differences in the strains used or the growth conditions. In this regard, although the switching rate of the WT cells used by Kim and Cross is broadly similar to the data presented here, the switching profile is somewhat different. For example, in situ switchers were almost entirely absent (&lt;2% of total switchers) in the Kim and Cross studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim and Cross, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2011</xref>), whereas they constituted ~27% of WT switchers here; conversely, ~65% of WT switchers recovered by Kim and Cross used <italic>VSG</italic> GC, as opposed to only ~10% here. The pattern of WT VSG switching described here is very comparable with that seen by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Povelones et al. (2012)</xref>, who used the same constructs but generated the cells independently from us. Thus, it seems likely that small differences in the constructs, their expression levels or their integration into the active BES may result in the WT VSG switching profile differences discussed above. Irrespective of these differences, the increased contribution of VSG GC and telomere XO to VSG switching is a common effect of <italic>recq2-/-</italic> (~50% and ~40%, respectively), <italic>rmi1-/-</italic> (70% and 25%, respectively)and <italic>topo3α-/-</italic> (70% and 23%, respectively) mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim and Cross, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2011</xref>). Similarly, all three -/- mutants display an almost complete absence of events leading to ES loss (either GC or deletion). As has been argued before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim and Cross, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2011</xref>), the increase in telomere XO is striking, as this effect is consistent with the action of the RTR complex in processing recombination intermediates to suppress chromosome crossover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cejka et al., 2010</xref>). In yeast, Sgs1 mutation leads to increased crossover recombination after the formation of a chromosome-internal DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ira et al., 2003</xref>). The absence of crossovers in HRES <italic>recq2</italic>-/- mutants after I-SceI induction provides further evidence that an induced DSB in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> active BES is tackled by a repair strategy that differs markedly from that which directs VSG switching. Yeast Sgs1 mutants also display increased repair by break-induced replication (BIR) at a telomere-proximal DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lydeard et al., 2010</xref>). The decreased survival of HRES <italic>recq2</italic>-/- mutants after I-SceI induction indicates that, perhaps surprisingly, an induced DSB in the active BES is inefficiently repaired by BIR, despite the potential for this reaction to direct VSG switching of telomeric genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boothroyd et al., 2009</xref>). Inefficient engagement of a DSB in HR-mediated repair is consistent with the qPCR we describe after I-SceI-mediated cleavage of the BES (see below). In contrast, RTR action on recombination intermediates, including Holliday junctions, that can arise following replication fork stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mankouri and Hickson, 2007</xref>) may more readily explain the <italic>T. brucei</italic> RTR phenotypes, leading to the suggestion that replication-associated instability initiates VSG switching (below).</p><p>Targeted formation of a DSB to elicit recombination and allow temporal analysis of repair has been most extensively described in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hicks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Renkawitz et al., 2013</xref>). Such studies suggest that endonuclease cleavage, DNA DSB processing and recruitment of Rad51 occur rapidly, with homology search and functional engagement of a homologous DNA substrate being slower reactions that follow from the break. As has been stated elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2013</xref>), the main effect of an I-SceI-induced DSB in the active BES is cell death, to a larger extent than the same lesion in the interior of chromosome 11. By monitoring the presence of an intact I-SceI site, we show that cleavage occurs in HRES cells at least as rapidly as in HR1, with few cells retaining an intact site after ~8 hr (1 cell cycle). I-SceI cleavage therefore appears to be rapid in <italic>T. brucei</italic> also, with a timing largely consistent with formation of single-stranded DNA, cell cycle impairment and the detection of damage by formation of either RAD51 or γH2A foci (all at around 12 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glover and Horn, 2014</xref>). However, whereas loss of PCR-amplifiable I-SceI sequence is maintained in HR1 cells from ~8–72 hr after I-SceI induction, intact I-SceI target sequence reforms at least twice in HRES cells over the 32 hr after induction. After the I-SceI site is maximally cleaved in HR1 cells, recombination product (primarily gene conversion from the unbroken chromosome 11 homologue) gradually forms over the next 72 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glover et al., 2008</xref>), consistent with induction of repair. In contrast, the abundance of the <italic>VSG</italic> gene (<italic>VSG221</italic>) positioned downstream of the I-SceI site in HRES closely mirrors that of the I-SceI target sequence and, moreover, virtually all HRES cells continue to express VSG221 protein 24 hr after I-SceI induction. Collectively, these data reinforce the evidence for distinct responses to a DSB in the two locations examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glover and Horn, 2014</xref>). In addition, these data reveal that repair efficiency and profile is markedly different in the active BES compared with the interior of chromosome 11. In fact, the data suggest that recovery of VSG switchers following induction of a DSB in the active BES may not result from rapid induction of efficient <italic>VSG</italic>-directed HR. Instead, switchers may be selected: i.e. most HRES cells that suffer a DSB die because repair is inefficient, and the population is gradually replaced thereafter, initially by cells in which the I-SceI site has not been cut and gradually by cells that have undergone a VSG switch that removes the I-SceI target. Given the slow kinetics of repair after Rad51 loading in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hicks et al., 2011</xref>), it seems likely that the explanation for the high rate of death after DSB formation in the active <italic>T. brucei</italic> BES is that strand exchange (homology search, invasion or resolution) is very inefficient in this setting. Why this might be awaits further analysis, but it may reflect the limited length or level of sequence identity between <italic>VSG</italic> flanks (including the 70 bp repeats), or the complexity in searching for a repair substrate throughout the <italic>VSG</italic> archive.</p><p>What might explain VSG switch initiation, if not the direct formation of a DSB, such as by an endonuclease? MFAseq mapping, validated by VSG-focused qPCR, provides the first evidence that initiation could be linked to DNA replication. Throughout the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome, we reveal pronounced rigidity in core genome replication timing, with the same origins used with the same efficiency in both BSF and PCF cells. In this context, the actively transcribed BES is unique, being the single mapped telomeric site that is early replicating, and the only locus in the genome that displays different replication timing in PCF and BSF cells. As all BES are silenced and late replicating in PCF cells, the singular early replication of the active BES in mammal-infective <italic>T. brucei</italic> suggests a model for VSG switch initiation in which transcription of the BES allows the site to become accessible for replication and establishes conditions that generate instability, most likely through replication-transcription clashes within the BES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Replication stalling can generate the structures that the RTR complex acts upon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cejka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mankouri and Hickson, 2007</xref>), explaining the differing contributions of TbRECQ2 to VSG switching and I-SceI-induced DSB repair. Moreover, stalling of replication by transcription can lead to DNA rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bermejo et al., 2012</xref>) and pausing of the replication fork has been shown to induce targeted mating type switching in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klar et al., 2014</xref>). How early replication of the active BES in <italic>T. brucei</italic> BSF cells occurs is currently unclear, in particular because replication direction cannot be determined from the MFAseq data. Thus, two possibilities can be considered. In one scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), replication initiates from the BES promoter environment, which would be compatible with the close association between origin activity and TbORC1/CDC6 binding at transcription start sites in the genome core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tiengwe et al., 2012</xref>). Though replication and transcription would be co-directional in this model, clashes between the two processes can occur in this arrangement due to the different rates of the reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Merrikh et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, it is possible that replication or transcription could encounter progression difficulties in traversing the 70 bp repeats, providing some localisation of the clashes, which may lead to DNA breaks, including DSBs. A complication in this model is uncertainty about whether control of BES transcription is exerted by differential promoter activity in the active versus the silent BES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kassem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>). In a second model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), replication initiates at the telomere of the BES, leading to head-on collision with transcription; variation in the location of the collisions might explain the uncertainty of DSB mapping in the BES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boothroyd et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jehi et al., 2014</xref>), and events that lead to gene loss or replacement upstream of the 70 bp repeats. Recently, TbORC1/CDC6 has been documented to bind telomeres in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, but whether this is selective for the active BES, and if it reflects a role in gene silencing or directing replication, is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benmerzouga et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast with the data here, previous work has shown that the replicated copies of the active BES are segregated later than silent BES during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Landeira et al., 2009</xref>). This observation is not incompatible with unique early replication of the active BES and could, indeed, be explained by a delay in chromatid separation due to the increased presence of unresolved recombination intermediates between sister chromatids at this telomeric locus.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12765.016</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Two models for replication-directed VSG switching.</title><p>A schematic of a bloodstream <italic>VSG</italic>expression site is shown (<bold>A</bold>; not to scale), detailing key features (left to right): the promoter (flag), a number of expression site-asscociated genes (ESAGs; blue boxes), 70 bp repeats (hatched box), the <italic>VSG</italic> gene (red box) and the telomere repeats (white arrows).

For each sample, 0.18 ng of gDNA was used, and the data shown are averages of itriplicate experiments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [089172, 093589], the BBSRC [BB/K006495/1] and Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT, Portugal) [SFRH/BD/68784/2010].

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Losick as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>The manuscript under consideration from Devlin and colleagues addresses the fascinating problem of antigenic variation in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (&quot;VSG Switching&quot;), which is at the heart of this parasites ability to cause disease in humans and other mammals. The manuscript attempts to clarify the important issue of how the mechanism of coat variation is initiated. The authors report the very interesting result that while origins of replication are conserved (presumably in location and firing) in the two trypanosome life forms (PC and BF), the lone exception is the active BES in the BF which replicates early. From there, the implication is that replication is key for the initiation of VSG switching, and the authors go some way toward showing that. It's not an unexpected result, necessarily (it was one of the mechanisms contemplated by many in the field) but it is really nice to see it substantiated experimentally. This could well be the mechanism that produces the DNA DSB that is an obligate intermediate of any cut and paste recombination event.</p><p>And really, that's the only (but significant) problem with the paper: that they try to &quot;invalidate&quot; a substantial body of data showing that this is the case, through experiments that are either over interpreted, or potentially misinterpreted. Because indeed, it is rather likely that the recQ mutant accumulates DNA damage, some of which could be a direct DSB or a SSB that develops into a DSB. The authors might want to examine DSB formation in the mutants, for instance to demonstrate this.</p><p>The recommendation therefore will be for &quot;major revision&quot;, ideally with the main focus being on the robust experimental data implicating replication (and RECQ2, and transcription fork stalling, potentially) as an initiating event to VSG recombination. This revision should be chiefly textual but an also include additional experiments, as summarized below.</p><p>Summary of main concerns:</p><p>1) The loss of RECQ2 resulted in fewer survivors in HR1 and HRES cells, but RECQ2 null cells have higher VSG switching rate than WT cells. The authors therefore concluded that DSBs are not linked with the initiation of VSG switching. In my opinion, the observation that RECQ2 null cells have higher VSG switching rate is consistent with the idea that DSBs induce VSG switching. It is important to note that RECQ2 may also play an important role in DNA replication in addition to DNA damage repair. Therefore, loss of RECQ2 is expected to result in more DSBs (due to less efficient repair of DSBs or due to increased DSB formation resulting from more replication fork stalling or due to both reasons), which in turn can lead to more frequent VSG switching. The key experiment here is to examine whether RECQ2 null cells have more DSBs at subtelomeres or not. This can be done by LMPCR or IF/ChIP using γH2A/RAD51 antibodies. In addition, it is important to test whether RECQ2 plays an important role in DNA replication. If RECQ2 null cells have more replication fork stalling induced DSBs, switchers can arise from recombination events different than those observed in HRES cells, where repair of an induced DSB is assayed.</p><p>2) The second concern is about the I-SceI induction in HRES cells. This essentially repeated the same experiment done in Glover et al. 2013, however, with a different outcome. In Glover et al. 2013, all survivors from cells with an I-SceI cut between 70 bp repeats and the active VSG gene are switchers, while in the current study many survivors did not switch. The authors speculated that VSG2 expressers were simply not digested by I-SceI. Therefore, the I-SceI digestion seemed not as efficient as it was in Glover et al. 2013, which was more than 50% (by γH2A IF analysis). However, it is not shown how efficient the I-SceI digestion is induced in this manuscript. It is important to determine the I-SceI digestion efficiency as a control and equally important to increase the induction efficiency to ensure a proper assay. On the other hand, it is possible that the I-SceI cut was efficiently repaired if the digestion occurs in G2 phase where a sister chromatid is available. It would be better if the authors can specifically induce I-SceI cut in G1 and G2 phases separately, but this possibility should be at least discussed. In addition, possible reasons for the different results of this study and the one in Glover et al. 2013 should be discussed.</p><p>3) DNA fragility resulting from collisions between DNA replication and transcription machinery is an exciting hypothesis (supported by data in other organisms) that has been asserted previously in <italic>T. brucei</italic> switching and the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in support of this prediction a potential strength of this manuscript that should have been explored further. However, DNA fragility in the actively expressed subtelomere doesn't directly argue against &quot;direct formation of DSBs.… [as] the initiating event in VSG switching,&quot; as the authors would suggest. Based on the observations, it seems equally likely that DNA replication through the actively transcribed region is a challenge that requires RECQ2 function, while loss of RECQ2 likely causes more replication fork stalling, resulting in more DSBs and leading to more VSG switching subsequently. It is therefore important to examine DNA replication in the active ES in RECQ2 null cells.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mapping replication dynamics in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> reveals a link with telomere transcription and antigenic variation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been much improved but there are some remaining issues (noted by reviewers 1 &amp; 2) that need to be addressed with textual changes before formal acceptance, as outlined below (reviewer 3 had no additional concerns).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>While the newly added data are compelling, the revision under consideration does not address a major concern that the data are presented in a somewhat confused manner. For instance, the wording regarding how breaks arise and whether they are made &quot;directly&quot; is my biggest concern. After reading both drafts of the manuscript multiple times and the response to reviewers, I now understand that by &quot;directly&quot; the authors are speaking of a hypothesis that a specific endonuclease could initiate DNA break formation and switching. This is problematic for two reasons:</p><p>1) There is no longer a &quot;prevailing hypothesis&quot; that a specific endonuclease has a role in switch initiation. There are numerous studies and reviews that either show switching arising from DNA fragility (non-enzymatic) or suggest that DNA replication, transcription, or other forms of site instability are the basis for the DNA lesions that resulting VSG switching. Nonetheless, it is completely reasonable to have this be the main question the paper is addressing, as long as it is clear.</p><p>2) The language around this whole subject in the manuscript is confounding and open to misinterpretation. In the author's response, they clarify this issue in the following statement, &quot;The implications of this analysis are important. For instance, it would erroneous for researchers to hunt for a <italic>T. brucei</italic>-encoded endonuclease that cleaves the BES; in addition, data from the use of ISceI-mediated cleavage to model VSG switch initiation must be interpreted with caution, as it may not recapitulate the 'natural' route of initiation&quot;.</p><p>This is a very important point and should be stated in the manuscript. Also, in the manuscript Introduction (third paragraph) the authors clearly describe the problem they are seeking to address and in essence define what is meant by &quot;directly.&quot; But the word &quot;directly&quot; is not used in that passage to clarify their word choice. If directly were defined here many of the difficulties with this paper might be cleared up. Are breaks formed by recombination or transcriptional instability occurring &quot;indirectly&quot;, only if they clearly defined as such.</p><p>This is not a trivial issue as the use of vague language in the Abstract could lead to a complete misunderstanding by some readers who would read it to think the authors propose breaks are not involved at all.</p><p>Recommendation #1:</p><p>Use of the word &quot;directly&quot; should be removed from the Abstract and replaced with clearer language. Then it can be defined in the Introduction and used thereafter.</p><p>Second major concern:</p><p>It is confounding that a paper built on high-quality data and presenting interesting findings is constructed in a manner that distracts from the findings. Specifically, (from the first paragraph of subsection “A DNA doublestrand break in the VSG expression site is inefficiently repaired”), there is nothing &quot;dichotomous&quot; about the observation that RECQ2 knock-down increases sensitivity to DNA damage and increases switching. If fact, the entire body of data in this paper consistently suggest that RECQ2 has a role in DNA damage repair, which may be linked to specific aspects of DNA replication.</p><p>Recommendation #2:</p><p>The question the paper aims to address should be more clearly stated. If the real question is &quot;how VSG switching is initiated&quot; or &quot;what is the initiating lesion that activates recombinatorial switching&quot; then the authors should state this directly. If they think a major conclusion from these findings is that it is unlikely that a site specific endonuclease is involved they should discuss this in the Introduction and possibly mention it clearly in the Abstract.</p><p>The data in each Results section should be presented without interpretation. The conclusions and interpretations reserved for the Discussion. This approach would strengthen the manuscript by highlighting the quality of the data and deemphasizing the existing over-interpretations.</p><p>While the data and discoveries are (and previously were) publication worthy, in my view, the manuscript needs a major rewrite with a change of tone and emphasis on the data that is presented and the specific question the authors aimed to address.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This revised manuscript has improved greatly. The authors have added several key new results and improved the discussions.</p><p>Specifically regarding the authors' conclusion that &quot;phenotypes from RECQ2 null cells argue against models for VSG switch initiation based upon direct DNA break formation&quot;, based on the authors' rebuttal and more explanation, this reviewer feels what the authors want to state is that DNA breaks can form due to replication stress, which in turn can induce VSG switching. Therefore, direct DNA break formation, such as a consequence of a specific endonuclease activity, is unlikely the first step of VSG switching. In this regard, this reviewer agrees with the authors. However, this reviewer feels that the term &quot;direct DNA break formation&quot; may not have explained this clearly enough. At this stage, just a few more sentences to clearly describe what do the authors mean about &quot;direct DNA break formation&quot; should suffice.</p><p>This reviewer appreciates the authors now have performed additional experiments to confirm that when VSG221 is active, it is replicated early, but when it's silenced, it is replicated late. This is a very strong piece of evidence supporting the hypothesis that replication timing is linked with transcription state. The MFA data on VSG121, however, is not as strong. The fact that there are several genomic copies of VSG121 and the fact that VSG121 may not be the sole active VSG among the analyzed population make it hard to interpret the data. It is probably better not to extrapolate too much.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12765.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>General assessment:</italic> </p><p><italic>The manuscript under consideration from Devlin and colleagues addresses the fascinating problem of antigenic variation in T. brucei (&quot;VSG Switching&quot;), which is at the heart of this parasites ability to cause disease in humans and other mammals.

Though the referees are correct that a link with replication has been noted in the field, in fact such contemplation has had little foundation, since we had essentially no knowledge of the replication dynamics of <italic>T. brucei</italic> chromosome (sub)telomeres. Our new data fills this gap in knowledge, but it is important to note (as we have tried hard to stress in the paper) that the potential link between BES replication dynamics and VSG switching remains an association (see below). We have gone to some lengths to emphasise there is considerable uncertainty in the nature of the BES replication (please see the model that we propose, and discussion below), and that extensive and challenging experimental tests of this new hypothesis are needed in the future.</p><p><italic>And really, that's the only (but significant) problem with the paper: that they try to &quot;invalidate&quot; a substantial body of data showing that this is the case, through experiments that are either over interpreted, or potentially misinterpreted. Because indeed, it is rather likely that the recQ mutant accumulates DNA damage, some of which could be a direct DSB or a SSB that develops into a DSB. The authors might want to examine DSB formation in the mutants, for instance to demonstrate this.</italic></p><p>We’re a little bemused by the suggestion that we are attempting, in the analysis of RECQ2, to ‘invalidate’ previous data. We have no wish to invalidate peer-reviewed, published work. As we have stated, the published data linking DSBs with initiation of antigenic variation are association studies: detection of DNA damage by ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR) in the BESs, and the demonstration that endonuclease-mediated DSBs can lead to VSG switching. Association studies can only allow the formulation of a hypothesis that DSBs are linked to VSG switch initiation. Thus, the state of the field is that the prevailing hypothesis needs to be critically tested (just as we have stressed above for the link between the new replication data and VSG switching). As an example of why experimental testing needs done, the available data cannot determine the route(s) by which DSBs arise in the BES. In analysing the role of RECQ2, we provide the first test of whether directly formed DSBs are a likely initiating lesion. Our conclusions are not, as the referees suggest (see below, comment 1), that ‘DSBs are not linked with the initiation of VSG switching’. Instead, we have stated that the inconsistency between the effects of RECQ2 mutation on repair of induced DSBs and on the rate and profile of VSG switching indicates that if DSBs are the initiating lesion (which remains entirely possible), it is unlikely they arise directly. The implications of this analysis are important. For instance, it would erroneous for researchers to hunt for a <italic>T. brucei</italic>-encoded endonuclease that cleaves the BES; in addition, data from the use of ISceI-mediated cleavage to model VSG switch initiation must be interpreted with caution, as it may not recapitulate the ‘natural’ route of initiation (though it remains a valuable strategy to model VSG switch dynamics).</p><p>Given our RECQ2 data suggest DSBs do not to arise directly it became important we provide an alternative model for switch initiation might occur – hence why we explored replication dynamics of the BES. Again, to be absolutely clear, we are well aware the available data linking BES replication and VSG switch initiation is also an association, and we have tried hard to stress this new hypothesis needs critical testing.</p><p><italic>The recommendation therefore will be for &quot;major revision&quot;, ideally with the main focus being on the robust experimental data implicating replication (and RECQ2, and transcription fork stalling, potentially) as an initiating event to VSG recombination. This revision should be chiefly textual but an also include additional experiments, as summarized below.</italic></p><p><italic>Summary of main concerns:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The loss of RECQ2 resulted in fewer survivors in HR1 and HRES cells, but RECQ2 null cells have higher VSG switching rate than WT cells. The authors therefore concluded that DSBs are not linked with the initiation of VSG switching. In my opinion, the observation that RECQ2 null cells have higher VSG switching rate is consistent with the idea that DSBs induce VSG switching. It is important to note that RECQ2 may also play an important role in DNA replication in addition to DNA damage repair. Therefore, loss of RECQ2 is expected to result in more DSBs (due to less efficient repair of DSBs or due to increased DSB formation resulting from more replication fork stalling or due to both reasons), which in turn can lead to more frequent VSG switching. The key experiment here is to examine whether RECQ2 null cells have more DSBs at subtelomeres or not. This can be done by LMPCR or IF/ChIP using γH2A/RAD51 antibodies. In addition, it is important to test whether RECQ2 plays an important role in DNA replication. If RECQ2 null cells have more replication fork stalling induced DSBs, switchers can arise from recombination events different than those observed in HRES cells, where repair of an induced DSB is assayed.</italic></p><p>As stated above, nowhere do we conclude that ‘DSBs are not linked with the initiation of VSG switching’. Instead, our conclusion is that ‘the <underline>direct</underline> formation of a DSB is unlikely to be the route for initiation of <italic>T. brucei</italic> antigenic variation’. In the final Discussion paragraph, we attempted to discuss how replication stalling may link to previous LMPCR data that detected DNA breaks within the BESs (Boothroyd et al., 2009; Glover et al., 2013; Jehi et al., 2014), but we acknowledge we failed to state that stalling may result in DSBs. As a result, we have modified the text:</p><p>“In addition, it is possible that replication or transcription could encounter progression difficulties in traversing the 70 bp repeats, providing some localisation of the clashes, <underline>which may lead to DNA breaks, including DSBs</underline>.”</p><p>“In a second model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), replication initiates at the telomere of the BES, leading to head-on collision with transcription; variation in the location of the collisions might explain the uncertainty of <underline>DSB</underline> mapping in the BES (Boothroyd et al., 2009; Glover et al., 2013; Jehi et al., 2014).”</p><p>At this stage, it is a major undertaking to evaluate DSB quantity within the BES. First, these loci are highly homologous, seriously compromising any attempts at chIP mapping. Second, our attempts to date at chIP with anti-RAD51 antiserum suggest it is not chIP-compatible (data not shown). Third, we are unconvinced that LMPCR is capable of providing quantification of lesion abundance, given it is based upon end-point PCR. Thus, to ask if RECQ2 mutants, in general, display altered replication or contain more lesions than WT, we provide two new sets of data.</p><p>First, we compared the cell cycle distribution of WT cells and the RECQ2 mutants by DAΠ staining, and could find no compelling evidence the mutants displayed an alteration relative to WT, suggesting that lack of RECQ2 does not result in detectable stalling at a discernible cell cycle stage. These data are added as a new panel to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(1C)</xref>. We have added the following text to the paper to refer to these data:</p><p>“To ask if the growth change [in the mutants] results from an impediment in completing a cell cycle stage or traversing between sequential stages, cells were stained with DAΠ to visualise nuclear (N) and kinetoplast (K) DNA. […] Thus, the growth impairment of the RECQ2 mutants is not due to detectable stalling at a discernible cell cycle stage or transition.”</p><p>Second, we have used western blotting to evaluate levels of γ H2A (thr130 phosphorylated H2A) and find evidence there is increased signal intensity of the repair-associated histone modification in the <italic>recq2</italic>-/- mutants, indicating greater levels of endogenous nuclear damage. These data are added as a new panel to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 (1D)</xref> and we have added the following text:</p><p>“Western blotting to detect the levels of Thr130 phosphorylated histone H2A (γ-H2A) revealed an increased signal in the <italic>recq2-/-</italic> mutants relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating this modification accumulates in the absence of the helicase to an extent comparable to that seen in WT or -/- mutants cells grown for 18 hr in 0.0003% MMS (see below). […] Thus, accumulation of the histone variant in the <italic>recq2-/-</italic> mutants indicates an increased level of nuclear DNA damage, which appears not to impair cell cycle progression but may impede cell growth or survival.”</p><p><italic>2) The second concern is about the I-SceI induction in HRES cells. This essentially repeated the same experiment done in Glover et al. 2013, however, with a different outcome. In Glover et al. 2013, all survivors from cells with an I-SceI cut between 70 bp repeats and the active VSG gene are switchers, while in the current study many survivors did not switch. The authors speculated that VSG2 expressers were simply not digested by I-SceI. Therefore, the I-SceI digestion seemed not as efficient as it was in Glover et al. 2013, which was more than 50% (by γH2A IF analysis). However, it is not shown how efficient the I-SceI digestion is induced in this manuscript. It is important to determine the I-SceI digestion efficiency as a control and equally important to increase the induction efficiency to ensure a proper assay. On the other hand, it is possible that the I-SceI cut was efficiently repaired if the digestion occurs in G2 phase where a sister chromatid is available. It would be better if the authors can specifically induce I-SceI cut in G1 and G2 phases separately, but this possibility should be at least discussed. In addition, possible reasons for the different results of this study and the one in Glover et al. 2013 should be discussed.</italic></p><p>I’m afraid that we don’t agree with the above interpretation of our findings, which in fact are very comparable with the data for HRES cells described by Glover and colleagues in both their 2013 (PLoS Pathogen) and 2014 (Nucleic Acid Res) papers.</p><p>A) <italic>In Glover et al. 2013, all survivors from cells with an I-SceI cut between 70 bp repeats and the active VSG gene are switchers, while in the current study many survivors did not switch.</italic> This statement is incorrect. In our study, as in Glover et al. 2013, all analysed clonal survivors after ISceI induction of WT HRES cells had switched the expressed VSG. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> we perform PCR on 25 HRES WT survivors and show that none retained the VSG221 gene, meaning they must be expressing another VSG; Glover et al. found, by the same PCR, that 1/22 HRES survivors retained the VSG221 gene, though no longer expressed the protein. An anomaly in our study is that 4% of the HRES WT survivors were still resistant to puromycin, for reasons that are unclear.</p><p>B) <italic>The authors speculated that VSG2 expressers were simply not digested by I-SceI.</italic> This statement appears to be referring to results for the RECQ2 mutants, where we were attempting to explain the greater numbers of puromycin-resistant HRES RECQ2 mutant clones after ISceI induction. On re- reading, we can see that this was unclear and have therefore changed the wording:</p><p>“These data are most simply explained by a greater number of HRES <italic>recq2-/-</italic> mutants being recovered (relative to HR1 mutants) in which a DSB has not been induced, reflecting the very limited survival capacity of <italic>recq2-/-</italic> mutants after a DSB is made in the active BES.”</p><p>C) <italic>Therefore, the I-SceI digestion seemed not as efficient as it was in Glover et al. 2013, which was more than 50% (by γH2A IF analysis). However, it is not shown how efficient the I-SceI digestion is induced in this manuscript. It is important to determine the I-SceI digestion efficiency as a control.</italic> In fact, we directly assess the efficiency of ISceI cleavage using a qPCR assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These data reveal 80-100% of cells do not have intact (PCR-amplifiable) ISceI sequence 2-8 hrs after Tet addition, arguing that cleavage is extremely efficient (in fact, more efficient than in HR1 cells). This seems to us a more direct measure of DNA cleavage than assessing levels of modified histone, though we find (Devlin and McCulloch, unpublished) that 12 and 24 hrs after Tet addition the average signal intensity of γH2A (evaluated by IF) in HRES cells increases around 4-fold relative to uninduced HRES cells. This finding appears very comparable with the increase in γH2A foci from 10% in uninduced HRES cells to around 50% in HRES cells 12 hr after Tet addition (Glover et al., 2014).</p><p>In summary, we suggest that our data display good overlap with those described previously by Glover et al., both in terms of efficiency of ISceI-mediated BES cleavage and induction of switching by loss of VSG221. Just as importantly, we also observe the main response to a DSB mediated by ISceI in the active BES is cell death, to a very similar extent to that described by Glover et al.</p><p><italic>3) DNA fragility resulting from collisions between DNA replication and transcription machinery is an exciting hypothesis (supported by data in other organisms) that has been asserted previously in T. brucei switching and the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in support of this prediction a potential strength of this manuscript that should have been explored further. However, DNA fragility in the actively expressed subtelomere doesn't directly argue against &quot;direct formation of DSBs.… [as] the initiating event in VSG switching,&quot; as the authors would suggest. Based on the observations, it seems equally likely that DNA replication through the actively transcribed region is a challenge that requires RECQ2 function, while loss of RECQ2 likely causes more replication fork stalling, resulting in more DSBs and leading to more VSG switching subsequently. It is therefore important to examine DNA replication in the active ES in RECQ2 null cells.</italic></p><p>In the above quote, the statement we make is taken out of context. The full statement is: “We show that loss of TbRECQ2 impairs DSB repair, consistent with the observation that the protein localizes to such lesions. Conversely, TbRECQ2 mutants display elevated rates of VSG switching, indicating it is unlikely that the direct formation of DSBs is the initiating event in VSG switching.” We are specifically referring to the RECQ2 data, which argue against VSG switch initiation through direct formation of a DSB, such as occurs by ISceI cleavage.</p><p>It is important to be clear about what we can, and what we cannot say from the available data. Our data argue that RECQ2 acts in VSG switching, consistent with the widespread role for homologous recombination in this immune evasion process. However, our data also show that the mode of action of RECQ2 in VSG switching is inconsistent with how the <italic>T. brucei</italic> protein (indeed all RecQ homologues) acts upon a directly generated DSB. Thus, we should discount (or at the very least question) the direct formation of a DSB as being the route to VSG switch initiation. It is of course possible that ‘loss of RECQ2 likely causes more replication fork stalling, resulting in more DSBs and leading to more VSG switching subsequently’. However, we do not yet know the direction, rate or initiation site of replication in the BES; nor do we know if replication stalls somewhere in the BES, or what structures form if stalling occurs. In our view, it is overly speculative to make any such assertions at this stage, and hence we have proposed a limited model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) in which we have been circumspect in how we discuss the mode of action of RECQ2 in VSG switching and the proposed link between replication and VSG switching.</p><p>We agree that <italic>it is therefore important to examine DNA replication in the active ES in RECQ2 null cells</italic>: examining replication dynamics, both in WT and RECQ2 mutant cells, will provide critical tests of the hypothesis we propose, just as examining RECQ2 has provided a test of the hypothesis that directly-formed DSBs initiate VSG switching. However, I’m sure the referees appreciate that such tests are a long-term endeavour, necessitating new single molecule approaches to evaluate BES replication dynamics, since MFAseq is too crude for such analyses.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript has been much improved but there are some remaining issues (noted by reviewers 1 &amp; 2) that need to be addressed with textual changes before formal acceptance, as outlined below (reviewer 3 had no additional concerns).</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>While the newly added data are compelling, the revision under consideration does not address a major concern that the data are presented in a somewhat confused manner.</italic></p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p> <italic>This is not a trivial issue as the use of vague language in the Abstract could lead to a complete misunderstanding by some readers who would read it to think the authors propose breaks are not involved at all.</italic> </p><p> <italic>Recommendation #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Use of the word &quot;directly&quot; should be removed from the Abstract and replaced with clearer language. Then it can be defined in the Introduction and used thereafter.</italic></p><p>A) We have restructured the final paragraph of the Introduction to provide greater clarity:</p><p>“Despite the emerging association between DNA DSBs and VSG switching, questions remain about the detailed mechanism(s) of VSG switch initiation. For instance, are DSBs generated directly in the active BES, such as through the action of an endonuclease, as occurs during S. cerevisiae mating type switching (Lee and Haber, 2015)?[…] Second, we provide evidence for strong association between replication timing and BES transcription, indicating that VSG switch initiation may be mechanistically linked to DNA replication.”</p><p>B) We have altered the wording of the Abstract:</p><p>“Survival of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> depends upon switches in its protective Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) coat by antigenic variation. VSG switching occurs by frequent homologous recombination, which is thought to require locus-specific initiation. […] Specific association between VSG transcription and replication timing reveals a model for antigenic variation based on replication-derived DNA fragility”.</p><p><italic>Second major concern:</italic></p><p><italic>It is confounding that a paper built on high-quality data and presenting interesting findings is constructed in a manner that distracts from the findings.</italic></p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>While the data and discoveries are (and previously were) publication worthy, in my view, the manuscript needs a major rewrite with a change of tone and emphasis on the data that is presented and the specific question the authors aimed to address.</italic></p><p>We have rewritten the opening paragraph of the Discussion, more clearly stating our interpretation of the data in the paper and emphasising that we believe endonuclease-mediated DSB formation is unlikely to be the route for VSG switch initiation. We also emphasise the continued uncertainty of exactly what lesion might first form in the active BES to drive antigenic variation:</p><p>“Understanding the initiation event(s) of VSG switching by recombination is important, since this element of the reaction may be lineage-specific, and might explain both the elevated rate of the reaction relative to general HR (which catalyses the change in VSG) and the potential focus on the active BES. […] To test the role of endonuclease-generated, BES-focused DSBs in the initiation of VSG switching, we first analysed the genome repair functions of one of two <italic>T. brucei</italic> RecQ-like proteins, TbRECQ2.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>Comments:</italic></p><p> <italic>This revised manuscript has improved greatly. The authors have added several key new results and improved the discussions.</italic> </p><p><italic>Specifically regarding the authors' conclusion that &quot;phenotypes from RECQ2 null cells argue against models for VSG switch initiation based upon direct DNA break formation&quot;, based on the authors' rebuttal and more explanation, this reviewer feels what the authors want to state is that DNA breaks can form due to replication stress, which in turn can induce VSG switching. Therefore, direct DNA break formation, such as a consequence of a specific endonuclease activity, is unlikely the first step of VSG switching. In this regard, this reviewer agrees with the authors. However, this reviewer feels that the term &quot;direct DNA break formation&quot; may not have explained this clearly enough. At this stage, just a few more sentences to clearly describe what do the authors mean about &quot;direct DNA break formation&quot; should suffice.</italic></p><p>Please see corrections listed above (to Abstract, Introduction and Discussion), which we hope have clarified the text.</p><p><italic>This reviewer appreciates the authors now have performed additional experiments to confirm that when VSG221 is active, it is replicated early, but when it's silenced, it is replicated late. This is a very strong piece of evidence supporting the hypothesis that replication timing is linked with transcription state. The MFA data on VSG121, however, is not as strong. The fact that there are several genomic copies of VSG121 and the fact that VSG121 may not be the sole active VSG among the analyzed population make it hard to interpret the data. It is probably better not to extrapolate too much.</italic></p><p>We have stated the following, which we hope sufficiently indicates the uncertainty of BES transcription, or at least VSG121 replication timing, in the BES1 TetR blockade cells:</p><p>“Despite the potentially confounding effect of VSG121 array copies that may be late replicating, as well as uncertainty about the transcriptional status of all the VSG BES in these cells, these data suggest earlier replication of VSG121 when the VSG221-containing BES1 is silenced and BES3 is at least one of the BES expressed in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> population”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
