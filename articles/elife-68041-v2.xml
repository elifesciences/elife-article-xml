brain circuits that control voluntary movements, but our understanding of its influence on the activity of target neurons in vivo remains limited. Here, we use two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to monitor the activity of direct and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs) simultaneously in the striatum of behaving mice during acute and prolonged manipulations of DA signaling. We find that increasing and decreasing DA biases striatal activity toward the direct and indirect pathways, respectively, by changing the overall number of SPNs recruited during behavior in a manner not predicted by existing models of DA function. This modulation is drastically altered in a model of Parkinson’s disease. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated population-level influence of DA on striatal output and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>basal ganglia</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd><kwd>Parkinson’s disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00NS087098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tritsch</surname><given-names>Nicolas X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2NS105553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tritsch</surname><given-names>Nicolas X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Considerable evidence in humans, primates, and rodents implicates DA in supporting motor learning and in executing vigorous movements via its actions in the striatum, the principal input nucleus to the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graybiel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Turner and Desmurget, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dudman and Krakauer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klaus et al., 2019</xref>). The striatum mainly consists of two large populations of inhibitory spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that belong to the direct and indirect pathways (dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively). The former directly inhibits output nuclei of the basal ganglia, including the internal globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata, while the latter promotes their activity indirectly by way of the external globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus. Although long believed to exert opposite effects on movement, dSPNs and iSPNs are now known to be concurrently active and to work in concert to produce coherent sequences of voluntary movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Klaus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Markowitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Parker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sheng et al., 2019</xref>). How DA influences the activity of dSPNs and iSPNs in vivo to affect movement, however, remains poorly understood.</p><p>Because dSPNs express Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled D<sub>1</sub>-type DA receptors and iSPNs Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled D<sub>2</sub>-type DA receptors, DA is widely believed to differentially modulate both pathways and to promote imbalances that impact how the basal ganglia contribute to behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nelson and Kreitzer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klaus et al., 2019</xref>). Electrophysiological studies in brain slices have identified several ion channels and synaptic properties in SPNs susceptible to differential modulation by DA on both short and long timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhai et al., 2019</xref>). DA has for instance been shown to modify the intrinsic excitability of SPNs over the course of seconds to minutes, increasing and reducing the number of action potentials produced by dSPNs and iSPNs in response to somatic current injection, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hernandez-Lopez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ericsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Planert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lahiri and Bevan, 2020</xref>). These effects may account for DA’s ability to transiently motivate behavior and invigorate motor actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Panigrahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>). DA receptor signaling also promotes the long-term potentiation and depression of cortico-striatal glutamatergic synapses in dSPNs and iSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calabresi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pawlak and Kerr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen et al., 2008</xref>). Such plasticity may underlie motor learning and the formation of motor habits by striatal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koralek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yttri and Dudman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iino et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Although ex vivo studies provide compelling evidence that DA directly promotes the activation of dSPNs and impedes that of iSPNs, there are good reasons to believe that DA’s modulatory effects in vivo may be more complex. First, DA does not act exclusively on SPNs. DA receptors are also found on excitatory afferents, inhibitory SPN collaterals and striatal interneurons, all of which participate in shaping striatal output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhai et al., 2019</xref>). Second, SPNs are constantly exposed to DA, as midbrain DA neurons fire action potentials tonically at 3–10 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grace and Bunney, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). Given that a single pulse of DA alters the excitability of SPNs for several minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lahiri and Bevan, 2020</xref>), additional modulation by rising DA may be occluded in vivo. Alternatively, the relatively low affinity of D<sub>1</sub> receptors for DA compared to D<sub>2</sub> receptors raises the possibility that dSPNs may only be sensitive to rising DA levels, while iSPNs may selectively respond to drops in extracellular DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaulieu and Gainetdinov, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). Third, although in vivo studies comparing SPN discharge before and after DA neuron lesions in animal models of Parkinson’s disease support the view that DA differentially modulates firing rates in dSPNs and iSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mallet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>), they do not directly speak to DA’s actions under physiological conditions, as chronic loss of DA evokes widespread homeostatic adaptations in striatal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhai et al., 2019</xref>). Lastly, whether DA modulates other aspects of striatal output in addition to discharge rates, such as bursting or population-level striatal activity patterns, has been explored less extensively.</p><p>Recent imaging studies show that distinct motor actions are represented in striatum by separate groups – or ensembles – of SPNs, and that individual renditions of a given action recruit a sparse subset of SPNs from these larger action-specific ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Klaus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Markowitz et al., 2018</xref>). It is presently not clear how plastic these neural representations are, and if DA plays a role in sculpting them. Here, we test this possibility using two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to monitor dSPN and iSPN ensembles simultaneously in the striatum of behaving mice. We report that acute and chronic DA manipulations strongly modify the overall size of movement-related ensembles in both dSPNs and iSPNs, resulting in pathway imbalances. Importantly, DA receptor signaling does not modulate dSPN and iSPN ensembles in opposite ways. Although the size of iSPN ensembles is inversely related to DA signaling, dSPN ensembles follow an inverted U-shaped response. Chronic loss of midbrain DA neurons in a model of advanced Parkinson’s disease is associated with a selective decrease in the number of active dSPNs and with dramatic changes in how movement-related dSPN ensembles respond to DA. Our results therefore reveal that, in addition to its effects on firing rates, DA regulates striatal output by reconfiguring its movement-related ensemble code.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Simultaneous imaging of dSPN and iSPN activity</title><p>To resolve the activity of individual striatal neurons in vivo, we expressed the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) virally in the dorsolateral striatum under control of the synapsin promoter to label all neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Despite compensatory changes in iSPNs, the overall size of SPN ensembles recruited over the course of imaging sessions remained significantly biased toward the indirect pathway in chronically lesioned mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These results therefore indicate that DA depletion strongly biases striatal activity toward the indirect pathway both acutely and chronically, and point to plasticity mechanisms that normalize the number of active iSPNs, but not dSPNs, upon persistent absence of DA signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Chronic DA depletion alters how SPN ensembles respond to DA</title><p>Motor impairments in Parkinson’s disease are typically managed by elevating striatal DA with L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor for DA.

We therefore investigated whether DA’s influence on SPN ensembles changes in the striatum of mice in which DA axons are chronically lost. To do this, we first treated mice that had received unilateral 6-OHDA infusions in SNc at least one month earlier with a single dose of L-DOPA. As expected, this treatment reversed the turning bias of lesioned mice within minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). L-DOPA also affected SPN ensembles, albeit to a much greater extent than that observed with D<sub>1/2</sub>R agonists in DA-intact animals. The number of dSPNs exhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during forward locomotion on motorized treadmills in DA-lesioned mice expanded by 10-fold with L-DOPA, outnumbering pre-lesion dSPN ensembles by a factor of two on average and reaching upwards of 70% of all imaged dSPNs in some fields of view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>).

This discrepancy may stem from changes in how striatal circuits respond to DA following SNc neuron loss, or from differences in the pharmacological potency of these treatments. Indeed, L-DOPA’s ability to elevate extracellular DA varies strongly with DA axonal density, producing disproportionately high and prolonged increases in DA in the striatum of DA-lesioned animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abercrombie et al., 1990</xref>). To distinguish between these possibilities, we directly compared the effects of L-DOPA and D<sub>1/2</sub>R agonists on SPN ensembles in a subset of DA-depleted mice locomoting on motorized treadmills. D<sub>1/2</sub>R agonists no longer provoked a decline in the number of active dSPNs in chronically lesioned mice as they did in DA-intact mice, even at high concentrations. Instead, forward locomotion recruited twice as many dSPNs as it did pre-lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This expansion was comparable in magnitude to L-DOPA’s, indicating that dSPNs ensembles in DA-depleted mice respond differently to DA than in intact-mice. D<sub>1/2</sub>R agonists also mimicked the effects of L-DOPA on iSPNs, cutting the number of active cells in half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). At all doses tested, D<sub>1/2</sub>R stimulation evoked a strong imbalance in favor of the direct pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). These data therefore indicate that DA signaling favors the recruitment of dSPNs relative to iSPNs in both DA-intact and DA-depleted mice, but that the underlying population dynamics differ profoundly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Although dSPN ensembles are kept small with increasing DA under basal conditions, they are unrestrained in chronically lesioned mice and susceptible to dramatic expansion. At the same time, DA signaling depresses the size of iSPN ensembles, even at low levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we sought to reveal how acute and prolonged manipulations of DA signaling impact striatal output. To do so, we monitored intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in dSPNs and iSPNs simultaneously using two-photon microscopy to permit the identification of subtle imbalances between direct and indirect pathways long proposed to lie at the heart of basal ganglia function and dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nelson and Kreitzer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klaus et al., 2019</xref>). We specifically examined changes in the size of SPN ensembles recruited during a low-dimensional locomotor behavior to facilitate comparisons across imaging sessions.</p><p>There is compelling evidence, primarily in ex vivo brain slices, that DA modulates the intrinsic excitability of SPNs and the strength of excitatory afferents to promote the activation of dSPNs and impede that of iSPNs. The net consequences of DA’s actions on SPNs in vivo have almost exclusively been understood in the context of firing rates. Although this view finds experimental support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mallet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>), it does not speak to other aspects of striatal activity that DA may modulate, such as bursting or population dynamics. Our results suggest that DA exerts a strong influence on the size of movement-related SPN ensembles in ways not captured by existing models of DA function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).</p><p>Reducing DA signaling causes a strong population-level imbalance in favor of the indirect pathway by simultaneously depressing the number of dSPNs and doubling the number of iSPNs displaying movement-related Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. This effect is unlikely to stem from differential modulation of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Day et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>) or excitatory afferents, which are largely shared between pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kress et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, we did not detect imbalances in either the amplitude or frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in dSPNs and iSPNs. Instead, the observed ensemble changes support the view that, despite differences in the apparent affinity of D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors for DA, basal DA levels promote the recruitment of dSPNs and limit that of iSPNs. The latter is consistent with the recent observation that protein kinase A is strongly activated in iSPNs in response to phasic dips in extracellular DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, periods of diminished DA signaling (i.e. following negative reward prediction errors) may be associated with a coincident expansion and reduction in the number of iSPNs and dSPNs responding to shared excitatory inputs with somatodendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, respectively.</p><p>Elevating DA signaling also affects SPN ensembles, promoting in most cases imbalance toward the direct pathway. Mild increases in DA signaling with D<sub>1/2</sub>R agonists or natural rewards selectively increases the size of dSPN ensembles, indicating that dSPNs remain sensitive to phasic elevations in DA. By contrast, stronger stimulation of DA receptors with higher doses of D<sub>1/2</sub>R agonists causes both dSPN and iSPN ensembles to shrink. A similar effect was observed when boosting endogenous DA levels with nomifensine, which mimics the effects of stimulants like methylphenidate used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed effects reflect off-target actions of these pharmacological agents within and outside striatum, the fact that DA axons project most densely to striatum, that DA receptors are strongly expressed in striatum, and that distinct manipulations produce similar phenotypes suggest that SPN ensemble size may be directly modulated by striatal DA receptors. In addition, several electrophysiological studies have reported that D<sub>1</sub>R agonists can suppress voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels and SPN firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akaike et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calabresi et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schiffmann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hernández-López et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Planert et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, these results fundamentally challenge the pervasive notion that elevating DA signaling invariably promotes the activation of dSPNs, and invite a more cautious interpretation of the effects of DA on striatal circuits. Our data show that the size of iSPN ensembles is inversely related to extracellular DA levels, whereas dSPN ensembles follow an ‘inverted U’ response with limited capacity for expansion with increasing DA. Interestingly, a similar relationship has been described in prefrontal cortex with DA acting on D<sub>1</sub>Rs to regulate cognitive functions like working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vijayraghavan et al., 2007</xref>), pointing to a common mechanism of dopaminergic modulation across brain regions.</p><p>It is increasingly recognized that motor impairments in Parkinson’s disease reflect aberrant activity patterns within the basal ganglia that arise not only from the loss of striatal DA, but also from subsequent homeostatic circuit adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhai et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, we observed stark differences in the activity of iSPNs after acute and prolonged depletion of DA. Whereas iSPNs initially respond to sudden DA loss with a surge in active cells similar to that evoked with D<sub>1/2</sub>R antagonists, movement-related iSPN ensembles returned to their pre-lesion size within a week. This observation agrees with recent work showing that persistent DA depletion in mouse models of Parkinson’s disease does not evoke excessive disinhibition of the indirect pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ketzef et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Parker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>). These results therefore indicate that iSPNs possess a remarkable capacity for homeostatic plasticity, which may stem from dendritic atrophy, spine loss, elevated inhibition from surrounding interneurons and diminished intrinsic excitability upon DA depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gittis and Kreitzer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhai et al., 2019</xref>). By contrast, dSPN ensembles failed to functionally recover from acute loss of DA, as the number of active dSPNs remained low for up to a month after 6-OHDA treatment, despite reported increases in intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fieblinger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ketzef et al., 2017</xref>). This finding echoes a previous report that many dSPNs are electrically silent in lesioned animals and more difficult to evoke spikes from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mallet et al., 2006</xref>), possibly because DA depletion also weakens excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fieblinger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Parker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ketzef et al., 2017</xref>) and potentiates GABAergic influences onto dSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lemos et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the bradykinesia that defines Parkinson’s disease may result not only from elevated discharge of iSPNs during periods of immobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Parker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>), but also from the diminished ability to recruit large populations of dSPNs during movement.</p><p>DA replacement therapy with L-DOPA is the main line of treatment for Parkinson’s disease. Although effective at alleviating motor impairments early in disease, L-DOPA eventually evokes dyskinesias. These abnormal involuntary movements are believed to arise in part from striatal circuit maladaptation to DA denervation beyond a critical threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cenci, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Picconi et al., 2018</xref>). In our 6-OHDA-lesioned animals – which model the severe SNc degeneration of advanced Parkinson’s disease – restoring DA signaling with L-DOPA or D<sub>1/2</sub>R agonists affects SPN ensembles to an extent not seen in DA-intact mice. Specifically, active dSPN ensembles no longer showed an inverted U-shaped response to increasing DA. Instead, they grew larger than pre-lesion ensembles, reaching 60–80% of all imaged dSPNs in some preparations. This suggests that, as the disease progresses and DA degeneration worsens, the way in which dSPNs respond to DA fundamentally changes, complicating attempts at restoring balance between striatal pathways using DA. It is possible that the heightened sensitivity of DA receptors that accompanies severe DA neuron loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerfen, 2003</xref>) underlies this population-level phenotype. We predict that large expansions of dSPN ensembles associated with motor actions will gravely compromise the ability of dSPNs to represent different movements and may explain why L-DOPA eventually induces uncontrolled choreiform and ballistic movements involving multiple body parts.</p><p>It is possible that the changes in ensemble size we reveal here reflect DA’s well-established influence on SPN intrinsic excitability and firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). The high degree of divergence and convergence of excitatory inputs to striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flaherty and Graybiel, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reig and Silberberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mandelbaum et al., 2019</xref>) may allow DA’s effects on intrinsic excitability, excitatory afferent strength, and firing rates to translate into a striatal population code, effectively amplifying DA’s impact on downstream basal ganglia nuclei. Alternatively, DA may regulate the likelihood that SPNs respond to excitatory inputs with somatodendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, a key factor governing plasticity across brain areas in health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lerner and Kreitzer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhuang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nanou and Catterall, 2018</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in SPNs are tightly correlated with bursts of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kerr and Plenz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Owen et al., 2018</xref>) and can be modulated by local interneurons independent of firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Owen et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in SPNs may not reflect firing rates as much as the propensity to emit bursts of action potentials. As such, fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in SPNs constitute a measure of striatal activity in their own right, highlighting bursting events likely to impact Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent synaptic plasticity in SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter and Sabatini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jędrzejewska-Szmek et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to its established role in shaping plasticity at individual synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calabresi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pawlak and Kerr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen et al., 2008</xref>), DA may therefore also regulate the number of neurons eligible to participate in such plasticity.</p><p>Several of our manipulations did not modify the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients oppositely in dSPNs and iSPNs. We interpret this to mean that the factors that drive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in SPNs (e.g. trains of excitatory inputs) are shared between pathways and not subject to strong pathway-specific modulation by DA. This finding stands in contrast to a recent imaging study reporting differential changes in the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in dSPNs and iSPNs upon acute and chronic DA manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Parker et al., 2018</xref>). This inconsistency may stem from technical differences; we monitored striatal activity in head-fixed mice consistently performing one simple movement across conditions, whereas Parker and colleagues imaged freely behaving mice performing multiple undefined movement that may vary in frequency or intensity with DA manipulations. In addition, our imaging approach clearly distinguishes changes in the frequency and amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients per active neuron from changes in the overall number of active cells associated with a given action. These measures can more easily be conflated with one-photon endoscopic techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Helmchen and Denk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ziv and Ghosh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Lastly, it is important to recall that all subcortical cellular-resolution imaging studies damage cortex to gain optical access. This is a particularly important caveat in dorsolateral striatum, which receives strong excitatory inputs from the overlaying somatosensory cortex. It is therefore possible that the changes we report here mainly reflect DA modulation of thalamo-striatal circuits, which are preserved in our imaging preparation.</p><p>Taken together, our results expand classic rate-based models of DA modulation by revealing an additional dimension of DA signaling at the level of neuronal populations. We find that the size of movement-related SPN ensembles is not fixed, but rather strongly modulated by DA. Elevating DA biases striatal ensembles toward the direct pathway, while decreasing DA does the opposite. Importantly, the population dynamics underlying pathway imbalances vary with DA levels and differ in DA-intact and DA-depleted mice, prompting revisions of our understanding of DA’s complex modulatory actions in vivo. Short and long-term changes in the number of SPNs that fire bursts of action potentials may constitute an integral way in which striatal circuits control the selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Markowitz et al., 2018</xref>), vigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Panigrahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yttri and Dudman, 2018</xref>), and learning of action sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Graybiel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koralek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iino et al., 2020</xref>). Future investigations will determine the cellular mechanisms that underlie DA’s ability to modulate the size of SPN ensembles, the time course of such changes in response to synaptically released DA, and the impact of varying ensemble size on the production, learning and refinement of motor actions by the basal ganglia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

The scalp was shaved and cleaned with ethanol and iodine solutions before exposing the skull. A custom titanium headpost was implanted over lambda using C and B metabond (Parkell) to allow head fixation. To achieve widespread viral expression of GCaMP6f in striatum, 100 nl of AAV1-Syn-GCaMP6f-WPRE-SV40 was injected alone or along with AAV1-FLEX-tdTomato 1.7 mm below dura at a rate of 100 nl/min (KD Scientific) into the right dorsolateral striatum at four locations (anterior/lateral from bregma, in mm): 0.7/1.7; 0.7/2.3; 1.3/1.7, and 1.3/2.3.

All arms of the maze were closed (i.e. featured 15 cm-tall walls) to avoid anxiety-related behaviors. The number of ipsiversive, contraversive and straight choices upon reaching the center of the maze were automatically quantified in MATLAB (Mathworks) and verified visually.

GCaMP6f and tdTomato were excited a using a pulsed dispersion-compensated Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent; Chameleon Vision II) tuned to 940 nm (40–80 mW at the sample). Mice were head-fixed above a freely rotating circular treadmill consisting of a 6’ plastic saucer (Ware Manufacturing) mounted on a rotary encoder (US Digital, Serial #: MA3-A10-125-B). Motorized, fixed-distance and velocity trials were conducted by connecting a integrated servo motor (Teknic Clearpath: CPM-MCVC-2310S-RQN) to the treadmill to impose 10 s-long fixed-speed (10 cm/s) running bouts every 20 s. Water-rewards (~0.1 ml) were delivered through a spout controlled by an inaudible solenoid (The Lee Company, LHQA0531220H) at 60 s intervals between motorized running bouts. Mouse posture was simultaneously monitored using a near infrared camera (Basler; acA2000-165um), with each video frame triggered by the two-photon imaging frame clock. The latter was recorded in Wavesurfer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.janelia.org/open-science/wavesurfer">https://www.janelia.org/open-science/wavesurfer</ext-link>) to synchronize imaging and behavioral data. Striatal fields of view (500 × 500 μm; 1–3 per mouse) near the center of the imaging window were selected based on the expression of GCaMP6f and tdTomato, and were continuously imaged with a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels at 30 Hz frame rate for a minimum of 20 min each. Bleaching of GCaMP6f was negligible. The same fields of view were imaged multiple times on non-consecutive days using alignment based on blood vessels and a reference image.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fiber photometry</title><p>Excitation light (Thorlabs; M470F3) was passed through a fluorescence mini-cube (Doric, FMC5-E1-460/490) and 400 μm fiber optic patch cord connected to the mouse via a zirconia sleeve. Emission was collected through the same patch cord and mini-cube to a femtowatt photoreceiver (Newport, 2151). Photometry signals were digitized at 2 kHz using a National Instruments acquisition board (USB-6343), recorded with Wavesurfer, and low-pass filtered and down-sampled to 30 Hz in MATLAB (Mathworks).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Image processing</title><p>Time series of two-photon images were concatenated and motion corrected, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence traces were extracted from individual neurons with minimal neuropil contamination using a custom MATLAB (Mathworks) pipeline described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Driscoll et al., 2017</xref> and kindly made available by Chris Harvey (Harvard Medical School; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/HarveyLab/Acquisition2P_class.git">https://github.com/HarveyLab/Acquisition2P_class.git</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chettih, 2019</xref>). Briefly, putative cell bodies were selected manually in the mean intensity image. Highly correlated and spatially-contiguous fluorescence sources within 30 μm of the selected pixel were then identified automatically based on the correlation structure of the pixel time series to delineate the spatial footprint of active neuronal processes. Fluorescence time series were computed by averaging across all pixels within that footprint and were manually classified into cell bodies, processes (not analyzed), and background (neuropil). This approach is advantageous over manually defined regions of interest as it segregates dendritic processes that overlap with somata if they exhibit distinct fluorescence time series. Each putative cell was paired with a neighboring background source, which was subtracted from the cell body’s fluorescence time series. Segmentation and neuropil subtraction were manually verified for each cell and adjusted when necessary using a graphical user interface to obtain clean neuropil-subtracted fluorescence traces without apparent negative-going transients. GCamp6f-labelled cell bodies were manually labeled as dSPNs or iSPNs based on tdTomato fluorescence in the mean intensity image in <italic>Drd1a</italic><sup>tdTomato</sup> and <italic>Adora2a</italic><sup>tdTomato</sup> mice, respectively, and tdTomato-negative cells were either labeled as putative iSPNs (in in <italic>Drd1a</italic><sup>tdTomato</sup> mice), putative dSPNs (<italic>Adora2a</italic><sup>tdTomato</sup> mice), or putative interneurons based on cell morphology, baseline Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence intensity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) by an experimenter blind to experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image and behavior analyses</title><p>Quantification of imaging and behavioral data was carried out in MATLAB using custom-code available online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TritschLab/TLab-2P-analysis">https://github.com/TritschLab/TLab-2P-analysis</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">TritschLab, 2021</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:1f508fc1d28e6018d71341a99963fbf42c034c7c;origin=https://github.com/TritschLab/TLab-2P-analysis;visit=swh:1:snp:1afcd7b2866fe475e707bde1cf221e5ef68c21c3;anchor=swh:1:rev:a32d12e2dd10eb0ff7510fbbdc83aea7cf3c7356">swh:1:rev:a32d12e2dd10eb0ff7510fbbdc83aea7cf3c7356</ext-link>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were detected using the built-in MATLAB findpeaks() function on each cell’s neuropil-subtracted fluorescence trace smoothed with a 150 ms window if they exhibited a minimum peak height and minimum peak prominence of five standard deviations greater than baseline, and a minimum width of 140 ms at half peak prominence. These criteria are intentionally stringent so as to exclude events not clearly resolved from baseline fluorescence at the cost of underestimating Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient frequency per SPN. All imaged neurons displaying at minimum one Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient were deemed active. Individual fields of view were only selected for longitudinal imaging and quantification if at least five active dSPNs and five active iSPNs were observed at baseline in self-initiated and motorized locomotor trials, and if mice traveled at minimum five meters in self-initiated trials to ensure adequate estimation of SPN ensemble size and mean SPN Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient frequency. For each imaging session and field of view (FOV), we report the percentage of dSPNs and iSPNs that display Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (i.e. active ensemble size), the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients recorded per active dSPNs or iSPNs while moving or immobile averaged across each FOV, and the mean amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients recorded in all active dSPNs or iSPNs averaged for each FOV. Active ensemble size is calculated as the percentage of all imaged dSPNs or iSPNs in a given FOV that display Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients over the course of an imaging session. Activity in dSPNs and iSPNs was compared for each imaging session and FOV by computing a bias index, consisting of the difference in ensemble size, mean Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient frequency or amplitude between dSPNs and iSPNs, divided by their sum. Treadmill velocity was extracted from positional information provided by the rotary encoder, down-sampled to 30 Hz and aligned to the two-photon imaging frame rate. Immobility is defined as any period of time beginning at least 0.5 s after treadmill velocity decreases below 0.2 cm/s, lasting at minimum 4 s, and ending 0.5 s before treadmill velocity exceeds 0.2 cm/s again and for which no postural movement is detected using the infrared camera. Movement bouts are defined as any period of time when absolute treadmill velocity exceeds 0.4 cm/s for a minimum of 4 s, and is preceded and followed by 4 s of immobility. Movement onsets and offsets are the first and last time points, respectively, at least two standard deviations away from treadmill velocity measured while immobile. To relate Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient frequency to treadmill velocity, we recorded the instantaneous treadmill velocity at each Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient onset and divided the total number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients per velocity (binned at 0.4 cm/s) per SPN by the amount of time spent by a mouse at that velocity over the course of an imaging session. To relate the percentage of active SPNs to velocity, we averaged treadmill velocity in 200 ms bins, determined the fraction of all imaged dSPNs or iSPNs active within each bin and calculated the mean percentage of active dSPNs and iSPNs at different treadmill speeds (binned to 0.4 cm/s). To align Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient frequency to movement onset/offset, we calculated the mean number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients imaged per FOV per 200 ms-long bin around all locomotor bout onsets/offsets divided by the total number of active SPNs and bin duration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>For each experiment, data (reported in text and figures as mean ± s.e.m) were collected at minimum from two separate cohorts of mice (biological replicates) and were compared in Prism 8 (Graphpad) using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for independent groups and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for matched samples, and Two-way ANOVAs (mixed-effect model) for multiple comparisons, as indicated in text and figure legends.

The study provides a unique view of how dopamine modulates striatal activity in vivo by investigating effects on the size of movement-related projection neuron ensembles in DA-intact and DA-depleted mice. Whereas prior studies have focused on DA modulation of SPN excitability and firing rates, this paper introduces highly novel concepts about how dopamine modulation of the number of activated neurons (ensemble size) may influence direct/indirect pathway balance and its potential significance for Parkinson's disease.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dopamine differentially modulates the size of projection neuron ensembles in the intact and dopamine-depleted striatum&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ilana B Witten (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you can see in the comments below, there was great enthusiasm for your study by all three reviewers. The reviewers do not ask for new experiments, but please address the requests listed below to address because they will enhance clarity of presentation and interpretation. The full reviews are also included below for your consideration. For Reviewer 2 #3 item concerning evaluation of dyskinesia data, it is not required, but optional to address.</p><p>1. Reviewer 1: Items 1-3</p><p>2. Reviewer 2: Items 1,2,4,5</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The claims of the paper are largely well supported by current data. However, several aspects of data analysis could be done or clarified to further support the conclusions.</p><p>1. The dSPN U-shaped curve response is a potentially novel finding, but appears to be supported by a single data set at 1mg/kg in Figure 4A. These data also includes values that are non-normally distributed and close to outlier-like values. Was this finding replicated in a second cohort?</p><p>2. The authors focused on the analysis of ensemble size, firing rate and frequency of activated SPNs during forward locomotion. Presumably, locomotion arises from collaborative activation of certain SPN subsets and suppression of other subsets. Data in rearward locomotion and transitions should be readily available. Its evaluation would be important to bolster the findings, or reveal unexpected variances to the current interpretations.</p><p>3. Similarly, when only &quot;total locomotion&quot; is presented as the outcome measure, sub analyses should be performed on richer features of the movement data and presented/discussed to ensure that differential findings are not equally or better explained by differences in forward, reverse, or stalled locomotion or velocity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. While D1 receptors, at least within the striatum, are relatively selective in their expression on dSPNs, D2 antagonists or agonists may act on iSPNs themselves, or local microcircuit elements, including cholinergic interneurons, dopamine terminals, and potentially local glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. The authors allude to the glutamatergic inputs in the discussion, but one question in my mind was how much of the results here could be related to D2 autoreceptors on dopamine terminals. For example, D2 antagonists presynaptically increase striatal dopamine release, and D2 agonists decrease dopamine release (Palij et al., 1990 and others). At the very least, it would be worth discussing the potential mechanisms of the pharmacology.</p><p>2. Related to the above comment, though some of the differences between healthy and 6-OHDA treated animals in their response to dopamine drugs may be related to chronic changes in synaptic connectivity or intrinsic properties, some may relate to the loss of one of the targets of these drugs: the dopamine terminals. Might the effects of D2 antagonists in healthy animals be an interplay between direct effects on SPNs themselves, plus changes in dopamine release mediated by actions on dopamine terminals? And one of the reasons it's so different in 6-OHDA treated animals is that now this element has been removed?</p><p>3. The authors refer to L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in their discussion, and compare their findings to published work with L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, but this behavioral phenomenon was not mentioned/quantified in the text. Based on my understanding of the literature, the severity of dopamine depletion they induced (Figure 5B/C) combined with a dose of 10 mg/kg of L-DOPA would likely induce dyskinesia (eg Smith et al., 2012). Did their animals show dyskinesia? And if so, how did this relate to the patterns of neural activity reported?</p><p>4. For interpretability and clarity, it would be helpful to include details of some major methods in the Results text and/or main Figure legends. For example, the authors should indicate in the Results and/or Figure legends that they used both an A2a-Cre x Ai14 cross and a viral approach to directly label iSPNs, that they used a cocktail of SCH23390 and raclopride to block D1/2 type dopamine receptors, or a cocktail of SKF81297 and quinpirole to activate D1/2 type dopamine receptors.</p><p>5. It is unclear between the Figure and methods text what concentration of L-DOPA was used – the figure itself has &quot;10&quot; listed underneath (Figure 6E-G), but the methods list 12 mg/kg (which may instead refer to benserazide dosing?).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I thought this was a nice study. There have been few studies to examine DA modulation of D1R and D2R activity and I thought the dual population imaging was cool, I was interested to see the large population level effects that mostly recapitulated expectations about the two pathways, as well as to see the inverted-U effect on D1Rs which was interesting and I was not aware of that being observed in striatum before. I didn't have any major concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68041.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The claims of the paper are largely well supported by current data.

Even after excluding both extreme values from the dataset, treatment with D1/2R agonists still significantly increased dSPN ensemble size compared to baseline (p = 0.0156, n = 7 FOVs; Wilcoxon signed rank test).</p><p>However, we wish to correct the Reviewer on an important point: the 1 mg/kg agonist data point is not the only evidence for an inverted U-shaped distribution. First, we note that the fact that blocking and stimulating D1/2 receptors both reduce dSPN ensemble size is, in and of itself, supportive of an inverted U distribution, even in the absence of an overt increase in dSPN ensemble size with low dose agonists. Second, we provide evidence that elevating endogenous dopamine levels with natural rewards and dopamine transporter blockers respectively increases and decreases the size of dSPN ensembles (Figure 4E-G), further supporting an inverted U-shaped relationship between dSPN ensemble size and dopamine signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors focused on the analysis of ensemble size, firing rate and frequency of activated SPNs during forward locomotion. Presumably, locomotion arises from collaborative activation of certain SPN subsets and suppression of other subsets. Data in rearward locomotion and transitions should be readily available. Its evaluation would be important to bolster the findings, or reveal unexpected variances to the current interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>Mice were habituated to head-fixation in the recording apparatus on both freely-rotating and motorized circular treadmills prior to experimentation. Once habituated, mice engaged in bouts of forward locomotion spontaneously on the freely-rotating treadmill and rarely (if ever) initiated rearward treadmill rotations. In fact, we interpreted rearward locomotion as an overt sign of behavioral distress, and thus prolonged habituation (and refrained from initiating imaging experiments) in mice that displayed such behavior. In addition, we never imposed rearward locomotion on the motorized treadmill. For these reasons, we do not have rearward locomotion data available for analysis.</p><p>We do, however, have data during transitions from immobility to forward locomotion and back to immobility. We report on these data in Figures 2B,C for Ca<sup>2+</sup> event frequency and 5H for the percentage of imaged SPN active per 200 ms time bin. We also include in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> an additional display of the percentage of imaged SPNs displaying Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients as mice transition between immobility and forward locomotion in the dopamine-intact and dopamine-depleted (acutely and chronically) striatum:</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68041-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>These data are consistent with the changes in total SPN ensemble size reported in our manuscript. However, because measures of the instantaneous percentage of active SPNs cannot unambiguously distinguish between changes in overall active ensemble size (measured over an entire imaging session) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> event frequency per active SPN, we refrained from displaying them in the manuscript for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Similarly, when only &quot;total locomotion&quot; is presented as the outcome measure, sub analyses should be performed on richer features of the movement data and presented/discussed to ensure that differential findings are not equally or better explained by differences in forward, reverse, or stalled locomotion or velocity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that studying how neural activity in motor-related brain regions contributes to movement benefits from drawing comparisons with many behavioral parameters. But our study does not aim to explain what individual SPNs or groups of SPNs encode, or how they affect behavior. Instead, we sought to reveal how dopamine modulates striatal activity, while keeping as many experimental variables constant, including behavior. For this reason, we opted for a single, low-dimensional behavior (forward locomotion), which prior work shows is one of many ‘behavioral syllables’ spontaneously displayed by mice that is associated with the activation of a specific group of SPNs (Klaus et al., 2017; Markowitz et al., 2018).</p><p>We do, however, firmly believe that the reported changes in ensemble size do not stem from differences in velocity or forward, reverse, or stalled locomotion. First, as mentioned above, mice in our assay do not engage in rearward locomotion. Second, our manipulations did not shorten locomotor bout duration, indicating that stalled locomotion is unlikely to contribute to the observed effects on SPN ensemble size. Third, behavioral variables were not consistently affected by pharmacological manipulations (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1E–G). Fourth, we controlled for differences in locomotion frequency, duration and velocity by performing (Figures 3, 4 and 6) or repeating (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A) manipulations on motorized treadmills imposing a fixed number of locomotor bouts at set velocities. Fifth, dopamine-mediated changes in the percentage of imaged SPNs that are active during spontaneous locomotion were observed at all recorded velocities (Figure 5H). Lastly, the fact that diverse manipulations (ranging from unilateral lesion of nigrostriatal afferents to systemic DA receptor antagonists/agonists and natural rewards) produced consistent, <italic>differential</italic> effects on dSPN and iSPN ensembles despite variable effects on behavior strongly suggests that the cellular phenotypes we uncover here reflect the actions of dopamine, as opposed to being indirectly inherited from behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. While D1 receptors, at least within the striatum, are relatively selective in their expression on dSPNs, D2 antagonists or agonists may act on iSPNs themselves, or local microcircuit elements, including cholinergic interneurons, dopamine terminals, and potentially local glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. The authors allude to the glutamatergic inputs in the discussion, but one question in my mind was how much of the results here could be related to D2 autoreceptors on dopamine terminals. For example, D2 antagonists presynaptically increase striatal dopamine release, and D2 agonists decrease dopamine release (Palij et al., 1990 and others). At the very least, it would be worth discussing the potential mechanisms of the pharmacology.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is correct that dopamine receptors localize to many cells and processes in striatum in addition to dSPNs and iSPNs, making it difficult to attribute the effects of dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists to any one element. We first wish to clarify that the intent of this study is to reveal the net effect of dopamine modulation on striatal output in vivo, not to uncover the precise circuit elements or specific receptor types through which it does so. For this reason, we broadly stimulated or blocked all dopamine receptors simultaneously using cocktails of high-affinity D1/2R agonists or antagonists, respectively. One advantage of this approach is that we can a priori exclude confounds arising from secondary changes in presynaptic release of dopamine, since dopamine receptors are already pharmacologically blocked or stimulated. For instance, a presynaptic increase in dopamine release following D2R blockade ought to be of little consequence if all dopamine receptors in striatum are already blocked. Conversely, a decrease in dopamine release following D2R activation may be less impactful on SPNs whose receptors are coincidentally stimulated with D1/2 agonists.</p><p>We nevertheless performed experiments to mitigate concerns that modulation of presynaptic D2Rs significantly contributes to the observed effects. First, we replicated the contraction of dSPN ensembles observed with high dose D1/2R agonists (<bold>Figure 4A</bold>) in a small cohort of 3 mice treated with the D1R agonist SKF81297 alone at 3 mg/kg:</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68041-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Second, the differential effects of D1/2R antagonists on the size of dSPN and iSPN ensembles (e.g. contraction and expansion, respectively) were undistinguishable from those observed 24 h following the loss of SNc neurons with 6-OHDA, suggesting that presynaptic modulation of DA release via D2 autoreceptors does not significantly contribute to the observed changes in SPN ensemble size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Related to the above comment, though some of the differences between healthy and 6-OHDA treated animals in their response to dopamine drugs may be related to chronic changes in synaptic connectivity or intrinsic properties, some may relate to the loss of one of the targets of these drugs: the dopamine terminals. Might the effects of D2 antagonists in healthy animals be an interplay between direct effects on SPNs themselves, plus changes in dopamine release mediated by actions on dopamine terminals? And one of the reasons it's so different in 6-OHDA treated animals is that now this element has been removed?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, despite the strong influence of D2 autoreceptors on dopamine release from SNc axons, we do not have evidence that this modulation contributes to the effects of D1/2R antagonists or 6-OHDA lesions on the size of dSPN ensembles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors refer to L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in their discussion, and compare their findings to published work with L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, but this behavioral phenomenon was not mentioned/quantified in the text. Based on my understanding of the literature, the severity of dopamine depletion they induced (Figure 5B/C) combined with a dose of 10 mg/kg of L-DOPA would likely induce dyskinesia (eg Smith et al., 2012). Did their animals show dyskinesia? And if so, how did this relate to the patterns of neural activity reported?</p></disp-quote><p>We unfortunately did not perform detailed behavioral analyses using the validated Abnormal Involuntary Movement (AIM) scale. Axial, forelimb and orolingual AIMs typically develop in mice with unilateral dopamine neuron lesions upon chronic treatment with levodopa (at 3-25 mg/kg; Pavon et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2012; Cenci, 2014; Sebastianutto et al., 2016). We selected an intermediate dose and treated our mice only once, as we wished to restore striatal dopamine while avoiding severe dyskinetic episodes that may prevent mice from locomoting on the treadmill. We imaged striatal activity prior to levodopa, then administered levodopa before monitoring turning bias in a closed-arm plus-maze to confirm levodopa’s effectiveness, and finally imaged striatal activity again. The strong contraversive turning bias observed (see Figure 6—figure supplement 1A) is reminiscent of axial AIMs. However, we did not notice forelimb or orolingual AIMs, suggesting that our mice are unlikely to qualify as dyskinetic according to established standards. In agreement with this, our mice were able to locomote on the treadmill while head-fixed without apparent difficulty. That said, we agree with the Reviewer that it would be interesting for future investigations to relate SPN ensemble size to AIM scores to determine whether the dramatic expansion in dSPN ensemble size predisposes, or directly contributes to dyskinesia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For interpretability and clarity, it would be helpful to include details of some major methods in the Results text and/or main Figure legends. For example, the authors should indicate in the Results and/or Figure legends that they used both an A2a-Cre x Ai14 cross and a viral approach to directly label iSPNs, that they used a cocktail of SCH23390 and raclopride to block D1/2 type dopamine receptors, or a cocktail of SKF81297 and quinpirole to activate D1/2 type dopamine receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, the revised version of the manuscript specifies in the Results section that we used transgenic (A2a-Cre::Ai14 mice) as well as viral approaches (A2A-Cre with Cre-dependent tdTomato AAV) to label iSPNs in striatum (lines 125-129). The specific D1 and D2 receptor agonists and antagonists administered are now also indicated in the Results session (lines 191 and 222 in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It is unclear between the Figure and methods text what concentration of L-DOPA was used – the figure itself has &quot;10&quot; listed underneath (Figure 6E-G), but the methods list 12 mg/kg (which may instead refer to benserazide dosing?).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this typo.
