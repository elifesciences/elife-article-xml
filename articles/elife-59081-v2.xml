provides substantial opportunity for competition between endogenous and newly-encountered substrates to influence the evolutionary trajectory, an aspect that is often overlooked in laboratory directed evolution studies. We selected the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> nitro/quinone reductase NfsA for chloramphenicol detoxification by simultaneously randomising eight active-site residues and interrogating ~250,000,000 reconfigured variants. Analysis of every possible intermediate of the two best chloramphenicol reductases revealed complex epistatic interactions. In both cases, improved chloramphenicol detoxification was only observed after an R225 substitution that largely eliminated activity with endogenous quinones. Error-prone PCR mutagenesis reinforced the importance of R225 substitutions, found in 100% of selected variants. This strong activity trade-off demonstrates that endogenous cellular metabolites hold considerable potential to shape evolutionary outcomes. Unselected prodrug-converting activities were mostly unaffected, emphasising the importance of negative selection to effect enzyme specialisation, and offering an application for the evolved genes as dual-purpose selectable/counter-selectable markers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the cell, most tasks are performed by big molecules called proteins, which behave like molecular machines. Although proteins are often described as having one job each, this is not always true, and many proteins can perform different roles. Enzymes are a type of protein that facilitate chemical reactions. They are often specialised to one reaction, but they can also accelerate other side-reactions. During evolution, these side-reactions can become more useful and, as a result, the role of the enzyme may change over time.</p><p>The main role of the enzyme called NfsA in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteria is thought to be to convert molecules called quinones into hydroquinones, which can protect the cell from toxic molecules produced in oxidation reactions. As a side-reaction, NfsA has the potential to protect bacteria from an antibiotic called chloramphenicol, but it generally does this with such low efficacy that the effects are negligible. Producing hydroquinones is helpful to the cell in some situations, but if bacteria are regularly exposed to chloramphenicol, NfsA’s role aiding antibiotic resistance could become more important. Over time, the enzyme could evolve to become better at neutralising chloramphenicol. Therefore, NfsA provides an opportunity to study the evolution of proteins and how bacteria adapt to antibiotics.</p><p>To see how evolution might affect the activity of NfsA, Hall et al. generated 250 million <italic>E. coli</italic> with either random or targeted changes to the gene that codes for the NfsA enzyme. The resulting variants of NfsA that were most effective against chloramphenicol all had a change that eliminated the enzyme’s ability to convert quinones. This result demonstrates a key trade-off between roles for NfsA, where one must be lost for the other to improve.</p><p>These results demonstrate the interplay between a protein’s different roles and provide insight into bacterial drug resistance. Additionally, the experiments showed that the bacteria with improved resistance to chloramphenicol also became more sensitive to another antibiotic, metronidazole. These findings could inform the fight against drug-resistant bacterial infections and may also be helpful in guiding the design of proteins with different roles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nitroreductase</kwd><kwd>enzyme promiscuity</kwd><kwd>substrate competition</kwd><kwd>directed evolution</kwd><kwd>enzyme evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001509</institution-id><institution>Royal Society of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15-VUW-037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patrick</surname><given-names>Wayne M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ackerley</surname><given-names>David F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001513</institution-id><institution>Cancer Society of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18.05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calcott</surname><given-names>Mark J</given-names></name><name><surname>Ackerley</surname><given-names>David F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001509</institution-id><institution>Royal Society of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19-VUW-076</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patrick</surname><given-names>Wayne M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ackerley</surname><given-names>David F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001538</institution-id><institution>Victoria University of Wellington</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rich</surname><given-names>Michelle H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009495</institution-id><institution>Faculty of Science, Victoria University of Wellington</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VUW Masters Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Little</surname><given-names>Rory F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Evolving <italic>E. coli</italic> NfsA for enhanced chloramphenicol detoxification in the native host environment shows that eliminating substrate competition can occur rapidly, and be key to evolving a new enzymatic function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many (if not all) enzymes are promiscuous, meaning that in addition to their primary biological role(s) they can catalyse minor side reactions that have no apparent physiological relevance, either because they are too inefficient or because the substrate is not naturally encountered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Copley, 2015</xref>). From an evolutionary perspective, promiscuity can play an important role in contingency, providing a reservoir of potential functions that a cell can tap in response to changing circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O'Brien and Herschlag, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Copley, 2015</xref>). As demonstrated by the emergence of resistance to xenobiotic pollutants or clinical antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O'Brien and Herschlag, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Copley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2010</xref>), a strong selection pressure can cause latent promiscuous activities to be rapidly amplified to physiologically relevant levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Newton et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Catalytic transitions to an alternate substrate have been modelled experimentally using iterative rounds of random mutagenesis (e.g. error-prone PCR (epPCR)), a powerful directed evolution strategy that enables adaptive landscapes to be explored under defined laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaltenbach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaltenbach et al., 2016</xref>). These laboratory evolution studies have indicated that selection for substantial increases in a promiscuous activity typically results in only weak trade-offs against the native activity; and therefore, the transition from one primary function to another tends to progress via generalist enzyme intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaltenbach et al., 2016</xref>). Two leading teams have offered contrasting hypotheses to explain this phenomenon. In 2005, Tawfik and co-workers proposed that enzymes possess an innate ‘robustness’ and stability that buffers them against the potentially detrimental effects of novel mutations, coupled with a ‘plasticity’ that can amplify promiscuous functions with relatively few mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aharoni et al., 2005</xref>). More recently, Tokuriki and co-workers demonstrated that a robust native activity is not a prerequisite for weak trade-offs, and suggested that the predominance of these in the literature may instead be artefactual; a consequence of laboratory evolution studies being highly biased towards strong selection for a new function without any selection against the native activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaltenbach et al., 2016</xref>). They argue that it is unclear how specialisation can occur in this manner, and that in nature, selection might frequently exist to erode the original function. By way of example, they offer a scenario where the native and new substrate compete for the same active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaltenbach et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition to their exclusive emphasis on positive selection, we note that the studies overviewed by the Tokuriki team were also heavily biased towards heterologous enzyme expression and/or a transition in activity from one exogenously applied substrate to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaltenbach et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, there has been little consideration of how the native substrate might influence the evolutionary trajectory. We were therefore motivated to study the selection of a promiscuous function within the native host environment, with particular focus on the key catalytic changes driving the transition. Recognising that the stochastic nature of iterative random mutagenesis is unlikely to yield the most efficient pathway to a selected outcome, we sought to implement simultaneous mass-mutagenesis on a massive scale that would allow us to retrospectively assess all possible intermediates of our top variants, and infer the most plausible stepwise evolutionary trajectories. We were able to achieve both these goals by employing the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> nitro/quinone reductase NfsA as a new model system that offers several key advantages. NfsA is a member of a large bacterial superfamily comprising highly promiscuous FMN-dependent oxidoreductases that accept electrons from NAD(P)H and transfer them to a diverse range of substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Williams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akiva et al., 2017</xref>). Expression of <italic>nfsA</italic> is governed by the <italic>soxRS</italic> regulon, and NfsA is thought to guard against oxidative stress through reduction of water-soluble quinones such as 1,4-benzoquinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liochev et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Paterson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Copp et al., 2017</xref>). Although most efficient with quinone substrates, NfsA is also able to reduce a wide diversity of nitroaromatic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Valiauga et al., 2017</xref>). This is generally believed to represent non-physiological substrate ambiguity, as there are relatively few nitroaromatic natural products, and in many cases nitro-reduction yields a more toxic derivative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Winkler and Hertweck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Williams et al., 2015</xref>). An important exception is that nitro-reduction of chloramphenicol transforms this antibiotic to a product that is not discernibly toxic to bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yunis, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erwin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crofts et al., 2019</xref>). We have observed that over-expressed native NfsA confers only slight chloramphenicol protection to <italic>E. coli</italic> host cells, but reasoned that we could select for improved detoxification in an extremely high-throughput manner by plating variant libraries on chloramphenicol-amended media. Because members of the bacterial nitroreductase superfamily appear to have unusually plastic active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akiva et al., 2017</xref>), we considered that simultaneous mass-mutagenesis of up to eight active-site residues should be possible. In effect, we aimed to strip NfsA of its engine, and then select for a superior configuration of parts assembled within the empty chassis. By leaping directly to a new fitness peak, we considered that we might arrive at synergistic combinations of substitutions that would be difficult to achieve by iterative random mutagenesis approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design of an eight randomised codon <italic>nfsA</italic> gene library</title><p>We have previously conducted several different mutagenesis studies on <italic>nfsA</italic>, seeking to enhance activity with prodrugs and/or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probes for cancer gene therapy applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Williams, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Copp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rich, 2017</xref>), or to assess potential collateral sensitivities between niclosamide and the antibiotics metronidazole and nitrofurantoin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Copp et al., 2020</xref>). Based on this previous work we empirically identified eight active-site residues (S41, L43, H215, T219, K222, S224, R225, and F227; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) as being individually mutable and having the potential to contribute to generically improved nitroreductase activity. We then designed a degenerate gene library to enable simultaneous randomisation of each residue. As complete randomisation of target codons (e.g. NNK degeneracy) would have yielded an impractically large library of &gt;10<sup>12</sup> (32<sup>8</sup> or more) gene variants, we instead used a restricted set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The degenerate codon NDT was preferred at most sites, as this specifies 12 different amino acids that represent a balanced portfolio of small and large, polar and non-polar, aliphatic and aromatic, and negatively and positively charged side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reetz et al., 2008</xref>). However, at positions 219 and 222, NDT codons did not include the native NfsA residue as an option, so the alternative degeneracies NHT (12 unique amino acids) and VNG (11 unique amino acids) were chosen as acceptably balanced alternatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In total, our library represented 430 million possible gene combinations, collectively specifying 394 million different NfsA variants.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Creation, selection, and characterisation of 30 top chloramphenicol-detoxifying NfsA variants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of NfsA, based on PDB 1f5v.

This robust tolerance to active-site randomisation confirmed that NfsA exhibits a substantial degree of active-site plasticity.</p><p>We next plated the library on ≥45 µM chloramphenicol, recovering a total of 365 colonies. Retransformation of fresh 7NT host cells with the variant-encoding plasmids was performed to eliminate any selected chromosomal mutations, followed by validation of activities in liquid growth assays. Sequencing and elimination of duplicates yielded 30 top variants that exhibited evidence of a conserved genetic response to the chloramphenicol selection. Particularly strong trends were observed at positions 41 and 219 (where the native serine or threonine was substituted by an aromatic residue in ≥26 of the 30 cases), and at position 225 (100% substitution of the native arginine by an uncharged or acidic residue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Only at position 43 was the native leucine or a chemically similar residue frequently retained (16/30 cases). In EC<sub>50</sub> assays, 7NT cells expressing these 30 variants demonstrated nearly 6- to 10-fold greater chloramphenicol tolerance than those expressing native <italic>nfsA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that there was no substantial variation in expression between these variants and native <italic>nfsA</italic>, and hence the enhanced chloramphenicol detoxification was not a consequence of elevated expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the impact of the active-site reconfiguration on catalytic activity, the top five chloramphenicol-detoxifying NfsA variants were purified as His<sub>6</sub>-tagged proteins and evaluated in steady-state kinetics assays.

Here, we were unable to perform the same in vitro competition assays, as both 1,4-benzoquinone and chloramphenicol reduction are monitored by following NADPH depletion at 340 nm. However, when assayed individually we found that 1,4-benzoquinone reduction was unmeasurable in each of the five top chloramphenicol-detoxifying variants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Our data are therefore consistent with in vivo chloramphenicol reduction having been amplified for the selected variants by the elimination of competitive quinone inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Recreating all hypothetical evolutionary trajectories for the top chloramphenicol-detoxifying NfsA variants</title><p>We next sought to probe the contributions to improved chloramphenicol detoxification and/or diminished 1,4-benzoquinone reduction made by key substitutions, or combinations thereof. The top two chloramphenicol-detoxifying variants (on the basis of EC<sub>50</sub> measurements; 36_37 and 20_39) each had seven substitutions at the eight targeted positions, with both containing the wild-type residue leucine at position 43 (36_37 = S41Y, H215C, T219Y, K222V, S224R, R225V, F227G; 20_39 = S41Y, H215N, T219Y, K222R, S224Y, R225D, F227H; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Therefore, there are 126 possible intermediate forms (2<sup>7</sup> – 2) between wild-type NfsA and each selected variant. Genes encoding the 126 intermediate forms for each variant were artificially synthesised, cloned and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> 7NT cells, and the chloramphenicol tolerance of the resulting strains assessed in EC<sub>50</sub> growth assays. A Python script was generated to delineate all 5040 (7!) possible evolutionary trajectories and the output used to generate full network graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then considered whether traditional stepwise directed evolution strategies, which require each substitution to directly improve the selected activity (e.g. across iterative rounds of epPCR), could have plausibly generated either of variants 36_37 or 20_39. For the purposes of this analysis we considered ‘improvement’ to be a &gt; 16% increase in chloramphenicol EC<sub>50</sub> for each step, as this was the average error across all EC<sub>50</sub> measurements. In neither case was there a clear path from NfsA to the final variant that involved exclusively upward steps in the hypothetical evolutionary trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). Nevertheless, it was evident that the final two substitutions (H215C and K222V for variant 36_37, and K222R and S224Y for variant 20_39) did not contribute substantially to the overall chloramphenicol-detoxifying activity of each variant. Thus, we concluded that iterative evolutionary strategies could have plausibly generated NfsA variants exhibiting similar levels of chloramphenicol-detoxifying activity to 36_37 and 20_39, but that there were very few accessible pathways for this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Recreating the hypothetical evolutionary trajectories of NfsA variants 36_37 and 20_39.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Residues in the active site of 36_37 (A, blue), 20_39 (B, green) and wild-type NfsA (C, orange); based on PDB 1f5v (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobori et al., 2001</xref>).

However, the combination of S41Y and T219Y together with R225V or R225D gave a further significant improvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

We considered that interrogating the intermediate variants might shed light on the mechanistic basis of improved chloramphenicol detoxification. In particular, we wanted to determine how activity with a presumed native substrate like 1,4-benzoquinone was affected during the hypothetical evolutionary progression towards improved chloramphenicol detoxification. For this, the enzyme intermediates identified in the most probable stepwise evolutionary trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) were purified as His-tagged proteins and in vitro kinetics assays attempted with both chloramphenicol and 1,4-benzoquinone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). From these data, it was evident that the first substitution of both hypothetical trajectories (i.e. the elimination of R225) was sufficient to abolish nearly all 1,4-benzoquinone activity. A structure of NfsA with 1,4-benzoquinone in the active site was reported from the Hyde group that proposes the quinone is held in place through interactions between one of its carbonyl oxygens and the backbone of S41, while the other carbonyl oxygen interacts with the guanidinium of R225 and/or the amine of Q67 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Day, 2013</xref>).

However, while our targeted mutagenesis strategy allowed us to comprehensively explore a defined region of sequence space, we could not rule out that other evolutionary solutions might be possible. For example, we considered that an alternative spectrum of mutations might improve chloramphenicol detoxification without eliminating quinone reduction. To investigate this, we used epPCR to introduce mutations across the entire <italic>nfsA</italic> coding sequence, then transformed <italic>E. coli</italic> 7NT cells and subjected them to selection on LB agar amended with 10 µM chloramphenicol.</p><p>Growth inhibition assays were performed for 60 randomly chosen clones at a low (7.5 µM), medium (15 µM) or high (30 µM) concentration of chloramphenicol.

When each gene variant was sequenced, it was revealed that there were 50 unique sequences, each of which encoded a protein that was substituted at the R225 position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). In contrast, sequencing of 20 randomly-chosen clones grown without chloramphenicol selection identified no R225 substitutions, confirming that the epPCR library was not profoundly biased towards mutation of codon 225 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). We were surprised to note (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>) that codon 225 was mutated exclusively at the first nucleotide position, giving substitutions R225C (C→T, 47 times), R225S (C→A, seven times) or R225G (C→G, six times), but not at the second nucleotide position (which would have given rise to R225L/P/H). Of the latter three possibilities, R225L and R225H were both encoded by the degenerate NDT triplet used in our original combinatorial mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), but R225L was only recovered once in our top 30 variants and R225H not at all (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). It may be that as individual substitutions, none of R225L/P/H confer sufficient improvement in chloramphenicol detoxification to have been selected in this experiment. Irrespective, that 100% of selected variants were mutated at codon 225 provides compelling evidence that eliminating quinone competition is a key first step towards evolving improved chloramphenicol detoxification, and that substitution of R225 is the most attainable way to achieve this.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Impact of improved affinity for chloramphenicol on alternate substrates</title><p>We were interested to discover how selection for improved activity with chloramphenicol had impacted unselected promiscuous activities of NfsA.

The exception was metronidazole, for which all variants exhibited similar gains in activity to chloramphenicol, despite the two compounds sharing little structural similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Moreover, the introduction of R225V or R225D substitutions into NfsA (which largely eliminate 1,4-benzoquinone activity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>) did not improve reduction of all prodrugs, but only significantly enhanced activity with metronidazole and CB1954 (Student’s t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>).

The serendipitous gains in metronidazole sensitivity that paralleled improved chloramphenicol detoxification inspired us to investigate whether these opposing activities might have useful molecular biology applications, by offering dual selectable and counter-selectable functionalities in a single gene. Counter-selectable markers, such as the <italic>sacB</italic> levansucrase gene from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, have multiple applications including the forced elimination of plasmids, and resolution of merodiploid constructs during allele exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stibitz, 1994</xref>). However, they must typically be partnered with a selectable marker on the same DNA construct, to enable positive selection for the construct before its subsequent elimination. This occupies additional space, which is undesirable for size-restricted constructs, and means there is potential for the two genes to become separated by recombination events, leading to false positive or false negative outcomes.</p><p>Because metronidazole is cheap, widely-available, and has no measurable bystander effect in <italic>E. coli</italic> (i.e. unlike many other nitroaromatic prodrugs its toxic metabolites are confined solely to the activating cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan-Hyams et al., 2018</xref>]), we considered it ideally suited for counter-selection applications.

We acknowledge that this approach of focusing exclusively on eight key active-site residues means the reconstructed NfsA ‘engine’ is unlikely to be an optimal fit within the pre-existing chassis, and that further gains in activity would undoubtedly result by selecting residue substitutions in the second shell, or beyond. Nevertheless, we reasoned that our approach would allow us to gain comprehensive insight into key catalytic changes driving improved chloramphenicol detoxification, without being subject to the stochastic vagaries of epPCR, or the well-established phenomenon that it can only access a limited and unbalanced repertoire of residues (on average, only 5.7 of the 19 alternative amino acids per codon position, with a bias towards similar residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hermes et al., 1990</xref>]). We also initially considered that this approach might allow us to leap to a fitness peak that iterative random mutagenesis strategies would be unable to scale. However, when we examined every hypothetical evolutionary intermediate, we discovered this was not the case; although stepwise evolution would have been greatly constrained in the progression from wild-type NfsA to either of our top two variants, there were plausible trajectories to achieve these outcomes. Notably, the critical first step in any of these trajectories was the substitution of R225, leading to near-total abrogation of the native quinone reductase activity, which was never restored and appears incompatible with the selected activity. The importance of eliminating R225 was emphasised by epPCR mutagenesis of <italic>nfsA</italic>, when 50/50 unique variants selected for improved chloramphenicol detoxification were found to have lost R225, while 20/20 unselected variants retained it (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1e,f</xref>). The strong trade-off between quinone and chloramphenicol reduction is a very different scenario to the predominantly weak trade-offs observed in previous laboratory evolution studies (e.g. those reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaltenbach et al., 2016</xref>). Even the more recent work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-David et al., 2020</xref> who encountered an abrupt activity trade-off when they evolved the calcium-dependent lactonase mammalian paraoxonase-1 into an efficient organophosphate hydrolase, found that the native functionality could subsequently be restored and was not incompatible with the evolved one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-David et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-David et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>By choosing to select for a novel enzymatic activity within the native cellular environment, we deliberately set out to explore the additional complexities of metabolic interference, which have potential to play dominant roles in shaping natural evolutionary outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Copley, 2020</xref> recently described an equation that succinctly summarises how the rate of a promiscuous reaction in the presence of a native substrate might be improved by (1) increasing the concentration of the enzyme; (2) increasing the ratio of promiscuous to native substrate; and/or (3) altering the active site to diminish substrate competition, by enhancing binding or turnover of the promiscuous substrate, or decreasing binding of the native substrate. In a landmark 2015 study she and co-workers experimentally demonstrated the importance of diminished substrate competition, focusing on a single key Glu to Ala substitution that enabled several orthologs of ProA (L-gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase, a key enzyme in proline synthesis) to replace <italic>E. coli</italic> ArgC (an N-acetyl glutamyl phosphate reductase required for arginine synthesis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khanal et al., 2015</xref>). Where measurable, all of the substituted variants showed decreased affinity (increased <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic>) for the native substrate; and in all but one case there was substantial improvement in <italic>k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub></italic> for the promiscuous substrate as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khanal et al., 2015</xref>). These findings are similar to our observation that elimination of quinone reductase activity from NfsA via substitution of R225 provided a platform for successive improvements in chloramphenicol affinity to amplify host cell resistance. Together, these examples support the proposal of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaltenbach et al., 2016</xref> that during natural evolution of a promiscuous activity there is likely to be active selection against the original function, as well as our own supposition that most previous laboratory evolution studies have evaded this phenomenon by focusing on heterologous enzymes and/or exogenously applied substrates. Moreover, our observations that the unselected promiscuous activities of NfsA (reduction of a structurally diverse panel of prodrugs) were mostly unaffected is consistent with their central thesis, that positive selection alone does not lead to specialisation. The emerging picture is that evolution in the natural intracellular milieu involves both selection for the new function, and selection against the old.</p><p>An interesting difference between our scenario and that of the Copley team is that NfsA is less essential to the fitness of its host cell than ProA (e.g. deletion of <italic>nfsA</italic> does not impair <italic>E. coli</italic> growth even under oxidative stress from heavy metal challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerley et al., 2004</xref>]). This means that when a new stress is encountered and a promiscuous function becomes essential, as we have modelled here, the enzyme can potentially evolve without necessitating gene duplication to preserve the original function. An apparent ‘freedom to operate’ is manifest in the vast diversity of primary functionalities observed in the superfamily of nitroreductases that NfsA belongs to (which spans activities as divergent as quinone reduction, flavin reduction to power bioluminescence, flavin fragmentation, dehalogenation and dehydrogenation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akiva et al., 2017</xref>]). Although this contrasts with the prevailing Innovation–Amplification–Divergence (IAD) model for natural enzyme evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergthorsson et al., 2007</xref>), it may not be an exceptional scenario – rather, as previously argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Newton et al., 2015</xref> it is likely that only a minority of enzymes in a cell are under active selection for improved catalytic activity at any time, and redundancy in metabolic networks means that there is latent evolutionary potential that can be immediately tapped to adapt to stress without the requirement of rare and costly gene duplication events. That a single mutation may suffice to rapidly amplify a desirable promiscuous activity simply by eliminating native substrate competition confers substantial ‘robustness’ at a cellular level, even if it means that individual enzymes may not be as robust as previously considered.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Chloramphenicol, metronidazole, 2,4-dinitrotoluene and nitrofurazone were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Selection of improved variants from this library was carried out as described for the multi-site directed mutagenesis library above, but on LB agar plates supplemented with 10 µM chloramphenicol as well as 5 µM IPTG and 100 µg.mL<sup>−1</sup> ampicillin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Evaluating the selection/counter-selection potential of evolved <italic>nfsA</italic> variants</title><p>A single colony of an <italic>E. coli</italic> 7NT cells expressing <italic>nfsA_</italic>Ec 36_37 or 20_39 was used to inoculate a 3 mL overnight culture of LB supplemented with 100 µg.mL<sup>−1</sup> ampicillin. The next day, 100 µL of each overnight culture was used to inoculate 10 mL fresh LB medium in a 125 mL baffled conical flask. The culture was grown at 37°C, 200 rpm for 1 hr then the OD<sub>600</sub> of the flask was determined. An appropriate dilution of each culture was plated on agar plates containing either LB-only, or LB amended with 10 µM metronidazole or 5 µM chloramphenicol. At 10 µM metronidazole, cells expressing NfsA_Ec 36_37 or 20_39 could not grow but cells bearing no plasmid could, while the reverse scenario applied with 5 µM chloramphenicol. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 16 hr (LB-only or LB + metronidazole) or 40 hr (LB + chloramphenicol). To confirm the presence/absence of the plasmid bearing 36_37 or 20_39, 47 colonies from each condition were streaked on LB agar plates supplemented with 100 µg.mL<sup>−1</sup> ampicillin and incubated at 37°C for 16 hr, with growth indicating presence of the plasmid and no growth indicating absence of the plasmid. The same 47 colonies, alongside a negative control were further tested in a PCR screen with <italic>nfsA</italic>_Ec forward and reverse specific primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prosser et al., 2013</xref>). A band of approximately 720 bp indicated presence of the plasmid, while no band indicated absence of the plasmid.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, data are given as the mean ± standard deviation.

Apparent <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> were calculated using Graphpad 8.0. Kinetic parameters could not be accurately determined for 1,4<italic>-</italic>benzoquinone, therefore the catalytic rate of 1,4-benzoquinone reduction was measured at a single high concentration of 1,4-benzoquinone (100 µM) with reactions initiated by addition of 250 µM NADPH. All reactions were measured in triplicate and errors are ±1 S.D. In the left-most column, the terminology ‘+’ refers to an enzyme variant that has the same amino acid sequence as the variant in the row above, plus the one additional substitution indicated. For example, ‘+R225V’ describes a variant sharing an identical primary sequence to NfsA, with the additional substitution R225V. *Apparent <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> as determined at 250 µM NADPH. **Measured rates following addition of 250 µM NADPH. ***N.D.=not detectable (change in OD<sub>340</sub> &lt;0.1 s<sup>−1</sup>). (c) Average fold improvement for all NfsA_Ec variants that either retained R225 or contained a R225V/D substitution. To calculate the average fold improvement of variants retaining R225, the fold improvement relative to wild-type NfsA_Ec of all 64 variants retaining R225 was averaged. To calculate the average fold improvement of variants with the R225V or R225D substitutions, the fold improvement relative to wild-type NfsA_Ec of all 64 variants containing either R225V (in 36_37 intermediates) or R225D (in 20_39 intermediates) was averaged. (d) Relative levels of chloramphenicol growth inhibition experienced by <italic>E. coli</italic> 7NT strains expressing the 50 unique <italic>nfsA</italic> variants generated by epPCR. Following transformation of <italic>E. coli</italic> 7NT cells with the epPCR library, plating on LB amended with 10 µM chloramphenicol, and random selection of 60 colonies, 50 unique variants (numbered from ep_1 to ep_50; ep for ‘error-prone PCR’) were identified by Sanger sequencing of the pUCX inserts. Fresh day cultures of each unique strain were incubated at 30°C, 200 rpm for 4 hr post-challenge with either a low (7.5 µM), medium (15 µM) or high (30 µM) concentration of chloramphenicol, and percentage growth inhibition was determined by calculating the relative increase in OD<sub>600</sub> for challenged cultures relative to unchallenged replicates. (e) Summary of all encoded amino acid and nucleotide substitutions identified in the 50 unique <italic>nfsA</italic> variants obtained from the epPCR library following chloramphenicol selection. (f) Summary of all encoded amino acid and nucleotide substitutions identified in 20 randomly-chosen <italic>nfsA</italic> variants obtained from the epPCR library in the absence of chloramphenicol selection.</p></caption><media

has so far been mostly a matter of speculation and your paper now shows conclusively that in the quinone reductase NfsA, a promiscuous chloramphenicol-detoxifying nitroreductase activity can only be amplified if a key first mutation eliminates the native activity of NfsA, after which additional substitutions incrementally improve the affinity for chloramphenicol as a substrate. This example substantiates a model for enzyme evolution, in which a single mutation can open the path to the rapid amplification of a desirable promiscuous activity simply by eliminating native substrate competition.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A giant leap in sequence space reveals the intracellular complexities of evolving a new function&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrei Lupas as the Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.

The model system is <italic>E. coli</italic> nitro/quinone reductase NfsA, a promiscuous FMN-dependent oxidoreductase that reduces toxic compounds and has the basal ability to reduce the antibiotic chloramphenicol. This function was used to select for improved detoxification by mass-mutagenizing eight active-site residues and isolating variants with up to 10-fold higher tolerance against chloramphenicol. The five best variant proteins were purified and characterized, showing that their kcat/Km was only marginally improved, with worse kcat but improved Km, indicating that the improvements in detoxification were driven by enhanced substrate affinity. For the top two variants, all possible evolutionary trajectories were recreated and their EC<sub>50</sub>'s tested to determine the most likely possible step-wise paths from NfsA to the final variants. The authors found that iterative evolutionary strategies could have generated similar variants, but that there were only few accessible pathways, indicating epistatic effects. The analysis also showed that for both variants, elimination of arginine at position 225 in the first step enabled further improvements to take hold and played a role in the loss of wildtype 1,4-benzoquinone activity. The sensitivity to four out of five tested prodrugs was however unchanged. Turnover of the fifth prodrug, namely reduction of metronidazole, which yields a toxic product, was on the other hand increased in the evolved variants, and could be used as a counter-selectable marker. This was briefly tested showing the potential of such an application.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This study presents a wealth of data, and is well reasoned, carefully executed and clearly laid out. However, although it states that its aim was to study the evolution of a promiscuous function within the native host environment and thus under metabolic interference of the native substrate, this was not the approach taken. Instead, a fitness peak for the promiscuous function was identified through mass mutagenesis at eight positions followed by selection, and then two potential evolutionary paths leading from the wild type to this peak were inferred based on an analysis of all possible mutant combinations at the mutagenized positions. The authors need to make clear throughout the paper that the variants able to detoxify chloramphenicol were not evolved and did not arise against metabolic interference of the native substrate. This is an important point as the considerable potential of endogenous metabolites to shape evolutionary outcomes (Abstract) is purely inferred from the observation that the first mutation in both reconstructed evolutionary paths appears to have been a mutation at R225, which led to a substantial drop in the turnover rate of the endogenous substrate. From this the authors conclude (very prominently throughout the paper) that the evolution of a new activity is only possible after loss of activity against the original substrate. From the data presented, it is however not clear to what extent this conclusion is supported.</p><p>1) According to the data in Figure 4 and Supplementary file 1B, mutation of R225 alone is accompanied by a ~2-fold increase in kcat/Km for chloramphenicol. This seems to be sufficient to explain the ~2-fold increase in EC<sub>50</sub> for chloramphenicol without invoking loss of quinone reductase activity. The control experiment in Figure 5, showing that substitution of R225 has no effect on most promiscuous activities of NfsA, also seems to indicate that the loss of native activity is not required for the evolution of chloramphenicol resistance. It would be important to determine the kinetic parameters of 1,4-benzoquinone reduction for NfsA and the purified R225V and R225D mutants in order to establish the loss of quinone reductase activity in the postulated first step of the evolutionary path. It would also be useful to study the effect of 1,4-benzoquinone competition on the chloramphenicol reductase activity of the mutants, at least the first ones along the proposed path, in order to show that they rapidly become insensitive to the native substrate.</p><p>2) After the initial screening of the transformed library of NfsA variants, 0.05% of gene variants are reported to be more effective in chloramphenicol detoxification than the wild type. In the next steps, this number is reduced to the top 30 variants, as characterized by their improvement of chloramphenicol EC<sub>50</sub> values (Figure 1D). However, it is not clear from the presentation whether these observations were controlled for the expression levels of the different NfsA mutants. Protein variants are often expressed at different levels in vivo, which can have a significant effect on the activity measured. Figure 1D was used for selection of the &quot;best&quot; variants for the rest of the study and to support this choice and the conclusions of the manuscript, relative enzyme expression levels should be reported (and if significantly different, should be corrected for). Such expression levels are reported later on for the 36_37 and 20_39 variants, but are missing at this early stage.</p><p>3) While mutation of R225 appeared to be required for improved chloramphenicol detoxification in this study, the authors only considered the effects of substitutions at eight positions. This is probably the main weakness of the combinatorial mutagenesis approach used here. It seems plausible that substitutions at other positions could also increase chloramphenicol tolerance, possibly opening a path without loss of quinone reductase activity. If the authors were able to perform one round of error-prone PCR on NfsA with selection for improved chloramphenicol resistance and obtain mainly variants with substitution of R225, this would substantially strengthen their claim that evolution of increased chloramphenicol resistance can only occur through loss of quinone reductase activity.</p><p>4) Even with additional experimental support for the main conclusion of the article, it seems fundamentally problematic to extrapolate from two instances to a general principle of evolution. The authors should tone done the claims that improved chloramphenicol detox activity is ONLY possible after elimination the native activity and instead comment on the two characterized mutant pathways as examples of this phenomenon, within the limitations of the experimental setup.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59081.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This study presents a wealth of data, and is well reasoned, carefully executed and clearly laid out.

We recognise the distinction between our mass mutagenesis strategy and stepwise evolution, and have edited our manuscript to eliminate any unjustified claims regarding evolution of our variants (most commonly, we added the word “hypothetical” in front of “evolutionary trajectory” , and substituted the word “evolved” with “selected” where the former was not justified). We do however disagree with the statement that our variants “did not arise against metabolic interference of the native substrate”. A key aspect of our work that is different from many previous directed evolution studies is that we selected our improved variants within their native host environment, where they were very specifically exposed to their native substrates. We consider that this clearly shaped the outcomes.</p><p>With credit to the excellent suggestion from the reviewers that we perform epPCR on the native <italic>nfsA</italic> gene to see whether substitution of R225 predominates, we note that we now have much stronger evidence to support our conclusions around the need to eliminate the native activity to enable improved chloramphenicol detoxification (see response to reviewers’ point 3 below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) According to the data in Figure 4 and Supplementary file 1B, mutation of R225 alone is accompanied by a ~2-fold increase in kcat/Km for chloramphenicol.

In brief, it was not possible for us to derive meaningful 1,4-benzoquinone kinetic parameters for the two variants (both R225V and R225D exhibit a just-detectable level of 1,4-benzoquinone activity, as was indicated in the “Rate with 100 µM <italic>p</italic>-benzoquinone” column of Supplementary file 1B and in Figures 4A and B; but the activity was essentially undetectable at lower concentrations). This is the basis for our conclusion that quinone reductase activity has indeed been lost in the postulated first step of the evolutionary path. To more overtly justify this conclusion to the reader, we have now referred to these data explicitly in the main text, as detailed in our response to the next point.</p><p>ii) We agree that it would be ideal to study the effect of 1,4-benzoquinone competition on the chloramphenicol reductase activity of the mutants, but unfortunately both chloramphenicol and 1,4-benzoquinone reduction assays rely on monitoring NADPH depletion at 340 nm, so it is not possible to deconvolute the relative turnover of each substrate by spectrophotometric assays in a mixed solution (in our previous study, we were able to independently monitor PR-104A reduction at 400 nm). However, it is important to note that in our previous study the top selected variant was still partially active with 1,4-benzoquinone in vitro, making it plausible that substrate competition could occur. Here we show that 1,4-benzoquinone activity had effectively been eliminated from our R225-substituted variants, and we therefore consider it reasonable to presume that 1,4-benzoquinone will no longer exhibit substrate competition with chloramphenicol. We have now clarified these points in the text, with the last two sentences of the relevant paragraph now reading:</p><p>“Here, we were unable to perform the same in vitro competition assays, as both 1,4-benzoquinone and chloramphenicol reduction are monitored by following NADPH depletion at 340 nm. […] In contrast, for wild type NfsA, 1,4-benzoquinone reduction (<italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>/<italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> = 5.8 × 10<sup>6</sup>; Valiauga et al., 2017) is nearly 1000-fold more efficient than chloramphenicol reduction (Table 1). Our data are therefore consistent with in vivo chloramphenicol reduction having been amplified for the selected variants by the elimination of competitive quinone inhibition.”</p><p>We also note that the additional epPCR experiments (see point 3 below) strongly reinforce that evolving improved chloramphenicol detoxification necessitates elimination of R225, which is consistent with 1,4-benzoquinone outcompeting chloramphenicol as a substrate for wild type NfsA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) After the initial screening of the transformed library of NfsA variants, 0.05% of gene variants are reported to be more effective in chloramphenicol detoxification than the wild type.

We have now performed SDS-PAGE analysis for the <italic>E. coli</italic> strains expressing each of the top 30 variants alongside wild type NfsA controls, and can confirm that there is no substantial variation in expression between these variants and wild type NfsA. We have provided these data as a supplementary figure (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1), and have added the following sentence to the main text: “SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that there was no substantial variation in expression between these variants and native <italic>nfsA</italic>, and hence the enhanced chloramphenicol detoxification was not a consequence of elevated expression levels Figure 1—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While mutation of R225 appeared to be required for improved chloramphenicol detoxification in this study, the authors only considered the effects of substitutions at eight positions.

Our previous conclusions regarding the need to eliminate the native quinone reductase activity have now received a compelling corroboration by our discovery that 100% of unique selected variants (50/50) after one round of epPCR on native <italic>nfsA</italic> were carrying an R225 substitution. We have added an additional section of text entitled “Directed evolution of NfsA via epPCR yields exclusively R225-substituted variants” and two additional supplementary tables (Supplementary file 1E and F) and a new supplementary figure to describe these findings; and have reworked our Abstract and Discussion slightly to recognise them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Even with additional experimental support for the main conclusion of the article, it seems fundamentally problematic to extrapolate from two instances to a general principle of evolution.
