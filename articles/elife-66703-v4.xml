age, leading to altered cytokine polarization and immune dysfunction, shifting these critical immune cells from protective sentinels to disease promoters. The molecular mechanisms underlying macrophage inflammaging are poorly understood. Using an unbiased RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach, we identified <italic>Mir146b</italic> as a microRNA whose expression progressively and unidirectionally declined with age in thioglycollate-elicited murine macrophages. <italic>Mir146b</italic> deficiency led to altered macrophage cytokine expression and reduced mitochondrial metabolic activity, two hallmarks of cellular aging. Single-cell RNA-seq identified patterns of altered inflammation and interferon gamma signaling in <italic>Mir146b-</italic>deficient macrophages. Identification of <italic>Mir146b</italic> as a potential regulator of macrophage aging provides novel insights into immune dysfunction associated with aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY019287-08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Apte</surname><given-names>Rajendra S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Apte</surname><given-names>Rajendra S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000965</institution-id><institution>American Federation for Aging Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Apte</surname><given-names>Rajendra S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010657</institution-id><institution>Carl Marshall and Mildred Almen Reeves Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Apte</surname><given-names>Rajendra S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jeffery T.

Through surface-bound or secreted factors, they signal to other cells and regulate diverse processes such as angiogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis. These global functional consequences of macrophage activity make these cells critical in regulating the molecular pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system, and blinding eye conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelly et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore and Tabas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mammana et al., 2018</xref>). Macrophages undergo broad programmatic changes with aging that manifest as abnormal macrophage activation and polarization and are phenotypically labeled as immunosenescence or inflammaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sene and Apte, 2014</xref>). This age-associated shift in the macrophage phenotype from disease protective to disease promoting led us to hypothesize that alterations in the aged macrophage transcriptome may regulate this dysfunction.</p><p>Altered macrophage polarization and activation are associated with aging and drive molecular inflammation. Although this age-induced macrophage-mediated phenotype has been partially characterized, the current paradigm relies on an incomplete cytokine signature to determine whether macrophages mitigate or promote disease with little information about the altered regulatory networks that inform downstream effector function of aging macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Locati et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref>). Over the past decade, numerous studies have described how microRNAs (miRNAs), short non-coding RNAs ~22 nucleotides long, regulate gene expression by either transcript degradation or translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartel, 2009</xref>). Multiple laboratories have demonstrated that miRNAs control critical processes in macrophages, including cholesterol efflux, lipid metabolism, and polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sene et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2012</xref>). We hypothesized that expression of specific macrophage miRNAs is altered with organismal aging and may drive the inflammaging process. We tested this by examining changes in miRNA expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Using this unbiased approach, we identified a potentially high-value miRNA (<italic>Mir146b-5p</italic>) that inversely correlates with thioglycollate-elicited macrophage (TGEM) host age. Here we demonstrate that expression of <italic>Mir146b</italic> progressively declines in the aging TGEM and is associated with significant mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal macrophage activation and polarization, recapitulating the inflammaging phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TGEM purity is unaffected by host age</title><p>Although miRNAs have been implicated in regulating age-associated gene expression, their role in directing gene expression patterns and function in aging macrophages is unclear. We hypothesized that altered transcriptional regulation by miRNAs contributed to age-associated programmatic alterations in macrophages and sought to examine these changes in non-coding RNA expression on a genome-wide scale. Thioglycollate injection induces a sterile inflammatory response in the mouse peritoneum, which elicits infiltration of monocytes from the blood. Lavage of the peritoneum several days post-injection allows for the collection of the activated TGEM population, consisting of both resident and recruited macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pavlou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghosn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Layoun et al., 2015</xref>), with the potential to collect additional cell types that may be present in the peritoneum. Collected cells are gently centrifuged, resuspended in complete culture medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS), and plated in tissue culture plastics. TGEMs adhere to tissue culture plastics, while other cells such as red blood cells or adipocytes do not. Cells that have not adhered to the tissue culture plates can be eliminated by gentle washes with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and the remaining adhered cells can be used for analysis. In order to ensure that this preparation method provided a highly pure TGEM population for our studies and to determine if the age of the mouse from which the TGEMs were harvested impacted the degree of macrophage purity, we harvested peritoneal lavage exudates from five young (3 months old) and five old (20 months old) female C57Bl/6 mice 4 days post-thioglycollate induction. Cells collected from individual mice were treated as independent biological samples. We plated samples as described above and allowed the macrophage population to adhere overnight to the culture dishes. The next day, non-adherent cells were washed away using DPBS and we gently lifted the remaining adherent cells into freshly prepared ice-cold fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer. Each sample was stained for macrophage markers CD11b and F4/80. Flow cytometry analysis showed that approximately 95% of all cells stained double-positive for both markers, confirming these cells as macrophages. Moreover, we confirmed that the age of the mouse from which the cells were harvested does not impact the purity of the TGEM population obtained through this procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We utilized this method of thioglycollate induction and cell adherence to collect TGEMs for the experiments throughout this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Macrophage <italic>Mir146b</italic> expression levels decline during aging</title><p>Having established our method for obtaining TGEMs, we next performed RNA-seq analysis using small RNAs purified from TGEMs isolated from six time points (3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, and 30 months) spanning the normal lifespan of C57Bl/6 mice to identify miRNAs whose expression changed with aging. Peritoneal exudates from 10 female thioglycollate-elicited mice were pooled to obtain one TGEM sample per time point. As miRNAs generally function to repress their targets, we were most interested in miRNAs whose expression decreased with organismal age, which would in turn lead to the accumulation of the miRNA’s downstream target genes that may contribute to age-associated inflammation and cellular dysfunction. Unsurprisingly, we found many miRNAs whose overall expression was altered with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We next validated the miRNAs whose expression seemed to decrease most gradually with increasing host age using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Each individual mouse used was treated as an independent biological replicate sample (n = 7–9 mice per age group). Each sample was run in duplicate for each probe set, and the average cycle threshold (Ct) value of the two technical replicates for each sample was used for computing the ΔΔCt and expression levels relative to our youngest (3 months old) time point. While our original RNA-seq dataset included mice as old as 30 months, the oldest mice available at the time of our validation were aged 20 months. Utilizing TGEMs from female mice at ages 3, 12, or 20 months, we observed no statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05) in expression levels of <italic>Mir15a</italic>, <italic>Mir29a</italic>, <italic>Mir423</italic>, <italic>Mir146a</italic>, or <italic>Mir18a</italic> with age<italic>. Mir362</italic> (data not shown) was also evaluated but was undetected for approximately half of all samples tested, independent of age, and was therefore excluded from analysis. Two miRNAs, <italic>Mir146b</italic> and <italic>Mir22</italic>, displayed significant decreases from 3 to 20 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–H</xref>). Previous studies in monocytes/macrophages have demonstrated that <italic>Mir22</italic> is upregulated through PU.1 during hematopoetic differentiation and a loss of <italic>Mir22</italic> is associated with acute myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Mir22</italic> can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncomiR, depending upon the context, and its expression has been shown to increase with aging in hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Wang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jazbutyte et al., 2013</xref>). For <italic>Mir146b</italic>, prior works have demonstrated decreased expression in obesity and the progression and metastases of cancers including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and glioblastoma multiforme, and its expression has been noted to decrease with age in the lungs in human bronchial biopsies from healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hulsmans et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Correia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ong et al., 2019</xref>). The effects of age-associated loss of neither <italic>Mir22</italic> nor <italic>Mir146b</italic> have been previously demonstrated in macrophages.

To further validate these findings, we used the hybridization probe-based Affymetrix QuantiGene 2.0 miRNA plate assay. We isolated total RNA from female TGEMs at 3 or 30 months of age and applied 250 ng of total RNA per well containing hybridization probe sets targeting either mature <italic>Mir146b</italic> or housekeeping gene <italic>U6</italic> for overnight incubation. Two technical replicates per probe set were run for each biological sample/mouse. The following day, the signal was amplified and detected by using a chemiluminescent substrate according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Here we further confirmed a comparable decrease in <italic>Mir146b</italic> relative expression levels from 3 to 30 months in TGEMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Age causes poorly understood programmatic changes within the macrophage that lead to a shift in polarization that promotes dysfunctional immunity and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). RNA-seq and subsequent qPCR validation demonstrated that <italic>Mir146b</italic> showed a consistent unidirectional alteration in expression pattern over the lifetime of a mouse. As such, we hypothesized that <italic>Mir146b</italic> target genes may either directly or indirectly regulate macrophage polarization and aging phenotype. High levels of <italic>Mir146b</italic> may promote a ‘young’ phenotype, and the progressive decline in its expression seen with increasing age likely leads to the alternative ‘old’ macrophage phenotype. To assess this hypothesis, we created macrophages (from young 3-month-old C57Bl/6 female mice) with transient <italic>Mir146b</italic> knockdown through fast-forward transfection with <italic>Mir146b</italic>-specific antagomir inhibitors at a final concentration of 25 nM. We measured the transfection efficiency (in separate wells) using a fluorescently tagged sham inhibitor of similar nucleotide length and noted a transfection efficiency of approximately 80%, with less than 2% cell death assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and data not shown) 24 hr post-transfection. This transfection protocol resulted in &gt;50% reduction in macrophage <italic>Mir146b</italic> miRNA expression levels when measured by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Mir146b</italic> for 72 hr in TGEMs resulted in trends of decreased gene expression of multiple cytokines and regulatory markers including <italic>Nos2</italic>, <italic>Mmp9</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Arg1</italic>, and <italic>Cd163</italic> along with a trend toward increased <italic>Il10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) when compared to the relative expression in sham-transfected control TGEMs. These results implicate <italic>Mir146b</italic> in regulating genes associated with macrophage polarization and inflammation, phenocopying aging macrophage phenotypes previously reported by our lab and others of decreasing M1-associated cytokine markers with simultaneously elevated <italic>Il10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelly et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sene et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Loss of <italic>Mir146b</italic> in TGEMs alters inflammatory cytokine profile.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fast-forward transfection of thioglycollate-elicited macrophages (TGEMs) from 3-month-old C57Bl/6 female mice with small (~22 nucleotides) RNAs (magenta) for microRNA knockdown causes little apoptosis as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (green/arrows) while (<bold>B</bold>) producing efficient knockdown of <italic>Mir146b</italic> vs scramble transfection control as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) expression analysis (n = 6 vs n = 6 from two separate experiments of n = 3 independent wells each; **p&lt;0.0022).

We also asked whether increasing age may amplify these transcriptional differences. To address these questions, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using TGEMs isolated from young (&lt;4 months) and old (&gt;17 months) cKO female mice and age-matched littermate Controls. Analysis revealed three transcriptionally distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). All clusters expressed macrophage markers including <italic>Mertk</italic>, <italic>Csf1r</italic>, and <italic>Cd68</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

A majority of the down-regulated genes identified by bulk RNA-seq displayed lower expression in clusters 1 and 3 of cells from cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This loss of expression is consistent with a premature aging phenotype as many of the genes also show decreased expression in aged Control macrophages compared to young Control cells, although the resident peritoneal macrophages (Cluster 2) displayed equal or elevated expression of a subset of the genes. <italic>Lyz1</italic>, which was upregulated in cKO TGEMs in the bulk RNA-seq, was most highly expressed in resident peritoneal macrophages (Cluster 2). Its expression increased in cKO macrophages across all clusters compared to the Control counterparts; however, this increase was not recapitulated by natural aging (young Control vs old Control). As discussed above, we were unable to modulate <italic>Lyz1</italic> expression using overexpression models. Taken together, these may suggest that <italic>Mir146b</italic>’s role in <italic>Lyz1</italic> regulation is indirect. Alternatively, this discrepancy may be caused by amplifying or divergent effects due to the dramatic loss of <italic>Mir146b</italic> associated with our knockout model compared to the slow decline that occurs with natural aging, estimated to be approximately 25% (reduction) at this time point based upon our initial RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

As with our bulk RNA-seq, we again primarily noted decreases in gene expression, with four out of five patterns showing loss of gene expression in old cKO macrophages compared to age-matched controls (patterns b–e). The genes within these patterns normally display significant age-dependent changes in Control TGEMs, but the scale of expression or expression change was significantly reduced upon loss of <italic>Mir146b</italic>. Genes within these patterns were enriched for cellular functions such as cholesterol transport and biosynthesis (pattern b), scavenging/phagocytosis and migration (pattern c), negative regulation of inflammation (pattern d), and calcium homeostasis and endocytosis (pattern e).</p><p>Pattern a, however, highlighted genes that normally show only small decreases with age but were significantly increased in aged cKO TGEMs. Interestingly, of the 28 genes differentially expressed in pattern a, six are integral to the interferon gamma (IFNy) signaling pathway, including interferon-stimulated gene 15 (<italic>Isg15</italic>), C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (<italic>Ccl5</italic>), interferon-induced transmembrane 3 (<italic>Ifitm3</italic>), interferon regulatory factor 7 (<italic>Irf7</italic>), interleukin-18 binding protein (<italic>Il18bp</italic>), and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (<italic>Slpi</italic>). These findings are especially informative as IFNy treatment has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the respiratory capacity of macrophages in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).

Several cancers, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, and blinding eye diseases such as AMD and glaucoma are examples of diseases associated with an exponential increase in prevalence with each passing decade of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nomellini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Quigley, 2011</xref>). Macrophage-mediated inflammation has been implicated in promoting dysfunctional immunity in many of these disorders of aging; however, the molecular mechanisms by which aging leads to dysregulated macrophage function remain unknown.</p><p>Programmatic alteration of macrophage gene expression (coding transcriptome) with age precedes the downstream effects on macrophage proteome and function. miRNAs, which are major components of the non-coding transcriptome, alter expression by either transcript degradation or translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartel, 2009</xref>). Here we completed a comprehensive non-biased profiling of the TGEM non-coding transcriptome by small RNA-seq of female mice 3–30 months of age (virtual lifespan) to probe for programmatic alterations in TGEM miRNA expression, which may contribute to the age-associated macrophage dysfunction that triggers the transition from physiologic aging to pathogenic inflammation and disease. We identified <italic>Mir146b</italic> and <italic>Mir22</italic> as microRNAs whose expression progressively decrease with age in TGEMs from female mice. <italic>Mir146b</italic> expression was noted to be greater than 3.3-fold higher in macrophages from young (3 months old) mice compared to <italic>Mir22</italic>. While future studies examining the loss of <italic>Mir22</italic> with aging in TGEMs are certainly warranted, here we chose to pursue the effects of <italic>Mir146b</italic> loss, as its initial high expression in TGEMs from young mice and gradual decline with age may represent a biologically relevant pattern consistent with the slow onset of age-related pathologies. One caveat of this study is that our original sequencing data, which identified <italic>Mir146b</italic> and <italic>Mir22</italic> as miRNAs of interest in aging TGEMs, were aligned to the mm9 version of the mouse genome. While re-alignment and re-analysis of our data using the updated mm10 genome build may reveal other interesting patterns of miRNA expression or identify new miRNAs of interest in aging macrophages, this is technically challenging due to the legacy format of the raw data, and as such, we have not been able to integrate the data into the newer build. Regardless, our subsequent qPCR data confirm that <italic>Mir146b</italic> expression significantly decreases from 3 to 30 months in not only TGEMs but also BMDMs. We did note that <italic>Mir146b</italic> is expressed at much higher levels in TGEMs, owing, perhaps, to the naive state of cultured BMDMs compared to elicited macrophages. Loss of <italic>Mir146b</italic> in TGEMs, established by both the transient knockdown ex vivo and a novel conditional macrophage/monocyte knockout mouse, resulted in altered cytokine expression and polarization that parallels low-grade chronic inflammation associated with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Beek et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrated that <italic>Mir146b</italic> deletion in TGEMs results in an abnormal mitochondrial structure and dysfunctional mitochondrial metabolism, characterized by a decreased OCR and ECAR. Interestingly, this phenotype was reversed with <italic>Mir146b</italic> overexpression. Further examination of the effects of <italic>Mir146b</italic> overexpression in TGEMs as well as other murine macrophages such as BMDMs is warranted in future studies.</p><p>Perhaps, not surprisingly, given our observed TEM and Seahorse findings, we identified altered gene expression of multiple mitochondria-related genes as well as genes critical to glucose metabolism in TGEMs deficient in <italic>Mir146b</italic> utilizing RNA-seq. Age-related reductions in oxidative phosphorylation have been noted not only in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2018</xref>) but also in myriad cell types, including cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lesnefsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tepp et al., 2017</xref>), intestinal mucosal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Özsoy et al., 2020</xref>), and retinal pigment epithelium of AMD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferrington et al., 2017</xref>), and may serve as an important indicator of age-related disease and progression. Interestingly, the only gene noted to significantly increase with <italic>Mir146b</italic> conditional knockout in TGEMs by bulk RNA-seq was <italic>Lyz1</italic>, which encodes for the bacteriolytic enzyme lysozyme C-1. This gene has not been previously linked to mitochondrial function and was not significantly increased with age in scRNA-seq or altered in overexpression experiments. Our study identifies a novel role for <italic>Mir146b</italic> in mitochondrial metabolic function in macrophages within the innate immune system and suggests that a gradual loss of <italic>Mir146b</italic> expression with age contributes to TGEM dysfunction, possibly due to an altered IFN gene response. These changes in TGEM metabolism, activation, and polarization may contribute to the para-inflammation associated with aging and diseases of aging. Further research will be necessary to determine whether this age-associated dysfunction extends to macrophages from other tissues and whether it is therapeutically modifiable.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Washington University in Saint Louis and performed according to the Washington University Animal Care and Use Guidelines. Data presented within this manuscript were obtained using female mice. C57Bl/6 mice, ranging in age from 3 to 30 months, were obtained from the National Institute on Aging (Bethesda, MA) Aged Rodent Colony. To create mice lacking <italic>Mir146b</italic>, a targeting vector that utilized a modified pBluescript backbone was constructed using recombineering methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). The first step was the retrieval of the entire length of the construct from the RP24-161H3 Bac vector. In the next step, the lone LoxP site, 326 bp downstream of <italic>Mir146b</italic>, was inserted. The last step was insertion of the LoxP and Frt flanked Neo cassette, 676 bp upstream of<italic>Mir146b</italic>. The construct contains a 5’ homology arm, a <italic>Pgk-</italic>driven Neo cassette flanked by Frt sites with a LoxP site upstream of the Neo cassette, a conditional arm with a lone LoxP site downstream of the conditional arm, and finally a 3’ homology arm. The 5’ arm starts at 3877 bp upstream of <italic>Mir146b</italic> and is 3201 bp in length. The conditional arm is 1118 bp and contains <italic>Mir146b</italic>. The 3’ arm starts 327 bp downstream of <italic>Mir146b</italic> and is 3117 bp in length. The linearized construct was transfected into SCC10 (129x1Sv/J) embryonic stem (ES) cells and clones were screened for G418 resistance and homologous recombination via long range PCR and Southern hybridization. Positive karyotypically normal ES clones were subsequently injected into mouse blastocysts. The resulting chimeric male mouse served as the colony founder and was bred to C57Bl/6J female mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor; ME Stock No. 000664). Mice positive for the <italic>Mir146b</italic> insert were bred to B6.Cg-Tg(Pgk1-flpo)10Sykr/J hemizygous Flp deleter strain (Jackson Laboratory Stock No. 011065) to remove the Universal Neo cassette. Offspring positive for the <italic>Mir146b</italic> knock-in construct and negative for Frt/Universal Neo were further crossed to C57Bl/6J for subsequent generations to establish the line at &gt;99% in the C57Bl/6J background. Genetic background analysis was performed by IDEXX BioAnalytics (Columbia, MO) using C57Bl/6J as the reference background. To create mice in which <italic>Mir146b</italic> was conditionally knocked out in macrophages, we crossed this line with <italic>Lyz2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice (Jackson Laboratory stock No. 04781) to produce <italic>Lyz</italic> <sup>Cre</sup> <italic>Mir146b</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> (cKO) and <italic>MiR146b</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> littermate controls (Controls). The final breeding scheme of <italic>Lyz</italic> <sup>Cre</sup> <italic>Mir146b</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> X <italic>MiR146b</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> resulted in viable fertile litters with approximately half of the pups being <italic>Mir146b</italic> macrophage cKOs and half, Cre-negative (non-excised) <italic>Mir146b</italic>-construct-positive Controls.

At day 4 post-injection, mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation and macrophages were collected by peritoneal lavage in 10 ml DPBS (Gibco [ThermoFisher Scientific]; Waltham, MA). Cells were pelleted at 1000 x<italic>g</italic> for 10 min, DPBS was decanted, and cells were resuspended and plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco) containing 10% FBS (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic cocktail (Gibco), and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco). Following overnight cell adherence, plates were washed two to three times with DPBS to remove non-adherent cells and complete DMEM medium was replaced for approximately 24 hr, at which time they were directly assayed or harvested for further analysis. Cells were maintained in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>For BMDMs, mice were euthanized via CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation, and the femurs and tibia were harvested. Each bone was flushed with 5 ml DMEM using a 25 g needle and syringe to collect the bone marrow. The cell suspension was passed through a 100 μM strainer to remove clumps. Cells were plated in a differentiation medium consisting of DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 1% pen/strep, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 20% conditioned medium from L929 cell culture. Cultures were washed in DPBS every 3 days and the differentiation medium replaced through d7, after which time they were switched to a medium without the addition of L929-conditioned media and prepared for assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Cells were harvested by peritoneal lavage of thioglycollate-elicited female mice, aged 3 or 20 months, cultured overnight in complete DMEM to allow macrophage/monocyte cells to attach, washed with DPBS to remove non-adherent cells, and returned to culture to rest overnight as described above. To collect the adherent cells for analysis, plates were washed twice with DPBS to remove the residual culture medium and fresh ice-cold FACS buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% sodium azide in DPBS) was added to the plate. Cells were gently removed using a cell lifter. The resulting cell suspension was pipetted up and down to achieve single cells and then passed through a 50-µM filter. Cells were stained with CD11b eFluor450 and F4/80 APC (eBiosciences) and 30,000 cells per sample were analyzed using a BD FACSCanto Flow Cytometry system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Small RNA-seq of C57Bl/6 macrophages</title><p>For small RNA-seq to examine miRNA expression, TGEMs were harvested, as described above, from C57Bl/6 female mice of ages 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months (National Institute on Aging). Peritoneal exudates containing TGEMs were pooled from 10 mice per age group and plated and washed as described above. RNA (&gt;10µg) was isolated from macrophage samples using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) as per manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was randomly fragmented and converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) for sequencing using the Illumina GAII (San Diego, CA) platform. The resulting sequencing reads were analyzed by Cofactor Genomics (St Louis, MO), in consultation with the Washington University Genome Center, using the Cofactor Genomics EXP software package. Sequences were first aligned against the mouse genome (July 2007 [NCBI37/mm9]). Overlapping reads were then clustered together to assemble expressed loci and provide respective read counts and coverage for each locus. All counts and expression levels were normalized down to the sample with the fewest reads in order to allow cross sample comparative expression between loci. A x6 coverage multiplier was used as a cutoff for including reads to compensate for stochastic deep sequencing. A pair-wise comparison was performed between samples and log2 ratios were computed for each expressed small RNA. Sequences aligning to the annotated regions of the mouse genome that have been previously identified as 572 individual microRNAs were used for further analysis. We next identified microRNAs whose expression either consistently increased or decreased (ie, unidirectional change) across time in the progressively aging macrophage, allowing for +/- 10% error in the expression ratios between any two consecutive time points, such that if the (n + 1) time point compared to (n) was 0.9 &lt; (Exp(n+1))/Exp(n) &lt; 1.1, then it was considered to be no change and not contributing to either direction. A heatmap of the top 100 expressed miRNAs was constructed using Phantasus build 1.9.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zenkova et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>miRNA expression profiling</title><p>For qPCR analysis of miRNA expression, we isolated RNA from TGEMs using the miRvana RNA isolation kit and prepared cDNA using the miRCURY LNA Universal RT microRNA PCR, Polyadenylation and cDNA synthesis kit II (Qiagen) with 65 ng of starting RNA per reaction.

Samples were washed in sodium cacodylate buffer and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Polysciences Inc) for 1 hr. Samples were then rinsed extensively in distilled water (dH<sub>2</sub>0) prior to en bloc staining with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate (Ted Pella Inc, Redding, CA) for 1 hr. Following several rinses in dH<sub>2</sub>0, samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Eponate 12 resin (Ted Pella Inc). Sections of 95 nm were cut with a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems Inc, Bannockburn, IL), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed on a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc, Peabody, MA) equipped with an AMT 8.0 megapixel digital camera and AMT Image Capture Engine V602 software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Woburn, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>MTT reduction assay</title><p>TGEMs from female mice were plated at 100,000 cells per well in 96-well plates in complete DMEM medium as described above. At the time of the experiment, cells were washed with DPBS and DMEM medium containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT (Millipore-Sigma) was applied to the cells for 3 hr at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Freshly prepared isopropanol containing 10% triton-X 100 and 0.1 N HCl was used to dissolve formazan crystals formed during the incubation. Absorbance at 570 nM was measured on a Tecan Spark multi-mode plate reader (Morrisville, NC).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Seahorse Mito Stress Assay</title><p>For metabolic characterization of macrophages, we used the Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress test on an XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to measure the OCR as a surrogate marker for oxidative respiration. Macrophages were plated in Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplates (Seahorse Bioscience) at 100,000 cells per well. On the morning of the experiment, we washed the cells and replaced the medium with Seahorse assay medium (Agilent Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS, 25 mM glucose (Millipore Sigma, St Louis, MO), and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the pH adjusted to 7.4. After incubation in a non-CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C for 1 hr, we measured the OCR at baseline and after sequential treatment with the following chemicals from the Mito Stress Test kit (Seahorse Bioscience): 3 μM oligomycin, 5 μM FCCP, and 1 μM rotenone/antimycin A (rot/AA). Each cycle consisted of 2 min of mixing and a 1 min pause, followed by a 5-min measurement period; we repeated each cycle three times. We normalized the background of all measurements by subtracting the average OCR of each sample after treatment with rot/AA. Values from n = 6 technical replicates were averaged for each biological replicate sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>MicroRNA overexpression</title><p>Transient overexpression of <italic>Mir146b</italic> in TGEMs was achieved by fast-forward transfection of cells harvested from C57Bl/6J (Jackson) female mice using fluorescein amidite-labeled (FAM-labeled) <italic>hsa-146b-5p</italic> miRCURY locked nucleic acid (LNA) miRNA Mimic (5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">UGAGAACUGAAUUCCAUAGGCU</named-content>-3’; Qiagen; cat. #339173 YM00472354-ABD) or negative control A LNA (5’-/F6-FAM/<named-content content-type="sequence">AACACGTCTATACGC</named-content>-3’; Qiagen; cat. #300611–04). Briefly, after harvest, macrophages were seeded at 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere for 2 hr. Following DPBS washes to remove non-adherent cells, transfection complexes were prepared containing 50 nM of mimic (or negative control LNA) and 0.75% HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) and incubated for 15 min at RT before adding to the cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep, and 1% L-glutamine.

aging-related diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning why immune cells become dysfunctional during aging remain poorly understood. This study is a timely investigation demonstrating that aging leads to differential expression of micro RNAs in elicited peritoneal macrophages, which in turn promotes altered macrophage gene expression, polarization, and mitochondrial dysfunction. A key strength of this manuscript is the discovery of a role for miR-146b in macrophage biology, and the role of its decreased expression with age in driving aspects of macrophage functional decline with aging.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Loss of macrophage miR-146b with aging contributes to inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use a type of &quot;elicited&quot; macrophages, Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages (TGEMs), which do not represent a naive state, but an activated/recruited state. However, this information is only included in the material and methods, and not discussed in the rest of the manuscript. Since this could have a great impact on the results, the three reviewers agreed that it is essential that authors explicitly address the use of TGEMs, (even if only textually), including in the title, abstract and main text, to make sure that the narrower scope of findings is clear to readers without needing to read the material and methods. If possible (maybe for future studies), similar analyses of other macrophage types would help understand the general relevance of the finding on the impact of miR-146b on inflamm-aging.</p><p>2) Since the authors opted for an adherence-only method of purification for the TGEMs, it is crucial that some measurement of the purity of the macrophage population be provided to make sure that the purity of TGEMs by adherence is not affected by aging. An F4/80 and Cd11b flow cytometry staining on cells purified similarly from the same ages and sexes would be the ideal method for this.</p><p>3) The authors need to carefully edit the manuscript to include all relevant and necessary methodological details (e.g. sex of used mice in general and by panel, a systematic clarification of the use of technical vs. biological replicates, etc.). The authors also should refer to the individual reviewer comments for the points needed clarification in the revised manuscript on this point.</p><p>4) Generally, the authors need to improve and amend their statistical analyses. This includes (i) providing more information on the analysis leading to only miR-146b (since referees note that other miRs look significant in the analysis), (ii) removal of all t-tests since there is no power to test for data normality, removal of statistical tests when the authors only have n = 2, etc.</p><p>5) Finally, potentially contradictory findings between figures need to be reconciled or explicitly discussed by the authors. (e.g. Reviewer #2 point 4)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Santeford et al. study the regulation and impact of a microRNA, miR-146b, on macrophage aging phenotypes in mice. They first identify miR-146b as the only significantly and monotonously age-regulated miRNA in thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (TGEMs) using a small RNA-seq approach. They then proceed to perform short-term manipulation of miR-146b expression in culture, as well as using a myeloid KO in vivo, and observe consistent remodeling of gene expression of cytokine genes in TGEMs. They also observe that miR-146b deficiency impacts TGEM metabolic function, including mitochondrial respiration. Transcriptome-wide analysis (both bulk and single-cell level) of the impact of miR-146b deficiency in TGEMs from the myeloid miR-146b KO model reveals decreased expression of metabolic genes and increases in interferon-signaling genes, similar to what is reported with aging.</p><p>This article identifies an interesting new regulator [miR-146b] of macrophage phenotypes with potential relationship with aging, thus providing an interesting mechanistic insight into remodeling of macrophage function with aging. Consequently, this study is of interest to the fields of macrophage biology, immunometabolism and aging biology. While the strength of this manuscript is the discovery of a role for miR-146b inn macrophage biology, and potential link with functional decline with aging, a number of points need to be addressed before the study is presented with its full context (i.e. choice of use of TGEMs) and some technical questions are answered.</p><p>A major caveat that will need to be discussed and addressed by the authors is the use of TGEMs vs. naïve/resident peritoneal macrophages with aging. Indeed, thioglycolate elicitation recruits new non-resident macrophages to the peritoneum, and will also drive them to a more activated state in response to the foreign signal. TGEMs contain a lot more &quot;small&quot; peritoneal macrophages (bone-marrow derived) than steady state peritoneal macrophages (usually composed of a majority of &quot;large&quot; peritoneal macrophages, which are resident and of embryonic origin). Although the study of TGEMs is interesting (and provides insights into populations recruited upon infection) they do not represent the steady state. This point should be very clearly stated in the text rather than just in the material and methods, at least the first time the macrophages are mentioned rather than just refer to these as &quot;peritoneal macrophages&quot; which is incorrect and somewhat misleading.</p><p>1) Peritoneal Macrophages used from these experiments are from thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (majorly bone-marrow derived and recruited upon acute irritation), which are very different from the steady state population (embryonic derived and usually resting). Since thioglycolate is a way to mimic a chronic infection, some of the described biology (including the difference between TGEMs and BMDMs) could be due to a difference in response to the chronic infection instead of the difference between microRNA expression of aged animals. Thus:</p><p>a. This caveat needs to be explicitly addressed in the text the first time the authors mention the macrophages (line 80 &quot;peritoneal macrophages&quot;). This term should be systematically replaced with &quot;TGEM&quot; for accuracy throughout the manuscript.</p><p>b. The authors should discuss the caveat that effects may differ if unstimulated resident peritoneal macrophages had been evaluated instead.</p><p>c. Another point that should be discussed would be that the difference in age-regulated expression between TGEMs and BMDMs may be due to the effect of thioglycolate induction on the studied macrophages.</p><p>2) A number of studies are done with N = 2 samples (1E, 2C, 2F). This is problematic for several reasons: (i) statistics cannot be reliably applied to such small sample numbers and are thus meaningless and (ii) the use of the student t-test is for sure unwarranted, since a goodness of fit test is impossible to perform to confirm normality of data. If these pieces of data are retained as is, I recommend commenting on fold changes and nothing else. If the authors want to discuss statistics, additional samples need to be included and non-parametric tests should be used. In generally, the authors should revise analyses to use non-parametric tests instead of the Student t-test.</p><p>3) Aging is a very sex-dimorphic process, and thus a variable of interest in any study including aging as its topic. However, the sex of used animals is not given in the manuscript. Please update the manuscript to include this information. If only one sex was used, please discuss how results may be different in the other sex in the Discussion section. If both sexes were mixed, please make sure to color-code data points to differentiate females and males on the graphs.</p><p>4) Methodological details need to be included or revised for consistency reproducibility.</p><p>a. Please include a table with the sequences of all used qPCR and genotyping primers.</p><p>b. Some analyses are performed on the mm9 mouse genome build (e.g. small RNA-seq seq, line 449) and some on the mm10 genome build (e.g. RNA-seq of KO TGEMs line 591). Since this could lead to differences in results, please harmonize analyses so they are all performed on the same genomic build.</p><p>c. Please include all code/scripts used for the analysis in a supplementary document or deposit them to a Github repository as per the journal policy.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Santeford et al. investigated age-dependent molecular changes in macrophages that could contribute to inflammaging. Using RNA-seq analysis on peritoneal macrophages from mice of various ages, they identified miR-146b as a microRNA that progressively and unidirectionally declined with age. Using miR-146b antagomirs (inhibitors) and conditional knockout mice, they show that the loss of miR-146b function alters the expression of several inflammatory cytokines. Microscopic analysis revealed abnormal mitochondrial morphology in thioglycolate-induced peritoneal macrophages that lack miR-146b, which was coupled with reduced maximum respiratory capacity and glycolytic rate. Single cell RNA-seq on peritoneal macrophages revealed distinct clusters and a subset with altered interferon γ signaling.</p><p>The study demonstrates an interesting role for miR-146b as a regulator of macrophage function. It provides a strong correlation between microRNAs and inflammaging, but a causal relation is yet to be established. The study surveys the expression of macrophage miR-146 from mice of various age groups, uses a unique mouse model capable of conditionally knocking out miR-46b, and scRNA-seq to dissect the complex population of peritoneal macrophages in a peritonitis model. Some limitations of the study lie on the lack of mechanistic connection between miR-146b and mitochondrial/metabolic alternations, the incomplete understanding whether aging macrophages lose the adaptive capacity to induce miR-146b upon stimulation or the ability to maintain baseline expression, and the unclear role of resident vs recruited macrophages in inflammaging.</p><p>1. The authors state that miR-146b is the only microRNA that progressively and unidirectionally declined with age (lines 25-27, lines 66-68). This is confusing as Supplementary Figure 1 shows other miRNAs that decline with age, such as miR15a. Please clarify and/or rephrase.</p><p>2. The thioglycolate-induced peritonitis model provides activated macrophages (both resident and recruited monocyte-derived macrophages). In contrast, bone marrow-derived macrophages that were differentiated in vitro are naive. This difference may underly the inconsistent in age-dependent miR-146 expression pattern in Figure 1. Thus, it is possible that what is lost during aging in macrophages is the adaptive capacity to induce miR-146b rather baseline expression. Would miR-146b levels decline with age also in bone marrow-derived macrophages if they were to be stimulated (i.e. loss of adaptive capacity to induce miR-14b)?</p><p>3. The manuscript should clearly discuss that data on thioglycolate-induced peritoneal macrophages reflect induced responses rather than naive conditions.</p><p>4. The cytokine panel in Figure 2C (miR-146b knockdown) does not include some cytokines in 2F (miR-146b knockout) – were they measured? Also, please comment on the Mmp9 expression, which is decreased in 2C but increased in 2F.</p><p>5. It would strengthen the paper if the levels of secreted cytokines (proteins) upon loss of miR-146b were measured.</p><p>6. In figure 3, the authors overexpress miR-146b and show increased mitochondrial respiration. Does this also alter the expression of cytokines measured in Figure 2?</p><p>7. The loss of miR-146b reduces OCR/ECAR and, conversely, its overexpression increases OCR/ECAR. Further, the authors show that the loss of miR-146b affects the expression of mitochondria-associated genes. On that line, does miR-146b overexpression affect similar genes (which would revert the metabolic phenotype)?</p><p>8. The miR-146b-dependent metabolic shift may result from alterations of multiple metabolic pathways that consequently affect OCR/ECAR, such as glucose metabolism. Were there metabolic genes that changed in the RNA-seq? If so, is/were there a coherent metabolic pathway(s) that is/are highlighted? If possible, quantifying metabolites that are highly relevant to macrophage function would provide further insight.</p><p>9. Are the cytokines measured in Figure 2 reflected in the scRNA-seq of Lyz2; miR-146bM-/M- mice?</p><p>10. As the authors state, peritoneal macrophages consist of a heterogeneous population of resident and recruited (monocyte-derived) macrophages. Further, monocyte-derived macrophages may not display age-dependent loss of miR-146b (Figure 1C). The authors may want to add some discussion on the potentially differential role of resident vs recruited macrophages in inflammaging. Further, have the authors tried to compare resident vs recruited macrophages in the scRNA-seq on peritoneal macrophages in addition to the 3 clusters (it is not clear whether the largest cluster 1 is a mix of both populations)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Santeford et al., investigates whether micro RNAs regulate macrophage function during the aging process. The authors approached this question by using an unbiased non-coding RNA transcriptomic profiling of mouse peritoneal macrophages spanning the whole lifespan of mice from 3-30 months. This analysis revealed an aged-dependent decrease in the expression of the micro RNA miR-146B. The authors further revealed that transient knock-down or knock-out of miR-146B expression in peritoneal macrophages leads to altered cytokine gene expression, indicative of skewed macrophage polarization seen in aging tissues. Additionally, miR-146B KO macrophages also had altered mitochondrial morphology and dysfunctional mitochondrial metabolism. Lastly, to further investigate peritoneal macrophage populations that are most affected by loss of miR-146B, the authors performed single-cell RNA sequencing of peritoneal macrophages from old and young WT and miR-146B KO mice. This analysis largely showed that gene expression in recruited monocyte derived (non-resident) macrophages is most affected by loss of miR-146B. The authors conclude that gradual loss of miR-146B may lead to macrophage dysfunction and inflammation phenotypes during aging.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>– The authors use of unbiased non-coding RNA transcriptomic profiling of mouse peritoneal macrophages (spanning the whole lifespan of mice from 3-30 months) provides a thorough analysis of the expression profiles of multiple micro RNAs in an age-dependent manner. This approach allowed the authors to identify the age-dependent down-regulation in miR-146B expression. Furthermore, the authors data set also revealed age-dependent changes to other micro RNAs, which will be areas of future investigation and a great resource to the aging field.</p><p>– The authors utilized multiple genetics approaches to target miR-146B for transient knockdown and knockout in primary peritoneal macrophages and characterized the functional consequences. This approach led to the major findings in the paper that loss of miR-146B in macrophages leads to altered gene expression of inflammatory cytokines, metabolism genes, and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p>– In addition to in vitro based experiments, the authors developed a miR-146B KO mouse model and aged the mice to investigate how loss of miR-146B affected the aging phenotype of aging peritoneal macrophages. This analysis was largely done in an unbiased manner utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>– The authors claim that the unbiased non-coding RNA transcriptomic profiling revealed miR-146B as the only micro RNA with consistent progressive changes with age. However, careful analysis of Supplemental Figure 1A shows many other micro RNAs that appear to be both positively and negatively correlated with age, including miR-15a which has a nearly identical gene expression pattern to miR-146B.</p><p>– In Figure 1B, the authors attempt to validate the RNA-seq gene expression of miR-146B via qPCR in young and old peritoneal macrophages, to demonstrate that this micro RNA is down-regulated during aging. However, the authors do not attempt to look at other micro RNAs as controls to test their hypothesis that miR-146B is the only micro RNA whose expression is regulated during aging.</p><p>– Figure 1, the experimental details are not very clear as described in the main text or figure legends. For example, in all the experiments it is unclear whether the data represents individual mice or biological/technical replicates from an individual mouse, the sex of the mice used in the study is unclear, and many experiments have a small sample size, especially for being in vivo mouse experiments.</p><p>– The paper attempts to look at mechanisms of macrophage aging-related inflammation by solely focusing on thioglycolate induced peritoneal macrophages (a transient and non-resident monocyte derived subpopulation of macrophages) responding to acute inflammation. However, emerging evidence suggest that aging is characterized low-grade chronic inflammation. Thus, it's unclear whether miR-146B is relevant in aging-related inflammation since macrophages from naturally low-grade chronically inflamed aged tissues were not analyzed in this paper.</p><p>Furthermore, it is also unclear if miR-146B is differentially expressed in non-resident vs tissue resident macrophages as no attempt to measure this was done in the manuscript or in the single-cell data presented in Figure 4. This is especially relevant since the authors showed in Figure 1D that bone marrow derived macrophages do not express significant amounts of miR-146B, compared to peritoneal macrophages, suggesting that different population of macrophages may or may not express miR-146B, particularly those that drive inflammaging. Perhaps the authors could investigate macrophage phenotypes from other tissues (known to undergo inflammaging) such as fat tissue from young and old, WT and miR-146B KO mice.</p><p>– In Figure 2, the authors mention that loss of miR-146B affects macrophage polarization, skewing macrophages to a phenotype that resembles inflammaging. However, the authors only looked at a very narrow panel of cytokines. The data (both in vitro and in vivo) shows that loss of miR-146B leads to many pro-inflammatory cytokines being significantly down-regulated such as IL-1b and IL-6, while seeing an upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 suggesting miR-146B promotes an anti-inflammatory skewing (opposite of what the authors claim). Furthermore, this gene expression was performed under basal conditions which leads to less reliable gene expression. The authors did not attempt to measure how loss of miR-146B affects proper macrophage polarization via the treatment of macrophages with the type II cytokine IL-4 (M2) and LPS to skew to the classical M1 state.</p><p>– The data showing miR-146B regulates macrophage gene expression and mitochondrial function is descriptive and the authors do not provide any mechanistic insight in to how miR-146B promotes these changes.</p><p>-In Figure 4, the authors suggest the gene Lyz1 may be involved in the phenotype observed in miR-146B KO macrophages, but once again no attempt to demonstrate that miR-146B regulates mitochondrial function or gene expression via regulation of Lyz1 was performed. In fact, this conclusion is weakened by Figure 4E, showing that despite downregulation of miR-146B in old WT macrophages, Lyz1 expression does not increase as expected, making it an unlikely regulator of the altered gene expression seen in the WT old macrophages.</p><p>Overall, the authors of this study provided strong evidence that aging leads to the down-regulation of miR-146B expression in aging peritoneal monocyte derived macrophages. The authors have also provided strong evidence that miR-146B regulates cytokine expression and mitochondrial function in peritoneal macrophages. However, the paper suffers from being descriptive and lacking mechanistic insight in how miR-146B regulates macrophage cytokine expression and mitochondrial function. Lastly, for the reasons listed above the paper does not fully support the hypothesis that miR-146B may be a major driver of aging-related macrophage dysfunction and inflammaging.</p><p>1) Figure 1A, please clarify the units on the Y axis.</p><p>2) Typo pg 5, line 86, add space between number and months.</p><p>3) Figure 4D, clearly label what are resident vs non-resident markers.</p><p>4) Figure 4A and 4E, please list the genes in the same order and provide the same genes in each experiment.</p><p>5) Figure 4F, please label on graph what each Pattern represents, clearly state genes in each Pattern and if possible, show data for each gene in supplemental space.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Loss of Mir146b with aging contributes to inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Using a flow cytometry approach, as was also suggested by reviewers here, we harvested TGEMs from female C57Bl/6 mice at approximately 3 and 18 months of age and stained for macrophage markers F4/80 (clone BM8) and CD64 (clone x54-5/7.1). We acquired data on a BD LSR II flow cytometer and used FlowJo v10 software to visualize and analyze data. No difference in the macrophage population was noted with either marker, and the overall percentages of cells positive for both macrophage markers (and therefore identified as macrophages) was consistently 94-96% in both old and young. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> contains representative dot plots from TGEM samples from a young and an old mouse, each gated for live single cells and double positive for F4/80 and CD64, as well as normalized univariate histogram displays for each marker.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66703-resp-fig1-v4.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors need to carefully edit the manuscript to include all relevant and necessary methodological details (e.g. sex of used mice in general and by panel, a systematic clarification of the use of technical vs. biological replicates, etc.).

Indeed, in this graphical representation pattern coloring does appear similar, particularly in small format. However, when we look directly at the numerical expression data, we can see that the decrease in expression from 3 months to 30 months in not unidirectional, as was seen with <italic>miR-146b</italic> and that may be expected as a result of the natural aging process. In fact, <italic>miR-15a</italic> expression actually increases by more than 10% between two separate consecutive time points (12 months to 18 months and 24 months to 30 months, respectively), thereby failing our criterion threshold.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66703-resp-fig2-v4.tif"/></fig><p>We have also presented experiments throughout the manuscript that include a greater number of replicates, when possible, and amended our statistical analyses of all experiments in accordance with the recommendation to remove all t-test.

As the authors state, peritoneal macrophages consist of a heterogeneous population of resident and recruited (monocyte-derived) macrophages. Further, monocyte-derived macrophages may not display age-dependent loss of miR-146b (Figure 1C). The authors may want to add some discussion on the potentially differential role of resident vs recruited macrophages in inflammaging.

We have included flow cytometry analysis of both young (3 month old, n=5 biological replicates/individual mice) and old (20+ month old, n=5 biological replicates/individual mice) TGEMs using the macrophage markers CD11b and F4/80 to validate the purity of the macrophage population utilizing the adherence selection method employed throughout this study. Approximately 95% of all cells, in both young and old samples, were double positive for both markers, indicating not only a high level of macrophage purity, but also demonstrating that there is no purity difference due to age. This data has been included as Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 source data. Dr. Lynn Hassman contributed to this effort and has been included as an author on the revised manuscript.</p><p>2. We have evaluated the miRNA expression patterns for a number of additional miRNAs in TGEMs. Here we further investigated microRNAs identified in our original dataset to have overall decreased expression with age, but which were not noted to decline in quite the linear fashion with each age point, we observed <italic>Mir146b</italic>. Based on values from our original small RNA-seq, we have evaluated the expression of <italic>Mir15a, Mir22, Mir423, Mir29a, Mir146a,</italic> and <italic>Mir18a</italic> along with <italic>Mir146b</italic>. We also attempted to analyze <italic>Mir362,</italic> but found its expression below the limit of detection for nearly half of our samples, regardless of age, and therefore did not include it in this manuscript. While our original experiment was able to utilize mice as old as 30 months of age, 20 month old mice is the oldest time point that we are able to presently acquire. We have noted this caveat within the manuscript. This new validation using mice using 7-9 individual mice at 3, 12, and 20 months of age again demonstrated decline in <italic>Mir146b</italic> from 3 to 20 months. In addition, <italic>Mir22</italic> was observed to decline between these time points as well. Our RNA-seq data indicates that while there may be decreases in expression between 3 and 18-24 months, expression may actually increase again from 24-30 months. We have included the graph of normalized expression values for <italic>Mir22</italic> obtained from our small RNA-seq data, but we cannot presently validate this potential increase in TGEMs from 30 month mice, and as such, do not comment on this pattern within the manuscript. We do however note that the level of reads for <italic>Mir146b</italic> is more than 3 fold higher than that of <italic>Mir22,</italic> keeping <italic>Mir146b</italic> an attractive target for our study, but also note the need for future studies of <italic>Mir22</italic> in the aging macrophage.</p><p>3. We have explicitly highlighted and discussed that our original small RNA-seq data, which helped us to identify <italic>Mir146b</italic> as a microRNA of interest, was aligned to the mm9 version of the mouse genome. We understand that re-analysis of the data using a newer version may reveal different patterns of expression for some miRNAs, revealing additional miRNAs of interesting in aging. However, due to the changes in raw data file types and programs that have occurred in the time period since this data was originally procured, conversion has been technically challenging at this point, and as such we are currently unable to realign these files. Importantly though, our qPCR of miRNA expression and additional experiments validates our initial findings from this RNAseq data set—<italic>Mir146b</italic> progressively declines with aging in murine TGEMs.</p><p>4.
