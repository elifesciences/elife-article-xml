canonical amino acids. While the evolutionary forces driving these polyphyletic deletion events are not well understood, the consequence is that extant metazoans are unable to produce nine essential amino acids (EAAs). Previous studies have highlighted that EAA biosynthesis tends to be more energetically costly, raising the possibility that these pathways were lost from organisms with access to abundant EAAs. It is unclear whether present-day metazoans can reaccept these pathways to resurrect biosynthetic capabilities that were lost long ago or whether evolution has rendered EAA pathways incompatible with metazoan metabolism. Here, we report progress on a large-scale synthetic genomics effort to reestablish EAA biosynthetic functionality in mammalian cells. We designed codon-optimized biosynthesis pathways based on genes mined from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. These pathways were de novo synthesized in 3 kilobase chunks, assembled <italic>in yeasto</italic> and genomically integrated into a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. One synthetic pathway produced valine at a sufficient level for cell viability and proliferation. <sup>13</sup>C-tracing verified de novo biosynthesis of valine and further revealed build-up of pathway intermediate 2,3-dihydroxy-3-isovalerate. Increasing the dosage of downstream <italic>ilvD</italic> boosted pathway performance and allowed for long-term propagation of second-generation cells in valine-free medium at 3.2 days per doubling. This work demonstrates that mammalian metabolism is amenable to restoration of ancient core pathways, paving a path for genome-scale efforts to synthetically restore metabolic functions to the metazoan lineage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cricetulus griseus</kwd><kwd>essential amino acids</kwd><kwd>synthetic biology</kwd><kwd>synthetic genomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HR011-17-2-0041</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Harris H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RM1 HG009491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boeke</surname><given-names>Jef D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-2032259</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Harris H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PATH1016691</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Harris H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006984</institution-id><institution>Irma T.

Furthermore, these losses appear to have occurred multiple times during eukaryotic evolution, including in some microbial lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Payne and Loomis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guedes et al., 2011</xref>). Branching from core metabolism, the nine EAA biosynthesis pathways missing from metazoans involve over 40 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2 supp3">Supplementary files 1-3</xref>) that are widely found in bacteria, fungi, and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guedes et al., 2011</xref>). While the absence of pathways that produce essential metabolites is observed in certain bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zengler and Zaramela, 2018</xref>), which possess short generation times and high genomic flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing environments, the forces driving the loss of multiple EAA biosynthetic pathways in multicellular eukaryotes remain a great mystery. An exception that proves the rule is the partial reacquisition of EAA biosynthetic pathways through horizontal gene transfer in certain rare insect lineages which host genome-reduced intracellular bacteria and feed on simple nutrient sources such as sap or blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wilson and Duncan, 2015</xref>).

The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cell line was chosen as a model system due to its fast generation time, amenability to genetic manipulations, availability of a whole genome sequence, and established industrial relevance for producing biologics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>). EAA biosynthesis genes from the best characterized model organisms were considered during pathway design while optimizing for the fewest number of enzymes needed for a given EAA pathway. To avoid using multiple promoters, we introduced ribosome-skipping 2A sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Szymczak-Workman et al., 2012</xref> between biosynthetic genes to allow for protein translation of separate enzymes from a single transcriptional unit. The EAA pathway and an additional EGFP reporter were placed in a vector that could be integrated as a single copy into the CHO genome at a designated landing pad using the Flp-In system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">O’Gorman et al., 1991</xref>). The entire pathway was synthesized de novo by commercial gene synthesis in 3 kilobase fragments and assembled in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> via homologous recombination of 80-basepair overlaps. Subsequent antibiotic selection of cells transfected with the vector resulted in a stable cell line containing the integrated EAA pathway. Finally, we performed a variety of phenotypic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic characterizations on the modified cell line to verify activity of the EAA biosynthesis pathway.</p><p>We first confirmed that the CHO cell line was in fact auxotrophic for each of the nine EAAs. As expected, CHO-K1 did not grow in ‘dropout’ F-12K medium lacking each of the nine EAAs and supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We noted that in this cell line, canonically non-essential amino acids tyrosine and proline also exhibited EAA-like properties in dropout media. Insufficient concentrations of phenylalanine in F-12K medium or low expression of endogenous phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase that converts phenylalanine to tyrosine could underlie the tyrosine limitation. Proline auxotrophy in CHO-K1 results from epigenetic silencing of the gene encoding Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) in the proline pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hefzi et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore used proline as a test case for our synthetic genomics pipeline. We tested the P5CS-equivalent proline biosynthesis enzyme found in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, encoded by two separate genes, <italic>proA</italic> and <italic>proB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

These EAAs were chosen because their biosynthesis pathways were missing the fewest number of genes. Valine and isoleucine collectively require four genes to recapitulate the bacterial-native pathway. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The two remaining genes were included to test potential routes to simultaneously rescue threonine and methionine auxotrophy by selectively supplementing individual missing metabolic steps, in addition to complete pathway reconstruction for valine and isoleucine. To biosynthesize methionine, we chose the <italic>E. coli metC</italic> gene, which encodes cystathionine-ß-lyase and converts cystathionine to homocysteine, a missing step in CHO-K1 cells in a potential serine to methionine biosynthetic pathway. Threonine production was tested using <italic>E. coli</italic> L-threonine aldolase <italic>ltaE</italic>, which converts glycine and acetaldehyde into threonine. For branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) valine and isoleucine, three additional biosynthetic enzymes and one regulatory subunit are needed in theory to convert pyruvate and 2-oxobutanoate into valine and isoleucine, respectively. In the case of valine, pyruvate is converted to 2-acetolactate, then to 2,3-dihydroxy-isovalerate, then to 2-oxoisovalerate and finally to valine. For isoleucine, 2-oxobutanoate is converted to 2-aceto-2-hydroxybutanoate, then to 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylpentanoate, then to 3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate, and finally to isoleucine. The final steps in the biosynthesis of both BCAAs can be performed by native CHO catabolic enzymes Bcat1 and Bcat2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hefzi et al., 2016</xref>.

Flp-In integration was used to stably insert either pMTIV, or a control vector (pCtrl) into the CHO genome. Successful generation of each cell line was confirmed by PCR amplification of junction regions formed during vector integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). RNA-seq of cells containing the pMTIV construct confirmed transcription of the entire ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Western blotting of pMTIV cells using antibodies against the P2A peptide yielded bands at the expected masses of P2A-tagged proteins, confirming the production of separate distinct enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>In reconstituted methionine-free, threonine-free, or isoleucine-free F-12K medium supplemented with dialyzed FBS to reduce FBS-derived AA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), cells containing the pMTIV construct did not show viability over 7 days, similar to cells containing the pCtrl control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). In striking contrast, however, cells containing the integrated pMTIV showed relatively healthy cell morphology and viability in valine-free F-12K medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), whereas cells containing pCtrl exhibited substantial loss of viability over 6 days. In complete F-12K medium, cells carrying the integrated pMTIV construct showed no growth defects compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In valine-free F-12K medium, pMTIV cells showed a 32% increase in cell number over 6 days compared to an 88% decrease in cell number in pCtrl cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). When cultured in valine-free F-12K medium over multiple passages with medium changes every 2 days, pMTIV cell proliferation was substantially reduced by the 3rd passage. We hypothesized that frequent passaging might over-dilute the medium and prevent sufficient accumulation of biosynthesized valine necessary for continued proliferation as has been demonstrated for certain non-essential metabolites which become essential when cells are cultured at low cell densities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eagle and Piez, 1962</xref>. We thus deployed a ‘conditioned-medium’ regimen, whereby 50% of the medium was freshly prepared valine-free F-12K medium and 50% was ‘conditioned’ valine-free F-12K medium in which pMTIV cells had previously been cultured over 2 days (see Materials and methods). While use of pMTIV-conditioned medium improved the survival of cells harboring the pathway, it did not completely rescue valine auxotrophy in control cells, which exhibited substantial loss of cell viability over 8 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>). As a control, we generated pCtrl-conditioned valine-free F-12K medium using the same medium conditioning regimen, which failed to enable cells to grow to the same degree as that of pMTIV-conditioned medium, suggesting that the benefit conferred by medium conditioning is valine-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Using this regimen, we were able to culture pMTIV cells for 9 passages without addition of exogenous valine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The doubling time was inconsistent across the 49 days of experimentation with cells exhibiting a mean doubling time of 5.3 days in the first 24 days and 21.0 days in the last 25 days. Despite the slowed growth seen in later passages, cells exhibited healthy morphology and continued viability at day-49, suggesting that the cells could have been passaged even further. To verify that the putative valine rescue effect was due to the valine biosynthesis genes present in pMTIV specifically and did not involve confounding effects due to the threonine and methionine biosynthesis genes included in the pMTIV pathway, we constructed and tested a second EAA pathway vector, ‘pIV,’ that only contained the four genes <italic>ilvNBCD</italic>. The pIV construct similarly supported cell growth in valine-free F-12K medium, and exhibited similar growth dynamics to the pMTIV construct in complete medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>To confirm endogenous biosynthesis of valine, we cultured pCtrl and pMTIV cells in RPMI medium containing <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose in the place of its <sup>12</sup>C equivalent together with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-sodium pyruvate spiked in at 2 mM over three passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

This detected peak was subject to MS2 alongside a <sup>12</sup>C-valine control peak and a <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>/<sup>15</sup>N-valine peak, which was spiked into all samples to serve as an internal standard. The resulting fragmentation patterns for each peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) matched theoretical expectations for each isotopic version of valine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). An extracted ion chromatogram further revealed a peak in the pMTIV valine-free medium metabolite extraction, which corresponded to a peak in the spiked-in positive control <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>/<sup>15</sup>N-valine, whereas no equivalent peak was seen among metabolites extracted from pCtrl cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Taken together, this demonstrates that pMTIV cells are capable of biosynthesizing valine from core metabolites glucose and pyruvate, thereby proving successful metazoan biosynthesis of valine. Over the course of 3 passages in heavy valine-free medium, the non-essential amino acid alanine, which is absent from RPMI medium and synthesized from pyruvate, was found to be 86.1% <sup>13</sup>C-labeled in pMTIV cell lysates. Assuming similar turnover rates for alanine and valine within the CHO proteome, we expected to see similar percentages of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled valine. However, just 32.2% of valine in pMTIV cell lysates was <sup>13</sup>C-labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-E</xref>). For pMTIV cells cultured in heavy but valine-replete medium, just 6.4% of valine in cell lysates was <sup>13</sup>C-labeled.

The transcriptional impact of pathway integration is modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Only 51 transcripts were differentially expressed between pCtrl and pMTIV cells grown in complete medium, and the fold changes between conditions were small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). While some gene ontology (GO) functional categories were enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>), they did not suggest dramatic cellular stress. Rather, these transcriptional changes may reflect cellular response to BCAA dysregulation due to altered valine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhenyukh et al., 2017</xref>), or may result from cryptic effects of bacterial genes placed in a heterologous mammalian cellular context. In contrast, comparison of 48 hr valine-starved pCtrl and pMTIV cells yielded ~7500 differentially expressed genes. Transcriptomes of pMTIV cells in valine-free medium more closely resembled cells grown on complete medium than did pCtrl cells in valine-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Differentially expressed genes between pCtrl and pMTIV cells showed enrichment for hundreds of GO categories, including clear signatures of cellular stress such as autophagy, changes to endoplasmic reticulum trafficking, and ribosome regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Most of the differentially regulated genes between pCtrl cells in complete medium, and those same cells starved of valine for 48 hr were also differentially expressed when comparing pCtrl and pMTIV cells in valine-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that most of the observed transcriptional changes represent broad but partial rescue of the cellular response to starvation. We also examined the integrated stress response (ISR) and mTOR signaling pathways, both of which are known to modulate cellular responses to starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). We observed no clear signatures of mTOR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>), although a number of individual genes related to the mTOR pathway were significantly differentially expressed compared to pCtrl cells valine-starved for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). A manually curated list of ISR genes showed signals of ISR gene activation, but showed few differences between pCtrl and pMTIV cells at 48 hr of starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). pMTIV cells grown for 5 passages over 29 days on conditioned valine-free F-12K medium were more similar to pMTIV cells starved for 48 hr than to pCtrl cells starved for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>). The transcriptomic signature of these cells, appears slightly orthogonal to the ‘starvation’ effect and recovery of pMTIV and pCtrl cells starved for 48 hr in PCA space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>), but the majority of the differently expressed genes between pMTIV cells starved for 29 days compared to pCtrl cells grown on complete media are shared with cells starved for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C</xref>), suggesting some limited cellular adaptation to long term passaging on valine-free media.</p><p>To improve rescue of the valine starvation phenotype, we looked for valine biosynthetic pathway intermediates in our metabolomics data that might suggest that the pathway was bottlenecked at any stage. While no signal could be detected for pyruvate, 2-acetolactate or 2-oxoisovalerate, a signal was detected for pathway intermediate <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-2,3-dihydroxy-isovalerate, which was specific to pMTIV cells cultured in both complete and in valine-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Both pCtrl and pMTIV cells were infected and integrants were selected for on puromycin, resulting in a population-averaged integration count of 5.7 copies of <italic>ilvD</italic> for pCtrl cells and 7.1 for pMTIV cells.

We also reduced the isoleucine content of this isotopically heavy valine-free RPMI medium to match the isoleucine content of F-12K medium from 0.38 mM to 0.06 mM after observing that pMTIV cells proliferated faster in this condition, presumably due to the high sensitivity of the <italic>ilvN/B</italic>-encoded acetolactate synthase complex to isoleucine-induced negative feedback inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barak et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). pMTIV and pMTIV-ilvD + cells were cultured in this reduced-isoleucine heavy medium over 36 days on plates coated with 0.1% gelatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We calculated the molar content of valine within the cells by relativizing peaks to that of the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>15</sup>N-valine internal standard, which was spiked into each sample at a known concentration. pMTIV samples on average contained 352.0 picomoles of valine per million cells of which 212.5 picomoles was <sup>13</sup>C-labeled whereas pMTIV-ilvD + samples on average contained 423.0 picomoles of valine per million cells of which 242.5 picomoles was <sup>13</sup>C-labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Our results indicate that contemporary metazoan biochemistry can support complete biosynthesis of valine, despite millions of years of evolution from its initial loss from the ancestral lineage. Interestingly, independent evidence for BCAA biosynthesis has also been obtained for sap-feeding whitefly bacteriocytes that host bacterial endosymbionts; metabolite sharing between these cells is predicted to lead to biosynthesis of BCAAs that are limiting in their restricted diet. The malleability of mammalian metabolism to accept heterologous core pathways opens up the possibility of animals with designer metabolisms and enhanced capacities to thrive under environmental stress and nutritional starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, our failure to functionalize designed methionine, threonine, and isoleucine pathways highlights outstanding challenges and future directions for synthetic metabolism engineering in animal cells and animals. Other pathway components or alternative selections may be needed for different EAAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rees and Hay, 1995</xref>). For instance, the <italic>ilvB/N</italic> enzyme pair we chose to encode the acetolactate synthase complex in our construct shows feedback sensitivity to isoleucine, which may account for the failure of the pathway to rescue isoleucine auxotrophy. A general lack of predictability and a dearth of well-characterized and controllable genetic ‘parts’ with high dynamic range continue to hamper efforts in genome-scale mammalian engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Black et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Weingarten-Gabbay et al., 2019</xref>).

biosynthesis pathway (excluding pathways annotated as only occurring in prokaryotes) were collected from the MetaCyc database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Variant biosynthetic routes to the same amino acid were considered as separate pathways, generating distinct EC number lists. The resulting per-pathway EC number lists were checked against the KEGG, Entrez Gene, Entrez Nucleotide, and Uniprot databases using their respective web APIs for each listed organism. If the combination of all databases contained at least one complete EC numbers list, corresponding to an end-to-end complete biosynthetic pathway, the organism was considered ‘complete’ for that essential amino acid.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Cell lines and media</title><p>CHO Flp-In cells (ThermoFisher, R75807) were used in all experiments. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma. For growth assays involving amino acid dropout formulations, medium was prepared from an amino acid-free Ham’s F-12 (Kaighn’s) powder base (US Biological, N8545), and custom combinations of amino acids were added back in as needed to match the standard amino acid concentrations for Ham’s F-12 (Kaighn’s) medium or as specified. Custom amino acid dropout medium was adjusted to a pH of 7.3, sterile filtered, and supplemented with 10% dialyzed Fetal Bovine Serum (Fisher Scientific, 26400044) and Penicillin-Streptomycin (100 U/mL) prior to use. For metabolomics experiments, medium was prepared from an amino acid-free and glucose-free RPMI 1640 powder base (US Biological, R9010-01), and custom combinations of amino acids and isotopically heavy glucose and sodium pyruvate were added in to match the standard amino acid concentrations for RPMI 1640 or as specified. pH was adjusted to 7.3, sterile filtered and supplemented with 10% dialyzed Fetal Bovine Serum and Penicillin-Streptomycin (100 U/mL) prior to use. Where specified, cells were cultured on plates coated with 0.1% gelatin (EMD Millipore, ES-006-B) for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were washed with PBS prior to use.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Cell counting and quantification</title><p>For evaluating effects of amino acid dropout on cell growth curves, cells were seeded at 1×10<sup>4</sup> into 6-well plates into F12-K media with lowered amino acid concentrations relative to typical F12-K media and then allowed to grow for 5 days. Media was then aspirated off and replaced with PBS with Hoechst 33342 live nuclear stain for automated imaging and counting using a DAPI filter set on an Eclipse Ti2 automated inverted microscope. To count, an automated microscopy routine was used to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> random locations within each well at 10× magnification, and then the cells present in imaged frames counted using automatic cell segregation and counting software. Given differences in cell response to starvation, segregation and counting parameters were tuned in each experiment, but kept constant between starvation conditions and cells with and without the pathway. For synthetic prototroph pathway tests, raw cell counts were performed using the Countess II Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher, A27977) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol, or using the Scepter 2.0 Handheld Automated Cell Counter (Millipore Sigma, C85360) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Ivan Topisirovic as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ran Kafri (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) CHO cells engineered to biosynthesize valine exhibited gradual increase in doubling time and reduction in valine production. Based on this, it was thought that more evidence is required to demonstrate that the introduction of valine biosynthetic pathway into CHO cells results in sustained proliferation and survival in the absence of valine supplementation. Accordingly, it was deemed that the authors should monitor long-term ability of engineered CHO cells to sustain valine production and proliferate in valine-free media.</p><p>2) Characterization of valine synthesizing CHO cells was found to be incomplete. To this end, monitoring flux via valine biosynthetic and degradation pathways, transcriptome and mTOR signaling at early and late time points was thought to be warranted.</p><p>3) Some technical issues were also observed. These include lack of clarity pertinent to the rationale behind using &quot;conditioned-medium&quot; in the experiments. Moreover, potential utilization of other sources of valine (e.g., proteins from the serum, autophagy) should be excluded.</p><p>4) More deliberation on the failure of the attempts to functionalize other essential amino acid biosynthesis in CHO cells should be considered.</p><p>5) The manuscript requires careful editing.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>– The extent of rescue of proliferation of CHO cells prototrophic for valine appears to be modest. It was appreciated that the latter cells survive in valine-free media, but it seems that their proliferation is significantly lower than in valine containing media. Moreover, it seems that after 6 passages only a fraction of the detected valine is synthesized de novo. Would this fraction further decrease in subsequent passages? Related to this, it is not clear what is the efficiency of valine biosynthesis in CHO cells vs. a prototrophic organism. Perhaps comparing the rates of valine synthesis in cell free extracts of CHO cells vs. those derived from a prototrophic organism may be helpful to address this.</p><p>– Another concern is that serum proteins, autophagy of proteasome may act as sources of valine, which should be excluded.</p><p>– Notwithstanding that monitoring steady-state mRNA levels was appreciated, further characterization of valine-prototrophic CHO cells appears to be warranted. This in particular relates to amino-acid sensing pathways (e.g., mTOR) that signal amino-acid availability to the proliferation/growth machinery.</p><p>– The authors should also elaborate on the failure to functionalize other tested pathways. Was this due to the altered stoichiometry and/or inadequate expression of the enzymes belonging to these pathways (which may occur post-transcriptionally)? Were the enzymes mislocalized? Are there other regulatory factors involved? Moreover, considering that the overarching tenet is that metazoans lost the ability to produce essential amino acids due to energetic restraints, it may be worthwhile noting that culturing conditions and potential differences in energy resources may impact on functionalization of essential amino acid biosynthetic pathways.</p><p>– Notwithstanding that this may be seen as too elaborate, including additional cell lines may be beneficial to exclude potential cell-line related biases.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The results put forth in this manuscript suggest the authors were marginally successful in introducing a valine biosynthetic pathway into CHO cells, but fall short of demonstrating a robust, self-sustaining engineered cell line under reasonable culture conditions. This milestone should be met prior to final acceptance at <italic>eLife</italic>. Additionally, the following revisions should be carried out prior to acceptance.</p><p>1) To substantiate the authors' major claims, follow up experiments demonstrating long-term homeostasis in the engineered cell line over multiple passages should be performed.</p><p>– It is possible residual valine from complete medium may help pCTRL and pMTIV cells survive at early timepoints. The authors should identify the timepoint at which pCTRL cells are no longer viable in dropout medium. The authors should then compare transcriptional profiles of the pMTIV cells at that timepoint to the that of pMTIV cells harvested at 4hr and 48hr.</p><p>– Similar to the point above, authors should include data examining pCTRL viability/ proliferation when fed with the conditioned medium regimen.</p><p>2) Metabolic flux should be more rigorously quantified for the pMTIV strain by performing the 13C6 tracer experiments and measuring 2-acetolactate, 2,3-dihydroxy-isovalerate, and 2-oxoisovalerate levels over time. Doing so may help identify key bottlenecks in the pathway. If a bottleneck can be identified, authors should attempt to make the pathway more efficient, either by modifying expression strategy of that enzyme or testing homologs from other hosts. The pathway should be optimized until the major revision 1 above is achieved.</p><p>3) Unsuccessful efforts to produce methionine, threonine, and isoleucine are distracting to the rest of the manuscript. For clarity, these sections should be de-emphasized in writing and figures for clarity.</p><p>4) Introducing heterologous pathways into new hosts can cause toxicity, especially when the donor and recipient are phylogenetically divergent. Authors should either experimentally test or comment on whether pathway intermediates/byproducts could have off-target effects.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The task that Wang et al., has undertaken is adventurous and the successful accomplishment can prove important in generating many unexpected insights once the CHO cell lines are shared with the wider community.</p><p>The authors have a few grammatical and spelling errors that should be corrected, including in the title &quot;in a mammalian cell&quot; --&gt; &quot;in mammalian cells&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72847.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) CHO cells engineered to biosynthesize valine exhibited gradual increase in doubling time and reduction in valine production.

We understand the core issue to be the reduction in doubling time shown for later time points in Figure 2F and the suggestion that this represents a time-dependent lag in growth rate due to cumulative insufficient valine production.</p><p>In response to this feedback, we set out to attain a consistent doubling time in the valine-free condition. We did so by increasing <italic>ilvD</italic> copy number in prototrophic pMTIV cells using lentiviral transduction thus generating a novel pMTIV-ilvD+ cell line that overexpresses <italic>ilvD</italic>-encoded dihydroxy-acid dehydratase (Figure 4A), a decision based on new information suggesting that bottlenecking was occurring at this step (see main point #2 below). Importantly, this dihydroxy-acid dehydratase overexpressing cell line was passaged 10 times in the absence of valine with a consistent average doubling time of 3.2 days. Doubling time remained consistent across the 39 days of culture and no medium conditioning was required (Figure 5).</p><p>Nonetheless, to alleviate concerns that the original prototrophic pMTIV cells were not able to sustain proliferation long-term in the absence of valine, we have also added additional evidence indicating that these cells retained valine prototrophy long-term:</p><p>1. A panel demonstrating the performance of an auxotrophic pCtrl cell line in the 50% conditioned F-12K medium originally used to culture pMTIV cells long-term (Figure 2 —figure supplement 5).</p><p>– pCtrl cells cultured in these conditions die off completely by day 8 having undergone zero passaging events</p><p>– Although pMTIV proliferation is slow at later time points in Figure 2F, we disagree with the suggestion that this represents a lack of prototrophy. Given the rapid death phenotype experienced by pCtrl cells, continued survival of pMTIV cells at late passages should instead be considered an indicator of sustained prototrophy.</p><p>2. Late time point transcriptomic data (Figure 3 —figure supplement 5) for pMTIV cells demonstrating partial rescue of nutritional starvation at day 29 in conditioned valine-free F-12K medium.</p><p>– Importantly, these data demonstrate that pMTIV cells at day 29 in the absence of valine are more similar to pCtrl cells cultured in complete medium than pCtrl cells cultured in the absence of valine for just 48 h.</p><p>3. Both early and late time point <sup>13</sup>C-tracing data (Figure 4E, Figure 4 —figure supplement 1D) for pMTIV and pMTIV-ilvD+ cells demonstrated ongoing valine biosynthesis at late time points.</p><p>– If cells were increasingly relying on supplementation of valine from an exogenous source at later time points, we would expect to see a reduction in <sup>13</sup>C-labeling of valine towards later time points. However, no such trend was evident in either pMTIV or pMTIV-ilvD+ cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Characterization of valine synthesizing CHO cells was found to be incomplete. To this end, monitoring flux via valine biosynthetic and degradation pathways, transcriptome and mTOR signaling at early and late time points was thought to be warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these comments. We have added a figure highlighting mTOR signaling differences in pMTIV and pCtrl cells at 48 h valine starvation, even though no clear signatures of mTOR activation could be detected (Figure 3 —figure supplement 4). We have also added a new supplemental figure showing transcriptomic analysis of cells grown long-term (5 passages, 29 days) in conditioned valine-free F-12K medium (Figure 3 —figure supplement 5).</p><p>Additionally, we were able to gain insight into flux through the pathway with <sup>13</sup>C-tracing. No signal could be detected for pyruvate, 2-acetolactate or 2-oxoisovalerate; however we were able to specifically detect pathway intermediate 2,3-dihydroxy-isoverate and have added a panel to reflect this (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1F).</p><p>It was unclear whether the detected 2,3-dihydroxy-isoverate represented a true pathway bottleneck. In order to test whether this was the case, we introduced extra copies of the downstream <italic>ilvD</italic> gene encoding the dihydroxy-acid dehydratase enzyme, by lentiviral transduction. In doing so, we generated the pMTIV-ilvD+ cell line, the growth of which outperformed the original pMTIV cell line significantly in valine-free RPMI medium, suggesting that <italic>ilvD</italic> expression levels led to inefficient flux through the pathway in valine starvation conditions. The newly generated pMTIV-ilvD+ cell line grew at an average doubling time of 3.2 days over 39 days in unconditioned valine-free RPMI medium compared to 1.0 days in the complete RPMI medium condition (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some technical issues were also observed. These include lack of clarity pertinent to the rationale behind using &quot;conditioned-medium&quot; in the experiments. Moreover, potential utilization of other sources of valine (e.g., proteins from the serum, autophagy) should be excluded.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity surrounding the use of conditioned medium and thank the reviewers for bringing this to our attention. We have added a panel demonstrating the utility of using conditioned medium in culturing pMTIV cells in the absence of valine (Figure 2 —figure supplement 5B). Furthermore, since we are now able to culture the new pMTIV-ilvD+ cells without conditioning, this critique may be considered moot.</p><p>The rationale behind the conditioned medium approach assumes amino acid transport in and out of cells to be adapted for a specific equilibrium of intracellular/extracellular valine concentration. When culturing prototrophic cells in valine-free medium conditions, extracellular valine concentrations will be minimal, forcing cells to secrete valine until the appropriate equilibrium has been met. By ‘conditioning’ the medium with prototrophic pMTIV cells ahead of time, we avoid disadvantaging the cells by requiring them to supply yet another valine-depleted environment with valine before retaining valine for anabolic purposes.</p><p>Examples supporting this rationale can be found in the literature. For example, in a 1962 publication by Eagle and Piez<sup>1</sup> it was demonstrated that there is a population-dependent requirement of cultured cells for metabolites that are otherwise considered non-essential. For instance, serine was required for growth when cells were cultured at low cell densities. In the words of the authors “the critical population density was that which was able to ‘condition’ the medium i.e. to build up a concentration in equilibrium with the minimum effective intracellular level, before the cells died of the specific deficiency”.</p><p>Figure 2 —figure supplement 5B further supports this explanation by illustrating that the positive effect from medium conditioning cannot be recapitulated if the medium is conditioned with pCtrl cells, which excludes the possibility of cell debris or other effects from medium conditioning conferring the positive benefit. It would therefore indicate that the benefit to cells that is derived from pMTIV medium conditioning is likely specifically caused by the valine synthesized and secreted by these cells.</p><p>With regard to potential utilization of other sources of valine, we agree with the reviewers’ concern and we have added a supplementary figure illustrating the amino acid content in the dialyzed fetal bovine serum used for dropout media in this study (Figure 2 —figure supplement 3). The serum was analyzed for the presence of 15 amino acids including valine, which was found to be present at 9.25 μM in the dialyzed fetal bovine serum used to supplement the dropout media. For context, when used at a 10% concentration, this constitutes a mere 0.47% contribution to valine content for a standard complete F-12K medium formulation (not supplemented with FBS) or 0.54% for RPMI 1640 (not supplemented with FBS), neither of which is sufficient to rescue starvation effects as evidenced by the rapid death seen for pCtrl cells when cultured in valine-free medium (Figure 2C, Figure 2E).</p><p>Regarding autophagy, if such an effect would significantly alter the outcome of cells, this would not be specific to our engineered cells and any rescue effects thereof should be apparent for pCtrl cells as well, which was shown not to be the case (Figure 2C, Figure 2E, Figure 2 —figure supplement 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) More deliberation on the failure of the attempts to functionalize other essential amino acid biosynthesis in CHO cells should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the success with valine, we feel it appropriate to outline these results on their own terms. However, we agree that it would be beneficial to additionally discuss other efforts.</p><p>We initially began our experimentation by designing an all-in-one construct that would introduce (a) isoleucine and valine biosynthesis using a shared 4-gene pathway (b) threonine biosynthesis by driving a typically degradative enzyme in reverse, and (c) rescue of methionine auxotrophy by bridging a gap in the sulfur shuttle. The all-in-one format using 2A ribosome-skipping peptide sequences served to free up the limited number of available mammalian regulatory elements for potential addition of other pathway functionalities as well as to minimize the number of genes introduced and by extension the cost of DNA synthesis. In particular, the gene choices made in the attempts to achieve (b) and (c) were optimistic and made in the interest of optimizing pathway number per DNA length.</p><p>While the valine pathway in theory is able to conduct isoleucine biosynthesis activity as well, the choice of an <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived <italic>ilvN/B</italic> acetolactate synthase to catalyze the initial pathway step may make it a valine biosynthetic pathway in practice as this enzymatic complex does not specifically favor isoleucine biosynthesis over valine biosynthesis given similar substrate availabilities like other <italic>E. coli</italic> isozymes (<italic>ilvG/M, ilvI/H</italic>) might<sup>2</sup>. This may be necessary for meaningful isoleucine biosynthetic functionality but in addition, isoleucine biosynthesis additionally requires the presence of 2-oxobutanoate, which is not as involved in core metabolism as pyruvate and therefore is presumably found at much lower concentrations in cells. Furthermore, the <italic>ilvN/B</italic>-encoded acetolactate synthase used here is known to be negatively feedback inhibited by all three branched-chain amino acids but most strongly by isoleucine. We have added a panel (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1B) demonstrating increased proliferative ability of pMTIV cells in valine-free RPMI medium at a reduced (0.06 mM instead of the standard 0.38 mM) isoleucine concentration. Collectively, these two biochemical constraints may limit the cells’ ability to produce self-sufficient quantities of isoleucine.</p><p>In the case of threonine, we attempted to opportunistically take advantage of the bidirectionality of a typically degradative enzyme, <italic>ltaE</italic>. However, this failed to rescue threonine auxotrophy, presumably because the mammalian metabolic equilibrium did not favor the reverse enzymatic reaction as intended.</p><p>In the case of methionine, rescue of biosynthesis was attempted by allowing for interconversion of cystathionine and homocysteine. Methionine is synthesized in mammalian cells from homocysteine, and we reasoned that increasing levels of cystathionine by introduction of <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived <italic>metC</italic> would increase levels of homocysteine, which might increase cell viability in methionine-free conditions. However, cystathionine biosynthesis in <italic>E. coli</italic> and mammalian cells are divergent processes requiring different starting substrates. Whereas <italic>E. coli</italic> synthesizes cystathionine from cysteine and succinyl-homoserine, mammalian cells synthesize cystathionine from serine and homocysteine. Introducing <italic>metC</italic> into a mammalian metabolic context therefore bridges a gap that is incompatible with the evolutionary developments of the past hundreds of millions of years, resulting in a circular pathway unlikely to produce significant quantities of methionine, which was confirmed empirically in our functional assay.</p><p>We would like to highlight to the reviewers that additional work is ongoing to rescue yet other essential amino acids, as well as our call for a wider community focus on such projects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The manuscript requires careful editing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional editing of the text to remove unfortunate errors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>– The extent of rescue of proliferation of CHO cells prototrophic for valine appears to be modest.

In this time course, <sup>13</sup>C-glucose replaced its <sup>12</sup>C counterpart in the valine-free RPMI medium formulation as before; however the spiked in sodium pyruvate was not <sup>13</sup>C-labeled in this follow-up experiment due to limited reagent availability during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is important to note as it follows that the expected <sup>13</sup>C-labeling outcome is different. When spiking in <sup>12</sup>C-sodium pyruvate, a subset of the M+0 valine detected in cells is likely to have been synthesized endogenously (from <sup>12</sup>C pyruvate) as is all of the detected M+2, M+3, and M+5 valine (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1A). This is in contrast to the original experiment in which only <sup>13</sup>C sources of glucose and pyruvate were spiked in. In that case, nearly all valine was expected to be M+5 if synthesized endogenously (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1A).</p><p>However it was unclear whether we would be able to culture cells long-term in unconditioned RPMI rather than in 50% conditioned F-12K medium which was originally used for long-term culture in valine-free conditions. We were unable to continue using the 50% conditioned F-12 as (a) for the purposes of <sup>13</sup>C-tracing, a conditioned medium regimen would complicate downstream analysis, and (b) we did not have access to a glucose-depleted F-12K powder base that would allow for full replacement of <sup>12</sup>C glucose/pyruvate with its <sup>13</sup>C equivalent.</p><p>In anticipation that cells might not perform well in unconditioned medium and in the new RPMI context, we therefore attempted to take measures to lose fewer cells to the harsh effects of passaging by culturing cells on plates coated with 0.1% gelatin thereby enabling metabolomic analysis of cultured in near-minimal valine conditions. While it in theory was possible that cells were consuming valine derived from the 0.1% gelatin coated on plates, any potential gelatin-derived valine would not be <sup>13</sup>C-labeled and should not influence information gained regarding <sup>13</sup>C-labeling levels. Furthermore, we later cultured cells long-term in unconditioned valine-free RPMI on plates not coated with 0.1% gelatin (Figure 5) and found growth in this condition to be no slower than growth on plates coated with 0.1% gelatin (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1C) suggesting that it is unlikely that cells are using valine derived from gelatin for anabolic purposes.</p><p>Over the time course, we saw no clear downward trend in the proportion or overall content of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled valine over the time course for pMTIV or pMTIV-ilvD+ cells, demonstrating that the cells were not reducing de novo synthesis of valine over time (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1D, Figure 4E). In fact, for pMTIV-ilvD+ cells, <sup>13</sup>C-valine content was higher than <sup>12</sup>C-valine content at every time point past 4 days of culture in the valine-free <sup>13</sup>C-labeled RPMI medium demonstrating that cells primarily rely on de novo synthesis of valine.</p><p>In pMTIV cells, <sup>13</sup>C-valine content was lower than <sup>12</sup>C-valine content on days 14 and 24 while the opposite was true on days 2, 4, 12, and 18, demonstrating that the <sup>13</sup>C content of the cells was not on a downward trend but rather fluctuated up and down. This may reflect an inability to adequately respond to valine demands given inefficient flux through the pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Another concern is that serum proteins, autophagy of proteasome may act as sources of valine, which should be excluded.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point above in our response to Essential Revision 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Notwithstanding that monitoring steady-state mRNA levels was appreciated, further characterization of valine-prototrophic CHO cells appears to be warranted.

Moreover, considering that the overarching tenet is that metazoans lost the ability to produce essential amino acids due to energetic restraints, it may be worthwhile noting that culturing conditions and potential differences in energy resources may impact on functionalization of essential amino acid biosynthetic pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these insights. We address this point above in our response to Essential Revision 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Notwithstanding that this may be seen as too elaborate, including additional cell lines may be beneficial to exclude potential cell-line related biases.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point and have already begun efforts to test our pathways in other cell lines, such as HEK cells, but we believe these data are too preliminary to be included at this time, and are beyond the scope of this contribution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The results put forth in this manuscript suggest the authors were marginally successful in introducing a valine biosynthetic pathway into CHO cells, but fall short of demonstrating a robust, self-sustaining engineered cell line under reasonable culture conditions. This milestone should be met prior to final acceptance at eLife. Additionally, the following revisions should be carried out prior to acceptance.</p></disp-quote><p>We undertook a painstaking and extensive effort to demonstrate robust and self-sustaining valine-free growth over 39 days. This was achieved by increasing <italic>ilvD</italic> (encoding a dihydroxy-acid dehydratase enzyme) copy number in response to detecting a potential pathway bottleneck in 2,3-dihydroxy-isovalerate. By increasing the efficiency of the final step in the introduced biosynthetic pathway, doubling time was reduced to a relatively consistent 3.2 days per doubling across 39 days in unconditioned RPMI medium supplemented with dialyzed FBS (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1) To substantiate the authors' major claims, follow up experiments demonstrating long-term homeostasis in the engineered cell line over multiple passages should be performed.</p><p>o It is possible residual valine from complete medium may help pCTRL and pMTIV cells survive at early timepoints. The authors should identify the timepoint at which pCTRL cells are no longer viable in dropout medium. The authors should then compare transcriptional profiles of the pMTIV cells at that timepoint to the that of pMTIV cells harvested at 4hr and 48hr.</p><p>– Similar to the point above, authors should include data examining pCTRL viability/ proliferation when fed with the conditioned medium regimen.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a figure describing pCtrl inviability using the 50% conditioned F-12K medium regimen (Figure 2 —figure supplement 5A).</p><p>With regard to pMTIV cells surviving on residual valine in later passages, we believe this is unlikely given that Figure 2E and Figure 2 —figure supplement 5A show that pCtrl cells typically die before the first passaging event in valine-free medium – after approximately 6 days in unconditioned valine-free F-12K medium or approximately 8 days in 50% conditioned valine-free F-12K medium.</p><p>While it was possible to include an 8 day timepoint for collecting transcriptomic pMTIV samples we originally did not do so as there is no suitable control for analyzing such samples. Nonetheless, we had previously collected RNA in duplicate samples from a late time point and as such have included transcriptomic data in a new figure for samples cultured in conditioned valine-free F-12K medium over 29 days or 5 passages i.e. well past the point of pCtrl inviability (Figure 3 —figure supplement 5)<bold>.</bold> Evidently, these cells more closely resemble healthy cells cultured in complete medium than do pCtrl cells cultured in valine-free F-12K for just 48 h.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Metabolic flux should be more rigorously quantified for the pMTIV strain by performing the 13C6 tracer experiments and measuring 2-acetolactate, 2,3-dihydroxy-isovalerate, and 2-oxoisovalerate levels over time. Doing so may help identify key bottlenecks in the pathway. If a bottleneck can be identified, authors should attempt to make the pathway more efficient, either by modifying expression strategy of that enzyme or testing homologs from other hosts. The pathway should be optimized until the major revision 1 above is achieved.</p></disp-quote><p>This excellent reviewer suggestion led to an important new finding – the specific accumulation of an intermediate suggesting a pathway bottleneck. We explored the presence of pathway intermediates in our original <sup>13</sup>C-tracing experiment. The only pathway intermediate detected by metabolomics analysis was 2,3-dihydroxy-isovalerate, suggesting potential bottlenecking at this step. We thus optimized our pMTIV cell line by introducing extra copies of the downstream dihydroxy-acid dehydratase-encoding <italic>ilvD</italic> gene by lentiviral transduction thus generating a novel pMTIV-ilvD+ cell line (Figure 4A). This resulted in cells that double on average every 3.2 days across 39 days in unconditioned valine-free RPMI medium (Figure 5). Doubling time was relatively consistent across the entire time course and long-term <sup>13</sup>C-tracing demonstrated that valine content as well as de novo valine biosynthesis in the novel pMTIV-ilvD+ cell line was stable across 36 days in unconditioned valine-free RPMI medium compared to pMTIV cells which exhibited fluctuating valine levels (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1D, Figure 4E). This data demonstrates long-term homeostasis and robust growth under reasonable culturing conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Unsuccessful efforts to produce methionine, threonine, and isoleucine are distracting to the rest of the manuscript. For clarity, these sections should be de-emphasized in writing and figures for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We believed it would be misleading to describe our efforts to rescue valine biosynthesis alone. On the suggestion of Reviewer #1 above as well as the suggestion outlined in Essential Revision #4 sections have been adjusted but not removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Introducing heterologous pathways into new hosts can cause toxicity, especially when the donor and recipient are phylogenetically divergent. Authors should either experimentally test or comment on whether pathway intermediates/byproducts could have off-target effects.</p></disp-quote><p>The potential toxicity of valine pathway intermediates (or perhaps toxic products from non-specific enzymatic activity) is certainly an interesting question, given the introduction of a pathway sourced from a distantly removed species. However, we saw no signs of metabolic stress in cells harboring the pathway when grown on complete media, either by growth rate (Figure 2D) or in the transcriptomic data (Figure 3D, Figure 3 —figure supplement 2). The introduction of the pathway therefore does not appear to be a significant stressor to the cells. However, it remains to be seen if this will true for all essential amino acids, particularly as we look to introduce the more complex pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The task that Wang et al., has undertaken is adventurous and the successful accomplishment can prove important in generating many unexpected insights once the CHO cell lines are shared with the wider community.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the vote of confidence, and share their excitement for the insights this work might enable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have a few grammatical and spelling errors that should be corrected, including in the title “in a mammalian cell” “ &quot;in mammalian cells&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for these errors, and have performed additional proofing.</p><p>References</p><p>1.
