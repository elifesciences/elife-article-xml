molecules such as ATP can exit. Co-release of polypeptides and hormones like insulin requires further expansion of the pore. There is evidence that pore expansion is regulated and can fail in diabetes and neurodegenerative disease. Here, we report that the cAMP-sensor Epac2 (Rap-GEF4) controls fusion pore behavior by acutely recruiting two pore-restricting proteins, amisyn and dynamin-1, to the exocytosis site in insulin-secreting beta-cells. cAMP elevation restricts and slows fusion pore expansion and peptide release, but not when Epac2 is inactivated pharmacologically or in Epac2<sup>-/-</sup> (<italic>Rapgef4</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Consistently, overexpression of Epac2 impedes pore expansion. Widely used antidiabetic drugs (GLP-1 receptor agonists and sulfonylureas) activate this pathway and thereby paradoxically restrict hormone release. We conclude that Epac2/cAMP controls fusion pore expansion and thus the balance of hormone and transmitter release during insulin granule exocytosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41711.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Insulin is the hormone that signals to the body to take up sugar from the blood. Specialized cells in the pancreas – known as β-cells – release insulin after a meal. Before that, insulin molecules are stored in tiny granules inside the β-cells; these granules must fuse with the cells’ surface membranes to release their contents. The first step in this process creates a narrow pore that allows small molecules, but not the larger insulin molecules, to seep out. The pore then widens to release the insulin. Since the small molecules are known to act locally in the pancreas, it is possible that this “molecular sieve” is biologically important. Yet it is not clear how the pore widens.</p><p>One of the problems for people with type 2 diabetes is that they release less insulin into the bloodstream. Two kinds of drugs used to treat these patients work by stimulating β-cells to release their insulin. One way to achieve this is by raising the levels of a small molecule called cAMP, which is well known to help prepare insulin granules for release. The cAMP molecule also seems to slow the widening of the pore, and Gucek et al. have now investigated how this happens at a molecular level.</p><p>By observing individual granules of human β-cells using a special microscope, Gucek et al. could watch how different drugs affect pore widening and content release. They also saw that cAMP activated a protein called Epac2, which then recruited two other proteins – amisyn and dynamin – to the small pores. These two proteins together then closed the pore, rather than expanding it to let insulin out. Type 2 diabetes patients sometimes have high levels of amisyn in their β-cells, which could explain why they do not release enough insulin. The microscopy experiments also revealed that two common anti-diabetic drugs activate Epac2 and prevent the pores from widening, thereby counteracting their positive effect on insulin release. The combined effect is likely a shift in the balance between insulin and the locally acting small molecules.</p><p>These findings suggest that two common anti-diabetic drugs activate a common mechanism that may lead to unexpected outcomes, possibly even reducing how much insulin the β-cells can release. Future studies in mice and humans will have to investigate these effects in whole organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fusion

from pancreatic β-cells and acts on target tissues such as muscle and liver to regulate blood glucose. Secretion of insulin occurs by regulated exocytosis, whereby secretory granules containing the hormone and other bioactive peptides and small molecules fuse with the plasma membrane. The first aqueous contact between granule lumen and the extracellular space is a narrow fusion pore (upper limit 3 nm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albillos et al., 1997</xref>) that is thought to consist of both lipids and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharma and Lindau, 2018</xref>). At this stage, the pore acts as a molecular sieve that allows release of small transmitter molecules such as nucleotides and catecholamines, but traps larger cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Obermüller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Barg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alvarez de Toledo et al., 1993</xref>). Electrophysiological experiments have shown that the fusion pore is short-lived and flickers between closed and open states, suggesting that mechanisms exist that stabilize this channel-like structure and restrict pore expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanna et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Breckenridge and Almers, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lollike et al., 1995</xref>). The pore can then expand irreversibly (termed full fusion), which leads to mixing of granule and plasma membrane and release of the bulkier hormone content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Obermüller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Barg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anantharam et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, the pore can close indefinitely to allow the granule to be retrieved, apparently intact, into the cell interior (termed kiss-and-run or cavicapture) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Obermüller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taraska et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsuboi and Rutter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2018</xref>). Estimates in β-cells suggest that 20–50% of all exocytosis in β-cells are transient kiss-and-run events that do not lead to insulin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Obermüller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>). However, kiss-and-run exocytosis contributes to local signaling within the islet because smaller granule constituents, such as nucleotides, glutamate or GABA, are released even when the fusion pore does not expand. Within the islet, ATP synchronizes β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hellman et al., 2004</xref>), and has both inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Salehi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Poulsen et al., 1999</xref>) and stimulatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Richards-Williams et al., 2008</xref>) effects on insulin secretion. ATP suppresses glucagon release from α-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tudurí et al., 2008</xref>), and activates macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weitz et al., 2018</xref>). Interstitial GABA leads to tonic GABA-A receptor activation and α-cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ben-Othman et al., 2017</xref>), and glutamate stimulates glucagon secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cabrera et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Regulation of fusion pore behavior is not understood mechanistically, but several cellular signaling events affect both lifetime and flicker behavior. Pore behavior has been shown to be regulated by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, cAMP, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanna et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alés et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Calejo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scepek et al., 1998</xref>) and recent superresolution imaging indicates that elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> and dynamin promote pore closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chiang et al., 2014</xref>). Both myosin and the small GTPase dynamin are involved in fusion pore restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jackson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsuboi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Graham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Artalejo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aoki et al., 2010</xref>), and assembly of filamentous actin promotes fusion pore expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wen et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting a link to endocytosis and the cytoskeleton. In β-cells of type-2 diabetics, upregulation of amysin leads to decreased insulin secretion because fusion pore expansion is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Collins et al., 2016</xref>), and the Parkinson’s related protein α-synuclein promotes fusion pore dilation in chromaffin cells and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Logan et al., 2017</xref>), thus providing evidence for altered fusion pore behavior in human disease.</p><p>Inadequate insulin secretion in type-2 diabetes (T2D) is treated clinically by two main strategies. First, sulfonylureas (e.g. tolbutamide and glibenclamide) close the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel by binding to its regulatory subunit SUR1, which leads to increased electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx that triggers insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henquin, 2000</xref>). Sulfonylureas are given orally and are first-line treatment for type-2 diabetes in many countries. Second, activation of the receptor for the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) raises cytosolic [cAMP] and thereby increases the propensity of insulin granules to undergo exocytosis. Both peptide agonists of the GLP-1 receptor (e.g. exendin-4) and inhibitors of DPP-4 are used clinically for this purpose. The effect of cAMP on exocytosis is mediated by a protein-kinase A (PKA)-dependent pathway, and by Epac2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Ras-like small GTPase Rap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kawasaki et al., 1998</xref>) that is a direct target for cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ozaki et al., 2000</xref>) and is recruited to insulin granule docking sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alenkvist et al., 2017</xref>). Epac2 has also been suggested to be activated by sulfonylureas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), which may underlie some of their effects on insulin secretion.</p><p>Here, we have studied fusion pore regulation in pancreatic β-cells, using high-resolution live-cell imaging. We report that activation of Epac2, either through GLP1-R/cAMP signaling or via sulfonylurea, restricts expansion of the insulin granule fusion pore by recruiting dynamin and amisyn to the exocytosis site. Activation of this pathway by two classes of antidiabetic drugs therefore hinders full fusion and insulin release, which is expected to reduce their effectiveness as insulin secretagogues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>cAMP-dependent fusion pore restriction is regulated by Epac but not PKA</title><p>To monitor single granule exocytosis, human pancreatic β-cells were infected with adenovirus encoding the granule marker NPY-Venus and imaged by TIRF microscopy. Exocytosis was evoked by local application of a solution containing 75 mM K<sup>+</sup>, which leads to rapid depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Visually, two phenotypes of granule exocytosis were observed. In the first, termed full fusion, fluorescence of a granule that was stably situated at the plasma membrane suddenly vanished during the stimulation (in most cases within &lt;100 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>, left panels). Since the EGFP label is relatively large (3.7 nm vs 3 nm for insulin monomers), this is interpreted as rapid pore widening that allowed general release of granule cargo. The sudden release of material may suggest that this release coincided with the collapse of the granule into the plasma membrane, but we cannot exclude that at least some granules remained intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taraska et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsuboi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2018</xref>).

The latter was estimated by fitting a discontinuous function to the fluorescence timecourse (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, green lines and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), which limits the analysis to granules that eventually released their peptide content.

Such events are increased by elevated cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanna et al., 2009</xref>) and likely other conditions that stabilize the fusion pore. Indeed, when forskolin (2 µM; fsk) was added to the bath solution we observed a twofold increase of exocytosis rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), a threefold increase of NPY release times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), and a nearly doubled fraction of events with restricted fusion pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,f</xref>).

We therefore tested the effect of sulfonylureas on fusion pore behavior. INS-1 cells expressing NPY-tdmOrange2 were tested with three types of sulfonylureas, with different relative membrane permeability (tolbutamide &lt; glibenclamide &lt; gliclazide). In addition, diazoxide (200 µM) was present to prevent electrical activity. Exocytosis was not observed under these conditions, but could be triggered by local application of elevated K<sup>+</sup> (75 mM). In the absence of fsk, the sulfonylureas accelerated K<sup>+</sup>-stimulated exocytosis about twofold over that observed in control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, left), which is consistent with earlier findings that sulfonylureas augment insulin secretion via intracellular targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Barg et al., 1999</xref>).

Accordingly, NPY release times were elevated compared with control (no fsk), and only marginally longer than with fsk alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, right).

Reduced diazoxide (50 µM) prevented glucose-dependent exocytosis but still allowed acute stimulation of exocytosis by sulfonylureas.

Taken together, the data suggest that sulfonylureas must enter the cytosol to affect fusion pore behavior, and that this effect is not mediated by the plasma membrane SUR. We excluded the possibility that sulfonylureas affect the fluorescence signal indirectly, by altering granule pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, an EGFP-tagged SUR1 (EGFP-SUR1) expressed in INS-1 cells did not localize to exocytosis sites or affect fusion pore behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Sulfonylureas have long been known to stimulate insulin secretion by binding to SUR1, which results in closure of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henquin, 2000</xref>). The drugs also accelerate PKA-independent granule priming in β-cells, which may involve activation of intracellularly localized SUR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eliasson et al., 2003</xref>). Our data indicate that sulfonylureas exert a third mode of action that leads to the restriction of the fusion pore and therefore limits insulin release. Two pieces of evidence suggest that SUR1 is not involved in the latter. First, acute exposure to sulfonylureas had no effect on fusion pore behavior, although it blocks K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (indicating SUR1 activation). Only long-term exposure to sulfonylurea resulted in restricted fusion pores, likely because it allowed the drugs to enter the cytoplasm. Second, we could not detect enrichment of SUR1 at the granule release site, which precludes any direct role of the protein in fusion pore regulation. Sulfonylurea compounds have been shown to allosterically stabilize the cAMP-dependent activation of Epac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takahashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herbst et al., 2011</xref>). Our finding that sulfonylurea caused fusion pore restriction in the absence of forskolin indicates that basal cAMP concentrations are sufficient for this effect. Since gliclizide binds the CNB1 domain without activating it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takahashi et al., 2013</xref>) and still restricts the fusion pore, Epac localization at the granule site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alenkvist et al., 2017</xref>) may be enough to regulate the downstream proteins (e.g. dynamin and amisyn). It can further be speculated that the competing stimulatory (via exocytosis) and inhibitor effects (via the fusion pore) of sulfonylureas on insulin secretion, contribute to the reduction in sulfonylurea effectiveness with time of treatment. Long-term treatment with GLP-1 analogs disturbs glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdulreda et al., 2016</xref>), and combination therapy of sulfonylurea and DPP4 inhibitors (that elevate cAMP) has been shown to lead to severe hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yabe and Seino, 2014</xref>), an effect that likely depends on Epac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Epac mediates the PKA-independent stimulation of exocytosis by cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Seino et al., 2009</xref>) and our data suggests it may affect both priming and fusion pore restriction. This effect is rapid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eliasson et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that Epac is preassembled at the site of the secretory machinery. Indeed, Epac concentrates at sites of docked insulin granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alenkvist et al., 2017</xref>), and forms functionally relevant complexes with the tethering proteins Rim2 and Piccolo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fujimoto et al., 2002</xref>). However, the amount of Epac2 present at individual release sites did not correlate with fusion pore behavior, which may indicate that the protein acts indirectly by activating or recruiting other proteins. Indeed, we show here that recruitment of two other proteins, dynamin and amisyn, depends on cAMP and Epac. Other known targets of Epac are the small GTPases Rap1 and R-Ras, for which Epac is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Rap1 is expressed on insulin granules and affects insulin secretion both directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shibasaki et al., 2007</xref>), and by promoting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release following phospholipase-C activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dzhura et al., 2011</xref>). R-Ras is an activator of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marte et al., 1997</xref>). By altering local phosphoinositide levels, Epac could therefore indirectly affect exocytosis via recruitment of C2-domain proteins such as Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kang et al., 2006</xref>), and fusion pore behavior by recruitment of the PH-domain containing proteins dynamin and amisyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ramachandran and Schmid, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbineni et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>An unresolved question is whether pore behavior is controlled by mechanisms that promote pore dilation, or that instead prevent it. Dynamin causes vesicle fission during clathrin-dependent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marks et al., 2001</xref>), and since dynamin is present at the exocytosis site and required for the kiss-and-run mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jackson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsuboi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trexler et al., 2016</xref>), it may have a similar role during transient exocytosis. An active scission mechanism is also suggested by the finding that granules loose some of their membrane proteins during transient exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsuboi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perrais et al., 2004</xref>). Capacitance measurements have shown that fusion pores initially flicker with conductances similar to those of large ion channels, before expanding irreversibly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lollike et al., 1995</xref>). This could result from pores that are initially stabilized through unknown protein interactions and that eventually give way to uncontrolled expansion. However, scission mechanisms involving dynamin can act even when the pore has dilated considerably beyond limit of reversible flicker behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Taraska and Almers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Anantharam et al., 2011</xref>), and even relatively large granules retain their size during fusion-fission cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lollike et al., 1995</xref>). Separate mechanisms may therefore operate, one that prevents pore dilation by actively causing scission, similar to the role of dynamins in endocytosis, and another by shifting the equilibrium between the open and closed states of the initial fusion pore. Curvature-sensitive proteins are particularly attractive for such roles since they could accumulate at the neck of the fused granule; such ring-like assemblies that have indeed been observed for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor synaptotagmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). Active pore dilation has also been proposed to be driven by crowding of SNARE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2017</xref>) and α-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Logan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>β-cell granules contain a variety of polypeptides (insulin, IAPP, chromogranins) and small molecule transmitter molecules (GABA, nucleotides, 5HT) that have important para- and autocrine functions within the islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Braun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caicedo, 2013</xref>). Insulin modulates its own release by activating β-cell insulin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leibiger et al., 2008</xref>), stimulates somatostatin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vergari et al., 2019</xref>), and inhibits glucagon secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ravier and Rutter, 2005</xref>). Insulin secretion is also inhibited by IAPP/amylin and chromogranin cleavage products such as pancreastatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Braun et al., 2012</xref>). Of the small transmitters, GABA inhibits glucagon secretion from α-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rorsman et al., 1989</xref>) and enhances insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soltani et al., 2011</xref>), and tonic GABA signaling is important for the maintenance of β-cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soltani et al., 2011</xref>). Adenine nucleotides cause β-cell depolarization, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release and enhanced insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jacques-Silva et al., 2010</xref>), but also negative effects have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Salehi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Poulsen et al., 1999</xref>). Paracrine purinergic effects also coordinate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling among β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hellman et al., 2004</xref>), stimulate secretion of somatostatin from δ-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bertrand et al., 1990</xref>), and target islet vasculature and macrophages as part of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weitz et al., 2018</xref>). By selectively allowing small molecule release, Epac/cAMP-dependent fusion pore restriction is expected to alter both the timing and the relative volume of peptidergic vs. transmitter signaling. Given that granule priming and islet electrical activity are regulated on a second time scale, even small delays between these signals can be envisioned to affect the ratio of insulin to glucagon secretion. As illustrated by the recent finding of altered fusion pore behavior in type-2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Collins et al., 2016</xref>), Epac-dependent fusion pore regulation may have profound consequences for islet physiology and glucose metabolism in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent or Resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source of Reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional Information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (Adenovirus)</td><td valign="top">NPY-Venus</td><td valign="top">P Rorsman (Oxford)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (Adenovirus)</td><td valign="top">NPY-tdmOrange2</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">See Constructs in Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Rapgef4</italic> KO and WT</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kopperud et al., 2017</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Rattus norvegicus domesticus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">INS-1 Clone 832/12</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hohmeier et al., 2000</xref>)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_7226">CVCL_7226</ext-link></td><td valign="top">H Mulder (Malmö)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">EGFP-Epac2</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Idevall-Hagren et al., 2013</xref>)</td><td valign="top">1068</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NPY-tdmOrange2</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gandasi et al., 2015</xref>)</td><td valign="top">1140</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">P2X<sub>2</sub>-mRFP1</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Obermüller et al., 2005</xref>)</td><td valign="top">1226</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NPY EGFP mCherry</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">See Constructs in Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Cherry2-amisyn</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">NM_001351940.1;

Your article has been reviewed by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ling-Gang Wu (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work the regulation of fusion pore dynamics in pancreatic β-cells is studied. The authors use human pancreatic β-cells for key first experiments, and subsequently from INS-1 cells and the Epac2 knockout mouse. Although it has been previously reported that Epac2 is directly involved in exocytosis at the exocytotic machinery, the precise mechanisms by which Epac2 regulates insulin exocytosis are poorly understood. The results suggest that cAMP and sulfonylureas restrict the fusion pore opening thereby limiting the release of insulin. Finally, the data further suggest that dynamin and amysin are part in the fusion pore restriction and that recruitment of these proteins to the release site is cAMP-dependent. The work adds new information on the role of Epac2 in fusion pore dynamics regarding the release from β-cells of not only insulin but also many other signaling smaller nucleotides.</p><p>There are several concerns as outlined below and we outline experimental data that should be included in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The heterogeneity among cells from different human donors is wide, and it can be argued whether results will hold if the authors increase the number of donors in their study. Moreover, the data from INS-1cells (rat islet origin and not human) require considering differences between human and rodent β-cells. It is essential that the key experiments in Figure 1 and the dynamin/amysin experiments in Figure 6 are repeated in the human cell line EndoC.</p><p>The authors do not really show the link between cAMP and dynamin/amysin. What mechanisms are involved in this process? The authors should address this by perhaps a speculative model in their discussion.</p><p>Abstract, the conclusion is wrong: cAMP elevation leads to pore expansion and peptide release, but not when Epac2 is inactivated pharmacologically or in Epac2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Conversely, overexpression of Epac2 impedes pore expansion. Based on the data, the conclusion might be: cAMP elevation restricts pore and leads to a slower expansion of the fusion pore and peptide release, but not when Epac2 is inactivated pharmacologically or in Epac2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Consistently, overexpression of Epac2 impedes pore expansion.</p><p>The complete release of NPY proceeds via full collapse fusion as shown in Figure 1(B) and in the text (Introduction), but according to reference (Shin et al., 2018), the vesicles can maintain the omega-shaped structures even after complete NPY release, and the pores can constrict after the complete release. Full-collapse is not observed for dense-core vesicle fusion in chromaffin cells (Shin et al., 2018). In addition, the fusion pore does not have to be larger than 10-30 nm for complete NPY release, because EGFP size is only 3.7nm as stated. The diagram in Figure 1(B) should be modified accordingly to avoid extrapolation from a pore more than 3.7 nm to full collapse fusion, and, &quot;fusion pore lifetime&quot; should be changed to &quot;NPY release time&quot; or other proper terms both in the legends and the main text. The methods used by the authors do not detect fusion pore lifetime, but only the NPY release time course (see Shin et al., 2018 for imaging of the fusion pore lifetime).</p><p>What is the reason that authors restricted exocytosis events to the rapid loss of the granule marker fluorescent (1-2 frames)? What about granule marker loss within 3-10 frames or &gt;10 frame? Please clarify why these events are excluded. On the other hand, in Figure 6a, the release time of the NPY after flash takes more than 2 seconds with multiple frames (obviously &gt;4 frames). This is inconsistent with the author's criteria of exocytosis events with the rapid loss within 1-2 frames. Please show the frame rate of all experiments since the different frame rates may generate different fraction of flash events vs full fusion events.</p><p>Rapid NPY spot fluorescence decrease can also be due to vesicle undocking (docked vesicle leaving the docking site), rather than fusion as in Figure 1A. The possibility of undocking should be ruled out by control experiments. A control experiment can be co-expressing pH-sensitive vesicular protein or adding dye in the bath solution to indicate fusion.</p><p>In subsection “cAMP-dependent fusion pore restriction is regulated by Epac but not PKA”, the authors state that PKA inhibition with Rp8-Br-cAMPS decreases exocytosis ~40% but not the fraction of flash events which is shown in Figure 1F. Then the percentage of flash events should be &gt;80% in Figure 1D for fsk+RP-8, but the flash percentage is similar as fsk alone with ~60-65%. How is this possible? This needs to be clarified to support the conclusion that Epac rather than PKA is responsible for cAMP-dependent fusion pore regulation.</p><p>At the end of Introduction, the authors write that activation of Epac2 via GLP-1 and sulfonylurea will hinder full fusion and that this is &quot;expected to reduce their full fusion as insulin secretagogoues&quot;. However, there are no data available in this study (or in published elsewhere) showing that addition of GLP-1 or sulfonylurea will reduce insulin secretion. How do the authors validate the importance of their study? Is glucose stimulated insulin secretion decreased in the cells (Figure 2) overexpressing Epac2? What about Epac2 and insulin secretion in EndoC cells?</p><p>The efficiency of the overexpression is not shown. What is the mRNA and protein levels of Epac2 (Figure 2), amysin and dynamin (Figure 6) after overexpression?</p><p>The authors have not performed the proper statistics for the data. A simple t-test is not enough when comparing multiple conditions. At least one-way ANOVA with ad hoc-test for multiple comparison.</p><p>The authors used Epac2 KO mice established in Kopperud et al. 2017, in which the characteristics of microvascular permeability of these mice was examined. However, the characteristics regarding glucose homeostasis including insulin secretion were not well studied in the paper. Furthermore, other lines of Epac2 KO mice have already been established and analyzed. The authors need to examine at least the insulin secretory profiles in the Epac2 KO mice used in this study in vivo and in vitro, and discuss them by referring to the previous studies using other KO strains.</p><p>Figure 2 shows that the percentage of flash events is increased by overexpression of Epac2. However, the actual number of flash events is not changed but full fusion events are decreased (Figure 2B), resulting in a decrease in the total number of fusion events (Figure 2A). In Figure 1, Epac activation by S223 increases the total number of exocytotic events by increasing flash events without changing the number of full fusion events. It seems that the fusion pore-regulating mechanism is different between these two conditions. Any thoughts on this issue?</p><p>In Figure 4, the total number of exocytotic events is not increased by fsk in Epac2 KO β-cells. However, it is unlikely that cAMP cannot increase the number of exocytotic events in the absence of Epac2, as PKA signaling remains intact. What is the authors' interpretation of these results?</p><p>In Figure 4F and 4G, fsk seems to prolong fusion pore lifetime significantly in both WT and Epac2 KO β-cells, although the authors state that the lifetimes are similar with or without forskolin. This should be modified.</p><p>In Figure 5, glib, tolb and gliz show similar effects on fusion pore regulation. However, the gliclazide data are inconsistent with the previous reports in which gliclazide among various sulfonylureas does not activate Epac2 (Zhang et al., 2009, Takahashi et al., 2013, Takahashi et al., 2013). The results should be confirmed using β-cells from Epac2 KO mice.</p><p>The authors show in Figure 6 that dynamin and amisyn are translocated to the site of exocytosis in a cAMP-dependent manner, and suggest that Epac protein is preassembled at the site of the secretory machinery. The authors also mention the involvement of Epac2 in the recruitment of dynamin and amisyn to the site of exocytosis, based on the observations of the translocation of these proteins by cAMP stimulation, which do not provide sufficient evidence to draw the authors' conclusion. The authors should show the behaviors of dynamin and amisyn in Epac2 KO β-cells and when Epac is activated pharmacologically.</p><p>The significance of the restriction of fusion pore expansion is not clear. Both full fusion and flash events eventually release all contents of the secretory vesicle. Thus, the prolonged fusion pore lifetime means only a few seconds delay in insulin release compared to release of small molecules (or small molecules release a few seconds in advance of the insulin release). Although the authors discuss the roles of these small molecules in autocrine and paracrine signaling in islets, the physiological and pathophysiological relevance of the time difference in the release of insulin and small molecules should be further discussed.</p><p>It has previously been shown that there are different modes of insulin exocytosis, based on the dynamics of insulin granules (predocked granules, newcomer granules, etc.) (Shibasaki et al.,2007 and Nagamatsu et al., 2006). Is there any difference in the mode of insulin exocytosis between the present study and the previous reports? The authors might want to discuss the modes of exocytotic events found in the present study in relation to previous studies.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Fusion pore regulation by cAMP/Epac2 controls cargo release during insulin exocytosis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Figure 1B. The drawing of full fusion with a wide concave structure may be subject to error, as recent super-resolution STED imaging shows that fusing dense-core vesicles maintain an omega-shape till the STED resolution limit (Shin et al., 2018; Chiang et al., 2014). We suggest to re-draw the concave shape in Figure 1B as an omega shape with a larger pore than the other omega profile at the left side. This does not mean that full-collapse does not occur in β-cells, but the authors' data can only say that the fusion pore is larger than NPY-venus.</p><p>2) The reviewer's comment: “Figure 2 shows that the percentage of flash events…”</p><p>The authors do not respond to the comment properly. The reviewers asked the authors to discuss the mechanisms of the different findings between Figure 2 and Figure 1. This should be reconsidered.</p><p>3) The reviewer's comment: “In Figure 5, Glib, tolb and gliz show similar effects…”</p><p>The authors have performed the requested experiments, and suggested that Epac2 is required for the effect of gliz on the fusion pore. The result on gliz is different from the previous reports (Zhang et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 2013). The authors should discuss reasons for the discrepancy.</p><p>4) The reviewer's comment: “The role of Eoac2(cAMP-GEFII) in insulin exocytosis…” The authors responded to the comment, but the modified statement has not been incorporated in the text (Introduction).</p><p>5) The reviewer's comment: “The source of reagents…” The source is provided, but the source of the Epac2 agonist S223 is missing.</p><p>6) The reviewer's comment: The description &quot;inhibitors of the GLP-1 peptidase&quot;… In the authors' response, &quot;inhibitors of DPP-4 peptidase&quot; should be &quot;inhibitors of DPP-4&quot;(delete&quot;peptidase&quot;).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41711.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work the regulation of fusion pore dynamics in pancreatic β-cells is studied.

During revision, we instead added data from four additional human donors, so that each of the conditions in Figure 1 now has been measured with 5-7 donors. We do not see strong donor to donor variation with respect to fusion pore behavior, and even average exocytosis is relatively similar between preps from non-diabetic donors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> and Gandasi et al., 2018). While there are differences in exocytosis rate between Ins1 and human cells, the effect of forskolin is very similar between the two. Exocytosis roughly doubles, the fraction of flash events shifts from 40 to 60%, and pore lifetimes increase from 0.27 to 0.7s for Ins1 and from 0.3 to 0.9s for human cells. We would also like to point out that Ins1 is a far more established model for insulin exocytosis (at least 1800 papers in PubMed) than EndoC (about 60 papers, of which only 4 studied exocytosis).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>K<sup>+</sup>-stimulated exocytosis in the indicated conditions.</title><p>In (<bold>a</bold>) each symbol represents the average of a donor, in (<bold>b</bold>), each symbol represents one cell.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41711-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors do not really show the link between cAMP and dynamin/amysin.

R-Ras is an activator of phosphoinositide 3-kinase <sup>67</sup>. By altering local phosphoinositide levels, Epac could therefore indirectly affect exocytosis via recruitment of C2-domain proteins such as Munc13 <sup>68</sup>, and fusion pore behavior by recruitment of the PH-domain containing proteins dynamin and amisyn <sup>69,70</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abstract, the conclusion is wrong: cAMP elevation leads to pore expansion and peptide release, but not when Epac2 is inactivated pharmacologically or in Epac2<sup>-/-</sup> mice.

We have also changed the fusion pore lifetime to NPY release time thorough the figures and text, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the reason that authors restricted exocytosis events to the rapid loss of the granule marker fluorescent (1-2 frames)? What about granule marker loss within 3-10 frames or &gt;10 frame? Please clarify why these events are excluded. On the other hand, in Figure 6a, the release time of the NPY after flash takes more than 2 seconds with multiple frames (obviously &gt;4 frames). This is inconsistent with the author's criteria of exocytosis events with the rapid loss within 1-2 frames. Please show the frame rate of all experiments since the different frame rates may generate different fraction of flash events vs full fusion events.</p></disp-quote><p>Detection of events was done by eye, using the criterion that the majority of the signal is lost suddenly (1-2 frames). This is now stated in the Materials and methods section, where we added the following text:</p><p>“The frame rate was 10 frames*s<sup>-1</sup>, with 100 ms exposures” subsection “TIRF microscopy” and “characteristic rapid loss of the granule marker fluorescence (most fluorescence lost within 1-2 frames)” subsection “Image analysis”.</p><p>In rare cases, a small portion of the signal remained at the release site (as in Figure 6A, note that only every fifth frame is shown). This is apparent in the quantification of the NPY-mOrange signal (now shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1). There are four possible explanations for the remaining fluorescence, (1) binding of the label to the outside of the cell after complete release (Michael, 2006), (2) kiss and run followed by undocking or re-acidification (Obermüller, 2005), (3) stray light from a nearby granule that did not undergo exocytosis, or (4) rapid undocking (see answer to the next question). We would maintain that the effect of all of this on our flash/no flash ratio measurement is minor. Occasionally, pore lifetimes for no-flash events are overestimated by the fitter, but this would not affect the conclusions of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Rapid NPY spot fluorescence decrease can also be due to vesicle undocking (docked vesicle leaving the docking site), rather than fusion as in Figure 1A. The possibility of undocking should be ruled out by control experiments. A control experiment can be co-expressing pH-sensitive vesicular protein or adding dye in the bath solution to indicate fusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Undocking is a rare event, 25-100 times less frequently than K<sup>+</sup>-stimulated exocytosis (eg Gandasi et al., 2018). However, control experiments were included in two of our previous papers. Accordingly, NPY-EGFP fluorescence disappears rapidly during exocytosis, while loss of the signal during undocking takes several seconds (Gandasi and Barg,2014; Figure S7). Multiplane confocal imaging also indicated that undocking is very slow, compared with exocytosis/content release (Barg, 2002, Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In subsection “cAMP-dependent fusion pore restriction is regulated by Epac but not PKA”, the authors state that PKA inhibition with Rp8-Br-cAMPS decreases exocytosis ~40% but not the fraction of flash events which is shown in Figure 1F. Then the percentage of flash events should be &gt;80% in Figure 1D for fsk+RP-8, but the flash percentage is similar as fsk alone with ~60-65%. How is this possible? This needs to be clarified to support the conclusion that Epac rather than PKA is responsible for cAMP-dependent fusion pore regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree. Assuming that PKA only affects the rate of exocytosis (but not fusion pore behavior), we would expect that the fraction of flash events remains constant in presence of the PKA blocker RP-8. This is in fact what is observed (Figure 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At the end of Introduction, the authors write that activation of Epac2 via GLP-1 and sulfonylurea will hinder full fusion and that this is &quot;expected to reduce their full fusion as insulin secretagogoues&quot;. However, there are no data available in this study (or in published elsewhere) showing that addition of GLP-1 or sulfonylurea will reduce insulin secretion. How do the authors validate the importance of their study? Is glucose stimulated insulin secretion decreased in the cells (Figure 2) overexpressing Epac2? What about Epac2 and insulin secretion in EndoC cells?</p></disp-quote><p>The statement is based on the data in Figure 5 suggesting that SU’s restrict fusion pore expansion by the same Epac-dependent mechanism as cAMP. In situations where exocytosis is strongly stimulated (in Figure 5 by SU, K<sup>+</sup> and ex-4), we observe a relative decrease in exocytosis (and therefore likely also insulin release) rather than an additive effect of SU and fsk. In vivo, SU will primarily stimulate exocytosis by closing K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and depolarization, but it will be worth investigating whether the stimulatory effect of GLP-1 agonists is affect by longterm SU treatment.</p><p>However, our study is focused on the molecular mechanism by which cAMP regulates fusion pore behavior, and we feel that in vivo studies to determine the physiological role of such mechanisms are beyond the scope of the paper. However, there is some evidence that fusion pore regulation by amisyn restricts insulin secretion, and may play a role in human type-2 diabetes (Collins, 2016). We also discuss the possibility that a delay between the release of small transmitters and insulin after Epac activation could be physiologically relevant, for example by influencing para/autocrine signaling in the islet. Such effects might be difficult to detect with traditional insulin secretion measurements, in particular since small molecule release and exocytosis are not considered in secretion measurements.</p><p>Regarding EndoC cells, please refer to our comment above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The efficiency of the overexpression is not shown. What is the mRNA and protein levels of Epac2 (Figure 2), amysin and dynamin (Figure 6) after overexpression?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that such quantification should be done on single cells, because the transfection only reaches a (varying) fraction of the cells and expression levels vary from cell to cell. We have therefore immunostained INS1 cells that had been transfected with mCherry-amisyn. In these cells we quantified both mCherry-amisyn and immunostaining (anti-amisyn detected with Alexa 488) in a large number of cells, including non-expressing cells (a). As expected, the Alexa fluorescence is higher in transfected cells (b), and there is a near linear relationship between red and green fluorescence (c); the y-axis offset is caused by non-transfected cells that are labeled green but not red, and represents endogenous amisyn expression. From this, we estimate that we worked with cells that overexpress the mCherry-amisyn 2-4 fold compared with endogenous expression. The data also hint that endogenous amisyn may be suppressed by expression of mCherry-amisyn (the average of non-transfected cells is higher than the offset). Similar experiments were done with dynamin1-GFP, and we observed a similar 2-3 fold increase for overexpressed dynamin 1 (d and e). The range of overexpression is similar to a number of other proteins that we have tested (eg syntaxin, CaV1.2), but unfortunately we were unable to source Epac antibodies of sufficient quality to succeed with such quantifications for Epac2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have not performed the proper statistics for the data.

However, the characteristics regarding glucose homeostasis including insulin secretion were not well studied in the paper. Furthermore, other lines of Epac2 KO mice have already been established and analyzed. The authors need to examine at least the insulin secretory profiles in the Epac2 KO mice used in this study in vivo and in vitro, and discuss them by referring to the previous studies using other KO strains.</p></disp-quote><p>The Epac2 knockout (KO) mouse used in this study differs from the original and most widely employed strain in that the deletion involves exons 12-13, which encode the high-affinity cAMP binding domain present in all Epac2 isoforms. With the previously generated mouse, a deletion was made in the first exon, thereby eliminating the dominating longest isoform Epac2A, but allowing expression of the shorter isoforms Epac2B and 2C. Indeed, there is evidence that Epac2B is present in mouse pancreatic islets, although it has not been clarified in which cell type(s) the protein is expressed Høivik et al., 2013. We therefore think that it is advantageous to use the mouse in which all Epac2 isoforms have been eliminated. We have added a short description in the methods section explaining the difference between the present mouse and the Epac2A-KO mouse.</p><p>A general characterization of the Epac2-KO mouse is ongoing but beyond the scope of this manuscript. Available insulin secretion data do not indicate any striking phenotypical differences from the first published Epac2A-KO strain. We have performed intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests showing that the mice are slightly glucose intolerant at an age of 10-11 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). This is reminiscent of the glucose intolerance reported for Epac2A-KO following increased metabolic demand induced by e.g. high fat feeding (Song et al., 2013).</p><p>Moreover, our analyses show that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from isolated islets remains intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">4</xref>), whereas amplification of secretion by cAMP-elevating glucagon is impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>). Although the number of observations are too few for the difference to reach statistical significance, the trend is as expected in light of the function of Epac2 and previously published data from Epac2A-deficient islets. We think that this functional characterization of the mouse would not add much to the present manuscript and think that the data would fit better in a forthcoming manuscript with more extensive phenotypic analyses and functional comparison between Epac2 and Epac1.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Means ± s.e.m. for blood glucose during intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests in three 10-11-month-old wild type and Epac2-deficient mice.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41711-resp-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Means ± s.e.m. for insulin from isolated islets stimulated by an elevation of the glucose concentration from 3 to 11 mM.</title><p>N=4 mice for each genotype.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41711-resp-fig3-v3.tif"/></fig><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Means ± s.e.m. for blood for insulin from isolated islets stimulated by an elevation of the glucose concentration from 3 to 20 mM and addition of 10 nM glucagon.</title><p>N=3 mice for each genotype.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41711-resp-fig4-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 shows that the percentage of flash events is increased by overexpression of Epac2. However, the actual number of flash events is not changed but full fusion events are decreased (Figure 2B), resulting in a decrease in the total number of fusion events (Figure 2A). In Figure 1, Epac activation by S223 increases the total number of exocytotic events by increasing flash events without changing the number of full fusion events. It seems that the fusion pore-regulating mechanism is different between these two conditions. Any thoughts on this issue?</p></disp-quote><p>We speculate that Epac becomes inhibitory for exocytosis due to the strong activation of pore restriction with both fsk and exogenous Epac, which competes with the cAMP-dependent acceleration of priming/exocytosis. We believe that this is also the reason for decreased exocytosis in presence of both forskolin and sulfonylurea (Figure 5B). Collins et al., (2016, and comment by Barg and Gucek, 2016) came to a similar conclusion regarding the role of amisyn in type 2 diabetes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4, the total number of exocytotic events is not increased by fsk in Epac2 KO β-cells. However, it is unlikely that cAMP cannot increase the number of exocytotic events in the absence of Epac2, as PKA signaling remains intact. What is the authors' interpretation of these results?</p></disp-quote><p>We are also surprised by the weak forskolin effect and the explanation is not clear. Since the PKA-dependent effect is slower than the Epac effect on exocytosis (Renström, 1997), it may be speculated that it has not become manifested during the relatively short time course of the experiment. Another possibility is that cAMP is already somewhat elevated in the control situation, since the cells are exposed to 10 mM glucose. Elevated cAMP may lead to PKA activation. It has been demonstrated that the apparent Kd for stimulating granule priming/exocytosis is 5-fold lower for PKA than for Epac (Eliasson, 2003).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4F and 4G, fsk seems to prolong fusion pore lifetime significantly in both WT and Epac2 KO β-cells, although the authors state that the lifetimes are similar with or without forskolin.

Both full fusion and flash events eventually release all contents of the secretory vesicle. Thus, the prolonged fusion pore lifetime means only a few seconds delay in insulin release compared to release of small molecules (or small molecules release a few seconds in advance of the insulin release). Although the authors discuss the roles of these small molecules in autocrine and paracrine signaling in islets, the physiological and pathophysiological relevance of the time difference in the release of insulin and small molecules should be further discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The Discussion section has been in part rewritten to strengthen the focus on physiological and pathophysiological relevance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It has previously been shown that there are different modes of insulin exocytosis, based on the dynamics of insulin granules (predocked granules, newcomer granules, etc.) (Shibasaki et al.,2007 and Nagamatsu et al., 2006).

The authors might want to discuss the modes of exocytotic events found in the present study in relation to previous studies.</p></disp-quote><p>While a number of labs have reported crash fusion (all using similar protocols), others have not (Tsuboi and Rutter, 2003; Barg et al., 2002; Michael et al., 2007; Hoppa et al., 2009; Gandasi and Barg, 2014). We recently presented a comprehensive analysis of near-membrane granule behavior in human β-cells, where there was no evidence for crash fusion (Gandasi et al., 2018). The reason why some groups observe crash fusion but others not is unclear. Possible differences include the use of glucose instead of KCl for stimulation (Shibasaki et al., 2007), the duration of the stimulation, and technical issues such as the use of thick cell supports (eg laminin), mistargeting of the granule label to other vesicle types, and label bleaching during long recordings. The latter would give the false appearance of no granule at the site of exocytosis. While this question is interesting and important (and should be settled), we believe that it is not central to the mechanism of fusion pore regulation by Epac and should rather be discussed in a topical review.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Fusion pore regulation by cAMP/Epac2 controls cargo release during insulin exocytosis&quot; for further consideration at eLife.

The drawing of full fusion with a wide concave structure may be subject to error, as recent super-resolution STED imaging shows that fusing dense-core vesicles maintain an omega-shape till the STED resolution limit (Shin et al., 2018; Chiang et al., 2014). We suggest to re-draw the concave shape in Figure 1B as an omega shape with a larger pore than the other omega profile at the left side. This does not mean that full-collapse does not occur in β-cells, but the authors' data can only say that the fusion pore is larger than NPY-venus.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.

This should be reconsidered.</p></disp-quote><p>This is probably due to its independent action on priming and fusion pore control. With activation (Figure 1; S223) both the effect of priming and the effect on the fusion pore are strongly present. With Epac overexpression only (Figure 2B), there is no effect on the priming, but only on the fusion pore restriction. As we´ve discussed in the response letter, we speculate that Epac, similarly as amisyn, becomes inhibitory for exocytosis due to the strong restriction of the pore with both fsk and exogenous Epac present. We might be under-detecting the restricted fusion pores that close back (kiss-and-run events), which accounts for the observed exocytosis decrease.</p><p>We´ve added a short discussion in the Discussion section:” Epac mediates the PKA-independent stimulation of exocytosis by cAMP <sup>59</sup> and our data suggests it may affect both priming and fusion pore restriction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewer's comment: “In Figure 5, Glib, tolb and gliz show similar effects…”</p><p>The authors have performed the requested experiments, and suggested that Epac2 is required for the effect of gliz on the fusion pore.

The mentioned reports state gliz does not activate Epac2A, but it can still bind (only through 1 binding site G114) to the CNB1 domain (Takahashi et al., 2013). We´ve previously shown Epac2 targeting to the plasma membrane doesn’t depend on CNB1 domain. The clustering at the granule site however does depend on the CNB1 domain (Alenkvist et al., 2017). Since we speculate that Epac works only as a regulator of downstream proteins (e.g. dynamin 1 and amisyn), the localization at the granule site without activation may explain the restriction of the fusion pores we´ve observed in this study. This is further supported with the data in Figure 2, where overexpression of Epac in absence of forskolin results in a strong restriction of the fusion pores.</p><p>We´ve added a short discussion in the Discussion section: “Since gliclizide binds the CNB1 domain without activating it <sup>54</sup> and still restricts the fusion pore, Epac localization at the granule site <sup>39</sup> may be enough to regulate the downstream proteins (e.g. dynamin and amisyn).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The reviewer's comment: “The role of Eoac2(cAMP-GEFII) in insulin exocytosis…” The authors responded to the comment, but the modified statement has not been incorporated in the text (Introduction).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing the mistake.
