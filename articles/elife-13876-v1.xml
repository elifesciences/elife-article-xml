VEGFR-2 has been hypothesized to be monomeric in the absence of bound ligand, and to undergo dimerization and activation only upon ligand binding. Using quantitative FRET and biochemical analysis, we show that VEGFR-2 forms dimers also in the absence of ligand when expressed at physiological levels, and that these dimers are phosphorylated. Ligand binding leads to a change in the TM domain conformation, resulting in increased kinase domain phosphorylation. Inter-receptor contacts within the extracellular and TM domains are critical for the establishment of the unliganded dimer structure, and for the transition to the ligand-bound active conformation. We further show that the pathogenic C482R VEGFR-2 mutant, linked to infantile hemangioma, promotes ligand-independent signaling by mimicking the structure of the ligand-bound wild-type VEGFR-2 dimer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13876.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13876.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13876.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>New blood vessels form by growing out from existing vessels. A signaling molecule called VEGF is crucial for this process and binds to a receptor protein known as VEGFR-2. This binding activates signaling events within the cells that line the blood vessels to promote the growth of new vessels.</p><p>VEGFR-2 belongs to a family of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases. The receptor has three main parts: one part extends out of the cell and binds to VEGF, another spans the cell’s membrane, while the third part is found inside the cell. The current model of VEGFR-2 activation is that VEGF binds to individual VEGFR-2 receptor proteins on the membrane, and brings two of them close enough to form a complex called a dimer. The receptor dimer is activated and initiates signaling within the cell.</p><p>Sarabipour et al. tested this current model and revealed that VEGFR-2 could form a dimer even in the absence of VEGF. This receptor dimer formed through contacts between parts that are inside the cell as well as the regions embedded in the membrane. These VEGFR-2 dimers were active, but only to a low level. However, the activity of the receptor was increased in the presence of VEGF. Sarabipour et al. found that binding of VEGF promoted VEGFR-2 to change its three-dimensional shape, which made it more active. Further work suggested that VEGFR-2 dimers must first correctly assemble in the absence of VEGF so that active VEGFR-2 dimers can form at a later stage. Hence a VEGFR-2 dimer on its own is an important intermediate that is needed for full activation of the receptor.</p><p>A mutation in the gene that encodes VEGFR-2 causes a disorder called infantile hemangioma that leads to abnormal vessel formation in young children. Sarabipour et al. found that this mutation causes VEGFR-2 to change its shape even when no VEGF is present and thus makes the receptor overly active. Finally, tumors need to form new blood vessels to grow and survive. These new findings suggest that drugs that interact with VEGFR-2 dimers in the absence of VEGF may be able to prevent the receptor from becoming activated and could thus help cut the blood supply to tumors and treat cancers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13876.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13876.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>transmembrane domains</kwd><kwd>dimerization</kwd><kwd>model systems</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A-130463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ballmer-Hofer</surname><given-names>Kurt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004201</institution-id><institution>Oncosuisse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OC2 01200-08-2007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ballmer-Hofer</surname><given-names>Kurt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM068619</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hristova</surname><given-names>Kalina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM095930</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hristova</surname><given-names>Kalina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000179</institution-id><institution>NSF Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB1157687</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hristova</surname><given-names>Kalina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor forms dimers in the absence of its ligand, and ligand-binding leads to structural changes that result in increased kinase phosphorylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, plays a critical role in embryogenesis, organ development, and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qutub et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nessa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2007</xref>).

Angiogenesis is regulated by the ligands and receptors of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferrara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsumoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shibuya et al., 2006</xref>). Of the three VEGF receptors, VEGFR-2 is the primary regulator of endothelial cell proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takahashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerhardt et al., 2003</xref>). VEGFR-2 is expressed in all human vascular endothelial cells and is often overexpressed in highly malignant solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamagishi et al., 2013</xref>). Aggressive cancerous phenotypes correlate with enhanced VEGFR-2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>VEGFR-2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) which transduces biochemical signals via lateral dimerization in the plasma membrane. Like most RTKs, VEGFR-2 is composed of an extracellular (EC) domain, a transmembrane (TM) domain, and an intracellular (IC) domain consisting of a kinase domain and sequences required for downstream signaling. The EC domain consists of seven immunoglobulin homology (Ig) domains, termed D1 (at the N-terminus) to D7 (closest to the membrane). VEGFR-2 binds to, and is activated by the ligands VEGF-A, VEGF-E, and a number of processed forms of VEGF-C and VEGF-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsumoto et al., 2001</xref>). Ligand binding to VEGFR-2 is mediated by Ig-domains 2 and 3 and the linker between D2 and D3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brozzo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leppanen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kisko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hyde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruch et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>All VEGF ligands form disulfide-linked anti-parallel homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muller et al., 1997</xref>). VEGF-A exists as different isoforms of various lengths, all containing the binding site for VEGFR-2, located within the N-terminal 121 amino acids. All isoforms exhibit similar binding affinity to VEGFR-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mac Gabhann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qutub et al., 2009</xref>). The longer VEGF-A isoforms possess additional sequences which enable binding to co-receptors such as neuropilins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qutub et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vempati et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>At present, there is no universal consensus model of RTK-mediated transmembrane signaling. Instead, two models, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, are discussed. The first is the 'diffusion-based' or 'canonical' model, in which RTKs exist as monomers in the absence of ligand because they do not have a sequence-specific propensity for lateral interactions. Ligand binding induces RTK dimerization, which brings the two catalytic domains into close proximity so they can cross-phosphorylate each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fantl et al., 1993</xref>). The second model is the 'pre-formed dimer model', in which the receptors can form dimers in the absence of ligand because they have a sequence-encoded propensity to interact laterally even in the absence of ligand, and thus they exist in a monomer-dimer equilibrium in the absence of ligand. Ligand binding promotes structural changes in the EC domain that trigger transmembrane signaling by reorienting the catalytic kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bocharov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sarabipour and Hristova, 2016</xref>).</p><p>VEGFR-2 has been believed to follow the canonical model of ligand-induced dimerization and activation, with dimeric VEGF ligands binding to freely diffusing monomeric receptors and promoting receptor dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kisko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hyde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shibuya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koch et al., 2011</xref>). In the active dimers, homotypic receptor-receptor contacts in domains D4-7 were observed that appear critical for efficient phosphorylation of the VEGFR-2 receptors in the presence of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hyde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruch et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Ligand-independent dimer formation has been observed for several RTKs, such as EGFR, FGFR, and Trk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Low-Nam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maruyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mischel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sarabipour and Hristova, 2016</xref>). The dimerization propensity of VEGFR-2 in the absence of ligand, however, has not been measured to date. Here, we examined VEGFR-2 dimerization, as well as the mechanism of VEGFR-2 ligand-mediated activation. We used a quantitative FRET-based method and biochemical assays to study the structure, stability, and activation of VEGFR-2 dimers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Full-length VEGFR-2 dimerizes in the absence of ligand</title><p>We investigated whether full-length VEGFR-2 is capable of forming dimers in the absence of ligand using an established quantitative FRET method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>).

To determine the thermodynamic parameters describing VEGFR-2 dimerization, we varied the receptor concentration, and we measured the concentrations of the receptors and the FRET efficiencies in individual plasma membrane-derived vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This method yields the dimerization constant <italic>K</italic> and thus the dimerization free energy (or dimer stability) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>).

Each vesicle was imaged in the donor, acceptor, and FRET channels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The FRET efficiency, the donor concentration, and the acceptor concentration in each individual vesicle were determined as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al.

The measured FRET efficiency for VEGFR-2 is shown as a function of acceptor concentration (VEGFR-2-mCherry) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (red solid symbols). The solid black line shows the so-called 'bystander' or 'stochastic' FRET, which occurs due to random approach of donors and acceptors in the absence of specific interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolber et al., 1979</xref>). The magnitude of stochastic FRET is well understood and characterized, both theoretically and experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">King et al., 2014</xref>). The measured FRET efficiencies significantly exceed this stochastic FRET contribution, demonstrating the existence of specific interactions between the full-length VEGFR-2 molecules in the cell membrane.</p><p>VEGFR-2 dimerization in the absence of ligand is supported by VEGFR-2 cross-linking data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Consistent with data in the literature, two monomeric bands were observed, corresponding to partially and fully glycosylated VEGFR-2 variants. We also observed weak bands at twice the VEGFR-2 molecular weight, corresponding to cross-linked dimers. We are aware that cross-linking efficiencies not only depend on dimerization, but also on the presence of suitable reactive groups in close proximity. Thus, the fact that we observed bands corresponding to dimers, albeit weak, provides support for our FRET results documenting VEGFR-2 dimerization in the absence of ligand.</p><p>The measured FRET in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> was corrected for the stochastic contribution, and the corrected FRET is plotted as a function of total receptor concentration in each vesicle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> with the red solid symbols.

Experiments were performed with two truncated VEGFR-2 constructs, one lacking the IC domain (EC+TM construct) and one lacking both the EC and IC domains. The VEGFR-2 TM domain construct contained a (GGS)<sub>5</sub> flexible linker, and a fluorescent protein. This type of attachment of the fluorescent probe to the TM domains has previously been used successfully and has been demonstrated not to affect dimerization propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sarabipour and Hristova, 2015</xref>). The EC+TM construct also included the VEGFR-2 EC domain. Both truncated constructs included the VEGFR-2 signal peptide which is cleaved during receptor processing.

This result is consistent with previous findings showing that the phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 is increased upon removal of the EC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manni et al., 2014a</xref>).

Consistent with our hypothesis, the corrected FRET efficiency did not vary with receptor concentration, indicative of constitutive dimerization. The Intrinsic FRET value was thus calculated for each individual vesicle, by dividing the corrected FRET efficiency by the acceptor fraction (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 6</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> shows histograms of the Intrinsic FRET values for single vesicles in the presence of the six ligands. The histograms are well described by Gaussian distributions. The center of the Gaussians, ~0.45, corresponding to a separation between the fluorescent proteins by ~56 Å, was the same for all six ligands. Since the fluorescent proteins were attached to the TM domains via flexible linkers, we conclude that the TM domain configuration is similar in the presence of the six ligands. On the other hand, the binding of any of the ligands significantly changed Intrinsic FRET for the EC+TM construct from 0.61 to 0.45, thus increasing the separation of the fluorescent proteins by 7 ± 1 Å, from 49 ± 2 Å to 56 ± 1 Å.

Using a quantitative FRET-based methodology, specifically designed to probe receptor interactions in the plasma membrane, we demonstrated that full-length VEGFR-2 forms dimers in the absence of ligand. A substantial fraction of the receptors is dimeric for receptor expression levels reported for endothelial cells (10 to 100 receptors per square micron). Furthermore, these unliganded dimeric receptors are phosphorylated, albeit to a low degree. The basal phosphorylation occurs on Y1054/1059 and Y1175 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), as well as on Y1214 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamalice et al., 2006</xref>).

A new model of RTK activation, which includes unliganded dimers of various stabilities as intermediates, has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sarabipour and Hristova, 2016</xref>). The behavior of VEGFR-2 observed here is consistent with this new model.</p><p>Through mutagenesis, domain deletions and domain substitutions, our study provides insights into the interactions that stabilize VEGFR-2 dimers in the plasma membrane in the absence of ligand. First, there are sequence-specific contacts between the TM domains in the dimers. In particular, at least one of the amino acids E764, T771, or F778 participates in helix-helix contacts, as the substitution of these three amino acids with Ile changed the structure and the stability of the EC+TM VEGFR-2 dimers in the absence of ligand. Second, these dimers are further stabilized by contacts between the IC domains, since the removal of the IC domains decreased dimer stability by 2.7 kcal.mole<sup>-1</sup>. Therefore, specific interactions between the IC domains regulate receptor dimerization and ensure control of receptor activity in the absence of ligand. Thus, our observations that VEGFR-2 phosphorylation can take place in the absence of ligand, along with the FRET results, point to a significant role of the IC domains in dimer stabilization. Third, we discovered a new role for domains D4 and D7 in unliganded VEGFR-2 dimerization, by showing that they stabilize VEGFR-2 dimers in the absence of ligand. Indeed, the substitution of Ig-domains D4 or D7 significantly altered both dimerization and Intrinsic FRET in the absence of ligand. Fourth, we showed that the wild-type VEGFR-2 EC domain, as a whole, inhibits receptor dimerization, as inferred from the fact that deletion of the entire EC domain increased the stability of the dimers by 1.4 kcal.mole<sup>-1</sup>. Overall, this work documents a complex role for the EC domain in VEGFR-2 dimer stabilization and establishes the existence of specific dimer stabilizing contacts in the EC, the TM, and the IC domains of VEGFR-2.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ligand binding promotes reorientation of the receptors in the dimer</title><p>To monitor ligand-induced conformational changes in the TM domain, we performed experiments with truncated VEGFR-2 constructs carrying fluorescent proteins attached via flexible (GGS)<sub>5</sub> linkers to the C-termini of the TM domains. The Intrinsic FRET decreased from 0.61 to 0.42, corresponding to an increase in separation between the fluorescent proteins in these dimers from 49 to 56 Å, upon ligand binding. This reflects an increase in the spatial separation between the TM domain C-termini by 7 Å in response to ligand binding.</p><p>Through mutagenesis analysis, we gained information about the structural changes in the TM domain of the VEGFGR-2 dimers that occur in response to ligand binding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

Ligand binding induces a rotation of the TM helices, leading to the engagement of at least one of the amino acids N762, V769, G770 in the helix-helix interface.

Previous NMR studies of in vitro produced RTK TM peptides, inserted into lipid bicelles or detergent micelles, have suggested the existence of two sets of mutually exclusive helix-helix contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bocharov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleishman et al., 2002</xref>). These observations have been interpreted as evidence that RTK TM domains can form at least two structurally and functionally different dimers. Yet, there have been no direct experimental data demonstrating a structural change in the VEGFR-2 TM domain dimer configuration in the plasma membrane, in response to ligand binding, so far. Here, we directly observed such a structural change using our quantitative FRET methodology which allowed us to monitor the response of the receptor dimer to ligand binding from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. FRET is extremely sensitive to the distance between the fluorescent proteins, which we measure with 1 Å precision.</p><p>The observed changes in FRET are biologically significant, as the increase in separation between the C-termini of the TM domains correlated with an increase in receptor phosphorylation and thus with receptor activity. Our results clearly demonstrate that ligand binding increases VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, which correlates with a conformational change in the TM domain dimer structure. A similar mechanism of activation, involving an increase in TM helix C-termini separation, has been proposed for EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bocharov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arkhipov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Endres et al., 2013</xref>). For the FGF receptors, however, the ligand-induced changes involve a decrease in the separation between the TM domain C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sarabipour and Hristova, 2016</xref>). Decrease in the separation of the TM domains upon ligand binding has also been observed for the constitutively dimeric IGF-1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kavran et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it appears that ligand-induced structural changes are a general feature of RTK activation, but the exact nature of the structural change varies for the different receptors.</p><p>We compared the structural effects of several ligands known to bind to VEGFR-2, namely three different VEGF-A isoforms (VEGF-A<sub>121</sub>, VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>a, and VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>b), as well as VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGF-E. Our experiments were conducted at very high, saturating ligand concentrations of 3 μg.ml<sup>-1</sup>, when ligand concentrations exceeded both the receptor concentrations and the ligand binding coefficients by at least a factor of 100. The FRET efficiency did not depend on receptor concentration, suggesting that all receptors were in the ligand-bound dimeric state. We measured the same Intrinsic FRET for EC+TM VEGFR-2 in the presence of all six ligands. Furthermore, these ligands gave rise to the same VEGFR-2 activities as determined by Western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies. We thus propose that the six ligands induced the same structural changes in the receptor, resulting in a similar VEGFR-2 phosphorylation increase. The VEGFR-2 case is thus quite different from the case of the FGFR dimers, which exhibit different structural and biological responses to the ligands fgf1 and fgf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sarabipour and Hristova, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The VEGF ligands are known to have distinct affinities for VEGFR-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brozzo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mac Gabhann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qutub et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, for VEGFR-2 it is reasonable to assume that binding affinity may determine the specific signal output by VEGFR-2 in response to different ligands. Alternatively, different intracellular trafficking of the ligand-bound receptors may dictate signaling specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clegg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballmer-Hofer et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Effect of mutations on transmembrane signaling</title><p>The mutations and substitutions used here to probe VEGFR-2 dimer stability, structure, and activation, promoted significant changes in VEGFR-2 structure and function. For instance, the D4 substitution stabilized the EC+TM VEGFR-2 dimer, altered its structure, and abolished ligand binding. The D7 substitution, on the other hand, caused receptor oligomerization that rendered the receptor non-responsive to ligand. The E764I-T771I-F778I TM domain mutations stabilized the VEGFR-2 dimer in the absence of ligand and changed its structure as reflected by Intrinsic FRET, but did not increase receptor phosphorylation. The N762I-V769I-G770I mutations altered the structure of the ligand-bound VEGFR-2 dimer and reduced receptor phosphorylation. Quite remarkably, none of the engineered mutations increased VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, suggesting that VEGFR-2 is surprisingly resistant to aberrant activation.</p><p>The only mutation that caused an increase in phosphorylation was the pathogenic C482R mutation, identified in infant hemangiomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boye et al., 2009</xref>).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a pathogenic activating mutation in VEGFR-2 and the first mechanistic study of such a mutation.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that the C482R mutant formed constitutive dimers even in the absence of ligand. Western blots performed under reducing and non-reducing conditions revealed that there are no disulfide-linked C482R dimers. Instead, quantitative FRET experiments revealed that the constitutive C482R dimers adopt the ligand-bound wild-type dimer conformation, both in the presence and absence of ligand. Thus, the C482R mutation increased VEGFR-2 activation by mimicking the structural effect of the ligand. Similar behavior has been observed for the pathogenic A391E, R248C, and S249C FGFR3 mutants, linked to skeletal and cranial growth disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sarabipour and Hristova, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Del Piccolo et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Volker Dötsch, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The other two reviewers have agreed to reveal their identities: Charles Sanders and Yechiel Shai.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There are two accepted models for the activation of VEGFR-2, the &quot;diffusion-based&quot; in which RTKs exist as monomers in the absence of ligand. Ligand binding induces its dimerization. The second model is the &quot;preformed dimer model&quot;, in which the receptors can form dimers in the absence of ligand but it exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium in the absence of ligand. Ligand binding promotes structural changes in the ecto domain that trigger transmembrane signaling.</p><p>Here the authors used quantitative FRET and biochemical analysis, to show directly that the full length VEGFR-2 forms dimers also in the absence of ligand and when expressed at physiological levels. Furthermore, these dimers are also phosphorylated. In addition, ligand binding causes a change in the conformation of the trans-membrane (TM) domain, leading to increased phosphorylation. They further demonstrated that Inter-receptor contacts within the extracellular and TM domains are critical for the formation of the unliganded dimer, as well as for the transition to the ligand-bound active conformation.</p><p>All reviewers agree that the manuscript reports interesting data. However, some questions remain that should be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) GFP variants are known to have a tendency to dimerize. Have the authors used monomeric forms of these fluorescent proteins or have taken into account this effect?</p><p>2) Some of the GFP variant proteins are not fully processed and therefore remain dark. Have the authors taken this into account?</p><p>3) What is the model of how a further separation of the C-terminal ends of the TM helices creates efficient cross phosphorylation? This seems to me rather counter intuitive. Could asymmetric kinase domain dimers play a role?</p><p>4) Both the Abstract and sections of the text (c.f. subsection “Ligand binding induces a structural change in the TM domain of the VEGFR-2 dimer”) refer to the presence of receptor phosphorylation under basal (ligand-free) conditions. What is the significance of basal phosphorylation? Does it induce basal signaling? Is it a different class (different sites?) of modification than that induced by growth factor binding?</p><p>5) The standard deviations reported in the table are mostly very small-often under 5% relative deviations (this seems very clear from the green and red data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, for example). These values seem to reflect the SD calculated by the data fitting program but, I assume, greatly under-represents the actual experimental uncertainties of the reported measurements.

Have the authors used monomeric forms of these fluorescent proteins or have taken into account this effect?</italic> </p><p>Yes, we use monomeric YFP and monomeric mCherry. In fact, we ourselves have introduced the A206K mutation in YFP to render it monomeric. Furthermore, we have published control experiments for ErbB truncated variants, labeled with these fluorescent donors and acceptors, that show no interactions (King et al., 2014). Thus, we know that the fluorescent proteins that we use do not induce the dimerization of the membrane proteins that they are attached to. In the revised paper, we have added “Both fluorescent proteins are monomeric, and do not drive interactions in the membrane (King et al., 2014)” to the Methods, subsection “Plasmids”, first paragraph.</p><p> <italic>2) Some of the GFP variant proteins are not fully processed and therefore remain dark. Have the authors taken this into account?</italic> </p><p>We have observed such effects in collaborative work with soluble fluorescent proteins. Sometimes the ratio of donor to acceptor concentrations for a linked donor-acceptor construct is not 1. However, we have seen no obvious indications of such effects for membrane proteins. We believe that the misfolded membrane proteins do not pass the quality control of the ER and do not make it to the plasma membrane and thus to our plasma membrane derived vesicles. On the other hand, misfolded soluble fluorescent proteins are made in the cytoplasm and, perhaps, are not destroyed efficiently as they are over-expressed.</p><p> <italic>3) What is the model of how a further separation of the C-terminal ends of the TM helices creates efficient cross phosphorylation? This seems to me rather counter intuitive. Could asymmetric kinase domain dimers play a role?</italic> </p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the VEGFR-2 results are consistent with the current model of EGFR TM domain dimer response to ligand. Upon ligand binding, the C- termini of the TM domains are believed to move away from each other (See for instance <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> - for “inactive dimer - in Arkhipov et al., 2013). In one model this creates “space” for the asymmetric EGFR kinase dimer to form. However, our experiments do not tell us much about the kinase domains, so we cannot speculate about a possible asymmetric kinase dimer at this point.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the movement of the VEGFR-2 TM C-termini in response to ligand, observed here, is the opposite of the one observed for FGFR TM domain C-termini with the same experimental technique. In the revised manuscript (Discussion, subsection “Ligand binding promotes reorientation of the receptors in the dimer”, fourth paragraph), we have added:</p><p>“A similar mechanism of activation, involving an increase in TM helix C-termini separation, has been proposed for EGFR (Arkhipov et al., 2013; Bocharov et al., 2008; Endres et al., 2013). For the FGF receptors, however, the ligand-induced changes involve a decrease in the separation between the TM domain C-termini (Sarabipour and Hristova, 2016). Decrease in the separation of the TM domains upon ligand binding has also been observed for the constitutively dimeric IGF-1R (Kavran et al., 2014). Thus, it appears that ligand-induced structural changes are a general feature of RTK activation, but the exact nature of the structural change varies for the different receptors.”</p><p> <italic>4) Both the Abstract and sections of the text (c.f. subsection “Ligand binding induces a structural change in the TM domain of the VEGFR-2 dimer”) refer to the presence of receptor phosphorylation under basal (ligand-free) conditions. What is the significance of basal phosphorylation? Does it induce basal signaling? Is it a different class (different sites?) of modification than that induced by growth factor binding?</italic> </p><p>Work in the literature has demonstrated that downstream kinases can be phosphorylated in endothelial cells in the absence of ligand. Basal phosphorylation occurs on Y1054/1059, Y1175 and Y1214. The phosphorylation of these tyrosines is increased upon VEGF treatment. In the revised manuscript (Discussion, subsection “VEGFR-2 forms dimers in the plasma membrane in the absence and presence of ligand”, first paragraph), we have added:</p><p>“The basal phosphorylation occurs on Y1054/1059 and Y1175 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), as well as on Y1214 (Lamalice et al., 2006). Consistent with these observations, phosphorylation of downstream kinases has been reported in endothelial cells in the absence of ligand (Labrecque et al., 2003; Oubaha and Gratton, 2009).”</p><p><italic>5) The standard deviations reported in the table are mostly very small-often under 5% relative deviations (this seems very clear from the green and red data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, for example). These values seem to reflect the SD calculated by the data fitting program but, I assume, greatly under-represents the actual experimental uncertainties of the reported measurements. This should be addressed.</italic> </p><p>The reported errors are not standard deviations, they are standard <italic>errors</italic> determined from the MATLAB fit. This is now stated in the legend to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. They are small because we have a very large number of data points (vesicles) to reduce random error. In previous work, we have analyzed the errors in our measurements, and we have shown that they are due to white noise (Chen et al., 2010). Because of this, the errors are reduced by making multiple measurements. Random errors cannot be eliminated completely, but they can be reduced by collecting a large number of data points (&gt;300) for each experimental condition.</p><p>To reduce systematic errors, we always calibrate the microscope by imaging purified fluorescent proteins at the start of each experiment (described in the Methods section). To determine if systematic errors play a role in our measurements, at least three independent experiments for each variant are performed on different days, and measurements with multiple variants are performed on the same day. We see no systematic errors and thus the white noise is the major source of error in our experiments.</p><p><italic>6) One thing that seems to be missing in the Discussion is integration of the major conclusions of this paper with what is now known about the signaling mechanisms of other RTK growth factor receptors.</italic></p><p>We have expanded the Discussion to address this concern. For instance, we have added to the Discussion, subsection “VEGFR-2 forms dimers in the plasma membrane in the absence and presence of ligand”, first paragraph:</p><p>“Recent work has demonstrated that other RTKs, such as EGFR and the FGF receptors (Chung et al., 2010; Comps-Agrar et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2012; Low-Nam et al., 2011; Sarabipour and Hristova, 2016) also form unliganded dimers. A new model of RTK activation, which includes unliganded dimers of various stabilities as intermediates, has been proposed (Sarabipour and Hristova, 2016). The behavior of VEGFR-2 observed here is consistent with this new model.”</p><p>We have further added to the Discussion, subsection ligand binding promotes reorientation of the receptors in the dimer, fifth paragraph: “The VEGFR-2 case is thus quite different from the case of the FGFR dimers, which exhibit different structural and biological responses to the ligands fgf1 and fgf2 (Sarabipour and Hristova, 2016).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
