myelinating oligodendrocytes represents a pivotal developmental milestone in vertebrates, given their capacity to ensheath axons and facilitate the swift conduction of action potentials. It is widely accepted that cortical oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) arise from medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), lateral/caudal ganglionic eminence (LGE/CGE), and cortical radial glial cells (RGCs). Here, we used two different fate mapping strategies to challenge the established notion that the LGE generates cortical OPCs. Furthermore, we used a Cre/loxP-dependent exclusion strategy to reveal that the LGE/CGE does not give rise to cortical OPCs. Additionally, we showed that specifically eliminating MGE-derived OPCs leads to a significant reduction of cortical OPCs. Together, our findings indicate that the LGE does not generate cortical OPCs, contrary to previous beliefs. These findings provide a new view of the developmental origins of cortical OPCs and a valuable foundation for future research on both normal development and oligodendrocyte-related disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oligodendrocyte</kwd><kwd>LGE</kwd><kwd>MGE</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>fate mapping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STI2030-2021ZD0202300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Zhengang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31820103006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Zhengang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82271197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Dashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81974175</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Dashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32200776</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhuangzhi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003399</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018SHZDZX01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Zhengang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZJ Lab</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Zhengang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The contribution of the lateral/caudal ganglionic eminence to the pool of cortical oligodendrocyte precursor cells is minimal.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are one of the most abundant cell types in the mammalian neocortex. The emergence of myelination OLs in vertebrates is a major event in the evolution of the central nervous system (CNS), as these cells play a crucial role in enhancing axonal insulation and the conduction of neural impulses. Previously, they have been described as support cells that myelinate axons and play essential roles in the function of neocortical circuits. Myelin loss or dysfunction is associated with many disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, depression, and pediatric leukodystrophies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>During CNS development, OLs originate from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which arise from different regions of the embryonic neural tube. OPCs proliferate and migrate away from the ventricular germinal zone (VZ) into developing gray and white matter before differentiating into mature OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). The developmental origin of cortical OLs has been extensively studied in the CNS, especially in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marques et al., 2018</xref>). A landmark study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kessaris et al., 2006</xref> demonstrated that cortical OPCs are generated in three waves, starting with a ventral wave, gradually transitioning to more dorsal origins. The first wave of cortical OPCs is derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) or the anterior entopeduncular area (AEP) at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) (<italic>Nkx2.1</italic><sup>+</sup> lineage). The second wave of cortical OLs is derived from the lateral/caudal ganglionic eminences (LGE/CGE) at E15.5 (<italic>Gsx2<sup>+</sup>/Nkx2.1<sup>-</sup></italic> lineage). The final wave occurs at P0, when OPCs originate from cortical glial progenitor cells (<italic>Emx1</italic><sup>+</sup> lineage). Our recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), however, challenge the notion that cortical OLs are generated in these three waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kessaris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richardson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rowitch and Kriegstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergles and Richardson, 2015</xref>), as the cortical glial progenitor cells were also found to express <italic>Gsx2</italic>, which was known to be exclusively expressed in the developing subpallium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chapman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chapman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wen et al., 2021</xref>), after E16.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Gsx2<sup>+</sup>/Nkx2.1<sup>-</sup></italic> lineage OLs may not represent LGE-derived cortical OLs. To date, whether the LGE/CGE generates cortical OPCs (OLs) during cortical development remains an unanswered question in the field of developmental neuroscience.</p><p>The present study was undertaken to answer this question. We carried out distinct fate mapping experiments and intersectional lineage analyses to reveal that cortical OPCs do not derive from the LGE/CGE. First, using in utero electroporation (IUE) to target the LGE in a Cre recombinase-dependent IS (<italic>Rosa26<sup>CAG-LSLFrt-tdTomato-Frt-EGFP</sup></italic>) reporter mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2016</xref>), we found that LGE-derived OPCs produced striatal OLs rather than cortical OLs. Second, by combining the PiggyBac transposon system with IUE, we found that no traced cells migrated into the cortex from the LGE. Third, by crossing the <italic>Nkx2.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Emx1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mouse lines with an H2B-GFP reporter mouse line, we found that nearly all cortical OPCs originated from <italic>Nkx2.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> or <italic>Emx1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> lineage cells. Finally, we analyzed <italic>Olig2</italic> conditional knockout mice (<italic>Nkx2.1<sup>Cre</sup>; Olig2<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice), and found that the number of cortical OPCs was significantly reduced from E14.5 to E16.5. These results indicated that the MGE was the predominant ventral source of cortical OPCs. Taken together, our findings suggest that the LGE/CGE gives rise to limited cortical OPCs (OLs) during neocortical development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fate mapping of LGE-derived OPCs by combining IUE with a Cre recombinase-dependent IS reporter</title><p>OPCs initially emerge in the ventral VZ of the MGE and can be labeled by platelet-derived growth factor receptor (α-subunit, <italic>Pdgfra</italic>) around E12.5. We hypothesized that if the LGE generated cortical OPCs, the <italic>Pdgfra<sup>+</sup></italic> cell migration stream from the LGE to the cortex could be observed during cortical development. To confirm this speculation, we conducted a detailed analysis of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> mRNA expression using in situ hybridization (ISH). Our results showed that there was no observable <italic>Pdgfra<sup>+</sup></italic> cell migration stream from the LGE to the cortex from E13.5 to postnatal day 0 (P0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, we used Cre recombinases in combination with an IS reporter mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2016</xref>) to fate map LGE-derived OPCs (OLs). We delivered pCAG-Cre plasmids specifically into the LGE VZ of IS reporter mouse embryos at E13.5 by IUE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). In this experiment, cells generated from electroporated neural stem cells (NSCs) expressed tdTomato (tdT). Interestingly, we observed many tdT<sup>+</sup> cells throughout the whole LGE (striatum) at E18.5. In contrast, there were very few tdT<sup>+</sup> cells detected in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). OPCs express <italic>Olig2</italic>, <italic>Sox10</italic>, <italic>Pdgfra,</italic> and NG2 (<italic>Cspg4</italic>) and mature neurons express NeuN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Finzsch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reiprich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kucharova and Stallcup, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sánchez-González et al., 2020</xref>). To determine the identity of the tdT<sup>+</sup> cells, we performed double staining of tdT with OLIG2, SOX10, PDGFRA, NG2 (CSPG4), and NeuN. Within the cortex, tdT<sup>+</sup> cells did not express OPC marker genes but express NeuN; however, tdT<sup>+</sup> cells expressed OPC marker genes and NeuN in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). We also delivered pCAG-Cre plasmids specifically into the LGE VZ of IS reporter mice at P0 by IUE and analyzed these mice at P49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) to investigate whether the LGE generates cortical OLs at a later developmental stage.

This approach utilized a transposase enzyme (helper plasmid) to integrate the H2B-GFP sequence from a donor plasmid into the genome of the in utero electroporated LGE progenitors along the lateral ventricular zone. The H2B-GFP reporter vector was delivered specifically into the LGE VZ of wild-type embryos at E13.5 by IUE, and these embryos were examined at E18.5 or P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). In this system, most traced cells (GFP<sup>+</sup>) were located in the striatum, and very few traced cells were observed in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>). Usually, a small population of RGCs located in the dorsal LGE or lateral/ventral pallium was labeled by IUE. These RGCs mainly migrated to the lateral/ventral pallium and amygdala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

However, in the current study, we re-examined the developmental origins of cortical OPCs using diverse strategies. Our findings show that cortical OPCs do not come from the LGE/CGE, contrary to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kessaris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richardson et al., 2006</xref>), which suggested that the LGE/CGE generates cortical OPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In fact, no cortical OPCs migrating from the LGE to the cortex were observed via our two fate mapping strategies. Furthermore, an exclusion strategy suggested that the LGE/CGE were not responsible for generating cortical OPCs. In addition, according to our study of <italic>Olig2</italic>-NCKO mice, MGE/AEP seems to be the predominant ventral source of cortical OPCs during neocortical development. Overall, these findings provide strong evidence that the contribution of the cortical OPCs from the LGE/CGE is minimal in the mouse brain.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Why LGE is not the main OPC pool for the cortex during development</title><p>OLs are specialized cells of the CNS that produce myelin, a multilayered membrane that spirally enwraps axons and facilitates rapid nerve conduction. Recent studies have shown that cortical OLs are heterogeneous, as there are transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of cortical OLs during development and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marques et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Floriddia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marques et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Falcão et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, OLs are derived from distinct OPC pools, which acquire different abilities to respond to demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kessaris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crawford et al., 2016</xref>). In the spinal cord, the developmental origin of OLs has been hotly debated for many years. Some groups believed that OLs originate only from the ventral neural tube, whereas others tend to support multiple origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richardson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spassky et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fogarty et al., 2005</xref>). One pioneering study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kessaris et al., 2006</xref>) purported that, in the forebrain, cortical OLs derive from multiple origins, such as the MGE, LGE, and cortex.</p><p>In general, the specification of OLs depends on SHH protein released from the notochord and floor plate, as <italic>Shh</italic> expression is both necessary and sufficient for OL generation in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Orentas et al., 1999</xref>). As in the spinal cord, OL generation in the cortex is also dependent on the <italic>Shh</italic> signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2000</xref>). During MGE development, <italic>Nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>Six3</italic> promote SHH secretion. Furthermore, the early-born neurons of the MGE also secrete SHH protein before E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flandin et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the high levels of SHH in the MGE contribute to the generation of OPCs from RGCs. In contrast, <italic>Shh</italic> signaling pathway activity is very weak in the LGE at the early stage (before E14.5). As the level of SHH gradually increases in the LGE, this results in a shift from neurogenesis to gliogenesis after E15.5, and the large number of the striatal neurons may block the migration of OPCs into the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Su et al., 2022</xref>). In summary, the process of cortical OL generation can be summarized as follows: First, the high level of SHH in the MGE allows for the production of a small population of cortical OPCs around E12.5. Subsequently, multipotent intermediate progenitors begin to express DLX transcription factors resulting in ending the generation of OPCs in the MGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Silbereis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Price et al., 2022</xref>). Second, RGCs undergo a gradual transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis around E15.5, driven by the progressive elevation of SHH levels in the LGE. However, the LGE had already generated a substantial number of neurons during this period, blocking the migration of OPCs into the cortex. Finally, with the gradual increase of SHH concentration, cortical RGCs begin to cease neurogenesis and shift toward gliogenesis after E16.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Winkler et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the generation of cortical OPCs is regulated by both precise temporal and spatial patterning, which is strictly dependent on the local environment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cortical-derived OLs/OPCs make up the majority of the cortical OLs/OPCs in the adult brain</title><p>During the early development of the cortex, both pallium and subpallium can generate cortical OPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kessaris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Tilborg et al., 2018</xref>).

It appears that OPCs generated later in development may possess a competitive advantage over their earlier-generated counterparts. Indeed, human glial progenitor cells engrafted neonatally or transplanted into the adult mouse brain can effectively disperse throughout the forebrain, differentiate into mature OLs, and remyelinate the demyelinated adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Windrem et al., 2020</xref>).

Thus, OLs may function as a homogeneous population in the adult forebrain. In fact, the number of LGE/CGE-derived cortical OPCs may also gradually decrease in the adult brain, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2021</xref>. However, Lui et al. did not analyze LGE-derived and MGE-derived OPCs separately. Therefore, they did not exclude the possibility that the LGE/CGE does not generate cortical OPCs. In summary, cortical OPCs/OLs comprise MGE-derived and cortical RGC-derived OPCs/OLs during the neonatal stage. In contrast, cortical-derived OPCs/OLs make up the majority of the cortical OPCs/OLs in the adult cortex. Recently, another study showed that ventral-derived OLs contribution to cortex is minimal.</p><p>Our study provides strong evidence that the contribution of the LGE to cortical OPCs is minimal during forebrain development.

Five electrical pulses (duration: 50 ms) were applied at 42 V across the uterine wall with a 950 ms interval between pulses. Electroporation was performed using a pair of 5 mm platinum electrodes (BTX, Tweezertrode 45-0488, Harvard Apparatus) connected to an electroporator (BTX, ECM830).

The paper is interesting to myelin biologists, the methods used are appropriate and, in general, the study is well-executed, thorough, and persuasive, but not 100% convincing.</p><p>Strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations:</p><p>The first evidence presented that the LGE does not generate OLs for the cortex is that there are no OL precursors 'streaming' from the LGE during embryogenesis, unlike the MGE (Figure 1A). This in itself is not strong evidence, as they might be more dispersed. In fact, in the images shown, there is no obvious 'streaming' from the MGE either. Note that in Figure 1 there is no reference to the star that is shown in the figure.</p><p>The authors then electroporate a reporter into the LGE at E13.5 and examine the fate of the electroporated cells (Figures 1C-E). They find that electroporated cells became neurons in the striatum and in the cortex but no OLs for the cortex. There are two issues with this: first, there is no quantification, which means there might indeed be a small contribution from the LGE that is not immediately obvious from snapshot images. Second, it is unexpected to find labelled neurons in the cortex at all since the LGE does not normally generate neurons for the cortex! Electroporations are quite crude experiments as targeting is imprecise and variable and not always discernible at later stages. For example, in Figure 1D, one can see tdTOM+ cells near the AEP, as well as the striatum. Hence, IUE cannot on its own be taken as proof that there is no contribution of the LGE to the cortical OL population.</p><p>The authors then use an alternative fate-mapping approach, again with E13.5 electroporations (Figure 2). They find only a few GFP+ cells in the cortex at E18 (Figures 2C-D) and P10 (Figure 2E) and these are mainly neurons, not OL lineage cells. Again, there is no quantification.</p><p>Figure 3 is more convincing, but the experiments are incomplete. Here the authors generate triple-transgenic mice expressing Cre in the cortex (Emx1-Cre) and the MGE (Nkx2.1-Cre) as well as a strong nuclear reporter (H2B-GFP). They find that at P0 and P10, 97-98% of OL-lineage cells (SOX10+ or PDGFRA+) in the cortex are labelled with GFP (Figure 3). This is a more convincing argument that the LGE/CGE might not contribute significant numbers of OL lineage cells to the cortex, in contrast to the Kessaris et at. (2006) paper, which showed that Gsh2-Cre mice label ~50% of SOX10+ve cells in the motor cortex at P10. The authors of the present paper suggest that the discrepancy between their study and that of Kessaris et al. (2006) is based on the authors' previous observation (Zhang et al 2020) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.03.027">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.03.027</ext-link>) that GSH2 is expressed in intermediate precursors of the cortex from E18 onwards. If correct, then Kessaris et al. might have mistakenly attributed Gsh2-Cre+ lineages to the LGE/CGE when they were in fact intrinsic to the cortex. However, the evidence from Zhang et al 2020 that GSH2 is expressed by cortical intermediate precursors seems to rest solely on their location within the developing cortex; a more convincing demonstration would be to show that the GSH2+ putative cortical precursors co-label for EMX1 (by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization), or that they co-label with a reporter in Emx1-driven reporter mice. This demonstration should be simple for the authors as they have all the necessary reagents to hand. Without these additional data, the assertion that GSX2+ve cells in the cortex are derived from the cortical VZ relies partly on an act of faith on the part of the reader.</p><p>Note that Tripathi et al. (2011, &quot;Dorsally- and ventrally-derived oligodendrocytes have similar electrical properties but myelinate preferred tracts.&quot; J. Neurosci. 31, 6809-6819) found that the Gsh-Cre+ OL lineage contributed only ~20% of OLs to the mature cortex, not ~50% as reported by Kessaris et al. (2006). If it is correct that these Gsh2-derived OLs are from the cortical anlagen as the current paper claims, then it would raise the possibility that the ventricular precursors of GSH2+ intermediate progenitors are not uniformly distributed through the cortical VZ but are perhaps localized to some part of it. Then the contribution of Gsh2-derived OLs to the cortical population could depend on precisely where one looks relative to that localized source. It would be a nice addition to the current manuscript if the authors could explore the distribution of their GSH2+ intermediate precursors throughout the developing cortex. In any case, Tripathi et al. (2011) should be cited.</p><p>Finally, the authors deleted Olig2 in the MGE and found a dramatic reduction of PDGFRA+ and SOX10+ cells in the cortex at E14 and E16 (Figure 4A-F). This further supports their conclusion that, at least at E16, there is no significant contribution of OLs from ventral sources other than the MGE/AEP. This does not exclude the possibility that the LGE/CGE generates OLs for the cortex at later stages. Hence, on its own, this is not completely convincing evidence that the LGE generates no OL lineage cells for the cortex.</p><p>Comments on the latest version:</p><p>The revised manuscript has addressed the issues we raised previously. The addition of the new Figure 3 supplement 1A-C demonstrating that Gsx2+ve cells in the cortex are generated from Emx1-Cre precursors is convincing, although there is nothing to prove that the GFP+, Gsh2+ double-labelled nuclei are oligodendrocyte lineage and not, for example, astrocytes. It would be helpful to include a Gsh2, Olig2 (or Gsh2, Sox10) double-label image to prove this point. Also, to make the figure more clear, the authors should also show a small area at high magnification, splitting the green and red channels so that the reader can see more clearly that all the red cells are also green.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94317.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Traditional thinking has been that cortical oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) arise in the development of the brain from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), lateral/caudal ganglionic eminence (LGE/CGE), and cortical radial glial cells (RGCs). Indeed a landmark study demonstrated some time ago that cortical OPCs are generated in three waves, starting with a ventral wave derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) or the anterior entopeduncular area (AEP) at embryonic day E12.5 (Nkx2.1+ lineage), followed by a second wave of cortical OLs derived from the lateral/caudal ganglionic eminences (LGE/CGE) at E15.5 (Gsx2+/Nkx2.1- lineage), and then a final wave occurring at P0, when OPCs originate from cortical glial progenitor cells (Emx1+ lineage). However, the authors challenge the idea in this paper that cortical progenitors are produced from the LGE. They have found previously that cortical glial progenitor cells were also found to express Gsx2, suggesting this may not have been the best marker for LGE-derived OPCs. They have used fate mapping experiments and lineage analyses to suggest that cortical OPCs do not derive from the LGE.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The data is high quality and very well presented, and experiments are thoughtful and elegant to address the questions being raised.</p><p>(2) The authors use two elegant approaches to lineage trace LGE derived cells, namely fate mapping of LGE-derived OPCs by combining IUE (intrauterine electroporation) with a Cre recombinase-dependent IS reporter, and Lineage tracing of LGE-derived OPCs by combining IUE with the PiggyBac transposon system. Both approaches show convincingly that labelled LGE-derived cells that enter the cortex do not express OPC markers, but that those co-labelling with oligodendrocyte markers remain in the striatum.</p><p>(3) The authors then use further approaches to confirm their findings. Firstly they lineage trace Emx1-Cre; Nkx2.1-Cre; H2B-GFP mice. Emx1-Cre is expressed in cortical RGCs and Nkx2.1-Cre is specifically expressed in MGE/AEP RGCs. They find that close to 98% of OPCs in the cortex co-label with GFP at later times, suggesting the contribution of OPCs from LGE is minimal.</p><p>(4) They use one further approach to strengthen the findings yet further. They cross Nkx2.1-Cre mice with Olig2 F/+ mice to eliminate Olig2 expression in the SVZ/VZ of the MGE/AEP (Figures 4A-B). The generation of MGE/AEP-derived OPCs is inhibited in these Olig2-NCKO conditional mice. They find that the number of cortical progenitors at E16.5 is reduced 10-fold in these mice, suggesting that LGE contribution to cortical OPCs is minimal.</p><p>Impact of Study:</p><p>The authors show elegantly and convincingly that the contribution of the LGE to the pool of cortical OPCs is minimal. The title should perhaps be that the LGE contribution is minimal rather than no contribution at all, as they are not able to rule out some small contribution from the LGE. These findings challenge the traditional belief that the LGE contributes to the pool of cortical OPCs. The authors do show that the LGE does produce OPCs, but that they tend to remain in the striatum rather than migrate into the cortex. It is interesting to wonder why their migration patterns may be different from the MGE-derived OPCs which migrate to the cortex. The functional significance of these different sources of OPCs for adult cortex in homeostatic or disease states remains unclear though.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94317.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jialin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Feihong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Yu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Ziwu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Dashi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Yangpu Hospital of Tongji University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Zhengang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Jiangang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhuangzhi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors re-examine the developmental origin of cortical oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells using a combination of strategies, focussing on the question of whether the LGE generates cortical OL cells. The paper is interesting to myelin biologists, the methods used are appropriate and, in general, the study is well-executed, thorough, and persuasive, but not 100% convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for approving our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations:</p><p>The first evidence presented that the LGE does not generate OLs for the cortex is that there are no OL precursors 'streaming' from the LGE during embryogenesis, unlike the MGE (Figure 1A). This in itself is not strong evidence, as they might be more dispersed. In fact, in the images shown, there is no obvious 'streaming' from the MGE either. Note that in Figure 1 there is no reference to the star that is shown in the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree with you. While OPC migration stream is not strong evidence to support that the LGE does not generate OPCs for the cortex, when considering our additional evidence, the absence of obvious 'streaming' from LGE to cortex provided supplementary support for this conclusion. Finally, we have removed the star in the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors then electroporate a reporter into the LGE at E13.5 and examine the fate of the electroporated cells (Figures 1C-E). They find that electroporated cells became neurons in the striatum and in the cortex but no OLs for the cortex. There are two issues with this: first, there is no quantification, which means there might indeed be a small contribution from the LGE that is not immediately obvious from snapshot images. Second, it is unexpected to find labelled neurons in the cortex at all since the LGE does not normally generate neurons for the cortex. Electroporations are quite crude experiments as targeting is imprecise and variable and not always discernible at later stages. For example, in Figure 1D, one can see tdTOM+ cells near the AEP, as well as the striatum. Hence, IUE cannot on its own be taken as proof that there is no contribution of the LGE to the cortical OL population.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your constructive suggestions.</p><p>(1) Following the reviewer's suggestion, we have added these statistics, please see Figure 1F.</p><p>(2) The reviewer raised a good point. We occasionally found a very small number of electroporated cells in the MGE/AEP VZ in our IUE system. Therefore, we can identify these electroporated cells in the cortex, most of them expressed the neuronal marker NeuN. We suspect these are MGE-derived cortical interneurons. It's worth noting that these electroporated cells (MGE-derived) are not glia cells. The probable reason may be that MGE/AEP generate cortical OPCs mainly before E13.5 (in this study we performed IUE at E13.5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors then use an alternative fate-mapping approach, again with E13.5 electroporations (Figure 2). They find only a few GFP+ cells in the cortex at E18 (Figures 2C-D) and P10 (Figure 2E) and these are mainly neurons, not OL lineage cells. Again, there is no quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your suggestions. Actually, in this fate-mapping approach, the electroporated cells in the cortex is very few. We analyzed four mice, and found that all GFP positive cells (139 GFP+) did not express OLIG2, SOX10 and PDGFRA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 is more convincing, but the experiments are incomplete. Here the authors generate triple-transgenic mice expressing Cre in the cortex (Emx1-Cre) and the MGE (Nkx2.1-Cre) as well as a strong nuclear reporter (H2B-GFP). They find that at P0 and P10, 97-98% of OL-lineage cells (SOX10+ or PDGFRA+) in the cortex are labelled with GFP (Figure 3). This is a more convincing argument that the LGE/CGE might not contribute significant numbers of OL lineage cells to the cortex, in contrast to the Kessaris et at. (2006) paper, which showed that Gsh2-Cre mice label ~50% of SOX10+ve cells in the motor cortex at P10. The authors of the present paper suggest that the discrepancy between their study and that of Kessaris et al. (2006) is based on the authors' previous observation (Zhang et al 2020) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.03.027">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.03.027</ext-link>) that GSH2 is expressed in intermediate precursors of the cortex from E18 onwards.

(2006) revealed that roughly 50% of cortical oligodendrocytes (OLs) originate from the Gsx2 lineage (LGE/CGE-derived). In contrast, Tripathi et al. (2011) observed that Gsx2-derived OLs contribute only around 20% to the corpus callosum (CC). To investigate the reasons behind these disparate findings, we conducted three experiments. Firstly, using Emx1Cre; RosaH2B-GFP mice, we found that approximately 89% of lateral CC (LCC) OLs originate from the Emx1 lineage, with only around 11% derived from the ventral source (refer to Author response image 1A and B below). Secondly, employing Nkx2-1Cre; RosaH2B-GFP mice, we determined that approximately 11% of LCC OLs originate from the Nkx2.1 lineage (refer to pictures C and D below). Finally, we found that approximately 98.3% of lateral LCC OLs originate from both Emx1 and Nkx2.1 lineages, with only around 1.7% possibly derived from the LGE (see Author response image 1E and F below). Taken together, our results indicate that approximately 89% of LCC OLs originate from the Emx1 lineage, while 11% of LCC OLs are derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE).</p><p>It is worth noting that OLs from Emx1 and Nkx2.1 lineages were equally distributed in the medial CC (mCC) (see Author response image 1G below). This finding suggests that MGE-derived OLs exhibit spatial heterogeneity in their distribution within the CC. These results provide evidence that the contribution of the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) and caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) to CC OLs is minimal.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94317-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors deleted Olig2 in the MGE and found a dramatic reduction of PDGFRA+ and SOX10+ cells in the cortex at E14 and E16 (Figure 4A-F).

In the current manuscript, the authors do not show these regions, or the LGE and CGE, in their images. It is essential to show PDGFRA immunolabelling at the cortico-striatal boundary and also in the LGE and CGE at E16.5 in control and Olig2 mutant mice. It is also necessary to extend this analysis to E18.5, perhaps showing PDGFRA + cells streaming from the cortical VZ/SVZ.</p></disp-quote><p>There are three reasons why we didn't analyze <italic>Olig2</italic>-NCKO mice after E16.5. 1.Frankly, the expression of Nkx2.1Cre is lower within the dorsal-most region of the MGE than other Nkx2.1-expressing regions. Even at E15.5, we can still find a small number of OPCs in the lateral cortex. We guess these OPCs are derived from dMGE. 2. Considering the possibility of incomplete recombination in Olig2 gene locus, we guess OPCs (Olig2+) are derived from MGE. In fact, we found a few OPCs in the MGE/AEP in the <italic>Olig2</italic>-NCKO mice (Figure 4F). 3. The recent study (bioRxiv preprint doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.23.576886">https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.23.576886</ext-link>) showed that the contribution of LGE/CGE to cortical OPCs is minimal. Taken together, our results provide additional evidence supporting the limited contribution of the LGE/CGE to cortical OPCs (OLs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Cite Tripathi et al.
