While their overall design reflects the hierarchical structure of the ventral (‘form-processing’) visual stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hubel and Wiesel, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">LeCun et al., 2015</xref>), the visual selectivity (i.e., tuning) of single units within the network are not constrained to match neurobiology. Rather, single-unit properties are determined by a performance-based learning algorithm that operates iteratively across many pre-classified training images, tuning the parameters of the network to decrease the error between the network output and the target classification. Nevertheless, first-layer units in these CNNs, following training, often show selectivity for orientation and spatial frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>) like neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). Attempts to visualize features encoded by single units deeper in such networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeiler and Fergus, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mahendran and Vedaldi, 2014</xref>) show that selectivity becomes increasingly complex and categorical, similar to the progression along the ventral stream. Solidifying this idea, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Güçlü and van Gerven, 2015</xref> found a corresponding hierarchy of visual features between BOLD signals in the human ventral stream and layers within a CNN. This raises the tentative but exciting possibility that units deeper in the network may approximate tuning observed at mid-level stages of the ventral stream, for example area V4. This is not unreasonable given that artificial networks that perform better at image classification also have population-level representations closer to those in area IT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kriegeskorte, 2015</xref>). V4 is a primary input to IT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>), yet there has been no systematic examination of whether specific form-selective properties found in V4 emerge within a CNN.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38242.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The 96 kernels (11 × 11 pixels, by three color channels) of the 1 st layer, Conv1, of the AlexNet model tested here.</title><p>Like many V1 receptive fields, many of these kernels are band-limited in spatial frequency and orientation.

In particular, many V4 neurons are selective for boundary curvature, ranging from concave to sharply convex, at particular angular positions around the center of an object. This angular position and curvature (APC) tuning may be important for supporting entire object representations deeper in the ventral stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pasupathy and Connor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murphy and Finkel, 2007</xref>), but it remains uncertain how it arises or is used. Finding APC-like tuning in the middle of an artificial network could help to relate mid-level visual physiology to pressures on visual representation applied by image statistics at the front end and by categorization performance downstream. It could also relate to the recent observation that human perception of shape similarity correlates with response similarity in CNNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kubilius et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We take an approach to characterizing single units in an artificial deep network that we refer to as ‘artiphysiology’ because it closely mirrors how an electrophysiologist approaches the characterization of single neurons in the brain. In particular, we presented the original 362 shape stimuli used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pasupathy and Connor, 2001</xref> to AlexNet, a CNN that was the first of its class to make large gains on general object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>) and that continues to be well-studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeiler and Fergus, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yosinski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lenc and Vedaldi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donahue et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szegedy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Güçlü and van Gerven, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flachot and Gegenfurtner, 2018</xref>). Making direct comparisons between CNN units and V4 neurons using V4 data from two previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pasupathy and Connor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El-Shamayleh and Pasupathy, 2016</xref>), we found that many units in AlexNet would be indistinguishable from good examples of boundary-curvature-tuned V4 neurons. We applied a CNN visualization technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeiler and Fergus, 2013</xref>) to examine whether natural image features that best drive such APC-like units are consistent with the notion of selectivity for curvature of object boundaries. We identify specific V4-like units so that other researchers may utilize them for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>AlexNet contains over 1.5 million units organized in eight major layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), but its convolutional architecture means that the vast majority of those units are spatially offset copies of each other. For example, in the first convolutional layer, Conv1, there are only 96 distinct kernels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), but they are repeated everywhere on a 55 × 55 grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, for the convolutional layers, Conv1 to Conv5, it suffices to study the selectivity of only those units at the spatial center of each layer. These units, plus all units in the subsequent fully-connected layers comprise the 22,096 unique units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) that we analyzed.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38242.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Architecture of the Caffe AlexNet CNN.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A one-dimensional scale view of the fan-in and spatial resolution of units for all 21 sublayers, aligned to their names listed in column (<bold>C</bold>). The color-filled triangles in convolutional (Conv) layers indicate the fan-in to convolutional units, gray triangles indicate the fan-in to max pooling units, and circles (or ovals) indicate the spatial positions of units along the horizontal dimension. For the Conv layers and their sublayers, each circle in the diagram represents the number of unique units listed in column (<bold>D</bold>). For example, for each orange circle/oval in the four sublayers associated with Conv1, there are 96 different units in the model (the Conv1 kernels are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The 227 pixel wide input image (top, yellow), is subsampled at the Conv1 sublayer (orange; ‘stride 4’ indicates that units occur only every four pixels) and again at each pooling sublayer (‘stride 2’), until the spatial resolution is reduced to a 6 × 6 grid at the transition from Pool5 to FC6. The pyramid of support converging to the central unit in Conv5 (dark blue triangle) is indicated by triangles and line segments starting from Conv1. Each unit in layers FC6, FC7 and FC8 (shades of green; not all units are shown) receives inputs from all units in the previous layer (there is no spatial dimension in the FC layers, units are depicted in a line only for convenience). Green triangles indicate the full fan-in to three example units in each FC layer.

Names in bold correspond to the eight major layers, each of which begins with a linear kernel (colorful triangles in (<bold>A</bold>)).

(<bold>E</bold>) The width and height of the spatial (convolutional) grid at each sublayer, or ‘1’ for the FC layers. The total number of units in each sublayer can be computed by multiplying the number of unique kernels (<bold>D</bold>) by the number of spatial positions (<bold>E</bold>). (<bold>F</bold>) The kernel size corresponds to the number of weights learned for each unique linear kernel. Pooling layers have 3 × 3 spatial kernels but have no weights—the maximum is taken over the raw inputs. The Conv2 kernels are only 48 deep because half of the Conv2 units take inputs from the first 48 feature dimensions in Conv1, whereas the other half take inputs from the last 48 Conv1 features; inputs are similarly grouped in Conv4 and Conv5 (see Krizhevsky et al.'s <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The bottom row provides totals. In addition to the weights associated with each kernel, there is also one bias value per kernel (not shown), which adds 10,568 free parameters to the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>60.9 million unique weights.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-38242-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><sec id="s2-1"><title>Responses of CNN units to simple shapes</title><p>We first establish that the simple visual stimuli used in V4 electrophysiology experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) do in fact drive units within the CNN, which was trained on a substantially different set of inputs: natural photographic images from the ImageNet database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2009</xref>). Across the convolutional layers and their sublayers, we found that our shape stimuli typically evoked a range of responses that was on average similar to, or larger than, the range driven by ImageNet images (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, Conv1, compare red to dark blue). The ranges for shapes and images became more similar following normalization layers (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, Norm1). In contrast, in the subsequent fully-connected layers, the natural images drove a larger range of responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, FC6, dark blue) than did shapes (red line), and from FC6 onwards the range of responses to shapes was about 1/2 to 1/3 of that for images. The wider dynamic range for images in later layers may reflect the sensitivity of deeper units to category-relevant conjunctions of image statistics that are absent in our simple shape stimuli. These results were robust to changes in stimulus intensity and size (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, legend); therefore, we settled on a standard size of 32 pixels so that stimuli fit within all RFs from Conv2 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) with room to spare for translation invariance tests (see Materials and methods).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38242.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The angular position and curvature (APC) model and associated stimuli.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The set of 51 simple closed shapes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pasupathy and Connor, 2001</xref>.

Each shape was shown at up to eight rotations as dictated by rotational symmetry, e.g., the small and large circles (upper left) were only shown at one rotation.

Natural images (n = 362, to match the number of shape stimuli) were pulled randomly from the ImageNet 2012 competition validation set.

The number of points in each distribution is given by the number of stimuli (362) times the number of unique units in the layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The vertical axis is log scaled as most distributions have a very high peak at 0. For Conv1, standard shapes drove a wider overall dynamic range than did images because of the high intensity edges that aligned with parts of the linear kernels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This was not the case for larger shapes because they often over-filled the small Conv1 kernels. For Relu1, negative responses are removed by rectification after a bias is added. At Conv2, there is little difference between the four stimulus sets on the positive side of the distribution. This changes from FC6 forward, where natural images drive a wider range of responses.

There is a clear but modest trend for the cumulative distribution functions to shift rightward for higher layers (orange lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), indicating that deeper layer units fit better on average to the APC model. The first CNN layer, Conv1 (black line) stands apart as having a far leftward-shifted r-value distribution, but this occurs simply because most of the stimuli overfill the small Conv1 RFs. Compared to V4 neurons studied with the same shape set (red line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), the median r-values (corresponding to 0.5 on the vertical axis) for layers Conv2 to FC8 were somewhat higher than that for V4, but the V4 and CNN curves matched closely at the upper range, with the best V4 unit having a higher APC r-value than any CNN unit.</p><p>One factor that could influence our CNN to V4 comparison is that CNN responses are noise-free, whereas V4 responses have substantial trial-to-trial variability. We extended the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haefner et al. (2009)</xref> to remove the bias that variability introduces into the correlation coefficient (see Materials and methods). The distribution of the corrected estimates of the r-values across the V4 population (pink line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) has a higher median than that for any of the CNN layers. This suggests that, had it been possible to record many more stimulus repeats to eliminate most of the noise in the V4 data, then one would find that the V4 population somewhat out-performs even the deep layers in AlexNet in fitting the APC model. Overall, regardless of whether we consider the raw or corrected V4 r-values, we would still conclude that the CNN contains units that cover the vast majority of the range of APC r-values found in V4 when tested with the same stimuli.</p><p>To determine whether the goodness of fit to the APC model was a result of the network architecture alone or if training on the object categorization task played a role, we fit the model to units in an untrained network in which weights were assigned random initial values (see Materials and methods) and found that only <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>14% had APC r-values above 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, blue trace) and none reached the upper range of r-values observed in the trained CNN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, black line, aggregate of all layers) or in V4 (red line). This suggests that training is important for achieving an APC r-value distribution consistent with V4.</p><p>To control for over fitting, we re-fit the APC model to all CNN units after shuffling the responses of each unit across the 362 shapes.

Thus, the APC model largely reflects specific patterns of responses of the units to the shapes, and not an ability of the model to fit any random or noisy set of responses (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pasupathy and Connor, 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Translation Invariance</title><p>To have V4-like boundary curvature tuning, a CNN unit must not only fit the APC model well for stimuli centered in the RF, but must maintain that selectivity when stimuli are placed elsewhere in the RF, that is it must show translation invariance like that found in V4 for our stimulus set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pasupathy and Connor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El-Shamayleh and Pasupathy, 2016</xref>).

This can be visualized across the RF using the position-correlation function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, red), which plots response correlation as a function of distance from a reference position (e.g., RF center). For this V4 neuron, the RF profile, measured by the mean response across all stimuli at each position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, green; see Materials and methods), falls off faster than the position-correlation function, consistent with a high degree of translation invariance.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38242.008</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Translation invariance as a function of position across the RF.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) For an example neuron from the V4 study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El-Shamayleh and Pasupathy (2016)</xref>, the responses to stimuli shifted away from the RF center by 1/6 of the estimated RF size are plotted against those placed in the RF center.

The region over which TI is measured, where all stimuli are wholly within the CRF (see Materials and methods), is within dotted lines bookending horizontal black bar. The unit is less translation invariant because it continues to have a large response even when correlation drops quickly from center. This is reflected in the lower TI score of 0.7.

In particular, when stimuli were shown 13 pixels to the left of center (black arrow) the aggregate firing rate (see Materials and methods) was 87% of maximum, but the correlation was near zero. The largely uncorrelated selectivity at two points within the RF indicates low translation invariance. Thus, despite its high APC r-value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), its low translation invariance diminishes it as a good model for V4 boundary contour tuning. This behavior was typical in layer Conv2, as demonstrated by the position-correlation function averaged across all units in the layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Specifically, the correlation (red) falls off rapidly compared to the RF profile (green) even for small displacements of the stimulus set.</p><p>For deeper layers, RFs tend to widen and translation invariance increases. This is exemplified by unit 369 in the fourth convolutional layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) and the Conv4 layer average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>): on average the correlation (red) more closely follows the RF profile (green) and does not drop to zero near the middle of the RF. In the deepest layers, exemplified by the FC7 unit from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, the RFs become very broad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, green) and there is very little fall-off in correlation (red) even for shifts larger than the stimulus size. This is true for the layer average as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). These plots show that shape selectivity becomes more translation invariant relative to RF size, and not just in terms of absolute distance, as signals progress to deeper layers.</p><p>To quantify translation invariance for each unit with a single number, we defined a metric, TI, based on the normalized average covariance of the response matrix across positions (see Materials and methods). The values of this metric, which would be one for perfect (and zero for no) correlation across positions, are shown for the example CNN units in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,G and I</xref>. The trend for increasing TI with layer depth seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (panels F, H and J) is borne out in the cumulative distributions of TI broken down by CNN layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Only the deepest four layers (Conv5 to FC8) had median TI values that approximated or exceeded that of our V4 population. Conv1 is excluded because its RFs are far too small to fully contain our stimuli at multiple positions (see Materials and methods).

High values of the TI metric are meant to indicate which units are generally translation invariant, thus we examined whether a high score for shifts along one direction were associated with a similar score along the orthogonal direction. (<bold>A</bold>) TI measured for vertical shifts is plotted against TI for horizontal shifts for all CNN units. Points with high TI values are more tightly clustered near the line of equality than are points with lower TI values, indicating that a high TI value measured for horizontal shifts tends to imply a high value for vertical shifts (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.79</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). We examined this relationship separately for each layer and found that early layers, for example Conv2 (<bold>B</bold>) contribute most of the highly scattered, low-TI points. As TI improves with deeper layers, the points tend to cluster more tightly on the line of equality and move toward the upper right, as shown for layers Conv5 (<bold>C</bold>), FC7 (<bold>D</bold>) and FC8 (<bold>E</bold>). Interestingly, high TI values in earlier layers are less consistent across axes of translation than in later layers. Such inconsistency is an indication that, in early layers, the selectivity can vary along one axis much more than it does along the other (e.g., a simple cell tuned for horizontal orientation has luminance selectivity that varies more strongly in the vertical dimension than in the horizontal dimension). The consistency of TI values across axes in later layers suggests that their selectivity is spatially more homogeneous. Overall, the high correlation between TI along the x and y axes for units in all but the earliest layers suggests that measuring TI in the x-direction can often be a useful shortcut for approximating the degree of translation invariance without adding a second dimension to the stimulus set. Overall, we found that our conclusions did not vary whether we measure TI in x, in y, or in both dimensions: units in the early CNN layers had TI values lower on average than those found in V4, whereas units in the deeper layers had TI values larger on average than those in V4.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-38242-fig7-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>An intuitive motivation for CNN architecture, chiefly convolution (repetition of linear filtering at translated positions) and max pooling, is the desire to achieve a translation invariant representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukushima, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rumelhart et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Serre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cadieu et al., 2007</xref>). This might lead to the idea that responses of units within these nets are translation invariant by design, but the observation that strong translation invariance only arises in later layers begins to deflate this notion. Furthermore, we computed TI for the same units and stimuli but in the untrained network. We found that the degradation of TI in an untrained network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) was even more dramatic than the degradation of APC tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

Although only a few FC7 units approach the hypothetical best V4 point, many units are better than the average V4 neuron (red lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast, most units from Conv2 are much further from ideal V4 behavior, but they span a large range, indicating that even in the second convolutional layer, some units have ended up, after training, having high TI and high APC r-values.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38242.011</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary of the similarity of CNN units to V4 neurons in terms of translation invariance (TI) and fit to the APC model.</title><p>For 100 randomly selected CNN units from Conv2 (brown) and FC7 (orange), APC r-value is plotted against TI.

We then used a visualization technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeiler and Fergus, 2013</xref>) to project back ('deconvolve’) from the unit onto each input image through the connections that most strongly contributed to the response, thereby revealing the regions and features supporting the response. We examined the ten most APC-like units in each of seven layers from Conv2 to FC8. Below we describe major qualitative observations as a function of layer depth.</p><p>Visualizing the ten most APC-like units in Conv2 revealed selectivity for orientation, conjunctions thereof, or other textures. For example, unit Conv2-113 (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8E</xref>), was best driven by lines at a particular orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) and most suppressed by oriented texture running roughly orthogonal to the preferred. This explains why this unit responded well only to shapes that have long contours extending to a point at the upper left, and poorly to shapes having a broad convexity or concavity to the upper left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Another Conv2 example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) was driven best by the conjunction of a vertical that bends to the upper left and a horizontal near the top of the RF that meet at a point in the upper left. Examining the input images reveals that textures and lines (e.g., the bedspread and rocking chair cushion) are as good at driving the unit as are boundaries of objects. A third unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) preferred conjunctions of orientations and was suppressed by lines running orthogonal to the preferred vertical orientation. The preferred pattern was usually not an object boundary, but could surround negative space or be surface texture. These observations, taken together with the poor translation invariance of Conv2 relative to deeper layers, suggest that units at this early stage are not coding boundary conformation in an object-centered way, but that any pattern matching the preferred features of the unit, regardless of its position with respect to an object, will drive these units well.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38242.012</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Visualization of APC-like units in layer Conv2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) For unit Conv2-113, the five most excitatory image patches are indicated by red squares superimposed in the raw images (top row, left side, from left to right).

Unit Conv3-156 was driven best by the broad downward border of light objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), particularly dog paws. The most suppressive features for this ‘downward-dog-paw’ unit were dark regions, often negative space, with relatively straight edges. The deconvolved features tended to emphasize the lower portion of the object border. A similar example, Conv3-020, had a preference for the upper border of bright forms (e.g., flames; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) and was suppressed by the upper border of dark forms (often dark hair on heads). This unit was representative of a tendency for selectivity for bright regions with broad convexities (e.g., Conv4-171, not shown). We assume that more dark-preferring units would have been found had our stimuli been presented as black-on-white. These trends continued with greater category specificity in Conv5. For example, Conv5-161 was driven best by the rounded, convex tops of white dog heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>), including some contribution from the eyes, and was most suppressed by human faces below the eyebrows. Unit Conv5-144 was best driven by the upward facing points of the tops of objects, particularly wolf ears and steeples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). This ‘wolf-ear-steeple’ unit was most suppressed by rounded forms, and may be important for distinguishing between the many dog categories with and without pointed ears. In addition to units like these, which appeared to be selective for portions of boundaries, there were several units that appeared to detect entire circles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), and thus fit well to an APC model with specificity for curvature but broadly accepting of any angular position.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38242.013</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Visualization of APC-like units in layers Conv3 to Conv5.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Visualization for unit Conv3-156, using the same format as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.

For example, unit FC6-3030 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>) responded best to hourglasses, but deconvolution did not highlight a particular critical feature. The shape stimuli driving the highest and lowest five responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>, bottom row) suggest that a cusp (convexity) facing upward is a critical feature, consistent with the APC model fit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The most suppressive natural images (not shown) were more diverse than those for the Conv layers, and thus provided little direct insight. Broadly, many of the top ten APC-like units in the FC layers fell into two categories: those preferring images with rounded borders facing approximately upwards (we refer to these as the ‘balls’ group) and those associated with a concavity between sharp convexities, also facing approximately upwards (the ‘wolf-ears’ group). For example, FC7-3192 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>) responded best to images of round objects (e.g., golf balls) and to shapes having rounded tops. FC7-3591 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>), which was the most APC-like unit by our joint TI-APC index (orange star in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), responded best to starfish and rabbit-like ears pointing up. Shapes with a convexity at 112° drove the unit most strongly, whereas shapes with rounded tops and overall vertical orientation yielded the most negative responses. FC7-3639 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D</xref>) is an example of a wolf-ears unit, and its preferred shapes include those with a convexity pointing upwards flanked by one or two sharp points. In FC8, where there is a one-to-one mapping from units onto the 1000 trained categories, the top ten APC units were evenly split between the wolf-ears group (categories: kit fox, gray fox, impala, red wolf and red fox) and the balls group (categories: ping-pong balls, golf balls, bathing caps, car mirrors and rugby balls). For example, unit FC8-271 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>) corresponds to the red wolf category and units FC8-433 and FC8-722 correspond to the bathing cap and ping-pong ball categories, respectively.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38242.015</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Visualization of APC-like units in the FC layers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) For unit FC6-3030, the top five images from the test set are shown above their deconvolved feature maps.

We hypothesized that these FC units were driven by a range of image properties that correlated well with the target category, and that shape was simply one among others such as texture and color. We examined how much better the units were driven by the best natural images compared to our best standard shapes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> shows for the top-10 APC-like units in each layer, that the best image drove responses on average about 2 times higher than did the best shape for Conv2-4, about 4–5 times higher for FC6-7 and more than 8 times higher for FC8. This is consistent with the hypothesis that shape tuned mechanisms contribute to the selectivity of these units, but are not sufficient in the absence of other image properties to drive the FC layers strongly. Nevertheless, the selectivity for simple shapes at the final layer appears to be qualitatively consistent with the category label. Notably, only two APC-like units responded better to a shape than to any natural image, but both were Conv4 units selective for bright circular regions (not shown), and the best stimulus was our large circle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, second from upper left).</p><fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38242.017</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Comparing the maximum responses driven by images to those driven by shapes for APC-like units.</title><p>For a given CNN unit, we computed the ratio of the maximum response across natural images (50,000 image test set) to the maximum response across our set of 362 shapes.

We therefore examined whether the CNN units might directly provide a better fit (than the APC model) to the responses of the V4 neurons. We used cross-validation (see Materials and methods) to put these very different models on equal footing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref> shows the cross-validated, best fit r-values for the APC model plotted against those for the CNN units. Neither model is clearly better on average: just over half (56/109) of neurons were better fit by the APC model, while just under half (53/109) were better fit by a CNN unit. Only 21 of 109 neurons had significant deviations from the line of equality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>, red) and these were evenly split: 11 better fit by the APC model and 10 by the CNN. The similar performance of the APC model and CNN could be a result of the CNN and APC model explaining the same component of variance in the data, or explaining largely separate components of the variance. To assess this, for each V4 neuron, we removed from its response the component of variance explained by its best-fit APC model. For this APC-orthogonalized V4 response, the CNN model had a median correlation to V4 of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf45"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.29</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (SD = 0.11), much lower than the APC model's <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.47</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (SD = 0.12) median . For 94/109 neurons, the APC model explained more variance than the variance uniquely explained by the CNN.

Although our simple shape stimuli were never presented to the network during training, we found that many units in the CNN were V4-like in terms of quantitative criteria for translation invariance and goodness of fit to a boundary curvature model. While units throughout AlexNet had good fits to the APC model, relatively poor translation invariance in the early layers meant that only the middle to deeper layers had substantial numbers of units that came close to matching exemplary APC-tuned V4 neurons. Based on our quantitative criteria and on the qualitative visualization of preferred features identified in natural images, we believe that APC-like units within middle layers of trained CNNs currently provide the best image-computable models for V4 boundary curvature selectivity.</p><p>Finding such matches at the single unit level is striking because the deep net and our macaques differ dramatically in their inputs, training and architecture. The animals never saw ImageNet images and probably never saw even a single instance of the overwhelming majority of the 1000 output categories of AlexNet. They did not see the forest, ocean, sky nor other important contexts for AlexNet categories, nor had AlexNet been trained on the artificial shapes used to characterize V4. While the macaque visual system may be shaped by real-time physical contact with a 3D dynamic world, AlexNet cannot and was not even given information about the locations nor boundaries of the targets to be classified within its images during categorization training. AlexNet lacks a retina with a fovea, an LGN, feedback from higher areas, dedicated excitatory and inhibitory neurons, etc., and it does not have to compute with action potentials. Our results suggest that image statistics related to object boundaries may generalize across a wide variety of inputs and may support a broad variety of tasks, thereby explaining the emergence of similar selectivity in such disparate systems.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Visualization of V4-like CNN units</title><p>By applying a CNN visualization technique to APC-like units identified by our quantitative criteria, we found that some of these CNN units appeared, qualitatively, to respond to shape boundaries in natural images whereas many others did not.

In contrast, candidate APC units in intermediate layers often responded specifically to natural images patches containing object boundaries, suggesting that these units are APC-like. In the deeper (FC) layers, units were poorly driven by our shape stimuli relative to natural images, and the preferred natural images for a given unit appeared similar along many feature dimensions (e.g., texture, background context) beyond simply the curvature of object boundaries. We speculate that these units are jointly tuned to many features and that object boundaries alone account for only part of their tuning. More work is needed to understand the FC-layer units with high APC r-values; however, we believe units in the middle layers, Conv3-5, provide good working models for understanding how APC-tuning might arise from earlier representations, how it may depend on image statistics and how it could support downstream representation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Training and translation invariance</title><p>Training dramatically increased the number of units with V4-like translation invariance, particularly in the FC layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Since the trained and untrained nets have the same architecture, the increase in TI is not simply a result of architectural features meant to facilitate translation invariance, for example max-pooling over identical, shifted filters. Thus, while CNN architecture is often associated with translation invariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukushima, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rumelhart et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Serre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cadieu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodfellow et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lenc and Vedaldi, 2014</xref>), we find that high TI for actual single unit responses is only achieved in tandem with the correct weights. We are currently undertaking an in-depth study comparing the trained and untrained networks to elucidate statistical properties of weight patterns that support translation invariance. Our preliminary analyses show that spatial homogeneity of a unit's kernel weights across features correlates with its TI score, but this correlation is weaker in higher layers. Alternative models of translation-invariant tuning in V4 include the spectral receptive field (SRF) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">David et al., 2006</xref>) and HMax model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cadieu et al., 2007</xref>). The former made use of the Fourier spectral power, which is invariant to translation of the input image, but this phase insensitivity prevents the SRF model from explaining APC-like shape tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oleskiw et al., 2014</xref>). The HMax model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cadieu et al. (2007)</xref> is a shallower network with the equivalent of two convolutional layers and does not achieve the strong translation invariance found in deeper layers here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Popovkina et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, translation invariance at the single-unit level is not a trivial result of gross CNN architecture, yet it is crucial for modeling V4 form selectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Other studies of TI in CNNs</title><p>Although other studies have examined translation invariance and related properties (rotation and reflection invariance) in artificial networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ranzato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodfellow et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lenc and Vedaldi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeiler and Fergus, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fawzi and Frossard, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Güçlü and van Gerven, 2015</xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsai and Cox, 2015</xref>), we are unaware of any study that has quantitatively documented a steady layer-to-layer increase of translation invariant form selectivity, measured for single units, across layers throughout a network like AlexNet. For example, using the invariance metric of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodfellow et al. (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shang et al. (2016)</xref>, their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) averaged over multiple types of invariance (e.g., translation, rotation) and over all units within a layer and found a weak, non-monotonic increase in invariance across layers in a CNN similar to AlexNet. Using the same metric but different stimuli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2016</xref> found no increase and no systematic trend in invariance across layers of their implementation of AlexNet (their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Güçlü and van Gerven (2015)</xref> plot an invariance metric against CNN layer, their metric is the half-width of a response profile, and thus it is unlike our TI selectivity metric. In spite of the importance of translation invariance in visual processing and deep learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">LeCun et al., 2015</xref>), there currently is no standard practice for quantifying it. An important direction for future work will be to establish standard and robust methods for assessing translation invariance and other transformation invariances to facilitate comparisons across artificial networks and the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Comparison to previous work</title><p>One way our approach to comparing the representation in a CNN to that in the brain differs from previous work is that we examined the representation of specific visual features at the single-unit level, whereas previous studies took a population level approach. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamins et al. (2014)</xref> modeled IT and V4 recordings using weighted sums over populations of CNN units, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte, 2014</xref> examined whether populations of CNN units represented categorical distinctions similar to those represented in IT (e.g., animate vs. inanimate). Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kubilius et al. (2016)</xref> examined whether forms perceived as similar by humans had similar CNN population representations. Our work is the first to quantitatively compare the single-unit representation in a CNN to that in a mid-level visual cortical area. We tested whether an artificial network matched the neural representation at a fundamental level—the output of single neurons, which are conveyed onward to hundreds or thousands of targets in multiple cortical areas. Unlike previous studies, we focused on specific physiological properties (boundary curvature tuning and translation invariance) with a goal of finding better models where a robust image-computable model is lacking. Furthermore, we use visualization of unit responses to natural images to qualitatively validate whether the representation that these response properties are intended to capture (an object-centered representation of boundary) does in fact hold across natural images. We believe this level of model validation, which includes quantitative and conceptual registration to documented neuronal selectivity, pushes the field beyond what has been done before. Our results allow modelers to focus on specific neural selectivities and work with concrete, identified circuits that have biologically plausible components.</p><p>Another major difference with prior work is that we fit the CNN to the APC model as opposed to directly to neural responses. This might seem like an unnecessary layer of abstraction, but the purpose of a model is not just predictive power but also interpretability, and the CNN's complexity runs counter to interpretability. The CNN is necessarily complex in order to encode complex features from raw pixel values, whereas the APC model has five interpretable parameters. The APC model describes responses to complex features while ignoring the details of how those features were computed from an image. By identifying APC-tuned units in the CNN, we gain an image-computable model of neural responses to interpretable features; these units can be studied to understand how and why such response patterns arise. When we separately tested whether the CNN units were able to directly fit the responses of V4 neurons, we found they were no better on average than the APC model, thus for a gain in interpretability, we did not suffer an overall loss of predictive power. Nevertheless, some V4 neurons were better fit directly to a CNN unit than to any APC model, suggesting there may be V4 representations beyond APC tuning that can be synergistically studied with CNNs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Value of artiphysiology</title><p>Comparing artificial networks to the brain can serve both computer and biological vision science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kriegeskorte, 2015</xref>). What can an electrophysiologist learn from this study? First, our results demonstrate that there may already exist image-computable models for complex selectivity that match single-neuron data better than hand-designed models from neuroscientists. Second, finding matches between neuronal selectivity in the brain and artificial networks trained on vast amounts of natural data provides one method for electrophysiologists to validate their findings. For example, our findings support the hypothesis that an encoding of boundary curvature in single units may be generally important for the representation of objects. Third, once a match is found based on limited sets of experimentally practical stimuli, units within deep nets can then be tested with vast and diverse stimuli to attempt to gain deeper understanding. For example, finding the downward-dog-paw and wolf-ear-steeple units raises the question of whether boundary curvature is encoded independent of other visual traits in V4 or in the CNN. Specifically, is it possible that V4 neurons that appear to encode curvature at a particular angular position are in fact also selective for texture or color features associated with a limited set of objects that have relevance to the monkey? Longer experimental sessions with richer stimulus sets will be required to test this in V4. Fourth, concrete, image-computable models can be used to address outstanding debates that may otherwise remain imprecise. For example, by visualizing the preferences of single units for natural stimuli after identifying and characterizing those units with artificial stimuli, our results speak to the debate on artificial vs. natural stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rust and Movshon, 2005</xref>) by showing that artificial stimuli are often able to reveal critical characteristics of the selectivity of units involved in complex mid-level (parts-based) to high-level (categorical) visual encoding, even when the visual dimensions of the artificial set explore only a minority of the feature space represented by the units. As another example, our results can help to address the debate of whether the visual system explicitly represents object boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelson and Bergen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Movshon and Simoncelli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ziemba and Freeman, 2015</xref>), which Movshon and Simoncelli describe as follows: ‘In brief, the concept is that the visual system is more concerned with the representation of the ‘stuff’ that lies between the edges, and less concerned with the edges themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelson and Bergen, 1991</xref>).' The models we have identified can now be used to pilot experimental tests of this rather complex, abstract idea.</p><p>Our approach also provides potentially valuable insight for machine learning. The connection between deep nets and actual neural circuits is often downplayed, but we found a close match at the level of specific single-unit selectivity. This opens the possibility that future studies could reveal more fine-scale similarities, that is matches of sub-types of single-unit selectivity, between artificial networks and the brain, and that such homology could become a basis for improving network performance. Second, translation invariance, seen as critical for robust visual representation, has not been systematically quantified for units within artificial networks. Determining why deeper layers in the network maintain a wide diversity of TI across units could be important for understanding how categorical representations are built. More generally, the art of characterizing units within complex systems using simple metrics and systematic stimulus sets, as practiced by electrophysiologists, can provide a useful way to interpret the representations learned in deep nets, thereby opening the black box to understand how learned representation contributes to performance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Further work</title><p>Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that some CNN units share a representation of shape in common with V4 that is captured by the APC model. Examining whether these CNN units demonstrate additional V4 properties, beyond those examined here, would further test this hypothesis. For example, curvature-tuned V4 cells have been shown to (1) have some degree of scale invariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El-Shamayleh and Pasupathy, 2016</xref>), (2) suppress the representation of accidental contours, for example those resulting from occlusion that are unrelated to object shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bushnell et al., 2011</xref>), (3) be robust against partial occlusions of certain portions of shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kosai et al., 2014</xref>), and (4) maintain selectivity across a spectrum of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bushnell and Pasupathy, 2012</xref>). Further studies like these are needed to more deeply probe whether the intermediate representation of shape and objects in the brain is similar to that in artificial networks. In addition to further study of functional response properties, it is important to understand how the network achieves these representations. For example, translation invariance was a key response property that allowed the trained network to achieve a V4-like representation, yet we are just beginning to understand what aspects of kernel weights, receptive field overlap, and convergence are critical to matching the physiological data. For CNNs to be valuable models of the nervous system, it will be important to understand what network properties support their ability to match representations observed in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>The convolutional neural network</title><p>We used an implementation of the well-known CNN referred to as ‘AlexNet,’ which is available from the Caffe deep learning framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org">http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jia et al., 2014</xref>). Its architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is purely feed forward: the input to each layer consists solely of the output from the previous layer. The network can be broken down into eight major layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left column), the first five of which are called convolutional layers (Conv1 through Conv5) because they contain linear spatial filters with local support that are repeatedly applied across the image. The last three layers are called fully connected (FC6 through FC8) because they receive input from all units in the previous layer. We next describe in detail the computations of the first major layer, which serves as a model to understand the later layers.</p><p>The first major convolutional layer consists of four sublayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, orange, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>, top four rows). The first sublayer, Conv1, consists of 96 distinct linear filters (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that are spatially localized to 11 × 11 pixel regions and that have a depth of three, corresponding to the red, green and blue (RGB) components of the input color images. The input images used for training and testing are 227 × 227 (spatial) x 3 (RGB) pixels. The output of a Conv1 unit is its linear filter output minus a bias value (a constant, not shown). Conv1 has a stride of 4, meaning that neighboring units have filters that are offset in space by four pixels. The output of each Conv1 unit is processed by a rectified linear unit in the second sublayer, Relu1, the output of which is simply the half-wave rectified value of Conv1. These values are then pooled by units in the third sublayer, Pool1, which compute the maximum over a 3 × 3 pixel region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, gray triangles) with a stride of 2. The outputs of the Pool1 units are then normalized (see below) to become the outputs of units in the fourth sublayer, Norm1. These normalized outputs are the inputs to the Conv2 units in the second major layer, and so on. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows a scale diagram of the spatial convergence in the convolutional layers (major layers are color coded) along one spatial dimension. Starting at the top, the 11 × 11 pixel kernels (orange triangles) sample the image every four pixels, reducing the spatial representation to a 55 × 55 element grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, column 4, lists spatial dimensions). The Pool1 layer reduces the representation to 27 × 27 because of its stride of 2. The Conv2 unit linear filters are 5 × 5 in space (red triangles) and are 48 deep (not depicted), where the depth refers to the number of unique kernels in the previous layer that provide inputs to the unit (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>), for details and their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for a depiction of the 3D kernel structure).</p><p>These operations continue to process and subsample the representation until, after Pool5, there is a 6 × 6 spatial grid that is 256 kernels deep. Given the convergence between layers, the maximum possible receptive field (RF) size (i.e., extent along either the horizontal or vertical dimension) for units in each convolutional layer ranges from 11 to 163 pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) for Conv1 to Conv5, respectively. For example, the pyramid of support is shown for the central Conv5 unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, dark blue triangle shows tip of upside-down pyramid), which has access to the region of width 163 pixels covered by Conv1 kernels (orange triangles). The receptive field sizes of units in the FC layers are unrestricted (not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The last major layer, FC8, has a Prob8 sublayer that represents the final output in terms of the probability that the visual input contains each of 1000 different categories of object (e.g., Dalmation, Lampshade, etc.; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>, for details).</p><p>Units in the Norm1 and Norm2 sublayers carry out local response normalization by dividing their input value by a function (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>), their section 3.3) of the sum of squared responses to five consecutive kernels (indices from +2 to −2) along the axis of unique kernel indices (e.g., in Conv1, the indices go from 0 to 95 for the filters shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, from the upper left towards the right and down), thereby creating inhibition among kernels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> (bottom row) lists the total number of units with unique kernels in each layer, and this defines the number of units that we examine here. In the Conv layers, we only test the units that lie at the central spatial position because they perform the same computation as their spatially offset counterparts. We analyzed a total of 22,096 units. To identify units for reproducibility in future studies, we refer to units by their layer name (e.g., Conv1) and a unit number, where the unit number is the index, starting at zero, within each sublayer and proceeding in the order defined in Caffe.</p><p>We tested the network in two states: untrained and fully trained. The untrained network has all weights (i.e., values within the convolutional kernels and input weights for FC layers) initialized to Gaussian random values with mean 0 and SD 0.01, except for FC6 and FC7 where SD = 0.005, and all bias values initialized to a constant of 0 (Conv1, Conv3, FC8) or 1 (Conv2, Conv4, Conv5, FC6, FC7). These initial bias values are relatively low to minimize the number of unresponsive units, which in turn guarantees a back propagation gradient for each unit during training. The fully trained network (available from Caffe) has been trained with stochastic gradient descent on large database of labeled images, ImageNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2009</xref>), with the target that the final sublayer, Prob8, has value 0 for all units except for a value of 1 for the unit corresponding to the category of the currently presented training image. To speed up training and mitigate overfitting, an elaborate training procedure was used that included a number of heuristics described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krizhevsky et al. (2012)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Visual stimuli</title><p>Our stimulus set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) is that used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pasupathy and Connor (2001)</xref> to assess tuning for boundary curvature in V4 neurons. The set consists of 51 different simple closed shapes that are presented at up to eight rotations (fewer rotations for shapes with rotational symmetry), giving a total of 362 unique stimulus images. We rendered the shapes within a 227 by 227 pixel field with RGB values set to the same amplitude, thus creating an achromatic stimulus. The background value was 0, and the foreground amplitude was varied up to 255, the maximum luminance. This format matched the size and amplitude of the JPEG images on which the CNN was originally trained. The center of each shape was taken to be the centroid of all points on the finely sampled shape boundary. We fixed the foreground amplitude to 255 after varying it to lower values and finding that it made little difference to the response levels through the network because of the normalization layers (see Results).</p><p>We set the size of our stimuli to be 32 pixels, meaning that the largest shape, the large circle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> second shape from upper left), had a diameter of 32 pixels and all stimuli maintained the relative scaling shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. This ensured the stimuli fit within the calculated RF of all layers except Conv1 with additional room for translations (see Maximum RF size, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and allowed all layers to be compared with respect to the same stimuli. We excluded Conv1 from our analysis because fitting the stimuli within the 11 by 11 pixel RFs would corrupt their boundary shape, would not allow room for testing translation invariance, and Conv1 is of less interest because of its simple function. In the V4 electrophysiological experiments of Pasupathy and Connor, stimuli were sized proportionally to each neuronal RF, as it can be difficult to drive a cell with stimuli that are much smaller than the RF. We tested sizes larger than 32 pixels (see Results) and found it did not substantially change our results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiological data</title><p>For comparison to the deep network model, we re-analyzed data from two previous single-unit, extracellular studies of parafoveal V4 neurons in the awake, fixating rhesus monkey (Macaca mulattta). Data from the first study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pasupathy and Connor (2001)</xref>, consists of the responses of 109 V4 neurons to the set of 362 shapes described above. There were typically 3–5 repeats of each stimulus, and we used the mean firing rate averaged across repeats and during the 500 ms stimulus presentation to constrain a model of tuning for boundary curvature in V4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To constrain translation invariance, we used data from a second study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El-Shamayleh and Pasupathy (2016)</xref>, because the first study used only two stimuli (one preferred and one antipreferred) to coarsely assess translation invariance. The data from the second study consists of responses of 39 neurons tested for translation invariance. The stimuli were the same types of shapes as the first study, but where the position of the stimuli within the RF was also varied. Each neuron was tested with up to 56 shapes (some of which are rotations of others) presented at 3–5 positions within the receptive field. Each unique combination of stimulus and RF position was presented for 5–16 repeats, and spike counts were averaged over the 300 ms stimulus presentation.

This metric works for both non-negative and signed random variables, thus covering the outputs of all layers of the CNN. We excluded CNN units where response sparsity was outside the range observed in V4: 2.9 to 42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; see Results). We also found that such units gave degenerate fits to the APC model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Placing stimuli in the classical receptive field</title><p>In keeping with neurophysiology, we defined the classical receptive field (CRF) of a CNN unit as the region of the input from which our stimuli can elicit a response different from baseline, where baseline is defined as the response to the background input (all zeros). For example, to determine the horizontal extent of the CRF of a unit, we started with our stimulus set centered (in x and y) on the spatial location of the unit and determined whether there was a driven response (deviation from baseline) to any stimulus. We then moved the stimulus set left and right to cover a 100 pixel span in two pixel increments to find the longest set of contiguous points from which any response was elicited at each point. In other words, stimuli were centered on pixels ranging from 64 to 164 in the 227 pixel wide image. To account for the finite width of the stimuli, we subtracted the maximum stimulus width from the length of the contiguous response region and added one to arrive at the estimated extent of the CRF in pixels along the horizontal axis. Any unit with a CRF wide enough to contain three 2-pixel translations of our stimulus set was included in our analyses. Generally, this provided a conservative estimate of the receptive field, because most stimuli were narrower than the maximal-width stimulus, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.</p><p>All analyses and plots of responses to translated shapes were made with respect to horizontal shifts of our vertically centered shape set.

Conceptually, APC tuning refers to the ability of a neuron to respond selectively to simple shape stimuli that have a boundary curvature feature (a convexity or concavity) at a particular angular position with respect to the center of the shape. Unlike the CNN, the APC model does not operate on raw image pixel values, but instead on the carefully parameterized curvature and angular position of diagnostic elements of the boundaries of simple closed shapes (see example shape, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Each boundary element along the border of a shape can be mapped to a point in a plane heretofore referred to as the APC plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Thus, this metric is also bounded to lie between −1 and 1, but it has an advantage over the average r-value across all unique pairs of locations because the latter would weight the r-value from RF locations with very weak responses just the same as those with very strong responses. For a simple model of neuronal translation invariance in which the variations of responses are described as the product of a receptive field profile and a shape selectivity function, our TI metric would take its maximum possible value, 1.

According to our simulations, our TI metric has the benefit of being unbiased with respect to receptive field size or selectivity of our response matrices, thereby facilitating comparisons across layers and diverse response distributions.</p><p>In testing the CNN, we finely sampled horizontal shifts of the stimulus set, as described above in ‘Placing stimuli in the CRF’.

This required us to compare, for each of the 109 V4 units, the best-fit unit in the pool of CNN units to the best fit provided by the APC model. In the case of the CNN, there are 22,096 units to consider (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the case of the APC model, there are five parameters (see 'The APC model’ above). We employed cross-validation to ensure that any differences in fit quality were not the result of one fitting procedure being more flexible than the other. In particular, we performed 50 fits on a random subset of 4/5 of the neural data, then measured the correlation of the fit model on the remaining 1/5. We took the mean of these 50 fits for each unit to be the estimate of test correlation, and the 95<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf76"><mml:msup><mml:mi/><mml:mi>th</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> percentiles of the distribution of fits for identifying cells that deviate in their fit quality between two models (e.g., APC model and the CNN). To judge whether the variance explained by the CNN was largely distinct from that explained by the APC model we fit a V4 neurons best-fit CNN model to the residual of the fit of the APC model to a V4 neuron. If the correlation of the CNN unit to the V4 neuron remains high then the APC model and CNN explain different features of the response of the V4 neuron.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Estimating the effect of the stochastic nature of neuronal responses</title><p>AlexNet produces deterministic, noise-free responses, whereas the responses of V4 neurons are stochastic. This raises the possibility that our conclusions might have been different if more trials of V4 data had been collected to reduce the noise in the estimates of the mean neuronal responses. In particular, trial-to-trial variability will tend to lower the correlation coefficient (r-value) between model and data.</p><p>To address this, we used the methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haefner et al.

We then used this set of sample means, which has TI = 1, to generate Poisson responses, simulating the original experiment 100 times and computing the TI value for each case. We took the average drop in TI (compared to 1) to be an estimate of the upper bound of how much the V4 neuron TI values could have been degraded by noise.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Visualization</title><p>To visualize the features that drove a particular unit in the CNN to its highest and lowest response levels, we first ranked all images (or image patches) based on the response of the unit to the standard test set of 50,000 images for AlexNet. For units in the convolutional layers, we considered the responses at all x-y locations for a particular unique kernel. Thus, we found not just the optimal image, but also the optimal patch within the image that drove the kernel being examined. We then performed a visualization technique on the 10 most excitatory images and on the 10 most suppressive images. We followed the methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeiler and Fergus (2013)</xref>, and used a deconvnet to project the response of the unit onto successive layers until we reached the input image. The deconvolved features can then be examined, as an RGB image, to provide a qualitative sense of what features within the image drove the unit to such a large positive or negative value.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship (DAP), a Google Faculty Research Award (WB and AP), the National Science Foundation CRCNS Grant IIS-1309725 (WB and AP), National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grant R01 EY-018839 (AP), NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs Grant RR-00166 to the Washington National Primate Research Center (AP), and NIH Grant R01 EY-027023 (WB) We thank Yasmine El-Shamayleh for sharing V4 data.

What follows is the editors’ letter requesting such plan.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;&quot;Artiphysiology&quot; reveals V4-like shape tuning in a deep network trained for image classification&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers who read this paper had quite different views. In my role as the reviewing editor, here I integrate and summarize the different impressions and comments and provide the authors with some recommendations to revise the paper and best respond to the comments to improve the manuscript, with my hope that it will be possible to reconsider publication of this study.</p><p>This paper examines the hidden units of deep networks trained on image classification in order to determine whether their tuning properties are similar to those that have been reported previously in primate visual area V4. The authors probe a pre-trained deep network (AlexNet, used in many other computational neuroscience studies) with simple closed-contour binary shape stimuli. These stimuli were used in previous impactful neurophysiology studies from this group to probe contour curvature and angle tuning in area V4.</p><p>The paper reports three main general results. First, it shows that some units within the deep network can be well described by a model contour curvature model of V4 selectivity (the APC model) that was developed previously by the authors. Second, it shows that the deep network units well described by APC model also exhibit position invariance, similar to that observed in real V4 neurons and reported in several previous studies. Third, the authors use a network visualization method to show that deep network units well described by the APC model are predicted to be selective for a range of complex natural images and that the best natural images evoke larger responses from the APC units than are obtained using the simpler stimuli.</p><p>This is a well written and clear paper. The computational analyses appear to be solid. Treating a deep network trained on a natural image classification task as an object of synthetic neurophysiological investigation is an interesting enterprise, and it is gratifying to see the correspondence between units in the deep network and V4 neurons that are well fit by the APC model.</p><p>The &quot;major concerns&quot; section below provides details of the major question that we have faced, which is: What is the added value of this well-written paper?

(2) How much data should be collected? (3) How should models be validated? (4) What modeling framework should we use? The authors are invited to clarify and explain how the paper appropriately relate to these questions.</p><p>At some level, it seems like this study has to work out the way that it did. As several recent neurophysiology modeling studies using deep networks have argued, both deep networks and the primate visual system were &quot;trained&quot; (or evolved) using analyze natural images, and it is not surprising that both hierarchical networks end up representing similar hierarchical structure in natural images. From that point of view the results of the manuscript are unsurprising. The two major conclusions of the paper are that units in deep networks trained on classification and well fit by the APC model show selectivity for contour curvature and that they are locally positioned invariant. Both of these observations are completely consistent with an enormous amount of prior data. A wealth of prior research suggests that object borders are important for vision. Theoretical arguments suggest that object borders are a critical component of any viable representation of the objects in natural scenes, and many previous neurophysiology studies using both synthetic and natural images have shown that units in V2 and V4 are sensitive to object borders including curved borders. The demonstration that deep networks are positionally invariant is also not surprising. After all, the deep networks tested here are convolutional and therefore are designed to be locally positioned invariant. In fact, convolutional networks were inspired originally by the finding of position invariance in primate vision.</p><p>The important question, therefore, is not whether there is any correspondence between the tuning of visual neurons and the tuning of units in deep networks trained for image classification. Instead, the important questions concern the nature of this tuning, the distributional relationships between primate neurons and units in the deep networks and, ultimately, what that can tell us about the biophysical mechanisms underpinning the observed functional selectivity.</p><p>We would have been more enthusiastic if the analysis could reveal some new principles that could provide impetus to further experimental studies, or which could be used to help improve current models. For example, if the current deep network framework could support some fundamentally new approach to interpreting functional responses that would provide a foundation for building a mathematical model that can explain observed functional properties in terms of known biophysical building blocks present in cortical neurons, or if the deep networks could be used as the building blocks for such a model.</p><p>At this point, this is a well-done study that supports the current view that the primate visual system and deep networks trained on natural image classification both encode intermediate object structure such as contour curvature. However, this paper as written doesn't resolve controversies and doesn't provide information that would be useful for designing future experiments or models.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38242.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors' note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and the authors made a formal revised submission.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The &quot;major concerns&quot; section below provides details of the major question that we have faced, which is: What is the added value of this well-written paper?

This is despite the remarkable differences between the two systems in terms of architecture (e.g., lack of feedback in AlexNet), properties of individual units (e.g., no dedicated inhibitory neurons in AlexNet), training (limited visual environment of colony raised animal) and behavioral tasks (no motor output requirements for AlexNet) [Discussion, second paragraph​]. This correspondence at the level of single units was unexpected and was not previously pursued in past studies (e.g., Yamins et al., 2014). [​Discussion subsection “Comparison to previous work”, first paragraph​]</p><p>2) Our results suggest that comparing properties of single units in AlexNet with cortical neurons can be a powerful tool to clarify complex processing beyond the earliest stages in primate cortex. We now emphasize that single-neuronal selectivity described by electrophysiologists might be questioned, but can gain more traction once similar selectivity is seen within an artificial network trained on a large bank of naturalistic inputs [Discussion​ subsection “Value of artiphysiology”]. Our paper highlights a general way forward for systems Neuroscience research.</p><p>3) Despite the CNN’s apparent complexity, form selectivity of some units in AlexNet can be described by a simple 5-parameter model. This is a novel strategy that complements the traditional approach of unit visualization, helping to defeat the notion of CNNs as mysterious black boxes. [Discussion subsection “Comparison to previous work”​]</p><p>4) Our work shows that single units of AlexNet achieve V4-like translation invariance only after extensive training (our Figure 8B and Discussion ‘Training and translation invariance’). This will help to dispel the expectation that units in deep networks are translation invariant by design. Our paper can move the field beyond this misconception so that investigation can begin in earnest to understand how units within complex networks including the brain achieve translation invariance, we now emphasize this [​Discussion subsection “Training and translation invariance”​].</p><p>5) Our results speak to the artificial vs. natural stimulus debate. They reveal that artificial stimuli can be quite diagnostic even in systems trained only on natural stimuli and even in deep layers of the system where the artificial stimuli may drive only a small fraction of the response dynamic range. [Discussion subsection “Value of artiphysiology”​]</p><p>6) Our study identifies the first image-computable, biologically-plausible circuit model that matches quantitatively the boundary shape tuning and TI in V4 [Discussion, first paragraph​]. We thus provide a concrete, openly available tool to test complex theories of image statistic vs. object centered encoding in V4 (Ziemba and Freeman, 2014).</p><p>ii) Our results are not merely confirmatory​: there is little consensus about processing in area V4 and there are major differences between the primate brain and CNNs in terms of architecture and training. Thus, there is not a solid basis to predict, at the single-unit level, the outcome of a comparison of form selectivity between deep nets and area V4.</p><p>1) There is currently no accepted model among electrophysiologists of what V4 does; therefore, to say that one knows in advance that a particular single-neuron selectivity in V4 (here, selectivity for boundary shape of simple forms) will emerge from a given artificial network is not tenable. Neuroscientists do not yet agree on what V4 neurons do, and different studies use widely different experimental paradigms and propose different circuit models that make different and sometimes directly contradictory predictions. This fact is demonstrated nicely by the current review, which questions whether the APC model is really any good at describing important properties of V4 neurons, and whether it is even valid to use in our study. This reflects the reality that we face regularly, and it is based on disagreements in published papers, public talks and anonymous critique that demonstrate the overall feeling of doubt that anybody understands what is going on in an area like V4. This view conflicts with the idea that, “we already know what features are represented in single units in the brain and in units in deep nets (and we know these are the same)”. So which is it: do we already know all of this, or are we confused about basic V4 selectivity? Because of this lack of clarity about V4, we believe that our paper will be of great interest and spur important debate in the community. This highlights an important insight of our paper: that single-neuronal selectivity described by electrophysiologists might seem questionable, but can gain more traction once it is seen that such selectivity can arise within an artificial network trained on a large bank of naturalistic inputs, we now discuss this point in our revised manuscript ​[​Discussion subsection “Value of artiphysiology”​]​. Importantly, this is not local to V4, the circuits and roles of neurons in V2, V3, IT, and beyond the visual cortex, are not agreed upon either. Thus, our paper highlights a general way forward in neuroscience.</p><p>2) There is wide disagreement about the validity of deep convolutional networks as robust models of human visual function. Many see these models as using tricks of image statistics to achieve good results – for example, journal articles highlight adversarial images, where deep nets fall down, and cases where artificial networks can fail spectacularly in challenging situations that are trivial for the primate visual system. The argument has been made that the primate brain depends on feedback and structural knowledge of the world, and these elements are not yet properly incorporated into the design and training of artificial networks. Primates have different training inputs and different tasks compared to the type of deep net studied here: they manipulate objects and experience them in 3D and over time, whereas AlexNet does not; we now include this point in our manuscript ​[​Discussion, second paragraph​]​. We and others have considered that border ownership and boundary shape selectivity are critical for organisms that must form their hands to grasp objects with great certainty, or perish. It remains uncertain going forward to what extent we should expect specific representations at the single unit level to align across such diverse systems. This argues against the predictability of what types of specific neuronal selectivity might be shared between the brain and deep nets.</p><p>3) There is wide agreement that deep nets are difficult to understand and provide little insight in spite of their amazing performance on specific tasks. This contradicts the notion that one already knows what to expect when examining the internal representation of single units in the deep net. Here we show that a simple, insightful 5-parameter model can be related to parts of a deep net [Discussion​ subsection “Comparison to previous work”]​. Previous studies that have compared responses have not gone down to the single unit level, and thus have left the mystery of the black box intact.</p><p>4) If another study comes out next month where it is found that a major property of V4 neurons (or of neurons in V2 or IT) is <italic>not</italic> present in the deep net (e.g., blur tuning, accidental contour discounting, color-invariant shape tuning, etc.), can one not equally well then say, “Of course this is not surprising because deep nets and the brain are so fundamentally different: different architecture, different sensory inputs and different tasks?” The fact that the opposite view (to that in Summary #2 above) could also be backed up by a large set of viable arguments suggests that our results cannot be taken as known in advance.</p><p>5) A phrase is repeated in the summary and below, “that hierarchical networks (either biological or artificial) end up representing similar hierarchical structure in natural images.” To argue that this obviates our results would imply that one has accepted the idea that the visual system is best described as hierarchical and that we know what features are represented therein. However, this is not the case. While there is general consensus that boundaries (“edges”) and textures in images are critical, it is still unknown what features are encoded beyond V1, how visual receptive fields are built, how selectivity actually arises in a circuit, and how best to conceptualize visual processing. There is still deep debate as to the function of feedback, and it is actively investigated whether predictive coding is a better model for the cortex at many levels. Visual neuroscientists work in a world where currently very little is established and agreed upon about circuitry and single neurons in mid-level processing. The phrase quoted above about hierarchy presents a broad, classical notion that has been a useful point of reference but has remained under debate for fifty years. Currently, vast amounts of funding and scientific effort are aimed at trying to understand cortical circuitry and function. This argues against the ideas that (a) we already know the ventral stream is a hierarchy like a feedforward deep net, (b) we know which sensory features are represented throughout, and (c) we have already uncovered image-computable models to explain visual representation that aligns with that in neuronal circuitry.</p><p>iii) ​Our paper does not merely target a local community​. We believe that our paper takes a novel approach in connecting two substantial communities – electrophysiologists who depend upon simple and limited stimulus paradigms and the machine learning community that aims to improve intelligent performance in artificial systems. Only recently have electrophysiologists had access to artificial networks that rival their physiological model systems in terms of having daunting complexity and strikingly good “behavioral” performance. Our results suggest to electrophysiologists that they may be able to harness deep nets for single-unit level comparisons in terms of neural representation. To the machine learning community, it reinforces the notion that the brain remains an important system for comparison and guidance, and that the craft of interpreting the innards of black boxes, honed by electrophysiologists, might be usefully applied to make sense of internal representation in deep nets. Our paper should have broad interest beyond local communities because it goes toward the question of the degree to which man-made intelligent systems can end up looking like the brain at a fine scale. We believe our paper both connects and transcends local communities. We now emphasize this starting with the opening line of our Abstract and by making specific sections to explain what electrophysiologists can learn and what the machine learning community can learn [​Discussion subsection “Value of artiphysiology”​].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Most researchers agree that the critical questions regarding modeling of sensory system at large are the practical ones: (1) What stimulus should be used in neurophysiology data collection? (2) How much data should be collected? (3) How should models be validated? (4) What modeling framework should we use? The authors are invited to clarify and explain how the paper appropriately relate to these questions.</p></disp-quote><p>We highlight below how our paper relates to these four questions and will emphasize the main points within our revised manuscript. Due to the open-ended, general nature of this invitation, we attempt to keep our replies brief to focus more on specific criticisms further below.</p><p>1) What stimuli to use​? A well-known debate in neurophysiology is whether to use artificial or natural stimuli (e.g., Rust and Movshon, 2005). Our artificial shape stimuli were substantially different from the training images for AlexNet, thus one could expect there to be little relationship between responses of the units to shapes and responses to natural images. We found a close relationship in many cases where the shape tuning of the units was reflective of their shape tuning over natural stimuli (Figure 11-12). Even for units at the deepest level of the network, the artificial electrophysiological stimuli were able to correlate strongly with the output category. There were also cases where characterization with the artificial shapes did not appear to relate to that with natural images, and this provides concrete examples for further research to gain insight into the determining factors [​Discussion subsection “Visualization of V4-like CNN units”​].</p><p>More importantly, by identifying an image-computable model for V4 boundary-form selective units, we offer the community an opportunity to test and optimize their stimuli on a model that is better than any V4 form-selective model as far as we know [​Discussion subsection “Comparison to previous work”​]. By showing not only which stimuli best drive these units, but also which most suppress them, we provide completely novel insight into stimulus design to test opponency and inhibition in mid-level form processing. We are using these novel CNN-unit models to design stimulus selection algorithms in our electrophysiological lab, and have just collected data from our first V4 units using this method. Such methods are generally of interest to others (e.g., Cowley et al., 2017, NIPS).</p><p>These models are also useful for developing stimulus sets to quantitatively understand form vs. texture tuning at the level of single units and circuits, and can be used to operationalize the difference between the notion of selectivity for things vs. stuff (Adelson, 1982), e.g., for object boundaries vs. general image statistics [Discussion Subsection “Value of artiphysiology”​].</p><p>2) How much data to collect​ ? Our paper relates to this in several ways.</p><p>A) We show that TI can be estimated along one axis of translation (horizontal) and this metric has strong correlation along the other axis (vertical), and with 2D translation [​Results subsection “Translation Invariance”, last paragraph​]. This is important for studies that try to understand TI in the cortex (another debated area: e.g., Sharpee et al., 2013; Rust and DiCarlo, 2010), where stimulus sets may need to be large to have ample diversity but then cannot be repeated in their entirety across a dense 2D grid.</p><p>B) Our simulations and noise-correction procedures [Materials and methods​ subsection “Estimating the effect of the stochastic nature of neuronal responses”] show that with ~5 stimulus repeats, our R-values for APC model fits are under-estimated only by a small amount [now shown as pink line added into Figure 5G].</p><p>C) We provide novel V4 models as tools for the community to estimate when they have collected enough different stimulus dimensions to have fully understood a unit in a complex, non-linear network.</p><p>3) How should models be validated<underline>​</underline>? We add substantively to a larger discussion on model validation. Prior studies on the effectiveness of deep neural networks for modeling the nervous system have not provided insight at the level of single neurons and electrophysiological selectivity (see for example Yamins et al., 2014; Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte, 2014). Their approaches emphasized explained variance for population-level fits. Here we take a different approach by choosing specific known response properties of single units (translation invariance and shape selectivity) and determine whether units in an artificial net achieve these actual neural response properties. Furthermore, we use visualization of unit responses to natural images to qualitatively validate whether the representation that these response properties are intended to capture (an object-centered representation of boundary) does in fact hold across natural images. We believe this level of model validation, which includes quantitative and conceptual level agreement to documented neuronal selectivity, pushes the field significantly beyond what has been done, we now state this in the revised manuscript [Discussion subsection “Comparison to previous work”​]. Our results allow modelers to focus on specific neural selectivities and work with concrete, identified circuits that have biologically plausible components which we emphasize now. Furthermore, the units in AlexNet that we point to are publicly available, image-computable models, thus allowing maximal transparency for others to validate or invalidate the models by any method they choose.</p><p>4) What modeling framework to use​? We have used two fundamentally different modeling frameworks in this study: the APC model, a simple descriptive model, and AlexNet, an image-computable statistical machine-learning model, and from this we have identified elements that can be extracted and analyzed to drive modeling at the circuit and biophysically plausible level. We now clarify in the Discussion [​second paragraph in subsection “Comparison to previous work”​] how using modeling frameworks at different levels of complexity (the 5-parameter APC model vs. the elaborate CNN) generates insight. We discuss how the combination of modeling frameworks is crucial, where an image computable model sheds light on potential circuit-level implementation, while the functional APC model captures the abstract representations (e.g., object-centeredness) theorized to be encoded and provides broad interpretation of neural responses. Because AlexNet is image-computable and feedforward, it allows one to extract and analyze the modular upstream circuitry driving identified units. These excerpts can then be compared to the best attempts at hand-made circuits (e.g., H-Max and many other cortical models of visual neuroscientists), refined to reach any desired level of biological plausibility, and analyzed to extract novel general principles. We believe this will be an important way forward in understanding form selectivity and translation invariance in the visual system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At some level, it seems like this study has to work out the way that it did. As several recent neurophysiology modeling studies using deep networks have argued, both deep networks and the primate visual system were &quot;trained&quot; (or evolved) using analyze natural images, and it is not surprising that both hierarchical networks end up representing similar hierarchical structure in natural images. From that point of view the results of the manuscript are unsurprising.</p></disp-quote><p>For general arguments as to why our results did not have to work out the way they did, see our replies to the Summary above. To this more specific point, it is rational to expect that similar systems trained on similar inputs for similar tasks could achieve similarity in representation. But, before deciding whether CNNs and the macaques in this study can be considered sufficiently similar systems, several specific questions would need to be answered. Namely,</p><p>1) how similar is the macaque to AlexNet in terms of simple visual input? The macaques in the study were raised in an animal colony, and thus in a limited visual environment. They never saw ImageNet images and probably never saw even a single instance of the overwhelming majority of the 1000 image categories of AlexNet. They did not see the forest, the ocean, the sky nor other important contexts for AlexNet categories. These animals were never exposed to natural images as part of an experiment or training. We are aware of no scientific study that estimates how close the input statistics are for such macaques and AlexNet, and it would be an oversimplification to say there was one set of natural scene statistics that caused all visual systems to develop the same way (there is great diversity in biological visual systems).</p><p>2) How similar are the training signals? The macaque visual system could be shaped by the need to physically interact in real time in a 3D dynamic world. It is unknown how much influence this might have on representation. AlexNet does not interact with the world that generated the images that it senses, nor is it even given information about the location of object boundaries in its images for the categorization task for which it was trained.</p><p>3) How do the vastly different architectures of the macaque and AlexNet alter single-unit representation? AlexNet does not have a retina or LGN nor feedback from higher areas, nor dedicated excitatory and inhibitory neurons, nor does it have to compute with action potentials. It is unknown how these elements influence single-unit representation in an appropriate context.</p><p>4) Will a small set of artificial stimuli from the electrophysiology lab be sufficient to probe a network that was never trained on such impoverished and noise-free inputs? Overall, without knowing in advance a lot more about the answers to such questions, we do not see how one could scientifically predict our results about the similarity of mid-level single-unit representations across these two very different systems. We discuss these points in the revised manuscript [Discussion​ second paragraph].</p><p>For example, Yamins et al. (2014) in part motivate the regression of many units’ responses in the CNN onto multi-unit data in cortex by arguing it would be unlikely to see one-to-one correspondences between CNN units and neurons in the brain. This argument assumed a highly distributed representation where it would be unlikely for two axes (single units) of this representation to align but only by looking at a population could a shared representation be discovered. Our results add to this debate by opening the possibility that a match could be made at the level of single unit selectivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The two major conclusions of the paper are that units in deep networks trained on classification and well fit by the APC model show selectivity for contour curvature and that they are locally positioned invariant. Both of these observations are completely consistent with an enormous amount of prior data.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, we show that many units can fit the boundary curvature (APC) model for stimuli centered in the RF. But not all of these units are locally translation invariant. When the additional criterion of translation invariance (TI) is added, then fewer units are good fits to the APC/TI model (relative to V4 selectivity). When visualization and response dynamic range are also considered, only a minority of units appear to match the APC/TI model quantitatively and conceptually. We added additional clarification in the text that this match only occurs for some units in the middle layers [Discussion, first paragraph​].</p><p>No study has ever fit a quantitative model of boundary curvature tuning to units in AlexNet, and no study has ever systematically estimated TI for units as we have done (using a systematic set of stimuli like those in electrophysiology and with a metric that controls for RF size and other factors). Studies of translation invariance in these nets have had mixed and conflicting results, as we report in the Discussion [​subsection “Other studies of TI in CNNs”​]. Deep net studies disagree about TI across layers, and V4 studies disagree about TI in neurons. Thus, our observations are not ‘completely consistent with an enormous amount of prior data’ as far as the published literature (see below for further details). Nevertheless, our results are consistent with some conclusions of previous work, and because all correct studies should be consistent with each other, this is not a shortcoming of our work. Overall, there is no other study in the category of our study – comparing single unit selectivity for mid-level vision in the macaque and a CNN [Discussion​ subsection “Comparison to previous work”].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A wealth of prior research suggests that object borders are important for vision. Theoretical arguments suggest that object borders are a critical component of any viable representation of the objects in natural scenes, and many previous neurophysiology studies using both synthetic and natural images have shown that units in V2 and V4 are sensitive to object borders including curved borders.</p></disp-quote><p>We generally agree with these statements and they are not criticisms, but premises, of our work aiming to find image-computable models to advance our understanding of the primate visual system. In this context it is interesting to note ideas of Movshon and Simoncelli (2014) and Ziemba and Freeman (2015), who argue that the whole demonstration of border selectivity could just be a result of selectivity for higher order image statistics. Thus, there is still disagreement about how such basic features are processed in the cortex, and having deep nets as useful working models could add substantially to this debate and could ultimately resolve this debate. We have revised our manuscript to emphasize these points [​Discussion subsection “Value of artiphysiology”​].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The demonstration that deep networks are positionally invariant is also not surprising. After all, the deep networks tested here are convolutional and therefore are designed to be locally positioned invariant. In fact, convolutional networks were inspired originally by the finding of position invariance in primate vision.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is a commonly held belief that deep networks are translation invariant by design, we find that they only achieve actual translation invariance in their units after extensive training (see Figure 7B and Discussion ‘Training and translation invariance’). It is important that this commonly held belief is dispelled so that investigation can begin in earnest to understand how units within complex networks including the brain achieve translation invariance. We now emphasize this point in our revised manuscript [​Discussion​ subsection “Other studies of TI in CNNs”].</p><p>Our results demonstrate that TI of single-unit form selectivity tends to increase with depth in the network but is highly variable from unit-to-unit even within a layer. We discuss in “Other studies of TI in CNN’s” how prior work published in the computer vision literature reports conflicting results as to the progression of invariance in layers of CNNs. We believe differences in reported TI across layer are the result of a lack of consistent definitions and absence of careful controls. Again this shows that the results we present are not simply ‘completely consistent with an enormous amount of prior data’ as far as the published literature. We appreciate being made aware of the study by Güçlü and van Gerven (2015) that used an invariance metric in a deep network. Their measure is fundamentally different from our TI–they fit a Gaussian surface to responses of units to translations of a single preferred stimulus, then take the median extent of the Gaussian across units in a layer as a measure of invariance for the layer. This metric is more similar to an electrophysiological estimate of average receptive field width across units in a layer; it does not measure the consistency of form selectivity to diverse stimuli across space. We now discuss their study in our revised manuscript [​Discussion subsection “Other studies of TI in CNNs”​]. Our TI metric was designed to do the latter, in keeping with notions from other electrophysiological studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The important question, therefore, is not whether there is any correspondence between the tuning of visual neurons and the tuning of units in deep networks trained for image classification. Instead, the important questions concern the nature of this tuning, the distributional relationships between primate neurons and units in the deep networks and, ultimately, what that can tell us about the biophysical mechanisms underpinning the observed functional selectivity.</p></disp-quote><p>We generally agree. Our study is focused on the nature of form tuning in V4 and in AlexNet. We test whether the nature of the encoding for form is similar in terms of a specific model of object-centered boundary curvature derived from electrophysiology. We ask whether, in the eyes of a scientist using common experimental paradigms, units in the network could be indistinguishable from neurons in the macaque brain, and we characterized the distribution of those units within and across layers in the network. We highlight specific units for further study, thus providing the entire community of experimentalists and modelers with the first set of specific, novel circuit models for a type of neuronal form selectivity (Table 1). Other studies have reported more general observations and have not looked at the nature of specific single-neuron representation, or have simply focused on other questions. Figure 5G and 7A in our manuscript report the distribution of curvature tuned and translation invariant units, respectively, across layers of AlexNet.</p><p>As for biophysical mechanisms, the operations in a deep neural network are generally biologically plausible (addition, multiplication, division, max-pooling) and have been used by neuroscientists attempting to hand-tune cortical models (e.g., HMax model and various normalization models). Because of this, the units that we have identified, and that are publicly available in a well-documented system (Caffe), can be used to make predictions about cortical circuits in terms of the number and types (of selectivity) of units that could be combined to achieve selectivity and invariance in V4. This can guide predictions about how features are linked together from V1 to V2 to V4. We are currently using the models identified in our paper to work backwards and forwards in the deep net to understand what computations are critical to achieving V4-like boundary shape selectivity. With respect to TI, we are just beginning to understand what properties of kernel weights, receptive field overlap, and convergence are critical to matching the physiological data. We describe these efforts in our manuscript. [Discussion subsection “Further work”​]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We would have been more enthusiastic if the analysis could reveal some new principles that could provide impetus to further experimental studies, or which could be used to help improve current models. For example, if the current deep network framework could support some fundamentally new approach to interpreting functional responses that would provide a foundation for building a mathematical model that can explain observed functional properties in terms of known biophysical building blocks present in cortical neurons, or if the deep networks could be used as the building blocks for such a model.</p></disp-quote><p>Our paper does help to improve current models of V4. Specifically, we provide a novel set of models (i.e., clearly identified units and their supporting circuits in AlexNet) that are the best and only models for a mid-level, single-neuron, visual form selectivity that meets critical quantitative criterion used in electrophysiology. This opens up many lines of hypothesis testing, model refinement and stimulus selection. In terms of biophysical building blocks, synaptic weights, thresholds, pooling, inhibition and excitation (positive and negative weights), and normalization are plausible operations at the circuit and system level, and these can be fairly easily translated into more refined biologically plausible models (e.g., E-I spiking circuits). We now emphasize these points in the revised manuscript [​Discussion, subsection “Comparison to previous work”​].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At this point, this is a well-done study that supports the current view that the primate visual system and deep networks trained on natural image classification both encode intermediate object structure such as contour curvature.

For a description of the value of our study in identifying novel, useful models and designing experiments, please see our replies above.</p><p>Natural vs. artificial stimuli: We show that artificial stimuli can be quite diagnostic even in systems only trained on natural stimuli and even in deep layers of the system where the artificial stimuli may drive only a small fraction of response dynamic range. We directly show that artificial and natural stimuli can give highly consistent impressions of mid-level shape selective units in a complex non-linear network. We now discuss how this paper contributes to this debate in the revised manuscript [Discussion subsection “Value of artiphysiology”].</p><p>Object boundaries vs. ‘stuff’​: By identifying the first image-computable, biologically-plausible circuit model that matches quantitatively the boundary shape tuning and TI in V4, we provide a concrete, openly available tool to test complex theories of image statistic vs. representations of object boundaries. Movshon and Simoncelli (2014) describe this debate: “In brief, the concept is that the visual system is more concerned with the representation of the “stuff” that lies between the edges, and less concerned with the edges themselves (Adelson and Bergen, 1991).” We show how our paper contributes to this debate in the revised manuscript [​Discussion subsection “Value of artiphysiology”​.]</p><p>Is translation invariance built-in or learned?:​ As noted above, it is a widely held belief that translation invariance is built in to convolutional neural networks. Our work helps to move beyond this belief by demonstrating the importance of measuring TI for single units. We emphasize this important point in our revised manuscript [​Discussion subsection “Training and translation invariance​”].</p><p>Do deep nets develop representations like those in the brain?:​ Our paper is the first to show a single-unit level correspondence for mid-level visual form processing between deep nets and the brain [​Discussion​ subsection “Comparison to previous work”].</p></body></sub-article></article>
