defects (NTDs) are linked, with a subset of NTD patients found to harbor mutations in PCP genes, but there is limited data on whether these mutations disrupt PCP signaling in vivo. The core PCP gene <italic>Van Gogh</italic> (<italic>Vang</italic>), <italic>Vangl1</italic>/2 in mammals, is the most specific for PCP. We thus addressed potential causality of NTD-associated <italic>Vangl1</italic>/2 mutations, from either mouse or human patients, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> allowing intricate analysis of the PCP pathway. Introducing the respective mammalian mutations into <italic>Drosophila Vang</italic> revealed defective phenotypic and functional behaviors, with changes to Vang localization, post-translational modification, and mechanistic function, such as its ability to interact with PCP effectors. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into how different mammalian mutations contribute to developmental disorders and strengthen the link between PCP and NTD. Importantly, analyses of the human mutations revealed that each is a causative factor for the associated NTD.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>As an embryo develops, its cells must work together to build mature tissues and organs. During the formation of the nervous system, for example, a sheet of cells destined to become the brain and spinal cord folds up into a tube spanning the length of the embryo. Normally, this tube – known as the ‘neural tube’ – zips up, and the cells that will eventually become skin and other surrounding tissues close in over it.</p><p>If the neural tube does not close completely, different parts of the spinal cord or brain can remain unprotected. This can cause diseases called neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, which is characterized by holes in the backbone exposing the spinal cord and surrounding membranes. Patients with neural tube defects can have similar genetic mutations, for example, in the genes controlling a process called “planar cell polarity”, or PCP for short.</p><p>Cells arranged in flat sheets use the PCP process to sense direction, and it is this process that allows structures, such as the scales on a fish or the hairs on a mouse, to all point in the same direction. PCP is also important in embryonic development: sheets of cells that can sense direction correctly can therefore move collectively to complete complex tasks (such as closing the neural tube). However, no-one knew whether the specific PCP gene mutations implicated in neural tube defects in humans actually affected the cells’ ability to sense direction, or indeed whether they were even involved in causing the diseases.</p><p>Humphries et al. set out to find out more about these mutations using fruit flies as a model system. The fruit fly is widely used to study the genes and signals involved in direction sensing, especially PCP. Problems with PCP produce easily measurable changes in the wing and eye, showing what went wrong and how badly.</p><p>Humphries et al. genetically engineered fruit flies to have the same mutations as human patients and revealed that these mutations did indeed alter cells’ ability to sense direction. These experiments also showed that each mutation did so in a different way, and with varying severity. This explained why the same mutations caused different levels of neural defects in mice (which are commonly used to study human diseases) and suggests that they might contribute to neural tube disorders in humans.</p><p>These results show potential connections between neural tube defects and direction sensing in cells. In the future, this study and follow-up work could help researchers to understand what types of mutation have the most impact, which may eventually allow doctors to better predict who is most at risk of being affected by these conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>human patient data</kwd><kwd>model systems</kwd><kwd>cell signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM127103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mlodzik</surname><given-names>Marek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY013256</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mlodzik</surname><given-names>Marek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Humphries</surname><given-names>Ashley C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human neural tube closure defects associated mutations in planar cell polarity (PCP) genes are causative of the disease, as revealed in the intricate <italic>Drosophila</italic> PCP model.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural tube closure defects (NTDs) are common congenital malformations in humans, affecting approximately 1 in 1000 births. During embryogenesis, the neural plate undergoes shaping, before neural folds develop and elevate, contact, and then fuse at the midline to create the closed tube structure that will form the spinal cord and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Copp et al., 2003</xref>). Studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, zebrafish, and subsequently mouse, revealed a role for planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling in this process. Further, it was demonstrated that <italic>Looptail</italic> (<italic>Lp</italic>) mice, with mutations in the <italic>mVangl2</italic> locus (see below), fail to establish a neural plate width that will allow for bending and closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Etheridge et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wallingford and Harland, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with a role in neurulation, <italic>Vangl2</italic> (an orthologue of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PCP core gene <italic>Van Gogh/Vang</italic>) is expressed broadly in the neural plate prior to, during, and after closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kibar et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, the second orthologous mouse gene, <italic>Vangl1</italic>, is also expressed in this tissue; however, its expression is more restricted, showing a complementary pattern with <italic>Vangl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doudney et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Torban et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Torban et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p><italic>Lp</italic> was originally defined by two independent mutations (D255E and S464N) in <italic>mVangl2</italic> that map to the C-terminal tail. Both display an identical phenotype, with homozygous mice developing craniorachischisis, a completely open neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kibar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murdoch et al., 2001</xref>). At the molecular level, the mutations were found to disrupt binding between Vangl2 and effectors and also showed reduced membrane localization, decreased protein levels, and defective phosphorylation of Vangl2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guyot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murdoch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Torban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Torban et al., 2007</xref>). Overall, this led to suggestions that the mutants are loss-of-function (LOF), and that Vangl2 is a rate-limiting component in a dosage-sensitive pathway. However, this is in contrast to the earliest genetic studies, which suggested a semi-dominant mutation with incomplete penetrance. This was due to the presence of a looped tail phenotype in the majority of, but not all heterozygotes, caused by delay of posterior neuropore closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Copp et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strong and Hollander, 1949</xref>). Since the original identification of the <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic> alleles, other PCP mutant mice were found to develop NTDs, implicating the pathway defects as a disease risk factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curtin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Etheridge et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hamblet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Merte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murdoch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2006b</xref>). Due to this strong correlation, efforts began to investigate whether human NTD patients might also exhibit mutations in PCP components.</p><p>A number of mutations were identified in patient populations in <italic>VANGL1</italic> and <italic>VANGL2</italic>, as well as additional core PCP and associated proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Juriloff and Harris, 2012</xref>). In each case, the mutation was heterozygous and, interestingly, familial mutations could be found to result in different disease severity among family members. However, this is perhaps not surprising given the complex etiology of NTDs, which are thought to result from a mixture of genetic and environmental factors. Furthermore, digenic mutations were also discovered among PCP genes, consistent with a multifactorial hypothesis, whereby additional factors would be required to achieve a threshold for disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allache et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beaumont et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Marco et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Merello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). This is additionally supported by chimeric mouse studies using the <italic>Lp</italic> allele that showed an all-or-nothing effect in developing craniorachischisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Musci and Mullen, 1990</xref>).</p><p>Despite the progress in identifying mutations within PCP components, data is lacking as to whether these mutations are in fact pathological, with only a few studies addressing this question to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iliescu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kibar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lei et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reynolds et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, evidence has emerged that the <italic>mVangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic> allele may in fact be a dominant negative mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yin et al., 2012</xref>), indicating there is more to investigate surrounding its molecular behavior. In addition, a recessive <italic>mVangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic> mutation was discovered (with substitution R259L) that gave an apparently normal phenotype in heterozygotes. In this case, only 47% of homozygote animals displayed a looped tail and 12% developed spina bifida, a milder NTD as compared to craniorachischisis, leading to the suggestion that this <italic>Lp</italic> mutation is a hypomorphic <italic>Vangl2</italic> LOF allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guyot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Polarization of epithelial cells, and cells in general, is critical for the morphogenesis and function of mature tissues, with perturbation of cellular polarity and tissue organization implicated in numerous diseases. Epithelial cell polarity can be derived in two axes, apical-basal and orthogonal to the plane of the epithelium, which is referred to as planar cell polarity (PCP). PCP establishment is governed by members of the conserved non-canonical Wnt/Frizzled-PCP pathway. Besides the four-pass trans-membrane protein Vang (Vangl1 and Vangl2 in mammals, see above), which was - like all other core PCP factors - originally discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taylor et al., 1998</xref>), a.k.a. <italic>strabismus/stbm</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolff and Rubin, 1998</xref>), they include the atypical cadherin Flamingo (Fmi; Celsr in mammals), the seven-pass transmembrane protein Frizzled (Fz; Fzd in vertebrates with several family members), and the cytoplasmic proteins Dishevelled (Dsh; Dvl in mammals), Diego (Dgo; Inversin/Diversin in vertebrates), and Prickle (Pk). The pathway is synonymous with the asymmetric localization of these core members, which form into two sub-complexes on opposite sides of a given cell, creating an intracellular bridge to convey polarity across the tissue. The complexes also direct spatially restricted downstream signaling through tissue-specific effectors, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement in the majority of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Humphries and Mlodzik, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Singh and Mlodzik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vladar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang and Mlodzik, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Asymmetric localization of PCP complexes is directly observable in cells of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing where they align to the proximal-distal axis. Molecular interactions promote the formation of stable complexes at proximal (Fmi-Vang-Pk) and distal (Fmi-Fz-Dsh-Dgo) cell membranes, with Fmi forming a homotypic interaction across cells. In the wing, signaling leads to the formation of a single-actin rich hair at the distal vertex of each cell. While in other tissues displaying visible PCP features, phenotypes can include fate specification or coordinated cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Humphries and Mlodzik, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Singh and Mlodzik, 2012</xref>). For example, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye, PCP signaling is responsible for determining the differential fate specification of photoreceptors R3 and R4, which also directs rotation and subsequent orientation of the photoreceptor clusters, referred to as ommatidia. These signaling events in turn lead to a mirror-image arrangement of ommatidia across the dorso-ventral midline, or equator. Disruption of PCP in the wing leads to misorientation of cellular hairs or multiple wing hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Humphries and Mlodzik, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Singh and Mlodzik, 2012</xref>), while in the eye chirality or rotation defects of the ommatidia are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mlodzik, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strutt and Strutt, 1999</xref>).</p><p>The importance of PCP during vertebrate development and disease has also become widely recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Humphries and Mlodzik, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simons and Mlodzik, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang and Nathans, 2007</xref>). The PCP pathway is highly conserved in vertebrates, with different tissues displaying PCP readouts or defects upon misregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang and Nathans, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang and Mlodzik, 2015</xref>). One example of this is the above mentioned <italic>mVangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic>, and the first example of a link between PCP signaling and NTDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kibar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murdoch et al., 2001</xref>). Based on the fact that several human patient-derived <italic>VANGL1</italic>/2 mutations exist, and the availability of comparable mouse alleles, we set out to investigate how these alleles impact PCP signaling functionally in a uniform defined genetic background. For this we utilized <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Overall, we focused on six mutations located in the C-terminal tail of Vang, where all molecular interactions have been thus far mapped. We observed that all resulted in aberrant PCP signaling and phenotypes, however, to varying degrees. In the majority of cases, the mutation was dominant, either hypermorphic gain-of-function or dominant negative, leading to altered protein localization of both alleles in vivo. We were also able to show that one mutation was indeed hypomorphic in its behavior. Taken together, our analyses demonstrate in molecular detail the nature of the different <italic>VANGL1/2</italic> alleles. These alleles display defective PCP signaling in vivo, indicating their causative association with the NTD phenotypes of the human patient mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutations associated with mammalian NTD can be found throughout the C-terminal tail of <italic>Vangl</italic> genes</title><p>The mammalian core PCP genes <italic>Vangl1/2</italic>, and <italic>Vang</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, play essential roles in planar polarity signaling. <italic>Vang</italic> interacts genetically with each PCP core gene.

We were interested to explore whether the different mutations observed in human patients could impact PCP phenotypically. Furthermore, we set out to investigate how mutations found in both the mouse and human patients affected signaling at a molecular and functional level. For this, we turned to <italic>Drosophila</italic> as it allows for intricate and quantitative analyses, and is a genetically simpler system with less redundancy - there is only one <italic>Vang</italic> gene in flies - that, importantly, shows functional and mechanistic conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Singh and Mlodzik, 2012</xref>).

Firstly, we were interested to compare mouse D255E and R259L in a genetically uniform background, as the mutations are only a few residues apart, and strikingly the more conservative mutation (D255E) displays a more severe phenotype as compared to R259L in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guyot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kibar et al., 2001</xref>). Secondly, R270H was selected, as the residue is absolutely conserved across all species, and it covers two independent mutational events, as a mutation in <italic>VANGL1</italic> was also observed at the equivalent residue (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) in a digenic combination along with a <italic>CELSR1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kibar et al., 2007</xref>). Thirdly, M328T was chosen because information to date suggests this mutation may be a LOF allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reynolds et al., 2010</xref>), and R353C as it was suggested that effector binding may be reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lei et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Finally, we selected R517H, a highly conserved residue with a conservative mutation where the bioinformatic prediction of its tolerance was unclear (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Overall, we analyzed mutations from both <italic>VANGL1</italic> and <italic>−2</italic>, investigated mutations spread along the length of the C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), compared conservative as well as drastic substitutions, and focused on well conserved sites across species.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Description of Vang mutations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the location of investigated mutations along the C-terminal tail of Vang.

We also included a Flagx3-tag and an attB (bacterial attachment) site. To enable site-specific recombination, constructs were then introduced into a fly strain containing an attP (phage attachment) docking site, along with PhiC31 integrase activity to mediate integration between the attB and P sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bischof et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bischof et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, by using the same attP docking site, we ensured insertion of the transgenes at a constant genetic locus and thus equivalent expression for accurate comparison. We chose to introduce mutations into the <italic>Drosophila Vang</italic> gene, rather than use mouse <italic>Vangl2</italic> or human <italic>VANGL1/2</italic>, to preserve native signaling and to reduce genetic complexity. As the equivalent residues have different numbers in <italic>Vang</italic>, as compared to the mouse or human orthologues, the mutations we investigated are referred by their numbers in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, here and throughout the paper, and are as follows: D317E, R321L, R332H, V391T, K418C and K577H (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> for comparison to mammalian residue numbers).</p><p>In order to first test the contribution of individual mutations, we performed an overexpression experiment.

We therefore chose two regions that would be suitable for qualitative and quantitative analyses of the different mutants, with region 1 showing a more severe PCP phenotype as compared to region 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Different mutations displayed different patterns of hair reorientation within these regions, confirming the system had an appropriate degree of sensitivity for this type of analysis. In region 1, D317E, R321L and K577H showed a distinct phenotype as compared to wt-Vang (over)expression. In fact, their hair pattern was more similar to that of <italic>Vang<sup>-/-</sup></italic> wings or a genetically wild-type wing (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>), included as a reference control that has no phenotype. In contrast, R332H, V391T and K418C all showed hair reorientation patterns similar to the gain-of-function (GOF) effect of wt-Vang overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also observed comparable changes in hair reorientation within region 2. In this case, D317E and K577H mirrored the phenotype of <italic>Vang<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, while R321L showed similarity to the reference control (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>). R332H, V391T and K418C again showed similar patterns to the GOF overexpression of wt-Vang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To quantify hair patterns, we utilized FijiWingsPolarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dobens et al., 2018</xref>), which determines the orientation of each hair within a given region, relative to the proximal-distal (P-D) axis. For visualization purposes, hair orientation angles are represented through arrows and a color gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Through quantification of hair orientation angles, we were able to show that in region 1 all mutations with the exception of V391T had a significant alteration in hair reorientation as compared to wt-Vang overexpression, while in region 2 all mutations showed significant divergence from the wt-Vang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To allow for statistical analysis, the data were pooled into three bins of angle orientation; normal orientation as determined by the reference control <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> (green), as well as a more anterior reorientation (yellow) or posterior reorientation (blue). The full spectrum of angles in 30° segments also reflected the changes in pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We confirmed that similar levels of protein expression were observed for each transgene (due to our experimental design). However, interestingly, D317E, R321L and K577H all showed a notable change in protein mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This mobility shift was also observable in samples from <italic>Vang-/-</italic> tissue and in transfection experiments in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> and Figure 4C). It has previously been demonstrated that Vang is phosphorylated leading to a mobility change and associated band shift on gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strutt et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, phosphatase treatment altered wt-Vang mobility, but it did not impact any of the mutants suggesting that their phosphorylation is reduced or lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As Vang phosphorylation is associated with membrane localization and function, this suggests that the D317E, R321L and K577H mutants are defective in one or both of these regards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strutt et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Dominant behavior and protein localization defects in the majority of mutations</title><p>To further investigate the effect of the respective mutation in the overexpression system, we analyzed protein localization in the pupal wing at ~25 hr APF, by which time wt-Vang is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

However, these mutants do not represent ‘simple’ LOF alleles, as they are dominantly affecting the localization of wt-Vang. R321L also displayed changes to protein mobility but did not lead to significant hair reorientation when overexpressed; its largely normal membrane localization and lack of effect on wt-Vang-GFP suggest it is a hypomorphic allele with reduced protein function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>). R332H and K418C also appear to act in a dominant fashion, but in this case the protein is recruited to the membrane, where it could have a dominant effect on signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

As many of the mammalian studies have focused on the interaction between Dishevelled (Dvl) and Vangl, we first examined the binding between Dsh and Vang, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologues. We expressed wt-Vang-Flag and mutant constructs in S2 cells and tested for their interaction with Dsh-GFP by pull-down. D317E, R321L and K577H all showed a reduced ability to interact with Dsh-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), while normal binding, comparable to wt-Vang, was observed for R332H, V391T and K418C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Next we tested binding between the different Vang mutants and Prickle (Pk), the main effector and cytoplasmic interaction partner of Vang in vivo. The same pattern of binding was observed, with a reduction in binding to D317E, R321L and K577H, but no change with R332H, V391T and K418C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

Interestingly, analyzing the location of these mutants along the C-terminal tail, they map in close proximity to regions of specific effector binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). K557H is situated near to the PDZ binding motif which is involved in Scribble (Scrib) binding (Scrib is required for PCP and has been shown to interact with Vang in both mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Courbard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Montcouquiol et al., 2003</xref>]). We were able to show that Dgo binding requires amino acids 304–323 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and D317E and R321L map within this region. As demonstrated, these mutations do not show specificity for a particular effector but instead a general reduction in binding. This correlation suggests that sites of effector binding along the C-terminal tail highlight regions of high sensitivity for Vang functionality, not just for binding to a particular effector, but in general for the integrity of the entire protein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our analyses revealed a differential and causative behavior for the NTD-associated Vangl mutants. <italic>Drosophila</italic> provides unprecedented depth to the analysis of PCP in the respective mutations through its well-established and detailed in vivo PCP features, the possibilities to study the NTD-mutations in an otherwise wild-type background as well as in the <italic>Vang-/-</italic> context, and both quantitative and qualitative nature of the assays for PCP. Taken together, our data revealed that the mutations analyzed fall into different functional categories and that all patient derived mutations tested are indeed causative of PCP defects, and hence likely causative of NTD in the patients.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Functional definition of both dominant negative and gain-of-function mutations</title><p>The detailed analyses of the NTD-associated mutations revealed specific functional features. For example, the R321L mutation (all numbers refer to the residues in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Vang, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for the respective numbers in mouse and human, unless otherwise indicated) behaves like a mild hypomorphic LOF allele, as demonstrated largely by a lack of phenotype upon over-expression and through the level of rescue observed. This is consistent with data from the <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic>-R259L mouse, where only mild NTD defects were observed, along with no difference in membrane localization or levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guyot et al., 2011</xref>). In our system, besides reduced membrane localization, we also observed its aberrant mobility in western blot assays, an indication that functionality of the protein was decreased, as well as diminished ability to bind effectors. Differences in protein mobility, localization, and effector binding were also observed for D317E and K577H. In contrast to R321L, however, both mutants failed to localize to the membrane, which was reflected in a hair orientation phenotype reminiscent of a <italic>Vang<sup>-/-</sup></italic> wing. Furthermore, both mutants showed largely no rescue in the respective assays. D317E displayed a stronger phenotype as compared to K577H, which correlated with the severity of subcellular mislocalization, highlighting the sensitivity and accuracy of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> assays.</p><p>Expression of D317E and K577H transgenes also led to mislocalization of wild-type Vang, revealing mechanistic insight into the dominant nature of these mutations. For D317E, this is consistent with data from the mouse (D255E), with our data further demonstrating that the mutation does indeed act in a dominant negative manner. It was previously demonstrated that Sec24b promotes the selective sorting of Vangl2 into vesicles for ER to Golgi transport, and that the <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp(D255E)</sup></italic> allele fails to undergo this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Merte et al., 2010</xref>). It has been demonstrated that the <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic> mouse shows reduced membrane protein levels, thought to result from the protein becoming trapped in the ER and subsequently targeted for degradation. While this might suggest a ‘simple’ LOF phenotype, the ability of Vangl1 and Vangl2 to interact complicates matters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yin et al., 2012</xref>). Further, it was demonstrated that Vangl1 is missing from the membrane in <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic> mice but not in a <italic>Vangl2</italic> knock-out, with <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic> also displaying a more severe phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yin et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, a dominant effect was observed in regard to the phosphorylation of wild-type Vangl2, which was reduced upon co-expression of the <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2011</xref>). This is consistent with - and reminiscent of - our dominant relocalization observations and, due to the hair reorientation pattern caused in our experiments, our data support the rationale that the original <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic> alleles are dominant negative mutations and not LOF. This is in alignment with the original genetic studies performed in the mouse that proposed semi-dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Copp et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strong and Hollander, 1949</xref>).</p><p>The patient derived K577H mutation had not previously been investigated. Here, we demonstrate that it is causative for PCP defects, and interestingly showed mechanistic similarity to D317E (the original <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic> mutation, see above), functioning like a dominant negative. Therefore, our data provide a link between the NTD mouse mutations and a human mutation and support the idea that mutations that affect PCP signaling in distinct ways could all contribute to NTD pathology. In line with this notion, we also observed that R332H and K418C displayed dominant activity in functional assays, consistent with the hypothesis that they are also causative in NTD. However, their phenotypic impact was different. These mutants retained effector binding and were localized to the membrane, even if not as distinctly as wild-type Vang. Additionally, the hair re-orientation phenotype observed was reminiscent of a GOF effect of Vang, which results from the non-polar localization of core PCP proteins at the membrane. As their interaction with cytoplasmic effectors and phosphorylation appear to be retained, this points to R332H and K418C behaving as hypermorphs with an effect on the PCP signaling complexes at the membrane. However, due to the relatively high expression levels of our transgenes we were not able to find conditions to analyze changes to protein asymmetry. Nonetheless, taken together and most importantly, the above-mentioned human patient mutations, cause dominant PCP defects, K577H with a dominant negative function, and R332H and K418C as hypermorphic alleles, and thus are likely causative of the NTDs.</p><p>Finally, we obtained data suggestive of V391T functioning as a mild hypermorph GOF. Although in the majority of assays V391T behaved similarly to R332H and K418C, its membrane localization appeared more robust, and rescue experiments were suggestive of the mutation leading to a milder GOF, and not dominant behavior, as was seen with R332H and K418C. Nonetheless, the data for this human mutation is again consistent with it also being causative of NTD.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> as model to define causative nature of human mutations</title><p>While there are caveats of using any specific system, including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the ability to phenocopy and refine results suggested from the mouse, for example in the case of the original <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic>, and to demonstrate sensitivity through quantitative analyses, highlights its utility in exploring the functionality and potential causative nature of human NTD-associated mutations. In fact, our assays were both able to reveal additional functional insight into mutations that had been studied previously by other means and to define functional and mechanistic behavior of previously unstudied human mutations. A popular system to investigate the different mutations is to analyze their localization in MDCK cells. In this assay, the mouse <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic> allele, D255E, was detected within the ER, and showed reduced stability and proteosomal degradation, echoing phenotypes from the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gravel et al., 2010</xref>). The same assay also showed defective localization for S464N, R259L and R274Q (equivalent to R332H in our assay), with all mutations displaying very similar phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iliescu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iliescu et al., 2011</xref>). While a useful assay to reveal potentially damaging effects upon <italic>Vangl1</italic>/2, it does not capture the true nature of the mutation as our in vivo assays do. For example, R259L is milder in phenotype as compared to S464N and displays membrane localization in vivo, which is not captured in the MDCK assay. In contrast, our assays capture these features in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> in vivo system. Furthermore our results define that R274Q/R270H in <italic>hVANGL1</italic>/2, respectively (R332H in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), likely has dominant negative activity. The result in MDCK cells for both R259L and R274Q is also at odds with experiments performed in zebrafish. Both mutants behaved similarly to wild-type protein in overexpression and rescue experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guyot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reynolds et al., 2010</xref>). The lack of phenotype from the zebrafish experiments suggests that, while suitable for mutations that have a strong pathological effect, this system may not be sensitive enough to reveal phenotypic and functional insight with milder mutations.</p><p>In line with this hypothesis, the zebrafish system did show phenotypic behavior for the <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic> mutations, mouse D255E and S464N, and additionally human M328T, with all performing as LOF in assays in the fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reynolds et al., 2010</xref>). Our data also revealed that mouse D255E (D317E in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) displayed LOF characteristics, for example diminished effector binding. However, our assays allow us to conclude further, as discussed above, that the mutant displays dominant negative function. In contrast, our data are not consistent with the zebrafish findings for human M328T. The equivalent <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant, V391T, displayed a mild GOF phenotype. This residue was the least conserved among the mutations tested, and while it is methionine in human and mouse Vangl1, the equivalent residue is valine in mouse, human and frog Vangl2, as well as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Vang. The differences in phenotypic outcome may be due to this discrepancy, and thus investigating the phenotypic behavior of Vangl2 with an equivalent mutation in a mammalian assay could provide further insight. This result also implies, as is to be expected, that the most conserved residues between systems will give the most reliable functional insight. Nonetheless, we were able to define that a mutation at this residue causes a dominant PCP defect, suggesting its importance for overall Vang function in PCP in general and NTD in particular.</p><p>As discussed above, our data set reveals graded phenotypes in vivo, with different mutations displaying more or less severe PCP defects. However, we could not find a pattern to correlate the severity observed with features of the different residues, for example, whether they occurred originally in <italic>VANGL1</italic> vs. <italic>VANGL2</italic>, if the substitution was more conservative or drastic, or whether familial or sporadic. This suggests that it is the location of the residue that exhibits a mutational change as the most important factor in determining phenotypic strength. A prime example of this is the comparison of the two mouse <italic>Vangl2<sup>Lp</sup></italic> alleles with a conservative substitution D255E and more drastic substitution R259L. While they are located in a similar region, the closer proximity of D255E downstream of the transmembrane domain, which also correlates with the Dgo interaction region, suggests it is a functionally more important residue and site, for protein integrity. Consistent with this notion, our observations that the mutations that display LOF characteristics, D255E, R259L and K577H, all map close to regions of effector binding, suggest that these regions are important for the general functional and structural integrity of Vang family proteins. While we cannot rule out that the reduced binding observed for D317E and K577H is due to their mislocalization and inaccessibility to effector proteins, this is clearly not the case for R321L which is localized to the membrane. We therefore favor the above hypothesis and believe these mutants lead to a general structural defect. While many of the NTD mutations may interfere with Vang/Vangl function by affecting its structure, it is also possible that they hit as yet unknown motifs or sites of post-translational modification. For example, R274/270, in human <italic>VANGL1/2</italic>, respectively (R332 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), forms part of a putative D-box ubiquitination motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iliescu et al., 2014</xref>), and two mutations found in the N-terminus of human patients are mapped to phosphorylation sites important for Vang function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kibar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lei et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, this suggests that there is much more to be revealed in determining both the contribution of PCP mutants to NTD, and that analyzing such NTD-associated mutations will reveal important mechanistic insight into Vang/Vangl function in general, in both developmental and disease contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Hair reorientation angles were quantified using the FijiWingsPolarity plugin, details of which can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dobens et al. (2018)</xref>. To perform the quantification, equivalent regions were cropped from three wings in each genotype. Angles of polarity were determined utilizing the plugin and the angles from each genotype combined. For statistical analysis, angles were divided into three categories: anterior reorientation, wild-type, and posterior reorientation. This satisfied the conditions of a valid <italic>Chi</italic>-squared test. Adult eye sections were assigned chirality by hand and orientation angle was defined using ImageJ. For statistical analysis, a <italic>Chi</italic>-squared test was performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Experimental design</title><p>In all cases, experiments were performed on at least 3 distinct occasions to ensure technical replication. To ensure biological replication for experiments involving <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue, 3–10 individual flies were examined for phenotypic similarity. All images and blots within the study were selected as the most representative of the population or findings after this analysis. This approach and sample size is consistent with previous studies performed in our laboratory that have generated reproducible data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In all cases, unless otherwise stated a Chi-square test was performed. This analysis was performed as it is an accepted test for differences between binned distributions as is the case for our data, and so our analysis examined whether we could disprove to a certain level of significance, the null hypothesis that two data sets are drawn from the same population distribution function. For analysis of actin rotation due to the low values in the medium and severe categories these categories were combined and a Fisher’s exact test was performed. The Fisher’s exact test was performed in place of the Chi-square test as the low sample size in specific categories meant conditions of the latter would not be satisfied leading to inaccurate analysis. All analyses were done using Prism software and N value and p values are detailed in tables below.</p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> - Region 1</th><th valign="bottom">p value</th><th valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> -

&quot;Mutations associated with human neural tube defects display disrupted planar cell polarity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor, Hugo Bellen as the Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. We apologize for the lengthy review process but the holidays did not help. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Please address the concerns of reviewer one and where possible those of reviewers 2 and 3.</p><p>We are enclosing the unedited version of the three reviewers comments, as they had some disagreements between them to which we wanted you to be privy. However, after discussion, the reviewers agreed that your paper is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> but that it will require extensive editing to make it more reader friendly for a broad audience (rather than just Drosophilists), and that it is better polished. Note that in the future, a more sophisticated approach should be envisaged using CRISPR technology and that point mutations in the endogenous gene will become the norm, rather than overexpression studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I quite like this new paper, which attacks the knotty problem of assessing pathogenicity within the rapidly expanding universe of disease associated variants from human patients. NTDs are an important problem, and the PCP genes are well known to be associated with NTDs. However, for the vast majority of variants we have little information relating genotype to phenotype. Here, the authors exploit the unique advantages of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system to assess the pathogenicity of several variants in Vangl. The paper is very important, then, for developing a new system in which such pathogenicity can be assessed in the biologically relevant setting of a planar polarized epithelium. It therefore lays down the groundwork for systematic assessment of PCP variants in human disease.</p><p>That said, the paper suffers from being inaccessible to non-Drosopholists and for providing too little context for the findings. With more effort put into the writing, this paper would be an excellent fit for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Comments, in order of appearance in the manuscript:</p><p>1) Improved scholarship would help: The significance of this paper rests in the synthesis of ideas and the integration of scientific communities (i.e. It exploits model system (fly) genetics to understand human disease genetics). To be effective, then, the paper must not alienate any of the stakeholders. So, the biggest liability is the paper's failure to meaningfully deal with the literature outside of the fly. This must be corrected:</p><p>Introduction. It's not clear why the Kibar 2007 paper is cited here. It is not a review of NTDs, but rather a primary paper showing for the first time the Vangl2 is mutated in human NTDs. It would more properly be cited in passages linking Vangl2 to NTDs (i.e. later in the Introduction).</p><p>Introduction. Several errors: Tada and Smith, 2000 did not look at neutral tube closure or neural tissue at all. It should be removed. Wallingford et al., 2002 is a review of PCP and convergent extension and does not mention neural tube closure in any depth; this should be replaced with the relevant paper for the link to neural plate width, which is Wallingford and Harland, 2002. Likewise, while the Wang, 2006b reference does describe PCP genes and neural tube closure, Wang, 2006a is the paper that actually links PCP to neural plate width. It should be cited here.</p><p>Introduction: Wang, 2006b should be included in the list here.</p><p>Introduction: The Looptail mouse was studied by geneticists for decades before it was identified as a mutation in Vangl2. That work is notable because the odd penetrance of the allele led to the conclusion that the mutation was &quot;semi-dominant,&quot; a decades-old conclusion confirmed by the nice experiments here. I recommend the authors discuss and cite (at a minimum) the following:</p><p>Developmental basis of severe neural tube defects in the loop-tail (Lp) mutant mouse: use of microsatellite DNA markers to identify embryonic genotype.</p><p>Copp, Checiu and Henson, 1994.</p><p>All-or-none craniorachischisis in Loop-tail mutant mouse chimeras.</p><p>Musci and Mullen, 1990.</p><p>Strong and Hollander, (1949).</p><p>These papers might also be re-introduced in the Discussion section.</p><p>The Introduction almost seems to be specifically designed to irritate non-Drosophilists. One might read a passage like this and retort that the linkage of PCP to NTDs is really the only truly important PCP finding, and it was made in the mouse. Why risk it?</p><p>2) Not written accessibly: I was able eventually to figure out what was what in Figure 2, but this critical figure was very poorly described.</p><p>Subsection “<italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a sensitive system for investigating the effect of mutations on PCP”, I don't know know what &quot;attP/B sites&quot; are, would nice to have this system explained.</p><p>Figure 2. I do not know what <italic>w1118</italic> is. After some digging, I find it is the control. But then, why is it shown after the mutant? What are we meant to compare the others to? The mutant or the control?</p><p>Figure 2. &quot;ac&gt;&quot; is never explicitly defined, though I gather it means the actin-Gal4 driven construct.</p><p>Figure 2. All the text in B is unreadably small.</p><p>Subsection “<italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a sensitive system for investigating the effect of mutations on PCP”: The text says &quot;all showed a notable change in protein mobility, but the data in Figure 2C do not convince me. What changes are they claiming? Is it a shift? A loss of a second band?</p><p>Subsection “<italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a sensitive system for investigating the effect of mutations on PCP”: I do not think it's appropriate to speculate these shifts may reflect phosphorylation here. Either do the simple experiment or move this to the Discussion section.</p><p>3) Overall lack of clarity: The experiments here are good ones, and overall, I find them compelling. Just the same, they are complex and must be explained clearly. Confusing and even misleading statements include:</p><p>Subsection “Dominant behavior and protein localization defects in the majority of mutations”: &quot;….comparison of localization of &quot;endogenous wt-Vang….&quot;&quot; The interior set of quotation marks here are the authors, indicating that even they know this experiment has nothing to do with actual endogenous vangl. The word endogenous must be removed and the authors must make it clear that this experiment looks at the effect of over-expressed mutant vangl on co-overexpressed mutant vangl.</p><p>Subsection “Dominant behavior and protein localization defects in the majority of mutations”: &quot;…suggestive of competition from the over-expressed Vang-flag for membrane recruitment. I concur with the authors' interpretation, but this result contradicts their claim that their overexpressions &quot;remain within physiological levels&quot;. This should be stated and addressed.</p><p>Subsection “Mutants show altered membrane localization in rescue conditions”: &quot;as compared to wt-Vang.&quot; Unless I am mistaken, this should be corrected to indicate that it is as compared to OVEREXPRESSED wt-Vang.</p><p>4) Subsection “Mutations associated with reduced membrane localization or loss in protein function disrupt effector binding”. An alternative interpretation is that these mutations lead to trapping of Vang in the ER or Golgi, where it cannot access cytoplasmic proteins such as Dvl, thus leading to the observed loss of binding. This is known to be the case for D317E, so this possibility should be raised here.</p><p>5) I think it would be great to include a table that summarizes the data for each mutation and ALSO summarizes the associated human phenotype (i.e. the specifics of the NTD for each).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Humphries et al., report the most comprehensive to date in vivo study in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of neural tube defect (NTD) associate mutations in VANGL2 and VANGL1, the core (and as the authors argue the most &quot;specific) component of the Planar Cell Polarity pathway. A subset of six missense mutations associated with NTDs in human and mouse in the C-terminal region of VANGL is studied. The authors leverage the advantage of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, in which the PCP pathway has been discovered and is arguably best understood. Using Gal4/UAS overexpression system they express the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Flagx3-tagged Vangl protein with the NTD mutations in the equivalent amino acid residues in wild type (overexpression) and vangl2 mutant background (rescue) and quantifying the wing hair orientation, as well as intracellular/tissue distribution of the (tagged) mutant and endogenous Vangl2 proteins, they conclude that the investigated candidate mutations are causative, and some work as antimorphs, hypermorphs, and one as a hypomorph. They identify reduced membrane localization, reduced interaction with intracellular effectors such ad Dsh, Pk, and Scribble and the interference with the membrane localization of the endogenous Vang as key molecular defects of the mutant proteins. One interesting insight is that &quot;these mutations do not show specificity for a particular effector but instead a general reduction in binding&quot; what the authors interpret as an effect of the mutations on &quot;the integrity of the entire protein&quot;.</p><p>Whereas, some studies of VANGL mutations have been reported in other systems (zebrafish, mammalian cell culture), this is the most comprehensive in vivo study. The manuscript reports a large amount of data, is well-reasoned and clearly presented. The authors carefully assess also the level of the analyzed proteins, their mobility in gel electrophoresis, and intracellular distribution. In combination with functional studies this allows them to deduce how individual mutations affect function of the various mutant proteins in PCP signaling in vivo. This confirms and significantly extends some of the previous work (e.g. on the hypomorphic nature of the Vangl2Lp424 -R259L mutation). As such the study should be of interest to the scientific community. However, there are several questions about the interpretations and limitations of the experimental approach that need to be addressed before the manuscript is suitable for publication.</p><p>The study is a missed opportunity, because the current experimental approach has limitations as discussed below. Indeed, it is somewhat surprising that in times when genome editing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is feasible, the author chose ectopic overexpression rather than engineering these mutations into the endogenous locus.</p><p>The limitation of the current overexpression approach is best seen in the rescue experiments. Here, the authors used actin-Gal4 driven expression, which as the authors state &quot;due to the higher than endogenous expression levels of the transgenes, we observed a gain-of-function phenotype with wt-Vang (Figure 4A). Despite this effect, we were able to observe hair reorientation patterns in the absence of endogenous Vang that were consistent with the experiments described above&quot;. As planar cell polarity and processes regulated by it are exquisitely sensitive to the level of Vangl expression (and other PCP proteins), it has been difficult to rescue Vang/Vangl mutant phenotypes by ectopic expression in any system. This also confounds the interpretation of the results of these experiments.</p><p>In the rescue experiments in the eye, e.g. Figure 5 it appears that even the proposed dominant negative mutant forms provide some rescuing activity. Could the authors comment on this?</p><p>On the other hand, the rescue experiments in the wing, do not allow sufficient resolution to ask whether the cell polarity phenotypes in the wing of vang-/- mutants overexpressing the proposed dominant negative Vang mutant proteins are identical to vang mutants, or stronger, or possibly different.

However, after discussion, the reviewers agreed that your paper is suitable for publication in eLife but that it will require extensive editing to make it more reader friendly for a broad audience (rather than just Drosophilists), and that it is better polished. Note that in the future, a more sophisticated approach should be envisaged using CRISPR technology and that point mutations in the endogenous gene will become the norm, rather than overexpression studies.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I quite like this new paper, which attacks the knotty problem of assessing pathogenicity within the rapidly expanding universe of disease associated variants from human patients. NTDs are an important problem, and the PCP genes are well known to be associated with NTDs. However, for the vast majority of variants we have little information relating genotype to phenotype. Here, the authors exploit the unique advantages of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system to assess the pathogenicity of several variants in Vangl. The paper is very important, then, for developing a new system in which such pathogenicity can be assessed in the biologically relevant setting of a planar polarized epithelium. It therefore lays down the groundwork for systematic assessment of PCP variants in human disease.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind comments and are glad they liked our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>That said, the paper suffers from being inaccessible to non-Drosopholists and for providing too little context for the findings. With more effort put into the writing, this paper would be an excellent fit for eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>Our apologies, we have worked to address this and are grateful to the reviewer for pointing out the areas of greatest concern. We have also used a FijiWingsPolarity software based presentation to replace the schematic drawings of wings within Figure 3 and Figure 4. This is in order to promote consistency with our analysis in Figure 2 and also to allow readers an easier interpretation of the different phenotypic features and patterns. We have moved the schematic drawings to the supplement, so we have two ways of representing the data, again hopefully improving accessibility for a wider audience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Improved scholarship would help: The significance of this paper rests in the synthesis of ideas and the integration of scientific communities (i.e. It exploits model system (fly) genetics to understand human disease genetics). To be effective, then, the paper must not alienate any of the stakeholders. So, the biggest liability is the paper's failure to meaningfully deal with the literature outside of the fly. This must be corrected:</p><p>Introduction. It's not clear why the Kibar 2007 paper is cited here. It is not a review of NTDs, but rather a primary paper showing for the first time the Vangl2 is mutated in human NTDs. It would more properly be cited in passages linking Vangl2 to NTDs (i.e. later in the Introduction).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out, we have removed the citation. As we have cited a comprehensive review regarding the link between Vangl and human NTD in the introduction we have chosen to cite the Kibar, 2007 when directly referring to the findings of the paper e.g. Introduction, subsection “Mutations associated with mammalian NTD can be found throughout the C-terminal tail of <italic>Vangl</italic> genes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction. Several errors: Tada and Smith, 2000 did not look at neutral tube closure or neural tissue at all. It should be removed. Wallingford et al., 2002 is a review of PCP and convergent extension and does not mention neural tube closure in any depth; this should be replaced with the relevant paper for the link to neural plate width, which is Wallingford and Harland, 2002. Likewise, while the Wang, 2006b reference does describe PCP genes and neural tube closure, Wang, 2006a is the paper that actually links PCP to neural plate width. It should be cited here.</p></disp-quote><p>Our apologies we made a mistake and referenced the wrong Wallingford and Wang papers, thank you for alerting us to this. We have corrected this error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction: Wang, 2006b should be included in the list here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this reference, apologies for the initial omission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction: The Looptail mouse was studied by geneticists for decades before it was identified as a mutation in Vangl2. That work is notable because the odd penetrance of the allele led to the conclusion that the mutation was &quot;semi-dominant,&quot; a decades-old conclusion confirmed by the nice experiments here. I recommend the authors discuss and cite (at a minimum) the following:</p><p>Developmental basis of severe neural tube defects in the loop-tail (Lp) mutant mouse: use of microsatellite DNA markers to identify embryonic genotype.</p><p>Copp, Checiu and Henson, 1994.</p><p>All-or-none craniorachischisis in Loop-tail mutant mouse chimeras.</p><p>Musci and Mullen, 1990.</p><p>Strong and Hollander, (1949).</p><p>These papers might also be re-introduced in the Discussion section.</p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have included these references and added more discussion surrounding the original <italic>Lp</italic> mouse work, e.g. lines Introduction and subsection “Functional definition of both dominant negative and gain-of-function mutations”.</p><p>The Introduction almost seems to be specifically designed to irritate non-Drosophilists. One might read a passage like this and retort that the linkage of PCP to NTDs is really the only truly important PCP finding, and it was made in the mouse. Why risk it?</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence has been removed to reflect the reviewer’s concerns. Our intention was only to highlight the advantages of using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system for certain types of analysis due to its simplicity compared to mammalian systems, which we discuss later in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2): Not written accessibly: I was able eventually to figure out what was what in Figure 2, but this critical figure was very poorly described.</p><p>Subsection “<italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a sensitive system for investigating the effect of mutations on PCP”, I don't know know what &quot;attP/B sites&quot; are, would nice to have this system explained.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for not having explained this clearly. We have added text to better explain the attP/B system that allows direct comparison of individual transgenes as they’re all expressed from the same genomic insertion.

I do not know what w1118 is. After some digging, I find it is the control. But then, why is it shown after the mutant? What are we meant to compare the others to? The mutant or the control?</p></disp-quote><p>The <italic>w1118</italic> genotype is used as a reference control where no phenotype is observed (“wild-type”). We have reordered the figure to have this “wild-type” reference control first. We describe now in the main text that <italic>w1118</italic> is genetically wild-type, and we have now added more text to hopefully make clearer to a wider audience what this fly genotype is and why we include it. Please see subsection “<italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a sensitive system for investigating the effect of mutations on PCP” and Figure 2 legend.</p><p>The different phenotypes can and should be compared to the reference control, the loss-of-function, and the wt overexpression. This is most useful, as the different mammalian mutants show different hair-reorientation patterns that are reminiscent of the three aforementioned genotypes. These different patterns and phenotypes are discussed within the text, e.g. subsection “<italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a sensitive system for investigating the effect of mutations on PCP”. For statistical analysis we compared the wt overexpression to each mutant overexpression, as we feel this is the most appropriate comparison and control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2. &quot;ac&gt;&quot; is never explicitly defined, though I gather it means the actin-Gal4 driven construct.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.

All the text in B is unreadably small.</p><p>We apologize for this mishap, we have increased the text size in the figure.</p><p>Subsection “<italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a sensitive system for investigating the effect of mutations on PCP”: The text says &quot;all showed a notable change in protein mobility, but the data in Figure 2C do not convince me. What changes are they claiming? Is it a shift? A loss of a second band?</p><p>There are a number of papers detailing the phosphorylation of Vang(l) proteins and associated changes in protein mobility as referenced in the manuscript. This includes our labs previous study (Kelly et al., 2016) as well as other <italic>Drosophila</italic> work (Strutt et al., 2019). Please note the variation in appearance of the phospho band shifts here. We find that loss in phosphorylation can lead to a single lower band or collapsed bands depending on the gel. To further clarify this point, we have repeated these experiments to show the change in protein mobility more consistently throughout the manuscript and the new data can be seen in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C.</p><p>Subsection “<italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a sensitive system for investigating the effect of mutations on PCP”: I do not think it's appropriate to speculate these shifts may reflect phosphorylation here.

Just the same, they are complex and must be explained clearly. Confusing and even misleading statements include:</p><p>Subsection “Dominant behavior and protein localization defects in the majority of mutations”: &quot;….comparison of localization of &quot;endogenous wt-Vang….&quot;&quot; The interior set of quotation marks here are the authors, indicating that even they know this experiment has nothing to do with actual endogenous vangl. The word endogenous must be removed and the authors must make it clear that this experiment looks at the effect of over-expressed mutant vangl on co-overexpressed mutant vangl.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the misleading comment, it was not our intention. We have added to the text to make the experimental approach easier to understand. Please see subsection “Dominant behavior and protein localization defects in the majority of mutations” in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Dominant behavior and protein localization defects in the majority of mutations”: &quot;…suggestive of competition from the over-expressed Vang-flag for membrane recruitment. I concur with the authors' interpretation, but this result contradicts their claim that their overexpressions &quot;remain within physiological levels&quot;. This should be stated and addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment and concern of the reviewer, however, we disagree that there is a contradiction. In this case the Vang-flag is overexpressed, while Vang-GFP remains within physiological levels, as shown by the absence of any GOF phenotypic change by the Vang-GFP expression (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). The change in Vang-GFP localization is due to the abundance of Vang-flag within the cell. We believe that better introduction of the experiment has made clearer the difference in expression levels between the Vang-flag mutants and Vang-GFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Mutants show altered membrane localization in rescue conditions”: &quot;as compared to wt-Vang.&quot; Unless I am mistaken, this should be corrected to indicate that it is as compared to OVEREXPRESSED wt-Vang.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. Yes, this has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Mutations associated with reduced membrane localization or loss in protein function disrupt effector binding”. An alternative interpretation is that these mutations lead to trapping of Vang in the ER or Golgi, where it cannot access cytoplasmic proteins such as Dvl, thus leading to the observed loss of binding. This is known to be the case for D317E, so this possibility should be raised here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed this interpretation in the Discussion section. We feel the data from the <italic>Lp</italic> mouse more likely reflect a loss of binding due to altered structure rather than trapping away from effectors. This is due to the observation that Sec24b is unable to bind and this is the reason for its localization in the ER (discussed in subsection “Functional definition of both dominant negative and gain-of-function mutations”). We also think that there is not strong enough evidence to show that the D317E and K577H mutants are trapped within a particular sub compartment, so we are reluctant to state this within the text. We do however discuss the trapping of <italic>Lp</italic> in the ER, so that readers are aware of these findings (subsection “<italic>Drosophila</italic> as model to define causative nature of human mutations”). Finally, we know that R321L can be membrane localized and so this mutant would be able to access cytoplasmic proteins and it still shows a binding defect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I think it would be great to include a table that summarizes the data for each mutation and ALSO summarizes the associated human phenotype (i.e. the specifics of the NTD for each).</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We agree that it would be nice to correlate the human data directly with our work. Unfortunately, we feel that this is not possible. As NTDs are very complex, it is clear that a number of factors combine to contribute to the overall phenotype (as discussed in our manuscript, Introduction). We therefore feel that stating the phenotype of one particular patient would be an oversimplification, as we cannot be sure whether and what other factors are contributing to disease progression, this is also relevant when considering that some mutations are familial and family members show different phenotypic outcome. We have thus chosen to keep our summary table as in the original version, however, should the editors feel differently on this point, it would of course be possible to adjust this and add this information.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Humphries et al., report the most comprehensive to date in vivo study in the Drosophila model of neural tube defect (NTD) associate mutations in VANGL2 and VANGL1, the core (and as the authors argue the most &quot;specific) component of the Planar Cell Polarity pathway. A subset of six missense mutations associated with NTDs in human and mouse in the C-terminal region of VANGL is studied. The authors leverage the advantage of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, in which the PCP pathway has been discovered and is arguably best understood. Using Gal4/UAS overexpression system they express the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Flagx3-tagged Vangl protein with the NTD mutations in the equivalent amino acid residues in wild type (overexpression) and vangl2 mutant background (rescue) and quantifying the wing hair orientation, as well as intracellular/tissue distribution of the (tagged) mutant and endogenous Vangl2 proteins, they conclude that the investigated candidate mutations are causative, and some work as antimorphs, hypermorphs, and one as a hypomorph. They identify reduced membrane localization, reduced interaction with intracellular effectors such ad Dsh, Pk, and Scribble and the interference with the membrane localization of the endogenous Vang as key molecular defects of the mutant proteins. One interesting insight is that &quot;these mutations do not show specificity for a particular effector but instead a general reduction in binding&quot; what the authors interpret as an effect of the mutations on &quot;the integrity of the entire protein&quot;.</p><p>Whereas, some studies of VANGL mutations have been reported in other systems (zebrafish, mammalian cell culture), this is the most comprehensive in vivo study. The manuscript reports a large amount of data, is well-reasoned and clearly presented. The authors carefully assess also the level of the analyzed proteins, their mobility in gel electrophoresis, and intracellular distribution. In combination with functional studies this allows them to deduce how individual mutations affect function of the various mutant proteins in PCP signaling in vivo. This confirms and significantly extends some of the previous work (e.g. on the hypomorphic nature of the Vangl2Lp424 -R259L mutation). As such the study should be of interest to the scientific community. However, there are several questions about the interpretations and limitations of the experimental approach that need to be addressed before the manuscript is suitable for publication.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments surrounding the findings of our study.</p><p>The study is a missed opportunity, because the current experimental approach has limitations as discussed below. Indeed, it is somewhat surprising that in times when genome editing in Drosophila is feasible, the author chose ectopic overexpression rather than engineering these mutations into the endogenous locus.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that these experiments would of have been an excellent addition, however, we chose the UAS/Gal4 attP/B system to be able to manipulate levels and dynamics of expression to answer different questions. We have discussed our reasoning for our approach in the cover letter, and for completeness we include our comments again here:</p><p>We were particularly interested to explore the nature of the mutations, e.g. gain of function or loss of function. Therefore, we felt the overexpression experiment would nicely address this, shown by either an enhancement, reduction or no change in phenotype as compared to wt overexpression. This coupled with the rescue experiment could then delineate between hypermorphic, hypomorphic, null or dominant negative mutations. As the Vang heterozygote displays very little phenotype, we were concerned that introduction of the mutation in the endogenous locus would not yield as clear results, especially for weaker mutations. This is also complicated by the fact that loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations in core PCP genes both lead to non-polar, abnormal localization. The mutations appear in heterozygote in human patients, however, in these cases the background must be favorable to see pathogenesis (family members with the mutation do not always show disease progression). While we feel we address what we set out to study, showing that mutations found in the human patients do show PCP defects, the next step of course would be to study the intricacies of PCP signaling in an endogenous setting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The limitation of the current overexpression approach is best seen in the rescue experiments. Here, the authors used actin-Gal4 driven expression, which as the authors state &quot;due to the higher than endogenous expression levels of the transgenes, we observed a gain-of-function phenotype with wt-Vang (Figure 4A). Despite this effect, we were able to observe hair reorientation patterns in the absence of endogenous Vang that were consistent with the experiments described above&quot;. As planar cell polarity and processes regulated by it are exquisitely sensitive to the level of Vangl expression (and other PCP proteins), it has been difficult to rescue Vang/Vangl mutant phenotypes by ectopic expression in any system. This also confounds the interpretation of the results of these experiments.</p><p>In the rescue experiments in the eye, e.g. Figure 5 it appears that even the proposed dominant negative mutant forms provide some rescuing activity. Could the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>We of course agree that there is a limitation to this approach, however we included the rescue experiments to support our findings from the dominant assays (overexpression – phenotype and localization). We also feel that they allowed for further interpretation. For example, without these experiments we would have not been able to confirm that R321L is a hypomorph and not a null allele. While the rescue is not perfect, as we acknowledge within the text, we think that the data is fully consistent with our other results. In regards to the dominant negative rescue, we indeed believe that some function of Vang is retained in these mutants that enables the very minor rescue that we see. We have now discussed this in the manuscript to clarify these points (subsection “Rescue experiments in the eye confirm loss-of-function and gain-of-function behavior).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the other hand, the rescue experiments in the wing, do not allow sufficient resolution to ask whether the cell polarity phenotypes in the wing of vang-/- mutants overexpressing the proposed dominant negative Vang mutant proteins are identical to vang mutants, or stronger, or possibly different. This would allow to distinguish between the antimorphic activity of these proteins being exerted through their effect on endogenous Vang protein (as seen in overexpression experiments) or possibly on other proteins as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewer raises an interesting point. We fully agree and would be keen to follow up the D317E and K577H mutants in a future study, to see whether their dominance impacts only Vang or indeed other PCP effectors. These findings could also have interesting implications for the <italic>Lp</italic> mouse.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Humphries et al. use <italic>Drosophila</italic> to examine several mammalian Vangl1/2 mutations that have been associated with neural tube defects.
