However, it is unknown whether life has always followed the same set of strategies for performing these critical tasks. Today, microbes access atmospheric sources of bioessential nitrogen through the activities of just one family of enzymes, nitrogenases. Here, we show that the only dinitrogen reduction mechanism known to date is an ancient feature conserved from nitrogenase ancestors. We designed a paleomolecular engineering approach wherein ancestral nitrogenase genes were phylogenetically reconstructed and inserted into the genome of the diazotrophic bacterial model, <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii,</italic> enabling an integrated assessment of both in vivo functionality and purified nitrogenase biochemistry. Nitrogenase ancestors are active and robust to variable incorporation of one or more ancestral protein subunits. Further, we find that all ancestors exhibit the reversible enzymatic mechanism for dinitrogen reduction, specifically evidenced by hydrogen inhibition, which is also exhibited by extant <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> nitrogenase isozymes. Our results suggest that life may have been constrained in its sampling of protein sequence space to catalyze one of the most energetically challenging biochemical reactions in nature. The experimental framework established here is essential for probing how nitrogenase functionality has been shaped within a dynamic, cellular context to sustain a globally consequential metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ancestral sequence reconstruction</kwd><kwd><italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic></kwd><kwd>early life</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>evolutionary biochemistry</kwd><kwd>metabolic engineering</kwd><kwd>nitrogenase</kwd><kwd>nitrogen fixation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19- ICAR19_2-0007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Amanda K</given-names></name><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Derek F</given-names></name><name><surname>Rivier</surname><given-names>Alex J</given-names></name><name><surname>Carruthers</surname><given-names>Brooke M</given-names></name><name><surname>Seefeldt</surname><given-names>Lance</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaçar</surname><given-names>Betül</given-names></name><name><surname>Pinochet-Barros</surname><given-names>Azul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000925</institution-id><institution>John Templeton Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>61926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaçar</surname><given-names>Betül</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2228495</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaçar</surname><given-names>Betül</given-names></name><name><surname>Rivier</surname><given-names>Alex J</given-names></name><name><surname>Carruthers</surname><given-names>Brooke M</given-names></name><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Amanda K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007015</institution-id><institution>University of Wisconsin-Madison</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaçar</surname><given-names>Betül</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005731</institution-id><institution>Arizona Space Grant Consortium</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carruthers</surname><given-names>Brooke M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>80NSSC19K1617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaçar</surname><given-names>Betül</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Life is constrained in its sampling of protein sequence space to catalyze one of the most energetically challenging biochemical reactions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolutionary history of life on Earth has generated tremendous ecosystem diversity, the sum of which is orders of magnitude larger than that which exists at present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jablonski, 2004</xref>). Life’s historical diversity provides a measure of its ability to solve adaptive problems within an integrated planetary system. Accessing these solutions requires a deeper understanding of the selective forces that have shaped the evolution of molecular-scale, metabolic innovations. However, the early histories of many of life’s key metabolic pathways and the enzymes that catalyze them remain coarsely resolved.</p><p>Important efforts to advance understanding of early metabolic innovations have included phylogenetic inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gold et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sánchez-Baracaldo and Cardona, 2020</xref>), systems-level network reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldford et al., 2017</xref>), and the leveraging of extant or mutant biological models as proxies for their ancient counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zerkle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Soboh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hurley et al., 2021</xref>). However, methods to directly study these metabolic evolutionary histories across past environmental and cellular transitions remain underexplored. A unified, experimental strategy that integrates historical changes to enzymes, which serve as the primary interface between metabolism and environment, and clarifies their impact within specific cellular and physiochemical contexts is necessary. To address this, phylogenetic reconstructions of enzymes can be directly integrated within laboratory microbial model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia and Kaçar, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kacar et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kędzior et al., 2022</xref>). In this paleomolecular framework, predicted ancestral enzymes can be ‘resurrected’ within a compatible host organism for functional characterization. These experimental systems can ultimately integrate multiple levels of historical analysis by interrogating critical features of ancient enzymes as well as dynamic interactions between enzymes, their broader metabolic networks, and the external environment.</p><p>The study of biological nitrogen fixation offers a promising testbed to thread these investigations of early metabolic evolution. Both phylogenetic and geological evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garcia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raymond et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyd et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stüeken et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parsons et al., 2021</xref>) indicate that the origin of biological nitrogen fixation was a singular and ancient evolutionary event on which the modern biosphere has since been built. The only known nitrogen fixation pathway (compared to, for example, at least seven carbon-fixation pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia et al., 2021a</xref>]) is catalyzed by an early-evolved family of metalloenzymes called nitrogenases that reduce highly inert, atmospheric dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) to bioavailable ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). The nitrogenase family comprises three isozymes that vary in their metal dependence (i.e. molybdenum, vanadium, and iron) and, in certain cases, all coexist within the same host organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mus et al., 2018</xref>). Many diazotrophs depend on genetic strategies for coordinating the biosynthesis and expression of multiple nitrogenase isozymes and their respective metalloclusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pérez-González et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burén et al., 2020</xref>), and, in oxic environments, protecting the oxygen-sensitive metalloclusters from degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gallon, 1992</xref>). Thus, nitrogenase enzymes are a central component of a broader, co-evolving nitrogen fixation machinery. These features that create significant experimental challenges for nitrogen fixation engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smanski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burén and Rubio, 2018</xref>) nevertheless also make this metabolism an ideal candidate for systems-level, paleomolecular study.</p><p>How biological nitrogen fixation emerged and evolved under past environmental conditions is still poorly constrained relative to its importance in Earth’s planetary and biological history. Because nitrogen has been a limiting nutrient over geological timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falkowski, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2019</xref>), nitrogenase has long been a key constituent of the expanding Earth’s biosphere. The impact of nitrogen limitation is underscored by human reliance on the industrial Haber-Bosch process, an energetically and environmentally costly workaround for nitrogen fertilizer production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vicente and Dean, 2017</xref>) designed to supplement a remarkable molecular innovation that biology has tinkered with for more than three billion years. How the structural domains and regulatory network of nitrogenase were recruited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyd et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mus et al., 2019</xref>) and under what selective pressures the metal dependence of nitrogenases was shaped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garcia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyd et al., 2011b</xref>) remain open questions. Importantly, it is not known how the enzymatic mechanism for dinitrogen reduction has been tuned by both peptide and metallocluster to achieve one of the most difficult reactions in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seefeldt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stripp et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harris et al., 2019</xref>). At the enzyme level, previous insights into nitrogenase sequence-function relationships have primarily derived from single or dual substitution studies. These have often yielded diminished or abolished nitrogenase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seefeldt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stripp et al., 2022</xref>), though in certain cases improved reactivity toward alternate, industrially relevant substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seefeldt et al., 2020</xref>). Despite illuminating key features of extant nitrogenase mechanisms in select model organisms, the combination of detailed functional studies within an explicit evolutionary scheme has not previously been accomplished for the nitrogen fixation system.</p><p>Here, we seek guidance from the Earth’s evolutionary past to reconstruct the history of the key metabolic enzyme, nitrogenase. We establish an evolutionary systems biology approach for the cellular- and molecular-level characterization of ancestral nitrogenases resurrected within the model diazotrophic bacterium, <italic>A. vinelandii</italic>. We find that variably replacing different protein subunits of the nitrogenase complex with inferred ancestral counterparts enables nitrogen fixation in <italic>A. vinelandii</italic>. Purified ancestral enzymes exhibit the specific N<sub>2</sub> reduction mechanism retained by their studied, extant counterparts, and maintain the same catalytic selectivity between N<sub>2</sub> and protons. Thus, the core strategy for biological nitrogen fixation is conserved across the investigated timeline. Our paleomolecular approach opens a new route to study the ancient functionality and evolution of nitrogenases both deeper in its ancestry and within the broader context of its supporting, cellular machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A resurrection strategy for ancestral nitrogenases</title><p>We designed an engineering pipeline for the resurrection and experimental characterization of ancestral nitrogenases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this scheme, phylogenetically inferred, ancestral nitrogenase genes are synthesized and engineered into the genome of a modern diazotrophic bacterium, enabling the assessment of in vivo nitrogenase activity and expression in parallel with biochemical analysis of the purified enzyme. The engineering and functional assessment of ancestral nitrogenases required a suitable diazotrophic microbial host, owing to challenges associated with nitrogenase heterologous expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vicente and Dean, 2017</xref>). We selected the obligately aerobic gammaproteobacterium, <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> (strain ‘DJ’), an ideal experimental model due to its genetic tractability and the availability of detailed studies on the genetics and biochemistry of its nitrogen fixation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Noar and Bruno-Bárcena, 2018</xref>). We specifically targeted the extant <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> molybdenum-dependent (‘Mo-;) nitrogenase (hereafter referred to as wild-type, ‘WT’), which is the best-studied isozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seefeldt et al., 2020</xref>) relative to the <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> vanadium (‘V-’) and iron (‘Fe-’) dependent nitrogenases. The WT Mo-nitrogenase complex comprises multiple subunits, NifH, NifD, and NifK (encoded by <italic>nifHDK</italic> genes), which are arranged into two catalytic components: a NifH homodimer and a NifDK heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). During catalysis, both components transiently associate to transfer one electron from NifH to NifDK and subsequently dissociate. Transferred electrons accumulate at the active-site Mo-containing metallocluster (‘FeMoco’) housed within the NifD subunits for reduction of the N<sub>2</sub> substrate to NH<sub>3</sub>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Engineering strategy for ancestral nitrogenase resurrection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental pipeline for nitrogenase resurrection in <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> and subsequent characterization, as described in the main text.

This mechanism involves the accumulation of four electrons/protons on the active-site cofactor as metal-bound hydrides, generating the E<sub>4</sub>(4 H) state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Once generated, N<sub>2</sub> can bind to the E<sub>4</sub>(4 H) state through a reversible reductive elimination/oxidative addition (<italic>re</italic>/<italic>oa</italic>) mechanism, which results in the release (<italic>re</italic>) of a single molecule of hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>). N<sub>2</sub> binding is reversible in the presence of sufficient H<sub>2</sub>, which displaces bound N<sub>2</sub> and results in the reformation of E<sub>4</sub>(4 H) with two hydrides (<italic>oa</italic>).

We demonstrate that engineered <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> cells can reduce N<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> and exhibit diazotrophic growth rates comparable to WT, though we observe that the oldest ancestor, Anc2, has a significantly longer lag phase. Purified nitrogenase ancestors are active for the reduction of H<sup>+</sup>, N<sub>2</sub>, and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, while maintaining the catalytic efficiency (described by the H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> ratio) of WT enzymes. Our results also show that ancestral N<sub>2</sub> reduction is inhibited by H<sub>2</sub>, indicating an early emergence of the reductive-elimination N<sub>2</sub>-reduction mechanism preserved by characterized, extant nitrogenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harris et al., 2022</xref>). These properties are maintained despite substantial residue-level changes to the peripheral nitrogenase structure (including relatively conserved sites), as well as a handful within the active-site or protein-interface regions within the enzyme complex.</p><p>It is important to consider that the nitrogenase ancestors resurrected here represent hypotheses regarding the true ancestral state. Uncertainty underlying ancestral reconstructions might derive from incomplete extant molecular sequence data, as well as incorrect assumptions associated with the implemented evolutionary models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia and Kaçar, 2019</xref>). For example, a complicating feature of nitrogenase evolution is that it has been shaped significantly by horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raymond et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parsons et al., 2021</xref>), which in certain cases has led to different evolutionary trajectories of individual nitrogenase structural genes. Specifically, certain H-subunit genes of the V-nitrogenase appear to have different evolutionary histories relative to their DK components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raymond et al., 2004</xref>). However, since our study targets a Mo-nitrogenase lineage, we do not expect horizontal transfer to be a significant source of uncertainty in our reconstructions.</p><p>The N<sub>2</sub>-reduction activity of nitrogenase ancestors suggests that the required protein-protein interactions—both between subunits that comprise the nitrogenase complex as well as those required for nitrogenase assembly in <italic>A. vinelandii</italic>—and metallocluster interactions are sufficiently maintained for primary function. Still, our results reveal the degree to which the organism-level phenotype of host strains can be perturbed by varying both the number and age of ancestral subunits. Importantly, these changes appear to impact phenotypic properties in complex ways, representative of the type of cellular constraints on nitrogenase evolution that would be unobservable through an in vitro study alone. For example, we observed comparable growth characteristics of strains harboring single (Anc1A, ancestral NifD) versus multiple (Anc1B, ancestral NifHDK) ancestral subunits of equivalent age, whereas the lag phase of Anc2 hosting a single, older subunit (ancestral NifD) was increased. Here, growth is sensitive to older, ancestral substitutions in a single subunit while permissive of more recent ancestral substitutions across one or more subunits within the nitrogenase complex. However, a different pattern is observed across in vivo acetylene reduction rates. These are most negatively impacted relative to WT in strains with a single NifD ancestor (Anc1A, Anc2), whereas rates are more modestly decreased in a strain with a complete, ancestral NifHDK complex (Anc1A). These results suggest that ancestral subunits of equivalent age have greater compatibility and yield greater in vivo activity compared to subunits of disparate ages, perhaps owing to modified protein interactions within the nitrogenase complexes The discrepancy between in vivo activity and growth characteristics may also be attributable to impacted cellular processes external to the biochemical properties of the nitrogenase complex itself, and yet nevertheless vital in determining the overall fitness of the host organism. Finally, though we do not detect significant differences in ancestral protein expression here, it is possible that phenotypic outcomes of future reconstructions might be impacted by perturbed expression levels (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kędzior et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garcia et al., 2021b</xref>). To what degree these expression levels are representative of the ancestral state and impact the phenotypic property of interest should be considered in future work.</p><p>That nitrogenase ancestors perform the reductive-elimination N<sub>2</sub>-reduction mechanism—as the distantly related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garcia et al., 2020</xref>), extant Mo-, V-, and Fe-nitrogenases of <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> do today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harris et al., 2019</xref>)—likely indicates that this enzymatic characteristic was set early in nitrogenase evolutionary history and sustained through significant past environmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lyons et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Som et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Catling and Zahnle, 2020</xref>) and ecological diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyd et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zehr et al., 2003</xref>). It is possible that life’s available strategies for achieving N<sub>2</sub> reduction may be fundamentally limited, and that a defining constraint of nitrogenase evolution has been the preservation of the same N<sub>2</sub> reduction mechanism across shifting selective pressures. For example, in the acquisition of V- and Fe-dependence from Mo-dependent ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garcia et al., 2020</xref>), nitrogenases may have required substantial sequence and structural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sippel and Einsle, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eady, 1996</xref>) in order to facilitate reductive elimination given a different active-site metallocluster. It is also possible that alternate strategies for biological nitrogen fixation evolved early in the history of life and were subsequently outcompeted, leaving no trace of their existence in extant microbial genomes. Why these alternate possibilities were evidently not explored by nature to the same degree remains an open question, particularly given the several abiotic mechanisms for nitrogen fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cherkasov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dörr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yung and McElroy, 1979</xref>) and the multiple biological pathways for another, globally significant metabolism, carbon fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia et al., 2021a</xref>). Because our paleomolecular approach is ultimately informed by extant sequence data, it cannot directly evaluate extinct sequences that, for instance, due to contingency or entrenchment, did not persist and become preserved in extant microbial genomes. Nevertheless, evolutionarily informed studies of nitrogenase functionality that define the sequence-function space of this enzyme family will provide a foundation for laboratory efforts aimed toward exploring alternate scenarios. Future work that explores deeper into nitrogenase evolutionary history (and across extant and ancestral nitrogenase sequence space, as charted here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>)) will clarify the degree of functional constraint exhibited by the nitrogenase family, both past and present.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Broadening the historical level of analysis beyond a single enzyme to the organism level is necessary to generate comprehensive insights into the evolutionary history and engineering potential of nitrogen fixation.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Nitrogenase resurrection and the evolution of a singular enzymatic mechanism&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Landry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Matilda Newton (Reviewer #2); Christian B Macdonald (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The reviewers raised questions about the impact of horizontal gene transfers on phylogenetic reconstructions. Further discussions led to the conclusion that this is probably not a major issue but it would be important to address this point in the paper.</p><p>– Reviewer 1 raised the issue that two distinct phylogenies were obtained with the same dataset as well as issues with the reconstruction methods implemented in the computational tools used. These would be important points to verify and clarify as needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would strongly suggest the RaxML issue is explained in the methods. As a community, we should make sure that rigorous methods are used, especially since there is virtually no significant computational cost to the full algorithm anymore. As the Kacar lab is one of the leading groups in this field, it would be great to be clear about this.</p><p>If I misunderstood, and the authors' version of RaxML did in fact use the correct algorithm, this part of my public review should be deleted. It would still raise the question as to why the PAML and RaxML reconstructions differ, which would still need to be explained in the methods.</p><p>I did not understand exactly what the language model analysis shows. It is only mentioned in one sentence in the paper that does not explain the meaning of this analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>• Include a caveat that the reconstructed enzymes can only ever be hypotheses.</p><p>• I appreciated the insertion of the gene into the genome as opposed to plasmid-based expression</p><p>• ASR can only ever reconstruct the ancestor to extant enzymes, we can't rule out that there were other N2 fixation strategies competing pre-LUCA but they have left no trace.</p><p>• Why did you choose to use maximum likelihood inference instead of Bayesian?</p><p>• Figure 3A – please show the y-axis in the log.</p><p>• Could you please represent catalysis in units for kcat and KM? This would make the kinetics easier to compare to other enzymes, both extant and reconstructed.</p><p>• 4C please include WT.</p><p>• In light of the conclusion about a highly conserved mechanism, I would like to see more nuanced mechanistic studies. Pre-steady state kinetics; MD; pH studies.</p><p>• Please infer the age of the hypothetical ancestors expressing anc1 and anc2.</p><p>• Is there a notable difference between how the all-anc complexes (Anc1B) interact as opposed to the hybrids (Anc1A, Anc2)? Is there a notable difference in melting temperature or oligomeric state? This is discussed to a degree in the paragraph beginning line 323, but many of the statements are general and do not posit molecular explanations. What do the authors mean by &quot;historical&quot; amino acid substitutions?</p><p>• The discussion notes the surprising conservation of inhibition by H<sup>+</sup> despite &quot;substantial residue-level changes to the peripheral nitrogenase structure, as well as a handful within relatively conserved, active-site or protein-interface regions within the enzyme complex&quot; Please elaborate on this, with specific attention to the active site. Are the residues involved/mechanisms known? Specify the mutations, how chemically conserved are they?</p><p>• I would be interested to see a discussion of potential ancestral promoters and expression levels. Expression levels are mentioned briefly in the results. I know this experiment must be compatible with the biological system used for the experiment (i.e. it would be impractical to also reconstruct ancestral promoters), but do the authors speculate that an ancestral nitrogenase would have been overexpressed to compensate for lower efficiency or that N2 fixation would merely have been rate-limited?</p><p>• For the uninitiated, please clearly introduce the evolution of metal ion dependence in nitrogenases.</p><p>• How do your results compare to enzyme reconstructions of a similar &quot;age&quot;?</p><p>• I find these results unsurprising. There is sufficient ASR literature to predict that a reconstructed enzyme will have comparable activity to the one or two extant enzymes it is compared to. When using a clade of conserved enzymes using a conserved mechanism, it is not surprising the ancestor conforms. What have we learned? It would be more interesting to probe these reconstructions for promiscuous activities or additional inhibitors. Are they easier to evolve than extant enzymes? If you reconstruct the whole pathway, does it behave differently? Does it act inefficiently and leak metabolites? Are other methods of fixation conceivable?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have several questions and suggestions for the phylogenetic analysis that I do not believe will alter any of the results but may help with presentation or for a better understanding of the uncertainty with them.</p><p>• Why were these particular nodes picked for reconstruction? Are they the highest confidence reconstructions?</p><p>• Why was LG+G+F used? Was any model testing done?</p><p>• What tool was used to align the sequences?</p><p>• Why was ASR performed with RAxML and PAML both?</p><p>• What is the difference between the forak023 and forak013-14 files in the github repository? The topology of tree_forak013-14_branchsupport.tre seems to be the one in the manuscript, but there are no branch support values in that file.</p><p>As mentioned in the public comments, I worry whether HGT may cause issues during tree inference. I believe the simplest way to find out would be to reconstruct a gene tree for each individual nif gene and see how the trees differ. It could also be worth examining whether these or the tree in the manuscript agree with bacterial phylogenies.</p><p>The randomly-selected codon (de)optimization process is a nice inclusion. I was a little unsure about how it was performed, though – were codons swapped randomly until some metric was reached, or a fixed number, or some other procedure? Given the other controls, I do not expect this to change any results, but it would be a nice method for other groups to potentially use.</p><p>Given that the WT and ancestral sequences are 83% identical or higher (roughly akin to humans and mice), is the result that function is conserved surprising? Is it possible that these results say more about sequence (and functional) conservation, rather than a constraint? The UMAP embedding is an interesting approach, but makes this point in a different way, as the ancestral and WT sequences are extremely close in UMAP space. I believe some discussion of sequence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85003.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The reviewers raised questions about the impact of horizontal gene transfers on phylogenetic reconstructions.

Briefly, we do acknowledge that horizontal gene transfer has significantly shaped the evolution of nitrogenases, and we would not expect agreement between protein and species trees. However, these do not impact our central conclusions since we do not make inferences of species-level divergence. A potential impact is if the individual proteins in our concatenated alignments follow different evolutionary trajectories. For the reasons described in more detail in the following responses, we do not expect this to contribute significantly to the uncertainty associated with our specific reconstructions.</p><p>We thank Reviewer #1 for outlining the issue with RAxML, which we became aware of in the process of carrying out this study. We therefore repeated our study with PAML, which, as Reviewer #1 points out, appears to yield comparable experimental results. We have followed the reviewer’s recommendation to highlight the discrepancies in ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithms, so the broader community does not inadvertently use the incorrect algorithm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would strongly suggest the RaxML issue is explained in the methods.

As the Kacar lab is one of the leading groups in this field, it would be great to be clear about this.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully welcome the reviewer’s recommendation to explain the RAxML v.8 issue in our Materials and methods. We initially used RAxML v.8 for ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) (e.g., following Aadland and Kolaczkowski, Genome Biol Evol, 2020). Despite RAxML v.8 documentation describing the algorithm as marginal reconstruction (as the reviewer notes), we were subsequently made aware that it is not the correct implementation. We therefore repeated our analysis using RAxML v.8 for tree reconstruction and PAML for ASR. As the reviewer also points out, ancestral sequences reconstructed from equivalent nodes in the RAxML and PAML analyses were very similar (~95% identical) and both exhibit the core N<sub>2</sub> reduction mechanism described in the main text. Therefore, uncertainty associated with our use of the incorrect ASR algorithm does not impact the central findings of our study.</p><p>In our revised text, we clarify that RAxML v.8 does not implement full marginal ancestral sequence reconstruction and justify our repeated ASR analysis in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If I misunderstood, and the authors' version of RaxML did in fact use the correct algorithm, this part of my public review should be deleted. It would still raise the question as to why the PAML and RaxML reconstructions differ, which would still need to be explained in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the RAxML version used did not implement the full algorithm, as outlined above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I did not understand exactly what the language model analysis shows. It is only mentioned in one sentence in the paper that does not explain the meaning of this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Our aim with the language model analysis was not to test a specific hypothesis, but to visualize the protein sequence space occupied both by extant and ancestral nitrogenases. On one hand, it places the studied ancestors in the context of this available diversity, and also charts a “roadmap” for future studies that will navigate a broader swath of this sequence space. We have now clarified the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>• Include a caveat that the reconstructed enzymes can only ever be hypotheses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a new paragraph in our Discussion that addresses uncertainty in ancestral sequence reconstruction, including the fact that reconstructed ancestral enzymes represent hypotheses regarding the true ancestral state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• I appreciated the insertion of the gene into the genome as opposed to plasmid-based expression</p></disp-quote><p>We’re glad the reviewer appreciated this crucial feature of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• ASR can only ever reconstruct the ancestor to extant enzymes, we can't rule out that there were other N2 fixation strategies competing pre-LUCA but they have left no trace.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that ASR is fundamentally limited to reconstructing the ancestors of whatever descendent enzymes have survived to the present. It is true that we cannot exclude the possibility that other, early-evolved nitrogen-fixing enzymes followed different strategies that were subsequently outcompeted. We address these possibilities in additional text in our Discussion, and have clarified text that discusses evolutionary constraints on nitrogen fixation strategies so as to capture these possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Why did you choose to use maximum likelihood inference instead of Bayesian?</p></disp-quote><p>Both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian phylogenetic methods have previously been applied to nitrogenase evolutionary studies, for example in our (authors Garcia, Kaçar) earlier work (Garcia et al., Geobiology, 2020; Garcia et al., Genome Biol Evol, 2021) and others (Boyd et al., Front Microbiol, 2011). With either method, we observe that the general topology of nitrogenase trees is maintained. Additionally, previous work has demonstrated that Bayesian methods don’t necessarily generate more accurate ancestral sequences than ML methods (Hanson-Smith, Mol Biol Evol, 2010). Finally, given the greater computational expense of Bayesian methods – potentially weeks of computation using our resources with an alignment containing several hundred concatenated sequences – we elected to prioritize broader sequence sampling and used ML.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 3A – please show the y-axis in the log.</p></disp-quote><p>The plot for Figure 3A has been edited to show the y-axis in log.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Could you please represent catalysis in units for kcat and KM?

Pre-steady state kinetics; MD; pH studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Our central finding concerns a major aspect of nitrogenase mechanism (i.e., the reductive elimination/oxidative addition, “re/oa”, model for N2 binding and reduction). These conclusions are not dependent on a more exhaustive investigation of other properties relating to nitrogenase mechanism. We direct the reviewer to Harris et al., Biochemistry, 2019; 2022 which provide a more in-depth description of the re/oa model and kinetics, which is also cited in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Please infer the age of the hypothetical ancestors expressing anc1 and anc2.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not perform time calibrations for our nitrogenase phylogeny, and age estimates based on species divergence are challenged by horizontal gene transfer (e.g., Parsons et al., Geobiology, 2021). Previous studies have estimated the timing of nitrogenase emergence (Parsons et al., Geobiology, 2021, Boyd et al., Geobiology, 2011), but more detailed constraints for the timeline targeted here are not presently available. We look forward to performing our own analysis in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Is there a notable difference between how the all-anc complexes (Anc1B) interact as opposed to the hybrids (Anc1A, Anc2)? Is there a notable difference in melting temperature or oligomeric state? This is discussed to a degree in the paragraph beginning line 323, but many of the statements are general and do not posit molecular explanations. What do the authors mean by &quot;historical&quot; amino acid substitutions?</p></disp-quote><p>Our ability to copurify NifDK complexes from all ancestors (Anc1A, Anc1B, Anc2) and their exhibited activity in vitro suggests that there is no substantial distinction in their oligomeric states (i.e., they all form NifDK heterotetramers that interact with the NifH homodimer during the catalytic cycle). We did not investigate their melting temperatures.</p><p>Nevertheless, we do highlight the organism-level phenotypic differences observed between Anc1A and Anc1B strains, which likely stem from the additional substitutions (relative to WT) in the NifH and NifK proteins of Anc1B, which are not present in Anc1A. We interpret that these phenotypic outcomes might result from perturbed interactions within the complex (though evidently not enough to change the core oligomeric state), which can be more deeply explored in future work. We have now clarified these inferences in the Discussion.</p><p>By historical substitutions, we refer to differences between WT and ancestral amino acids at a given site. Upon reviewer’s feedback, we think that “ancestral substitution” might better capture this intended meaning. We have replaced this terminology and defined it at its first occurrence in the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The discussion notes the surprising conservation of inhibition by H<sup>+</sup> despite &quot;substantial residue-level changes to the peripheral nitrogenase structure, as well as a handful within relatively conserved, active-site or protein-interface regions within the enzyme complex&quot; Please elaborate on this, with specific attention to the active site. Are the residues involved/mechanisms known? Specify the mutations, how chemically conserved are they?</p></disp-quote><p>Our original Results text included a description of the sequence level differences observed between WT and Anc1/Anc2 ancestors. There, we highlight specific residues in functionally significant regions (e.g., I355V in the active site, within a loop considered important for cofactor insertion; F429Y and R108K within the NifD:NifK interface). A global visualization of sequence level differences relative to their conservation is shown in SI Appendix, Figure S3, and a listing of substitutions at relatively conserved positions is found in SI Appendix, Table S1. To our knowledge, the functional significance of many of these amino acid sites are not well characterized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• I would be interested to see a discussion of potential ancestral promoters and expression levels. Expression levels are mentioned briefly in the results. I know this experiment must be compatible with the biological system used for the experiment (i.e. it would be impractical to also reconstruct ancestral promoters), but do the authors speculate that an ancestral nitrogenase would have been overexpressed to compensate for lower efficiency or that N2 fixation would merely have been rate-limited?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that ancestral protein expression is worthy of study, though, to date, not well explored. As the reviewer suggests, we (authors Garcia, Kaçar) recently reported that expression levels of an ancestral and less active RuBisCO enzyme are increased relative to the WT enzyme (Kedzior et al., Cell Reports, 2022). However, we don’t see strong evidence of nitrogenase overexpression in the present study (Figure 3D).</p><p>Since expression levels in our experiments are dictated by regulatory mechanisms possessed by our model, <italic>Azotobacter</italic>, it’s challenging to infer whether our specific results would represent ancestral protein expression levels in an ancient host organism. We can speculate that expression of an ancestral, Mo-dependent nitrogenase might itself be ultimately limited by Mo availability, particularly early in Earth history when bulk marine Mo concentrations were extremely low (e.g., Anbar, Science, 2008). We envision that these possibilities can be tested in future genome engineering studies building off our presented experimental system.</p><p>We have acknowledged the role of protein expression in shaping ancestral phenotypes in additional text within the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• For the uninitiated, please clearly introduce the evolution of metal ion dependence in nitrogenases.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume the reviewer is referring to a statement mentioning evolution of metal dependence in nitrogenases in our Introduction and agree that diversity of nitrogenase metal dependence is not well introduced. We now include additional text earlier in the introduction that describes the variability of nitrogenase metal dependence (i.e., relying on Mo, V, and Fe).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• How do your results compare to enzyme reconstructions of a similar &quot;age&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, our study represents the first laboratory reconstruction of nitrogenase enzymes. Therefore, we cannot yet compare our nitrogenase reconstructions to others of similar age.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• I find these results unsurprising. There is sufficient ASR literature to predict that a reconstructed enzyme will have comparable activity to the one or two extant enzymes it is compared to. When using a clade of conserved enzymes using a conserved mechanism, it is not surprising the ancestor conforms. What have we learned? It would be more interesting to probe these reconstructions for promiscuous activities or additional inhibitors. Are they easier to evolve than extant enzymes? If you reconstruct the whole pathway, does it behave differently? Does it act inefficiently and leak metabolites? Are other methods of fixation conceivable?</p></disp-quote><p>(Some of this text was also provided in response to similar comments from other reviewers).</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comment and have revised relevant sections in our manuscript to clarify the novelty our study and include additional nuance into our discussions of conservation and constraints.</p><p>Nitrogenases are deep time enzymes and are a challenging target for engineering and functional study due to the number of protein components involved, their interactions with a broader cellular network, and their oxygen sensitivity (we now elaborate on these points in our Introduction).

Are they the highest confidence reconstructions?</p></disp-quote><p>The selected nodes are indeed well-supported (SH-like aLRT values ≈ 98-100). We have included this information in the Materials and methods. In addition, we chose a relatively conservative percentage identify threshold based on our (Garcia, Kaçar) prior resurrection studies to ensure we could recover active nitrogenase ancestors in our experimental system.

As we describe in our main text, Anc1A and Anc1B have the same set of descendant proteins and their NifD amino acid sequences are 95% identical.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• What is the difference between the forak023 and forak013-14 files in the github repository?

We have updated the Github repository files and provided filenames that are more easily identifiable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As mentioned in the public comments, I worry whether HGT may cause issues during tree inference. I believe the simplest way to find out would be to reconstruct a gene tree for each individual nif gene and see how the trees differ. It could also be worth examining whether these or the tree in the manuscript agree with bacterial phylogenies.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, as the reviewer points out, nitrogenase evolution is known to have been affected by significant HGT (e.g., Raymond et al., MBE, 2004; Parsons et al., Geobiology, 2021). We would therefore not expect protein trees and bacterial/archaeal species trees to agree, given our dataset. Discordance between the protein and species trees shouldn’t impact our main conclusions since we are not drawing inferences concerning species evolution from our protein tree. Previous work has also demonstrated that the individual nitrogenase genes have followed similar evolutionary trajectories (Raymond et al., MBE, 2004; Garcia et al., Genome Biol Evol, 2022), with the exception of H-subunit genes from V-nitrogenases (VnfH), some of which have diverged recently from molybdenum-dependent genes (NifH). However, given that (1) we are targeting a specific Nif lineage, (2) only one of our reconstructions includes an ancestral NifH gene, and (3) we nevertheless observe phenotypic consistency across multiple reconstructions, we do not expect issues stemming from HGT to have significantly impacted the present results.</p><p>Nevertheless, we concede that HGT is an important aspect of nitrogenase evolution and should be thoughtfully considered in ours and others’ future work, particularly for reconstructions that extend deeper in the nitrogenase phylogeny.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The randomly-selected codon (de)optimization process is a nice inclusion. I was a little unsure about how it was performed, though – were codons swapped randomly until some metric was reached, or a fixed number, or some other procedure? Given the other controls, I do not expect this to change any results, but it would be a nice method for other groups to potentially use.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and agree that providing more details on our codon optimization process would be helpful for the community. We used a semi-randomized optimization process to maximize identify between WT and ancestral nucleotide sequences. Ancestral and WT <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> protein sequences were compared using the alignment output of ancestral sequence reconstruction (RAxML or PAML). For sites where the ancestral and WT residues were identical, the WT codon was assigned. At sites where the residues were different, the codon was assigned randomly, weighted by <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> codon frequencies (Codon Usage Database, https://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/). We have elaborated on our strategy in the Materials and methods and have added the relevant script to the public Kaçar Lab GitHub repository.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that the WT and ancestral sequences are 83% identical or higher (roughly akin to humans and mice), is the result that function is conserved surprising? Is it possible that these results say more about sequence (and functional) conservation, rather than a constraint? The UMAP embedding is an interesting approach, but makes this point in a different way, as the ancestral and WT sequences are extremely close in UMAP space. I believe some discussion of sequence.</p></disp-quote><p>(Some of this text was also provided in response to similar comments from other reviewers.
