In Cs<sup>+</sup> the frequency increase with temperature diminished and the Q<sub>10</sub> of the frequency dropped from ~1.75 to ~1.35. Unexpectedly in Cs<sup>+</sup>, the frequency dynamics became non-monotonic during temperature transitions; frequency initially dropped as temperature increased, then rose once temperature stabilized, creating a characteristic ‘jag’. Interestingly, these jags persisted during temperature transitions in Cs<sup>+</sup> when the pacemaker was isolated by picrotoxin, although the temperature-induced change in frequency recovered to control levels.

The frequency and phase of these components dictates the function and efficiency of the overall motion. Many locomotor systems maintain effectiveness by changing phase concomitantly with frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grillner, 1981</xref>). Some systems, such as lamprey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen et al., 1992</xref>) and leech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marder and Calabrese, 1996</xref>) swimming, require constant phase across frequencies. In either case, when such systems transition to new steady frequencies, they normally do so in a smooth, monotonic fashion. However, control theory recognizes that while smooth transitions may be optimal, they are not inevitable. The constraints of a system can cause a non-monotonic response to a state change, in some cases even having an initial change opposite to the final appropriate response. While the dynamics of many motor patterns under stable conditions have been extensively studied, how such systems appropriately adjust their phase and frequency as conditions change and avoid turbulent dynamics has been less often addressed.</p><p>Many rhythmic neurons and muscles utilize the hyperpolarization-activated inward current, I<sub>h</sub>, in generating their rhythmic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DiFrancesco, 1985</xref>). I<sub>h</sub> is mediated by the HCN-family of channels and is activated by hyperpolarization. This property allows excitable cells to depolarize after periods of inhibition, contributing to post-inhibitory rebound bursting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McCormick and Pape, 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McCormick and Pape, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goaillard et al., 2010</xref>). While some systems produce patterns myogenically, e.g., the vertebrate heartbeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DiFrancesco, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hagiwara and Irisawa, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsien et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DiFrancesco and Tromba, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yanagihara and Irisawa, 1980</xref>), other systems rely on networks of cells to produce their activity, such as the leech heartbeat generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nadim et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angstadt and Calabrese, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calabrese et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wenning et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stent et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tobin and Calabrese, 2005</xref>) or the mammalian respiratory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>While I<sub>h</sub> is utilized for rhythmogenesis in these systems, even a basic pattern of activity of a hard-wired neural circuit can be achieved through multiple combinations of intrinsic and synaptic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso and Marder, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso and Marder, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schulz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schulz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Prinz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Golowasch et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Golowasch et al., 1999b</xref>). The set of properties that allow functional activity during one set of conditions is likely inadequate for all conditions. Theoretical studies suggest that parameter sets that can produce similar activity in one environment display different robustness when the environment changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso and Marder, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso and Marder, 2019</xref>). As I<sub>h</sub> is a key component of ubiquitous rhythmic activity, we explored its potentially changing role during transitions in conditions a rhythmic system might encounter.</p><p>To this end, we utilized the response of the pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, <italic>Cancer borealis</italic>, to temperature changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso and Marder, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marder and Bucher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rinberg et al., 2013</xref>). The pyloric rhythm controls food filtering by the crustacean pylorus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McGaw and Curtis, 2013</xref>). Frequency is dictated by a three neuron electrically coupled pacemaker kernel, made up of the intrinsically oscillating anterior burster (AB) neuron and the two pyloric dilator (PD) neurons. The pacemaker kernel neurons make inhibitory synapses onto the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron and several pyloric (PY) neurons, whose properties are such that LP recovers from pacemaker inhibition before PY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marder and Bucher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hartline, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rabbah and Nadim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hartline and Gassie, 1979</xref>). At ~11°C the frequency of the pyloric rhythm is typically about 1 Hz with a characteristic triphasic rhythm of activity in the PD, LP, and PY neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hamood et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As a poikilotherm, temperature changes are relevant to a crab in its natural environment.

Previous work has demonstrated that I<sub>h</sub> increases in pyloric cells as temperature increases, but not whether this increase is necessary for normal responses of pyloric activity to temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peck et al., 2006</xref>). To probe the role I<sub>h</sub> plays across changing conditions, we pharmacologically blocked I<sub>h</sub> using cesium ions during temperature changes and observed the effect of this block on the frequency increase and phase constancy of the pyloric rhythm. This revealed unanticipated changes in frequency during acute transitions between temperatures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The steady-state frequency increase in response to elevated temperature was decreased by Cs<sup>+</sup></title><p>We used a combination of extracellular and intracellular recordings to monitor pyloric activity while the STG was superfused sequentially with saline or saline with 5 mM CsCl to block I<sub>h</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harris-Warrick et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goeritz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). We began recording at the standard temperature of 11°C and changed the temperature of the superfused solution in steps of 2°C up to 21°C using a Peltier device. The dish temperature and pyloric activity were allowed to stabilize for 4 min between steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To confirm the effectiveness of Cs<sup>+</sup> in reducing I<sub>h</sub> across this temperature range, we voltage clamped pyloric neurons (PD and LP) at the temperature extremes used in the experiment, 11°C and 21°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We held cells at –50 mV and hyperpolarized for 12 s in –10 mV steps from –100 mV to –120 mV. Because I<sub>h</sub> is slow to activate, we quantified I<sub>h</sub> as the difference between the initial current needed to hold the hyperpolarization and the current required to hold the hyperpolarization at steady state.

Based on observations that the frequency decrease is associated with an elongation of the depolarizing phase of a burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4G</xref>), we hypothesize that the decrease in frequency may be primarily caused by effects of temperature on the parameters of the transient potassium current, I<sub>A</sub>. I<sub>A</sub> is an inactivating, hyperpolarizing current activated by depolarization; its activation slows depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harris-Warrick et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MacLean et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greenberg and Manor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tierney and Harris-Warrick, 1992</xref>). Each of its state transitions (activation, inactivation, deinactivation) may be differentially affected by temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tang et al., 2010</xref>). If deinactivation is more accelerated or altered by temperature than inactivation, then as temperature increases a larger pool of I<sub>A</sub> channels would be available to be activated, resulting in transiently more I<sub>A</sub> during the depolarizing phase of a PD cycle. This proposed transient increase in I<sub>A</sub> would account for the decrease in frequency and elongated depolarization we observed. While temperature continued to change, the difference in parameters would continue to grow. Once the temperature stabilized a new equilibrium between activation, inactivation, and deinactivation could be achieved, potentially resulting in decreased total I<sub>A</sub> during a pyloric cycle, an increase in the rate of depolarization, and an increase in frequency. I<sub>h</sub> opposes and is correlated with I<sub>A</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schulz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MacLean et al., 2005</xref>) and prevents a neuron from spending as much time in the I<sub>A</sub>-deinactivating hyperpolarized state. Thus, when intact, we expect I<sub>h</sub> obscures the dynamic frequency effects we propose to be caused by differential temperature sensitivities in I<sub>A</sub> parameters.</p><p>Mathematically, activity patterns like those seen in Cs<sup>+</sup> where the output resulting from a step input first goes ‘in the wrong direction’ have been described in control theory as having a ‘non-minimum phase dynamic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franklin and Powell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Khammash, 2016</xref>). Typically, non-minimum phase systems are fragile and difficult to control, as they are prone to positive feedback loops unless the rate of sensor-induced adjustment is slow. While not uncommon in physics, such dynamics are generally avoided by biological systems to ensure robust responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Khammash, 2016</xref>). Our data suggest I<sub>h</sub> plays an important role in preventing the system from producing such turbulent behavior, resulting in the typical near-instantaneous and smooth increase in frequency upon changes in temperature. Future modeling may help demonstrate this principle in more general settings.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>I<sub>h</sub> dictates the steady-state increase in pyloric frequency to temperature through network effects</title><p>Given that previous studies showed I<sub>h</sub> increases in PD and LP cells at elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peck et al., 2006</xref>), it is unsurprising that blocking I<sub>h</sub> with Cs<sup>+</sup> had a larger effect at higher temperatures; the difference in I<sub>h</sub> between control and Cs<sup>+</sup> is expected to be larger at elevated temperatures. As I<sub>h</sub> is a depolarizing current, its removal would be consistent with the larger difference in frequency between saline and Cs<sup>+</sup> seen at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found control levels of temperature-induced frequency increase in the presence of Cs<sup>+</sup> when the pacemaker kernel was isolated by PTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). This result suggests that when temperature increases, the pacemaker kernel can increase the frequency of the pyloric rhythm without the contribution of depolarizing I<sub>h</sub>. However, if the follower neurons can feed back to the pacemaker and I<sub>h</sub> is blocked, the feedback limits the increase in frequency with increased temperature.</p><p>Potentially the temperature-induced increase in I<sub>h</sub> seen in LP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tang et al., 2010</xref>) is partially responsible for permitting the temperature-induced frequency increase seen in control conditions, and its removal by Cs<sup>+</sup> decreased the temperature-induced frequency increase. We noted that in Cs<sup>+</sup>, LP phase advanced with a preserved duty cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and advanced further with increased temperature compared to control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>). According to experiments on the effects of differently timed inhibition on pyloric frequency (phase response curve [PRC]), phase advance of LP would be expected to either increase frequency or have no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mamiya and Nadim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nadim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weaver and Hooper, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thirumalai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hooper et al., 2015</xref>), contrary to what we observed. However, temperature-induced I<sub>h</sub> increase in the pacemaker kernel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peck et al., 2006</xref>) is expected to advance the PRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soofi and Prinz, 2015</xref>), which could permit the increase in frequency with temperature observed in control conditions despite LP inhibition. In Cs<sup>+</sup>, this advance of the PRC would not occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soofi and Prinz, 2015</xref>), potentially causing the observed reduction in temperature-induced frequency increase in Cs<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>). In Cs<sup>+</sup>+PTX, there is no inhibition from LP to potentially slow down frequency, so compensation by increased I<sub>h</sub> in PD would be unnecessary. Overall, while I<sub>h</sub> is often associated with rhythmogenesis in intrinsic oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 1979</xref>), our results demonstrate its increasing role in appropriate regulation of persistent oscillatory frequency though network feedback at elevated temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>LP phase in Cs<sup>+</sup></title><p>Surprisingly, application of Cs<sup>+</sup> phase advanced LP, even more than might be expected when taking into account the advance in PD offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Previous studies reported no significant advance in LP, though these studies were in <italic>Panulirus interruptus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rodgers et al., 2011</xref>). Latency to LP firing increased after Cs<sup>+</sup> application but was insufficient to maintain or delay LP’s phase given the increased period at 11°C. Increased period is known to advance LP onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mamiya and Nadim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hooper, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martinez et al., 2019</xref>), but our observed LP onset advance was maintained even in period-matched samples between Cs<sup>+</sup> and control conditions. While in these matched samples PD bursting was shorter in Cs<sup>+</sup>, the time by which PD offset advanced was almost half of what LP advanced and did not significantly correlate with how much LP advanced. The PD to LP synapse is depressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mouser et al., 2008</xref>), such that longer recovery times between PD bursts, such as seen in period-matched Cs<sup>+</sup> samples, would be expected to strengthen the synapse, resulting in longer latencies to LP bursting, not shorter. Additionally, PY onset did not advance in period-matched samples. While the synapse from the pacemaker cells to PY and LP are not the same, they have been reported to have similar properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rabbah and Nadim, 2005</xref>) and there is no reason a priori to believe that Cs<sup>+</sup> differentially affected these synapses.</p><p>It was also surprising that when I<sub>h</sub> was blocked, LP firing <italic>further</italic> advanced with temperature-mediated frequency increases. Phase maintenance is sometimes explained through a balance of synaptic depression and I<sub>A</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greenberg and Manor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mouser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bose et al., 2004</xref>). The models of exploring phase constancy in oscillatory networks reminiscent of the STG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greenberg and Manor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manor et al., 2003</xref>) suggest that given I<sub>h</sub> acts in opposition to I<sub>A</sub>, normally I<sub>h</sub> should impair phase constancy by <italic>shortening</italic> LP latencies as the period increases and advancing LP, and that this effect should be minimized when period is decreasing, such as was seen when temperature increased. By this logic, I<sub>h</sub> removal would be expected to improve phase constancy and to have less effect on phase as period decreased, which is the opposite of what we observed. It therefore remains unclear why in Cs<sup>+</sup> LP was advanced and then further advanced as frequency increased with elevated temperatures. Again, more detailed modeling in the future may shed light on the precise property interactions that produce this unexpected further phase advancement.</p><p>While Cs<sup>+</sup> has been reported to block channels other than those responsible for I<sub>h</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pape, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wischmeyer and Karschin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coggan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harding et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Adams, 1980</xref>), there is no evidence that these other channels are playing significant roles in the current preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, Cs<sup>+</sup> primarily blocks potassium-passing channels in a voltage-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clay and Shlesinger, 1984</xref>) such that only inward currents are blocked when Cs<sup>+</sup> is extracellular. Additionally, we did not observe an increase in pyloric frequency or a consistent intracellular depolarization in Cs<sup>+</sup>, both of which would be expected if Cs<sup>+</sup> were indirectly changing the extracellular potassium concentration through effects on other potassium channels. Therefore, as a first approximation most of the effects seen here can likely be attributed to Cs<sup>+</sup> block of I<sub>h</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Concluding remarks and general implications</title><p>There was substantial animal to animal variability in the effect of Cs<sup>+</sup> block of I<sub>h</sub>. Likely this variability stems from the degeneracy in the combinations of currents that can result in a particular motor pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso and Marder, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schulz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Prinz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krenz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goaillard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anwar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marder et al., 2022</xref>). Some combinations likely rely more on I<sub>h</sub> to produce the prototypical response to temperature. Despite this variability, without I<sub>h</sub>, the pyloric network was unable to reliably produce either its typical rapid and smooth increase in frequency in response to temperature change, or its typical steady-state increase in frequency. As such I<sub>h</sub> may act as a buffer to transient response hiccups that may be caused by intrinsic properties and as a buffer to the limiting effects of network inhibition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and experimental preparation</title><p><italic>C. borealis</italic> were purchased from Commercial Lobster (Boston, MA, USA) and maintained in tanks containing artificial seawater (Instant Ocean) at 11–13°C on a 12 hr light/dark cycle for at least 1 week before use.

This study is relevant to the general problem that some rhythmic motor systems adjust to changing environmental conditions and state changes by increasing the cycle frequency in a smooth monotonic fashion while maintaining the relative timing of different network activity pattern phases that determine proper motor coordination. How this is achieved mechanistically in complex dynamic motor networks is not understood, particularly how the frequency and phase adjustments are achieved as conditions change while avoiding operational instabilities on different time scales. The authors specifically studied the contributions of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih), which is involved in rhythm control, to the adjustments of frequency and phases in the pyloric rhythmic pattern as the temperature was altered from 11 degrees C to 21 degrees C. They present compelling evidence that this current is a critical biophysical feature in the ability of this system to adjust transiently and persistently to temperature perturbations appropriately. After blocking Ih in the pyloric network with cesium, the network was unable to reliably produce its characteristic rapid and smooth increase in the frequency of the triphasic rhythmic motor pattern in response to increasing temperature or its typical steady-state increase in frequency over this Q10 temperature range.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The authors addressed this problem by technically rigorous experiments in the crab <italic>Cancer borealis</italic> stomatogastric ganglion (STG) in vitro, which readily allows for neuronal activity recording in a behaviorally and architecturally defined rhythmic neural circuit in conjunction with the application of blockers of Ih and synaptic receptors to disrupt circuit interactions. This approach is an effective way to experimentally investigate how complex rhythmic networks, at least in poikilotherms, mechanistically adjust to environmental perturbations such as temperature.</p><p>(2) While previous work demonstrated that Ih increases in pyloric neurons as temperature increases, the authors here establish that this increase is necessary for normal responses of STG neural activity to temperature, which consist of a smooth monotonic increase in the frequency of rhythmic activity with increasing temperature.</p><p>(3) The data shows that blocking Ih with cesium causes the frequency to transiently decrease (&quot;jags&quot;) when the temperature increases and then increases after the temperature stabilizes at a steady state, revealing a non-monotonic frequency response to temperature perturbations.</p><p>(4) The authors dissect some of the underlying neuronal and circuit dynamics, presenting evidence that after blocking Ih, the non-monotonic jags in the frequency response are mediated by intrinsic properties of pacemaker neurons, while in the steady state, Ih determined the overall frequency change (i.e., temperature sensitivity) through network interactions.</p><p>(5) The authors' results highlight more complex dynamic responses to increasing temperature for the first time, suggesting a longer timescale process than previously recognized that may result from interactions between multiple channels and/or ion channel kinetics.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The involvement of Ih in achieving the frequency and phase adjustments as conditions change and allowing smooth transitions to avoid operational instabilities in other complex rhythmic motor networks, for example, in homeotherms, is not established, so the present results may have limited general extrapolations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98844.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Using the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system (STNS), the authors present an interesting study wherein the contribution of the Ih current to temperature-induced changes in the frequency of a rhythmically active neural circuit is evaluated. Ih is a hyperpolarization-activated cation current that depolarizes neurons. Under normal conditions, increasing the temperature of the STNS increases the frequency of the spontaneously active pyloric rhythm. Notably, under normal conditions, as temperature systematically increases, the concomitant increase in pyloric frequency is smooth (i.e., monotonic). By contrast, blocking Ih with extracellular cesium produces temperature-induced pyloric frequency changes that follow a characteristic sawtooth response (i.e., non-monotonic). That is, in cesium, increasing temperature initially results in a transient drop in pyloric frequency that then stabilizes at a higher frequency. Thus, the authors conclude that Ih establishes a mechanism that ensures smooth changes in neural network frequency during environmental disturbances, a feature that likely bestows advantages to the animal's function.</p><p>The study describes several surprising and interesting findings. In general, the study's primary observation of the cesium-induced sawtooth response is remarkable. To my knowledge, this type of response has not yet been described in neurobiological systems, and I suspect that the unexpected response will be of interest to many readers.</p><p>At first glance, I had some concerns regarding the use of extracellular cesium to understand network phenomena. Yes, extracellular cesium blocks Ih. But extracellular cesium has also been shown to block astrocytic potassium channels, at least in mammalian systems (i.e., K-IR, PMID: 10601465), and such a blockade can elevate extracellular potassium. I was heartened to see that the authors acknowledge the non-specificity of cesium (lines 320-325) and I agree with the authors' contention that &quot;a first approximation most of the effects seen here can likely be attributed to Cs+ block of Ih&quot;. Upon reflecting on the potential confound, I was also reassured to see that extracellular cesium alone does not in fact increase pyloric frequency, an effect that might be expected if cesium indirectly raises [K<sup>+</sup>]outside. If the authors agree, then I suggest including that point in their discussion.</p><p>In summary, the authors present a solid investigation of a surprising biological phenomenon. In general, my comments are fairly minor. Thanks for contributing an interesting study.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A major strength of the study is the identification of an ionic conductance that mediates stable, monotonic changes in oscillatory frequency that accompany changes in the environment (i.e., temperature).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A potential experimental concern stems from the use of extracellular cesium to attribute network effects specifically to Ih. Previous work has shown that extracellular cesium also blocks inward-rectifier potassium channels expressed by astrocytes, and that such blockade may also elevate extracellular potassium, an action that generally depolarizes neurons. Notably, the authors address this potential concern in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98844.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper presents a systematic analylsis of the role of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (the h current) in the response of the pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab.

Our paper has greatly benefited from their advice. Like Reviewer 1, we acknowledge that while the exact involvement of Ih in allowing smooth transitions is likely not universal across all systems, our demonstration of the ways in which such currents can affect the dynamics of the response of complex rhythmic motor networks provides valuable insight. To address the concerns of Reviewer 2, we included a sentence in the discussion to highlight the fact that cesium neither increased the pyloric frequency nor caused consistent depolarization in intracellular recordings. We also highlighted that these observations suggest both that cesium is not indirectly raising [K+]outside and support the conclusion that the effects of cesium are primarily through blockade of Ih rather than other potassium channels.</p><p>Reviewer 3 raised some important points about modeling. While the lab has models that explore the effects of temperature on artificial triphasic rhythms, these models do not account for all the biophysical nuances of the full biological system. We have limited data about the exact nature of temperature-induced parameter changes and the extent to which these changes are mediated by intrinsic effects of temperature on protein structure versus protein interactions/modification by processes such as phosphorylation. With respects to the A current, Tang et al., 2010 reported that the activation and inactivation rates are differentially temperature sensitive but we do not have the data to suggest whether or not the time courses of such sensitivities are different. As such, we focus our discussion on the properties we know are modulated by temperature, i.e. activation rates. Within the discussion we now include the suggestion that future, more comprehensive modeling may be appropriate to further elucidate the ways in which reducing Ih may produce the here reported experimentally observed effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>A figure showing examples of the voltage-clamp traces for the critical measurements of the extent of Ih block by 5 mM CsCl in PD and LP neurons at the temperature extremes in these preparations is not shown, and the authors should consider including such a figure, perhaps as a supplemental figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Supplemental Figure 1 containing voltage-clamp traces demonstrating the extent of Ih block by 5mM CsCl in PD and LP neurons at 11 and 21°C. Due to technical concerns, different preparations were used in the measurements at 11°C and 21°C, but the point that the H-current is reduced is demonstrated in all cases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>Specific (Minor) Comments:</p><p>(1) Line 83: In Cs+ &quot;at 11°C, the pyloric frequency was significantly decreased compared to control conditions (Saline: 1.2± 0.2 Hz; Cs+ 0.9± 0.2 Hz)&quot;.</p><p>As above, the authors often report that cesium generally reduces pyloric frequency. Figure 5A demonstrates this action quite nicely. However, cesium's effect on pyloric frequency at 11°C seems less robust in Figure 1C. Why the discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>There is variability in the effects of Cs+ on the pyloric frequency. As noted, the standard deviation in frequency in both conditions is 0.2Hz. As such, there are some cases in which the initial frequency drop in Cs+ compared to control was relatively small. 1C is one such case, but was selected as an example because of its clear reduction in temperature sensitivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I don't understand what the arrows/dashed lines are trying to convey in Figure 3C.</p></disp-quote><p>The arrows/dashed lines represent the criteria used to define a cycle as “decreasing in frequency” (Temperature Increasing) or “increasing in frequency” (Temperature Stable). We have amended lines 130 and 137 in the text to hopefully clarify this point, as well as the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 118/168. The description of cesium's specific action on the depolarizing portion of PD activity is a bit confusing. In my mind, &quot;depolarization phase&quot; refers to the point at which PD is most depolarized. Perhaps restating the phrase to &quot;elongation of the depolarizing trajectory&quot; is less confusing. The authors may also want to consider labeling this trajectory in Figure 2C.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed “depolarization phase” to “depolarizing phase” to highlight that this is the period during which the cell is depolarizing, rather than at its most depolarized. We consider the plateau of the slow wave and spiking (the point at which PD is most depolarized) to be the “bursting phase”. We have labeled these phases in Figure 2C as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 3C legend: a few words seem to be missing.

I am not saying they have to add modeling to this already extensive and detailed paper, but it would be useful to know how much of these temperature effects have been modeled, for example in the following locations.</p><p>(2) Line 259 - &quot;Mathematically...&quot; - Is there a computational model of H current that has shown this decrease in frequency in pyloric neurons? If you are working on one for the future, you could mention this.</p></disp-quote><p>There is not currently a model in which the reduction of the H-current results in the non-minimum phase dynamics in the frequency response to temperature seen experimentally. It should be noted that our existing models of pyloric activity responses to temperature are not well suited to investigate such dynamics in their current iterations. Further work is necessary to demonstrate the principles observed experimentally in computational modeling, and we have added a sentence to the paper to reflect this point (Line 268).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 318 - &quot;therefore it remains unclear&quot; - I thought they had models of the circuit rhythmicity. Do these models include temperature effects? Can they comment on whether their models of the circuit show an opposite effect to what they see in the experiment? I'm not saying they have to model these new effects as that is probably an entirely different paper, but it would be interesting to know whether current models show a different effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We have some models of the pyloric response to temperature, but these models were specifically selected to maintain phase across the range of temperature. When Ih was reduced in these models, a variety of effects on phase and duty cycle were seen. These models were selected to have the same key features of behavior as the pyloric rhythm, but do not capture all the biophysical nuances of the complete system, and therefore should not necessarily be expected to reflect the experimental findings in their current iterations. Furthermore, these models are meant to have temperature as a static, rather than dynamic input, and thus are ill-suited to examine the conditions of our experiments. The models in their current state are not sufficiently relevant to these experimental findings that we they can illuminate the present paper `2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) &quot;If deinactivation is more accelerated or altered by temperature than inactivation...While temperature continued to change, the difference in parameters would continue to grow&quot; - This is described as a difference in temperature sensitivity, but it seems like it is also a function of the time course of the response to change in temperature (i.e. the different components could have the same final effect of temperature but show a different time course of the change).</p></disp-quote><p>We know from Tang et al, 2010, that activation and inactivation rates of the A current are differentially temperature sensitive. We have no evidence to suggest that the time course of the response to temperature of various parameters differ. The physical actions of temperature on proteins are likely to be extremely rapid, making a time course difference on the order of tens of seconds less unlikely, though not impossible. Modeling of the biophysics might illuminate the relative plausibility of these different mechanisms of action, but we feel that our current suggested explanation is reasonable based on existing information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Is it known how temperature is altering these channel kinetics? Is it via an intrinsic rearrangement of the protein structure, or is it a process that involves phosphorylation (that could explain differences in time course?). Some mention of the mechanism of temperature changes would be useful to readers outside this field.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not known exactly how temperature alters channel parameters. Invariably some, if not all, of it is due to an intrinsic rearrangement of protein structure, and our current models treat all parameter changes as an instantaneous consequence. However, it is possible that some effects of temperature are due to longer timescale processes such as phosphorylation or cAMP interactions. Current work in the lab is actively exploring these questions, but there is no definitive answer. Given that this paper focuses on the phenomenon and plausible biomolecular explanations based on existing data, we have not altered the paper to include more exhaustive coverage of all the possible avenues by which temperature may alter channel properties.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Title: misspelling of &quot;Cancer&quot; ?</p></disp-quote><p>We are unsure how that extra “w” got into the earliest version of the manuscript and have removed it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 66 &quot;We used 5mM CsCl&quot; - might mention right up front that this was a bath application of the substance.</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered this line to read “used bath application of 5mM CsCl”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 - &quot;The only feedback synapse to the pacemaker kernel neurons, LP to PD, and is blocked by picrotoxin&quot; - I think the word &quot;and&quot; should be removed from this phrase in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 legend - &quot;Reds denote temperature...yellows denote...&quot; - I think it should be &quot;Red dots denote temperature...yellow dots denote...&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Done</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4B - Why does the change in frequency in cesium look so different in Figure 4B compared to Figure 1C or Figure 3B? In the earlier figures, the increase of frequency is smaller but still present in cesium, whereas, in Figure 4B, cesium seems to completely block the increase in frequency. I'm not sure why this is different, but I guess it's because 3B and 4B are just mean traces from single experiments. Presumably, 4B is showing an experiment in which the cesium was subsequently combined with picrotoxin?</p></disp-quote><p>Figures 1C, 3B, and 4B are indeed all from different single experiments. As acknowledged in our concluding paragraph, there was substantial variability in the exact response of the pyloric rhythm to temperature while in cesium. The most consistent effect was that the difference in frequency between cesium and saline at a particular temperature increased, as demonstrated across 21 preparations in Figure 1D. It may be noted in Figure 1E that the Q10 was not infrequently &lt;1, meaning that there was a net decrease in frequency as temperature increased in some experiments such as seen in the example of Figure 4B. The “fold over” (initial increase in steady-state frequency with temperature, then decrease at higher temperatures) has been observed at higher temperatures (typically around 23-30 degrees C) even under control conditions but has not been highlighted in previous publications. The example in 4B was chosen because it demonstrated both the similarity in jags between Cs+ and Cs++PTX and an overall decrease in temperature sensitivity, even though in this instance the steady-state change in frequency with temperature was not monotonic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6A - &quot;Phase 0 to 1.0&quot; - The y-axis should provide units of phase.

We posit in the next paragraph that the effect of the H current on the temperature sensitivity could be due to its phase advance of LP, but that phase advance of LP is not particularly expected to increase frequency. We favor the possibility that temperature increases Ih in the pacemaker, which in turn advances the PRC of the rhythm, allowing the frequency increase seen under normal conditions. In Cs+, this advance does not occur, resulting in the lower temperature sensitivity. In Cs++PTX, the lack of inhibition from LP means compensatory advance of the pacemaker PRC by Ih is unnecessary to allow increased frequency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 285 - &quot;either increase frequency have no effect&quot; - Is there a missing &quot;or&quot; in this phrase?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have added the “or”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
