Opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and accidental death. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid therapies for managing post-surgical pain. Local application of Clarix Flo (FLO), a human amniotic membrane (AM) product, attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity without exhibiting known side effects of opioid use in mice. This effect was achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. We further purified the major matrix component, the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 (HC-HA/PTX3) from human AM that has greater purity and water solubility than FLO. HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HC-HA/PTX3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons, suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Moreover, we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every year, there are about 300 million major surgeries worldwide. Many people experience pain afterward, with some suffering chronic pain. Painkillers commonly used to manage postsurgical pain can have serious side effects. For example, opioid medications, a mainstay therapy for postsurgical pain, can lead to addiction and accidental overdose deaths. Therefore, non-opioid alternatives to manage postsurgical pain are desperately needed.</p><p>Substances in human birth tissues may offer a new approach to treating postsurgical pain. Tissue from the umbilical cord and the amniotic membrane are routinely discarded after birth. However, some studies have shown that this tissue can be repurposed as a treatment to promote healing and reduce inflammation in the eye and soft tissues. Studies have also suggested that this tissue may provide pain relief.</p><p>Zhang, Huang, Ford et al. showed that tissue derived from discarded post-birth tissues could reduce postsurgical pain in an animal model. In the experiments, mice with an incision on their paw were treated with the birth tissues. The treatment reduced pain in the animals without common side effects seen with opioid treatment. The experiments also provided insights into how the tissue helps relieve pain. The tissue inhibits nerve cells that sense pain through a pathway that requires a protein in the cell membrane called CD44. A compound from the amniotic tissue, called HC-HA/PTX3, is the key ingredient to this pain relief and can, on its own, relieve pain. The compound rearranges the protein scaffolding and reduces sodium and calcium ion signals in the nerve cells, making the cells less active. The experiments suggest a new approach to postsurgical pain control. Because these natural compounds from post-birth tissues have multiple effects, they may help provide improved pain control and help reduce postsurgical hyperactivity of nerve cells that can lead to chronic pain. More studies are needed to confirm the therapy would be safe and effective in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>human birth tissues</kwd><kwd>sensory neurons</kwd><kwd>CD44</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton rearrangement</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS110598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS117761</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99EY031742</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xuewei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The naturally occurring biologics, FLO and HC-HA/PTX3, derived from human birth tissues, may be developed as a much-needed non-opioid therapy for post-surgical pain treatment, leveraging robust neuronal mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Surgery or trauma may lead to persistent pain, impeding functional recovery and causing considerable distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kehlet et al., 2006</xref>). Continuous reliance on opioid analgesics causes severe side effects and accidental death, which resulted in a national public health emergency being declared in 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Colvin et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid alternative therapies for managing post-surgical/post-operative pain. An optimal strategy would be to develop local treatments that both inhibit pain and address the underlying pathophysiology, such as neuronal sensitization while avoiding the central side effects of commonly used analgesics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patapoutian et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>A naturally occurring biologic derived from human birth tissues has recently gained our attention as a potential solution for this challenging problem. The birth tissue is predominantly comprised of the amniotic membrane (AM) and umbilical cord (UC), which share the same cell origin as the fetus. These versatile biological tissues have been used as medical therapy in a wide range of conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chao et al., 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Rotth, 1940</xref>). FLO (Clarix Flo; BioTissue, Miami, FL) is a sterile, micronized, and lyophilized form of human AM/UC matrix used for surgical and non-surgical repair, reconstruction, or replacement of soft tissue by filling in the connective tissue void. They have been shown to orchestrate regenerative healing within its anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring properties in ophthalmic applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tighe et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, FLO also appears to relieve pain effectively in several ocular surface disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Espana et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Finger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morkin and Hamrah, 2018</xref>), and musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castellanos and Tighe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mead and Mead, 2020</xref>) and lower extremity neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buksh, 2020</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying its potential pain-inhibitory properties and how it may affect sensory neuron excitability remain unknown.</p><p>In a plantar-incision mouse model of post-surgical pain, we first explored whether FLO may be deployed as a viable biologic for the treatment of trauma pain. We then purified the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 (HC-HA/PTX3), which is in uniquely high amounts in human AM. The natural process of HC-HA/PTX3 formation may involve: Tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 protein covalently binds to HC1 of inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor and then transfers it to high-molecular-weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA). At this point, HC1 becomes conjugated, and tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 is released. PTX3 then tightly associates with the HC1–HA complex by binding to the HC1. HC-HA/PTX3 was recently shown to alleviate dry eye disease induced by chronic graft-versus-host disease by suppressing inflammation and scarring in murine lacrimal glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ogawa et al., 2017</xref>). We hence investigated whether HC-HA/PTX3 is a key bioactive component mediating the pain relief effects of FLO and further examined its mode of action.</p><p>Our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Moreover, we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FLO inhibited post-surgical pain and neuron activation</title><p>Intra-paw injection of FLO, but not the vehicle (saline) acutely inhibited heat nociception in naive wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Moreover, HC-HA/PTX3-induced pain inhibition was comparable between male and female mice after plantar-incision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). HMW-HA, a major component of HC-HA/PTX3, was suggested to attenuate inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain induced by the cancer chemotherapy paclitaxel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonet et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonet et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferrari et al., 2018</xref>).

These studies collectively support the safety and preliminary effectiveness of FLO in managing some clinical pain conditions such as knee osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castellanos and Tighe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mead and Mead, 2020</xref>), discogenic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buck, 2019</xref>), rotator cuff tears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackley et al., 2019</xref>), and painful neuropathy of the lower extremities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buksh, 2020</xref>). These clinical findings also provide important premise of our mechanistic study of FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 in the treatment of post-surgical pain. Applying FLO locally inhibited heat and mechanical hyperalgesia, and attenuated movement-induced pain in WT mice following plantar-incision. Similarly, HC-HA/PTX3 also inhibited heat hyperalgesia. Intriguingly, treatment with HC-HA/PTX3 demonstrated a stronger and longer-lasting pain-inhibitory effect compared to treatment with HMW-HA and the combination of HMW-HA and HC1, at their comparable dosages tested. This finding suggests the superiority of HC-HA/PTX3 over HMW-HA for post-surgical pain treatment, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. After in vivo administration, HMW-HA undergoes rapid and progressive degradation through a series of enzymatic reactions, resulting in the formation of polymers of decreasing sizes and altered bioactivity. Notably, different sizes of HA fragments exhibit a wide range of biological functions, which are sometimes opposing. For example, larger hyaluronan polymers (e.g., HMW-HA) possess anti-angiogenic, immunosuppressive, and anti-hyperalgesic properties. In contrast, smaller polysaccharide fragments are often inflammatory, immuno-stimulatory, angiogenic, and proalgesic. Moreover, they can compete with larger hyaluronan polymers for target receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stern et al., 2006</xref>). The long-lasting drug action of HC-HA/PTX3 in vivo indicates that it may possess a more stable structure than HMW-HA, making it less prone to degradation and loss of bio-efficacy.</p><p>Chronic post-surgical pain, which persists for at least 3 months after surgery, is most difficult to treat. In addition to the plantar-incision model, other chronic post-surgical pain models, such as skin/muscle incision and retraction model and laparotomy model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Flatters, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martinez et al., 2024</xref>), as well as neuropathic pain models, also need to be tested for treatment with FLO and HC/HA/PTX3 in future studies to extend current findings and improve the translational potential.</p><p>Small DRG neurons are activated by heat and noxious stimulation, while innocuous mechanical stimulation mainly activates large DRG neurons and low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qi et al., 2024</xref>). Both FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 inhibited small DRG neurons, as evidenced by decreased excitability in functional calcium imaging and electrophysiologic recording. We found that the potent inhibitory effect of HC-HA/PTX3 on small DRG neurons may result from their high expression of CD44. Both pain- and neuronal-inhibitory effects from FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 were CD44-dependent. Importantly, scRNA-seq analysis showed a significantly higher expression of CD44 in small nociceptive DRG neurons, compared to large neurons (e.g., LTMRs and proprioceptors). Similar findings were also observed in DRG scRNA-seq datasets from another two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renthal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vroman et al., 2023</xref>). In line with this notion, HC-HA/PTX3 exerted a minimal effect on large DRG neurons. Nevertheless, the mechanisms for the differential drug effects warrant further investigations.</p><p>Unlike traditional analgesics, which often target a single downstream effector, HC-HA/PTX3 may induce a range of changes that could fundamentally decrease nociceptor excitability. These changes include membrane hyperpolarization, altered intrinsic membrane properties, and the inhibitions of multiple membrane ion channels, including <italic>I</italic><sub>Nav</sub> and HVA-I<sub>ca</sub>. In addition, HC-HA/PTX3 reduced calcium responses evoked by several proalgesic compounds, including capsaicin, β-alanine, and cinnamal in nociceptive DRG neurons. The activations of TRPV1, MrgprD, and TPRA1 are known to be important to heat and mechanical hypersensitivity and themselves are important targets for pain control. Therefore, HC-HA/PTX3 may effectively block the transmission of noxious afferent inputs through multiple modes of action.</p><p>To explore the molecular basis of HC-HA/PTX3-induced neuronal inhibition, our study unraveled that HC-HA/PTX3, but not HMW-HA, induced a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, leading to an increase in sub-membranous F-actin polymerization and the translocation of CD44 to the vicinity of the cell membrane in small DRG neurons. This effect was not observed in large DRG neurons, and was blocked by both LAT-A pretreatment and <italic>Pfn1</italic> knockdown, which disrupt actin polymerization. Given that polymerized F-actin serves as a scaffold for signaling that affects ion channels, we speculate that the cytoskeleton rearrangement triggered by HC-HA/PTX3 could thus profoundly change ion channel function and, consequently, neuronal excitability. Supporting this hypothesis, the intracellular infusion of a low dose of LAT-A, which had minimal effect on <italic>I</italic><sub>Nav</sub>, and HVA-I<sub>ca</sub> and the morphology of DRG neurons, blocked the inhibition of <italic>I</italic><sub>Nav</sub> and HVA-I<sub>ca</sub> by HC-HA/PTX3. Thus, HC-HA/PTX3 may inhibit ion channels through a CD44-mediated cytoskeleton rearrangement, representing a novel mechanism for neuron inhibition.</p><p>The signaling of HMW-HA also depends on CD44 clustering in lipid rafts, and disrupting this markedly reduces HMW-HA-induced anti-hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonet et al., 2020</xref>). However, at the concentration tested (15 μg/ml), HMW-HA did not increase cortical F-actin and CD44 translocation in small DRG neurons, nor attenuated capsaicin-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase. These findings suggest that different ligands may induce varying cellular effects after binding to CD44. Indeed, HA of different molecular weights can activate different downstream signaling pathways of CD44, leading to opposing effects. For example, HMW-HA produced anti-hyperalgesia, while low-molecular-weight HA- (LMW-HA) induced hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferrari et al., 2018</xref>). While Src signaling was involved in LMW-HA-induced hyperalgeisa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonet et al., 2020</xref>), other downstream signaling pathways of CD44s may participate the anti-hyperalgesic effect of HMW-HA, including phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ)/ protein kinase B (AKT), RhoGTPases (RhoA and Rac1), and phospholipases (phospholipases Cε and Cγ1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonet et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonet et al., 2022</xref>). These findings suggest a complex interplay of downstream signaling pathways of CD44 in neuronal and pain modulation.</p><p>HMW-HA was reported to attenuate CIPN only in male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonet et al., 2022</xref>). However, sex dimorphism was not observed in the inhibition of PGE2-induced inflammatory pain by HMW-HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonet et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, HC-HA/PTX3-induced comparable pain inhibition in both sexes. For LMW-HA-induced hyperalgesia, three receptors, including CD44, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM), may be involved. Yet, estrogen dependence was only established for RHAMM-dependent hyperalgesia and its inhibition by HMW-HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonet et al., 2021a</xref>) These findings collectively suggest a complex interplay between estrogen and different types of HA and HA receptors in pain regulation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study suggests that human birth tissue products may be deployed as a viable biologic to treat post-surgical pain. We further identified HC-HA/PTX3 as the primary bioactive component responsible for pain inhibition. It induced an acute cytoskeleton rearrangement and inhibition of <italic>I</italic><sub>Nav</sub> and HVA-I<sub>ca</sub> currents in a CD44-dependent manner, making it a promising non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Nevertheless, translation of preclinical findings into clinical treatments is complex and often challenging due to species differences and the intricate nature of pain etiology in patients. Our findings provide an important rational for future clinical trials to validate the utility of FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 for post-surgical pain control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6 mice and CD44 KO mice (B6.129(Cg)-Cd44tm1Hbg/J, strain #005085) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Protin et al., 1999</xref>) were purchased from Jackson (Jax) Laboratories.

The voltage dependency of HVA-I<sub>Ca</sub> channel open probability was determined by plotting normalized tail currents as a function of test voltages applied, which were then fitted with a Boltzmann equation for channel open probabilities:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p><italic>P</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) represents the channel open probability as a function of membrane potential; <italic>P</italic><sub>min</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>max</sub> are the minimum and maximum open probabilities; <italic>V</italic><sub>half</sub> is the voltage at 50% maximum current; and <italic>k</italic> is the default slope value.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Nucleofection</title><p>The dissociated neurons from lumbar DRGs were suspended in 100 μl of Amaxa electroporation buffer (Lonza Cologne GmbH, Cologne, Germany) with siRNAs (0.2 nmol per transfection).

All standard operating procedures, work instructions, and forms used for release testing were approved by the quality assurance department of Biotissue, inc and the testing was performed according to GLP. The purity of HC-HA/PTX3 was disclosed by the lack of detectable proteins per BCA assay with a detectable level of 11.7 ± 3.2 µg/ml and notable reduction of protein bands per silver staining in AM4P when compared to AM2P with or without NaOH, which cleaves the ester bond between HA and HC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Due to the lack of detectable proteins, HC-HA/PTX3 was tested based on the amount of HA. HA in HC-HA/PTX3 was of high molecular weight (HMW) (≥500 kDa) when compared to the HMW-HA control using agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It was released by confirming the identity of HC-HA/PTX3 based on Western blot analysis using respective antibody specific to HC1 (ITIH1 antibody, Cat# ab70048, Abcam, Waltham, MA, USA) and PTX3 (PTX3 antibody, Cat# ALX-804-464-C100, Enzo, Farmingdale, NY, USA) with or without hyaluronidase (HAase) digestion to release HC1 and HMW PTX3 from HC-HA/PTX3 in the loading well into the gel and with or without reduction by DTT, which further rendered PTX3 from HMW (octamer) to dimer and monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). In addition, each batch of HC-HA/PTX3 was released after it also passed the potency assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), with the acceptance criterion of no less than 89.21% inhibition of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity of osteoclast differentiation in cloned monocytes of murine RAW264.7 cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL) (PeproTech, Cranbury, NJ, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Culturing DRG neurons</title><p>Lumbar DRGs from 4-week-old WT mice and CD44 KO mice (both sexes) were collected in cold DH10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weng et al., 2015</xref>) (90% Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium [DMEM]/F-12, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin [100 U/ml], and streptomycin [100 μg/ml] [Invitrogen]) and treated with enzyme solution (dispase [5 mg/ml] and collagenase type I [1 mg/ml] in Hanks’ balanced salt solution without Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> [Invitrogen]) for 35 min at 37°C.

To further improve the translational potential, we will extend current findings and employ chronic post-surgical pain models, such as skin/muscle incision and retraction (SMIR) in the thigh of the rodent,(1-3) as well as chronic pain models such as neuropathic pain in the future. We acknowledged this limitation in the discussion.

Cross-sectional area has often been used for describing the size of DRG neurons for in vivo calcium imaging studies, including our previous work (4, 5). In order to keep consistent and make data comparable between studies, we also used the cross-sectional area in current study in Fig 2 in vivo calcium imaging experiment. On the other hand, cell-diameter has been routinely/widely used for in vitro experiments such as in vitro electrophysiology recording and immunofluorescence staining of cultured DRG neurons. To be consistent with this tradition, we used cell-diameter in these experiments. Methods for measuring the area and diameter are explicitly described for each experimental setting, and consistent between the current study and our previous studies (6). In the manuscript, our previously published studies have also been cited in the Methods section. (Method “4 In vivo calcium imaging in mice” and “10.2 Intrinsic excitability studies of DRG neurons”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Clarify what &quot;% of total&quot; means in Figure 2.

This information was added to the figure legend of Figure 2 (B-C) and Method “4 In vivo calcium imaging in mice” in the revised manuscript. At the end of each experiment, we can over-exposure the image to unravel all neuronal profiles and count the total number of neurons on that field/image. Only a small portion of neurons in each size category responded to the test stimulation, and hence the total does not add up to 100.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Discuss clinical data or human studies to validate the efficacy and safety of FLO or HC-HA/PTX3 in patients.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the great suggestion. We provided a brief discussion (Page 11-12).</p><p>Cryopreserved AM/UC has been clinically validated through several hundred peer-reviewed publications since 1995, including 12 studies specifically assessing FLO (Clarix Flo). These studies collectively support the safety and preliminary effectiveness of Clarix Flo in managing some clinical pain conditions such as knee osteoarthritis(7, 8), discogenic pain (9), rotator cuff tears(10), and painful neuropathy of the lower extremities (11). Currently, HC-HA/PTX3 is limited to pre-clinical research, and to our knowledge, there are no available data on its clinical efficacy and safety.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Introduction, last sentence of the second paragraph, delete &quot;also&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for carefully examining our manuscript.
