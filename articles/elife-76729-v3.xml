microorganisms. A key contributor to the skin landscape is the sebaceous gland. Mice devoid of sebocytes are prone to skin infection, yet our understanding of how sebocytes function in host defense is incomplete. Here, we show that the small proline-rich proteins, SPRR1 and SPRR2 are bactericidal in skin. SPRR1B and SPPR2A were induced in human sebocytes by exposure to the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Colonization of germ-free mice was insufficient to trigger increased SPRR expression in mouse skin, but LPS injected into mouse skin stimulated increased expression of the mouse SPRR orthologous genes, <italic>Sprr1a</italic> and <italic>Sprr2a</italic>, through activation of MYD88. Both mouse and human SPRR proteins displayed potent bactericidal activity against MRSA (methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>), <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and skin commensals. Thus, <italic>Sprr1a<sup>−/−</sup>;Sprr2a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice are more susceptible to MRSA and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> skin infection. Lastly, mechanistic studies demonstrate that SPRR proteins exert their bactericidal activity through binding and disruption of the bacterial membrane. Taken together, these findings provide insight into the regulation and antimicrobial function of SPRR proteins in skin and how the skin defends the host against systemic infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial proteins</kwd><kwd>LPS</kwd><kwd>sebaceous glands</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR076459-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris-Tryon</surname><given-names>Tamia A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000867</institution-id><institution>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Amos</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris-Tryon</surname><given-names>Tamia A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAMS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris-Tryon</surname><given-names>Tamia A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SPRRs are bactericidal proteins, stimulated in the sebaceous gland by lipopolysaccharide, that defend the host against infection through bacterial membrane binding and disruption.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The skin is the human body’s largest organ, with direct contact with the external environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Belkaid and Segre, 2014</xref>). As a result, the skin surface continuously encounters a diverse microbial community including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duerkop and Hooper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Findley et al., 2013</xref>). When host defense is impaired, skin infection results. Thus, skin and soft tissue infections pose a considerable public health threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dryden, 2009</xref>). The majority of infections of the skin are caused by <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kahn and Goldstein, 2016</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infections in burn patients are one of the most common causes of mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huebinger et al., 2016</xref>). Adding to the challenges of treating infections posed by these pathogens has been the development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria such as methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klevens et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Skin antimicrobial proteins (AMPs) play an essential role in defending the host from the invasion of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang and Gallo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakatsuji and Gallo, 2012</xref>). Mammalian AMPs are evolutionarily ancient immune effectors that rapidly kill bacteria by targeting bacterial cell wall or cell membrane structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mukherjee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>). Several distinct AMP families, such as β-defensins, cathelicidins, resistin, and S100 proteins, have been identified and characterized in skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallo and Hooper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris, 2019</xref>). However, we still have a limited understanding of the arsenal of AMPs expressed by the skin, the regulatory networks that control the expression of AMPs, and how AMPs function to protect mammalian skin surfaces. Even less is known about the contribution that skin appendages make to host defense.</p><p>Sebaceous glands (SGs) are specialized epithelial cells that cover the entire skin surface except the palms and soles. SGs excrete a lipid-rich and waxy substance called sebum to the skin surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zouboulis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zouboulis et al., 2016</xref>). SGs are believed to contribute to the antimicrobial functions of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallo and Hooper, 2012</xref>), yet few current studies have examined the role of SGs in skin host defense. Here, we show the impact of the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on human sebocytes and demonstrate that bacterial lipoproteins stimulate the expression of members of the small proline-rich protein (SPRR) family. Human SPRR proteins are 6–18 kDa in size and comprise four subclasses (SPRR1, SPRR2, SPRR3, and SPRR4) with a similar structural organization. Among them, two SPRR1 and seven SPRR2 proteins are characterized with a much higher homogeneity, as they contain a similar consensus repeat sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cabral et al., 2001</xref>). SPRR proteins were originally identified in skin as markers of terminal differentiation that function as substrates of transglutaminase in the crosslinked cornified envelope present at the skin surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cabral et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Candi et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that SPRR1 and SPRR2 proteins function as AMPs in the skin. <italic>Sprr1a</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>;Sprr2a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice are more susceptible to MRSA and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> skin infection, revealing that SPRR proteins protect against pathogenic bacterial infections of the skin. We also show mechanistically that the bactericidal activity of SPRR proteins is mediated through the binding and disruption of bacterial membranes. Taken together our findings support a novel antimicrobial function of SPRR proteins in skin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SPRR proteins are induced by LPS in human sebocytes</title><p>As a first step toward understanding the role of the SG in skin host defense, we performed whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing to compare transcript abundances in human immortalized SG cells (SZ95) treated with LPS to untreated sebocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). LPS, a lipoprotein which coats the surface of Gram-negative bacteria, had broad impacts on gene expression in human sebocytes, including the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and AMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, three members of the small proline-rich family of proteins (SPRR) were markedly upregulated in sebocytes after LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To confirm that the expression of SPRR genes were induced by LPS, we used quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) to analyze the change of the human <italic>SPRR1B</italic>, <italic>SPRR2A</italic>, and <italic>SPRR2D</italic> transcript abundance in SZ95 cells. Consistent with our RNA-seq results, LPS-treated SZ95 cells displayed significant increase in the relative expression of <italic>SPRR</italic> family genes compared to vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, dose–response and time course experiments revealed that 1 μg LPS is optimal for induction of <italic>SPRR</italic> family genes expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with the qRT-PCR results, SPRR proteins expression also increased after LPS treatment in SZ95 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). LPS is a pattern-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) known to trigger gene transcription through the pattern recognition receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vaishnava et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore tested a panel of PAMPs to see if other foreign stimuli would trigger the expression of the <italic>SPRR</italic> genes in human sebocytes. Interestingly, two other lipoproteins, Pam3CSK4 and FSL-1, stimulate the expression of <italic>SPRR1B</italic>, <italic>SPRR2A</italic>, and <italic>SPRR2D</italic> genes in human sebocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that sebocytes respond to bacterial lipoproteins by expressing SPRR1 and SPRR2 proteins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The expression of <italic>SPRR</italic> family genes are upregulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in human sebaceous gland cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heat map of significantly upregulated genes, represented as <italic>Z</italic>-scored RPKM (reads per kilo base per million reads).

Interestingly, only the Gram-negative bacteria tested could trigger SPRR2A expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, these data establish that bacterial lipoproteins trigger the expression of <italic>SPRR</italic> genes in human sebocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SPRR proteins are upregulated by the injection of LPS in mouse skin</title><p>Next, we sought to examine whether commensal skin microbiota colonization could induce the expression of <italic>Sprr</italic> family genes in vivo. <italic>Sprr1b</italic> is not expressed in mouse skin, so we tested the ability of the microbiota to stimulate the expression of the mouse orthologs, <italic>Sprr1a</italic> and <italic>Sprr2a</italic>. In contrast to what we observed in human sebocytes in culture, <italic>Sprr</italic> gene expression was similar between germ-free and conventional mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that bacterial colonization alone is insufficient to trigger increased expression of <italic>Sprr</italic> genes in mouse skin. As the skin surface is coated with waxes, triglycerides and cornified keratinocytes with basal keratinocytes and SGs cells located closer to the dermis, we next chose to test whether deeper exposure to LPS – mimicking wounding and infection conditions — could stimulate <italic>Sprr1a</italic> and <italic>Sprr2a</italic> expression in mouse skin. Indeed, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that injection of LPS stimulates the expression of <italic>Sprr1a</italic> and <italic>Sprr2a</italic> in mouse skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Canonically, LPS stimulates gene expression through activation of TLR4 and the TLR signaling adaptor MYD88. Thus, LPS injected into the skin of <italic>Myd88</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice did not trigger increased expression of the <italic>SPRR</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that LPS induces SPRR protein expression through the TLR-MYD88 signaling pathway. Consistent with these data, both live and heat-inactivated <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteria were able to induce SPRR expression, suggesting that stimulation of <italic>Sprr1a</italic> and <italic>Sprr2a</italic> in mouse skin does not depend on the presence of bacterial metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As has been shown by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vermeij and Backendorf, 2010</xref>), we also found that <italic>Sprr1a</italic> and <italic>Sprr2a</italic> transcript abundance is locally induced by crosshatch skin wounding in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The expression of <italic>SPRR</italic> family genes are upregulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of <italic>Sprr1a</italic> and <italic>Sprr2a</italic> gene expression in mouse dorsal skin tissue.

SPRR1A is expressed in the SG and nonspecifically at the junction of the SG and hair follicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This suggests SPRR proteins expressed in the sebocyte may be secreted to the hair canal and are present at the skin surface. Since our immunofluorescence images and prior studies in keratinocytes indicated that SPRR1A and SPRR2A are expressed by keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fischer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sark et al., 1998</xref>), we sought to study whether LPS could stimulate SPRR expression in keratinocyte cells. We first made use of hTert cells, originally derived from human foreskin keratinocytes and immortalized by expression of human telomerase and mouse Cdk4, by treating the hTert cells with LPS for 24 hr. The qRT-PCR results showed that LPS cannot induce the expression of <italic>SPRR</italic> family genes in human keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further confirm this result, we isolated primary mouse keratinocytes from neonatal mice, and cultured them under both low and high calcium conditions. Under low calcium conditions, keratinocytes proliferate but require higher calcium conditions to differentiate in culture. Thus, in primary keratinocytes high calcium conditions triggered increased expression of both mouse <italic>Sprr1a</italic> and <italic>Sprr2a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, LPS did not stimulate the increased expression of <italic>Sprr</italic> genes in mouse keratinocytes under either condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

These data are consistent with the idea that most bacterial cell membranes are negatively charged and thus potentially susceptible to SPRR1 binding. Lastly, to determine whether SPRR proteins disrupt bacterial membranes, we incubated human SPRR1B and mouse SPRR1A protein with liposomes loaded with the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein (CF, ~10 Å Stokes diameter) and quantified dye release after exposure. Phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylserine (PS) liposomes are composed of 85% of the neutral lipid PC and 15% of the negatively charged lipid PS – similar to that of bacterial membranes. Both human SPRR1B and mouse SPRR1A protein-induced rapid dye efflux from negatively charged PC/PS liposomes in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

In this study, we have identified SPRR1 and SPRR2 proteins as a previously uncharacterized group of antibacterial proteins expressed by keratinocytes and SG cells, which can rapidly kill pathogens through membrane disruption and limit bacterial skin infection.</p><p>Several earlier studies have shown that SPRR proteins are upregulated in the GI tract, urinary tract, and the airway after exposure to stress and other inflammatory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Demetris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hooper et al., 2001</xref>). Further, Hu et al. recently revealed that SPRR2A has antimicrobial actions in the gastrointestinal tract during helminth infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2021</xref>). Our data highlight a previously unappreciated role of SPRR family proteins in skin immune defense, demonstrating that both SPRR1 and SPRR2 are bactericidal proteins induced in sebocytes by the bacterial cell wall component LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The major role of SGs in mammals is to produce sebum, a mixture of nonpolar lipids and proteins required for normal skin ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Sebum secretion can also act as a delivery system for AMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lovászi et al., 2017</xref>). Though beneficial to the host, AMPs can damage mammalian membranes, so confining expression of AMPs to the nonviable parts of skin through sebum delivery is optimal. Sebum also excretes AMPs to the surface within an acidic milieu, which is often required for AMP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malik et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, our data show that bacterial colonization of germ-free mice does not induce expression of SPRR proteins in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and that LPS is not able to stimulate the production of SPRR proteins in mouse keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest that penetration of bacterial stimuli to deeper portions of the skin may be required for MYD88-mediated SPRR protein production in skin.

As SPRR family proteins also function as crosslinking proteins in terminal differentiation of keratinocytes and formation of the cornified cell envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Candi et al., 2005</xref>), there are likely other regulatory networks that control SPRR protein expression in skin in response to wounding and other stimuli.

Summary:</p><p>The authors present a solid study on the antimicrobial effects/potential of SRPPs. In general, the study seems very well prepared and is rather dense in its repertoire of techniques and assays. However, there are some minor elements, which I think should be addressed prior to publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their review of our work and their positive comments regarding the quality of the data presented and the “repertoire of techniques” used to justify our conclusions. We have addressed the “minor elements” that were suggested in our revised manuscript and these are detailed below, point by point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Major elements:</p><p>Line 135: SPRR proteins are upregulated by the injection of LPS in mouse skin. This heading is confusing and misleading given that the paragraph is rounded off with the concluding remark that &quot;SPRR proteins are unregulated by LPS in human sebocytes in culture and by LPS dermal injection in mouse skin.&quot; Is this not contradictory?</p><p>The overall impression of the study is that not all the pieces of the puzzle fits, and the authors do also indicate this. However, certain elements could maybe be clarified and the authors stand could be justified more clearly with references to previous work. For example; line 255 &quot;Taken together, our findings suggest that deeper penetration of bacterial stimuli may be required for MYD88 mediated SPRR protein production in skin.&quot; It is not clear to me how the authors ended up with this conclusion. SPRR can be expressed in keratinocytes, the sebaceous gland and the fibroblasts (likely also other places). Keratinocytes lying on top and fibroblasts forming the &quot;deeper tissue&quot; which the authors refers to, or at least that is how I would interpret this. So the conclusion in other words would be that SPRR expression from fibroblasts is needed to gain proper protection. But I'm not sure that is really what the authors want to convey.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these thoughtful comments. We have revised this section of the manuscript to describe our findings more clearly. Please see Lines 143-186 of the revised manuscript. Our larger point was that bacterial colonization alone is insufficient to trigger augmented SPRR expression, likely because the skin surface is somewhat inert and bacterial products need to penetrate the cornified surface in order for sebocytes or other proliferating cells to be exposed to bacterial signals. We have revised this section of the manuscript to summarize this point more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the discussion it is stated that &quot;biochemical data show that mouse and human SPRR1 proteins interact with negatively charged lipid membranes, suggesting broad spectrum antimicrobial capability of these proteins (Figure 3D-F).&quot; I would disagree with this. E. coli is one of the easiest gram-negative bacteria one can kill with AMPs, and the authors have already stated that E. coli is not affected by SPRR1A. So I think the statement needs to be toned down, and or at least the lack of effect against E. coli should be stated again. Furthermore, it is super fascinating that SPRR1A is resistant to E. coli, and rather cool to learn that you uses LPS from E. coli to stimulate SPRR. Which prompts the question, would LPS from a different source, be more potent in stimulating SPRR, thus changing the entire story. This last comment is more for further work and should not be addressed in the revised version of course.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these thoughtful comments. We have revised the manuscript to again state that <italic>E. coli</italic> is resistant to SPRR killing – Line 287 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>We agree that how LPS from different sources stimulates SPRR expression is a question of interest. As a first step, we did investigate the ability of an array of heat killed bacteria to stimulate SPRR expression in cells. These data showed that several heat-killed Gram-negative bacteria were able to stimulate SPRR2A expression in cells. However, the Gram-positive bacteria tested did not have this ability (Supplemental Figure S3). These in vitro data on single strains of Gram-negative bacteria did show a greater impact of heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> compared to strains of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>C. rodentium.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Elements from the SPRR classification line 274 was could ideally have been added in the introduction, which would require less googling for readers with less background knowledge on SPRR.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion and have moved these sections to the introduction – Lines 96-99.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The section on proline-rich proteins as antimicrobials (line 277 to 281) stand in its current for as something unique and novel, however, the literature is rich in papers describing the antimicrobial effect of proline rich AMPs. Thus, justifying rephrasing of the text in the manuscript and also maybe addition of a reference of two.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions and have revised this section and added a recent review on proline-rich proteins as antimicrobials. Line 298-299</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The figures are overall of exceptional quality. However, the figure legend for Figure 1 is somewhat misleading. (B) is not a volcano plot. The heat map is (A and not C), &quot;SPRR1B, SPRR2A and SPRR2D are highlighted in red&quot; this info is redundant. The western blot is missing… etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment that our “figures are overall of exceptional quality”. We also thank the reviewer for catching the error in the figure legend for Figure 1 and for their suggested edits. We have made the requested changes to the figure legend. Line 569-580.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Minor elements</p><p>It's a minor comment. However, it is speculative to argue that 16h is the optimal for induction of SPRR. Expression of SPRR will most likely follow a bell-shaped curve. For SPRR1B at 1ugLPS the top of the curve is reached after 16h. However, this is clearly concentration dependent. Figure S1a, also illustrates that at lower LPS concentration, expression is less pronounced, thus it will take longer to reach max expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and have modified the text.

A most elegant study that shows how bacterial compounds can stimulate sebocytes to secrete a group of bactericidal proteins that than can kill different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most impressive part is the finding that colonization by itself does not induce secretion of these proteins. Authors describe that the depth of penetration is determining the secretion yes or no. This is in line with their findings that all kind of TLR-stimulants do induce expression and secretion, that would include compounds of commensal bacteria. This correlation with depth of penetration means that the way the system discriminates between harmless colonizers and pathogens is by &quot;measuring&quot; the depth of penetration into the skin. In my view this aspect can be addressed in more detail in abstract and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments on the elegance of our study and that “The most impressive part” is the finding that colonization by itself does not induce these proteins. We have revised the abstract and the manuscript to highlight these data and make these findings clearer to the reader. Lines 53-54 and Lines 143-186.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Authors should make an estimate, based on measurements, of how much protein is released in the skin and relate this to the effective concentration found in the bacterial killing experiments. The question is: does this attribute to in vivo killing, as is indicated in the KO-mouse or is it one of very many things that attribute to killing?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. Quantifying the amount of a given skin protein is challenged by the difficulty of solubilizing epidermal proteins. Further, dissecting specific sub compartments of the skin to quantify the concentration of proteins within secretory ducts and at the skin surface—as has been done in paneth cells of the gastrointestinal tract (Ayabe et al., 2000)— remains to be achieved. In our current study, we were able to partially solubilize skin tissue for western blotting and show in Supplemental Figure S8C that the SPRR1 antibody binds to a large band of protein in mouse skin. Immunofluorescence in Figure 2E also shows the brightest signal for SPRR1 at the skin surface.</p><p>Given the challenges of quantifying skin proteins, we can estimate the expression by comparing the RNA expression of SPRR proteins to other known antimicrobial proteins. <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref> is a chart of FPKM values (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) of mouse <italic>SPRR1a</italic> and <italic>SPRR2a</italic> from our published RNA-sequencing data set (Harris et al., 2019). In the skin of mice housed in an SPF facility at UT Southwestern, SPRR1 is expressed at higher levels than SPRR2. Both transcripts are comparable (on a whole skin level) to other published antimicrobial proteins in skin, such as cathelicidin, lysozyme, S100, and the β-defensins. Prior work shows that antimicrobial proteins in the skin and the gut are effective at low μM concentrations (Cash et al., 2006)(Korting et al., 2012), as we show in our current study (Figure 3). Thus, our findings suggest that SPRR proteins are present at similar amounts at the skin surface to other described antimicrobial proteins, which further suggests that the greater infectious burden seen in the <italic>Sprr1a</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>;Sprr2a</italic><sup>−/−</sup>mice (Figure 4) is due to the absence of these bactericidal proteins at the skin surface.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Gene</th><th valign="bottom">Protein</th><th valign="bottom">Mean-FPKM</th><th valign="bottom">Stdeve</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Sprr1a</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SPPR1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">66.30906576</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">26.04283</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Sprr2a</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SPPR2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6.587556046</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3.645252</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Lyz1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LYSOZYME</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">36.73892838</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">32.33246</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Lyz2</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LYSOZYME</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">255.6400659</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">234.8976</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Defb1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DEFENSIN</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">26.85869015</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7.757099</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Defb6</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DEFENSIN</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">163.2368575</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">64.78706</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Cramp1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CATHELICIDIN</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7.629683869</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.813505</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>S100a8</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">S100</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.002705491</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.908623</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Same question as above can be asked for tissue damage. Of course, these compounds are toxic to human cells, especially in high concentrations at the site of release in the skin. How toxic are these compounds to human cells as compared to the bacteria. How does this relate to the expected concentrations at the site of infections? How does this attribute to inflammation and tissue damage, is it the single cause or is it a small contribution amongst other things? Based on those data, what is the expected therapeutic window (relates to the statement of the authors that these compounds can be used to treat infections).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these thoughtful comments. It has been shown that other antimicrobials in the skin (such as cathelicidin) impact mammalian membranes and stimulate the immune system. We agree that it would be interesting to explore the direct impact of SPRR on mammalian membranes in future studies. Though the biochemistry is not entirely clear, prior work shows SPRR upregulation to be protective for the host (Pradervand et al., 2004)(Vermeij and Backendorf, 2010)(Demetris et al., 2008).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>4.
