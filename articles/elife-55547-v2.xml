Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) has been implicated in maintenance of the autophagy-inflammasome axis in innate murine immune cells. Here, we show that WASp deficiency is associated with impaired rapamycin-induced autophagosome formation and trafficking to lysosomes in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). WASp reconstitution in vitro and in WAS patients following clinical gene therapy restores autophagic flux and is dependent on the actin-related protein complex ARP2/3. Induction of mitochondrial damage with CCCP, as a model of selective autophagy, also reveals a novel ARP2/3-dependent role for WASp in formation of sequestrating actin cages and maintenance of mitochondrial network integrity. Furthermore, mitochondrial respiration is suppressed in WAS patient MDMs and unable to achieve normal maximal activity when stressed, indicating profound intrinsic metabolic dysfunction. Taken together, we provide evidence of new and important roles of human WASp in autophagic processes and immunometabolic regulation, which may mechanistically contribute to the complex WAS immunophenotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Wiskott Aldrich syndrome</kwd><kwd>actin cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>immunometabolism</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>innate immune cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>090233/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thrasher</surname><given-names>Adrian James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201250/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rivers</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rivers</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Rai</surname><given-names>Rajeev</given-names></name><name><surname>Cavazza</surname><given-names>Alessia</given-names></name><name><surname>Bajaj-Elliott</surname><given-names>Mona</given-names></name><name><surname>Thrasher</surname><given-names>Adrian J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>WASp is an immunometabolic regulator of human myeloid cells and regulates autophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) is an essential regulator of the actin cytoskeleton in haematopoietic cells. It co-ordinates cytoskeletal dynamics important in immune cell functions, through recruitment of the actin-related protein complex ARP2/3 and formation of new branched actin filaments (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rivers and Thrasher, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Wiskott Aldrich syndrome (WAS), caused by loss of function of WASp, is a rare X-linked disorder resulting in significant combined immune deficiency, microthrombocytopaenia and susceptibility to haematological malignancy. Symptoms of classical WAS present in infancy and most children will die from disease-related complications in the first 15 years of life, in the absence of definitive treatment by haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or gene therapy. An inflammatory phenotype occurs in up to 80% of children, with symptoms such as severe eczema, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), arthritis, and vasculitis, which may persist after HSCT in a proportion of children, particularly where myeloid chimerism is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Worth and Thrasher, 2015</xref>).</p><p>We recently demonstrated disturbance of the autophagy-inflammasome axis in WASp-deficient murine innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Inflammasomes are cytosolic protein complexes responsible for maturing the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and promoting inflammatory cell death, pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martinon et al., 2002</xref>). Assembling in response to endogenous and/or exogenous danger signals, they co-ordinate and aid in mounting appropriate immunity against potential threats, such as from invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Franchi et al., 2009</xref>). Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and downregulating inflammasomes, through clearance of inflammasome triggers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rodgers et al., 2014</xref>). Autophagosomes are double-membraned vesicles that form around cytoplasmic contents and are transported to lysosomes, where fusion allows for content degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shibutani et al., 2015</xref>). Autolysosomal contents are subsequently recycled either to the cytoplasm, or transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation and lysosomes are re-formed ready for further autophagosome interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Some autophagic processes are non-selective in nature, for example the catabolic degradation of bulk cytoplasmic contents to provide metabolic substrates following nutrient starvation (‘macroautophagy’). Others involve selective degradation, for example of damaged organelles, for example mitochondria (‘mitophagy’) or pathogens that have escaped phagocytosis (‘xenophagy’). These require a highly co-ordinated process, whereby targets for degradation must first be identified and recruit autophagy receptors.</p><p>Actin is involved in autophagy at several levels, including autophagosome formation, maturation, and transport to lysosomes [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kast and Dominguez, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kruppa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coutts and La Thangue, 2016</xref>]. The ARP2/3 complex, through which WASp acts, consists of seven subunits (ARP2, ARP3 and ARPC1-5) and has been particularly implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kast et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coutts and La Thangue, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">King et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zavodszky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). In an ex vivo model of <italic>Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC) infection in murine bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), we provided the first demonstration of a crucial role for WASp in xenophagy, where WASp deficiency resulted in the absence of canonical autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). In this model, impaired autophagy contributed to exaggerated inflammasome activity presumably due to defective clearance of intracellular bacteria.</p><p>To date, the potential role of WASp in regulating autophagy in human immune cells remains unstudied. Here, we provide evidence of an essential role for WASp in both non-selective autophagy and selective mitophagy in the human myeloid compartment, where it appears to be a novel player in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. We propose that metabolic consequences found in WASp deficiency identify WAS as a disorder of immunometabolic regulation, thus highlighting new potential therapeutic pathways for further exploration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>WASp plays a pivotal role in autophagosome formation following non-selective autophagy stimulation</title><p>We first investigated the role of human WASp in non-selective autophagy in the human monocytic cell line, THP-1. <italic>WAS</italic> KO THP-1 cells were generated by CRISPR gene-editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). Rapamycin inhibits the mTOR complex initiating autophagy, which culminates in LC3I to LC3II conversion on autophagosome membranes, the latter process being a well-established surrogate marker of autophagosome formation.</p><p>WT and <italic>WAS</italic> KO THP-1 cells were exposed to rapamycin and LC3II protein expression monitored through western blotting. In WT THP-1 cells, an increase in LC3II expression was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast, LC3II expression did not increase in the absence of WASp, leading to a significant reduction in LC3II expression in <italic>WAS</italic> KO compared with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). Given that autophagy stimulation results in a flux of autophagosomes, we assessed whether this difference in LC3II abundance reflected abrogated autophagosome formation, or an increase in autophagosome degradation. Bafilomycin inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion, preventing lysosomal degradation of autophagosomes. Co-culture with the combination of rapamycin and bafilomycin confirmed that reduced LC3II expression observed in <italic>WAS</italic> KO THP-1 cells was indicative of impaired autophagosome formation rather than increased degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

These findings were confirmed following in vivo WASp reconstitution in WAS patients treated with clinical gene therapy, where rapamycin stimulation of MDMs from WAS patients treated with gene therapy demonstrated LC3 punctae formation comparable to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g and h</xref>). Additionally, we were able to follow one patient through gene therapy, repeating rapamycin stimulation of MDMs from the same patient before and after treatment, with restoration of LC3 punctae observed at 6 and 9 months after engraftment of corrected HSPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our observations suggest for the first time that WASp plays an important role in autophagosome formation in response to non-selective autophagy in human myeloid cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Human WASp is implicated in delivery of autophagosomes to lysosomes in non-selective autophagy</title><p>In addition to reduced number, the cellular location of the LC3 punctae in WAS SDMs and MDMs differed when compared with heathy donors. Instead of peninuclear clustering, LC3 punctae in WAS SDMs and MDMs were scattered throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and g</xref>).</p><p>This observation led us to postulate that autophagosomes clustering around the perinuclear region may aid fusion with lysosomes. To test our hypothesis, LC3 and LAMP-1 (a lysosomal membrane marker) co-localisation in primary MDMs was investigated. In resting healthy donor MDMs, few LC3 punctae were seen scattered throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In contrast, LAMP-1 staining showed that lysosomes are more plentiful and found predominantly in the perinuclear region at rest. Upon rapamycin-induced autophagy, LC3 punctae markedly increased in number and co-localised with LAMP-1 punctae in the perinuclear region. EM analysis revealed that this co-localisation in the perinuclear region was around the microtubule organising centres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Taken together, the data suggest that autophagosomes are formed in the cytoplasm and travel along microtubules for lysosomal fusion. In contrast to healthy donors, WAS patient MDMs revealed disorganised co-localisation between LC3 and LAMP-1, with more than one cluster of LC3 and LAMP-1 punctae in addition to uncoordinated punctae scattered throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The disorganised appearance of LC3 and LAMP-1 punctae in the absence of WASp, supports our hypothesis for the importance of WASp in autophagosome-lysosome traffic and fusion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>WASp is necessary for delivery of autiophagosomes to lysosomes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) MDMs from a healthy donor, WAS patient and WAS patient following treatment with gene therapy cultured with or without rapamycin 50 nM and bafilomycin 160 nM as indicated for 6 hr.

ARPC1B is one of the seven subunits comprising the ARP2/3 complex. Patients with defects in this subunit exhibit a clinical phenotype largely similar to WAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kahr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kopitar et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting the two conditions share underlying mechanism(s). At present, whether these proteins play a role in autophagy is as yet unexplored. Since little is known about the cellular defects of ARP2/3 subunit deficiencies, we first sought to confirm an ARP2/3 functional defect in patient cells. Podosomes are established WASp-ARP2/3-dependent actin-rich structures important in adhesion and migration of myeloid cells, absent in WAS and CK666-treated healthy MDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Primary MDMs from ARPC1B-deficient patients were also unable to form podosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Furthermore, induction of non-selective autophagy in ARPC1B-deficient MDMs resulted in impaired LC3 punctae formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>), LC3-actin association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), and LC3II expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e and f</xref>), as seen in WAS.

The same process was carried out for all seven ARP2/3 complex subunits. In contrast to WASp analysis, three out of the seven ARP2/3 subunits (ARP2, ARP3, and ARPC2) were found to contain xLIR motifs, with high PSSM scores, highly predictive of functional LIR domains. Additionally, ARPC1B was identified to have a WxxL motif with high PSSM score that could also be predicted to contain a functional LIR motif.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>WASp-dependent actin cages encapsulate damaged mitochondria in mitophagy</title><p>Selective autophagy is a highly co-ordinated process, whereby targets for degradation are first identified and recruit autophagy receptors prior to being sequestered by autophagosomes. Our previous work demonstrated a marked defect in xenophagy in murine models of WASp deficiency, herein we sought to explore effects on similar pathways in human cells. Models of xenophagy are complicated as several cellular events including bacterial clearance through phagocytosis, autophagy and a hybrid process known as LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), all contribute to early bacterial sensing and processing.

The inability of WAS MDMs to respond to impaired OxPhos by upregulating aerobic glycolysis raises the possibility that metabolic undersupply could lead to downstream functional cellular consequences.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>WASp deficiency is associated with impaired mitochondrial function.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of MDMs from healthy donors and WAS patients during Mito Stress test.

Building on our previous findings identifying a key role for murine WASp in the autophagy-inflammasome axis, we now provide evidence that human WASp is important in both non-selective autophagy and selective mitophagy. Gaining mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of WAS allows us to report for the first time some important metabolic consequences of WASp deficiency, which may eventually help to clarify some previously unexplained features of the complex disease immunophenotype. Furthermore, with increasing interest in the importance of cellular metabolism in immune outcome in health and disease, our findings may have far-reaching implications for other diseases of cytoskeletal dysfunction.</p><p>In the present study, the potential contribution of WASp to both non-selective autophagy and selective mitophagy in human myeloid cells was investigated. A significant role for human WASp in autophagosome formation and dynamics was uncovered. Although WASp-deficiency resulted in only modest reduction in LC3II expression in THP-1 and primary MDMs, this is in keeping with our previous findings in murine BMDCs following rapamycin-induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, in xenophagy, our previous work demonstrated that this same modest reduction in LC3II expression correlated with complete absence of canonical autophagosome formation around intracellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). This finding highlights that expression of LC3II is not exclusive to mature autophagosomes, but may also associate with immature autophagosomes and other single-membraned vesicles. Here, we show that reduced LC3II expression in THP-1 cells and primary WAS MDMs correlates with a significant reduction in LC3 punctae, a surrogate marker for autophagosome formation, which are restored following in vitro and in vivo WAS correction.</p><p>Our recent work was the first to identify a role for murine WASp in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), although the mechanism(s) of action remained unexplored. In the present study, we elucidated that the mechanism of human WASp action in non-selective autophagy and mitophagy is dependent on ARP2/3-mediated actin polymerisation. Actin is seen to colocalise with LC3 punctae in rapamycin-induced autophagy of healthy donor SDMs and MDMs, which is abrogated in WAS, ARP2/3-inhibited healthy donors and ARPC1B-deficient patients. Restoration of actin-LC3 punctae association following in vitro and in vivo WAS correction confirms a WASp-dependent role in this model. Identification of potential LIR motifs in ARP2/3 components, not present in WASp, adds further support to the notion that the role of WASp in autophagy is via ARP2/3 actin polymerisation; however, it is worth also noting that LIR-independent modes of interaction with Atg-8 family proteins have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrends et al., 2010</xref>). Impaired autophagy in ARP2/3-inhibited and ARPC1B-deficient patients, also highlight a potential WASp-independent role for ARP2/3 in autophagy. Interestingly, reduction in LC3II protein expression following rapamycin-induced autophagy of ARPC1B-deficient patients, compared with healthy donors, was more profound than that seen in WAS. This may reflect WASp-independent polymerisation of actin via the ARP2/3 complex, which may be of particular importance in potential for compensatory mechanisms to restore some autophagic activity essential for cell survival in WASp deficiency. Our findings here are supported by extensive work by others in non-haematopoietic cell line models that highlight the importance of actin at various stages of the autophagy process (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kast and Dominguez, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coutts and La Thangue, 2016</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kruppa et al., 2016</xref>), for which ARP2/3 and WASp family members have been particularly implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kast et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coutts and La Thangue, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">King et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zavodszky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). To our knowledge, however, this is the first study reporting the importance of WASp and ARP2/3 in autophagy of primary human haematopoietic cells.</p><p>In addition to the role of actin in autophagosome formation and dynamics, existing evidence demonstrates that the transport of mature autophagosomes to lysosomes in non-haematopoietic cell lines relies on microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jahreiss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>). Our EM and confocal analyses of primary MDMs following rapamycin-induced autophagy identified clustering of autophagosomes around microtubule-organising centres. Although previous evidence to support a role of WASp in microtubule homeostasis is limited predominantly to a study where WASp was overexpressed in Cos7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2000</xref>), our data suggests in autophagy there may be a direct role of WASp in microtubule-dependent trafficking of autophagosomes. The mechanism of this link and to what degree actin may also contribute is at present unclear and requires further elucidation.</p><p>We were surprised to note that there appeared to be a reduction in lysosome numbers in untreated WAS MDMs. This could indicate an additional role for WASp in lysosome formation, or reflect impaired basal autophagic flux, since lysosomes re-form in late autophagy following content degradation of the autophagolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). Functionally, this observation may be important in antigen presentation, a role previously described for lysosomes in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vyas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saric et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondria are essential in providing energy for cellular homeostasis and play an important role in innate immunity, contributing to pathogen control through bactericidal activity of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">West et al., 2011</xref>). However, ROS can also lead to damage of cellular organelles, including the mitochondria themselves. Mitophagy plays a crucial role in ensuring damaged mitochondria are effectively cleared in order to maintain mitochondrial network integrity and cellular homeostasis. In a model of CCCP-induced mitophagy of primary MDMs, we found sites of actin polymerisation surrounding mitochondria that had become detached from the mitochondrial network, encapsulating them in cage-like structures. Actin-cage formation around damaged mitochondria was abrogated in WAS, ARP2/3-inhibited and ARPC1B-deficient patient MDMs and restored in WAS patients after clinical gene therapy. This suggests that, as in non-selective autophagy, mitophagy is dependent on the ARP2/3 activity of WASp. Our work here is supported by a recent study where ARP2/3-dependent actin polymerisation was identified to be important in mitophagic actin cage formation in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kruppa et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, mitophagic actin cage formation demonstrated in our study here bore similarity to the WASp-dependent actin-septin cages seen in our previous study investigating EPEC-mediated xenophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). To our knowledge, we are now the first to report an ARP2/3-dependent role for WASp in mitophagy of primary human MDMs.</p><p>Furthermore, in the absence of mitochondrial insult we have surprisingly uncovered a significant disruption to basal mitochondrial morphology in WAS MDMs, suggesting a role for WASp in maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Since actin is important in mitochondrial homeostasis through fission and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hatch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moore et al., 2016</xref>), it is not clear whether disrupted mitochondrial morphology in the absence of WASp reflects defective mitophagy alone or other as yet unexplored cellular events. Interestingly, the appearance of fragmented mitochondria, as seen in WAS MDMs, has been shown by others to be associated with caspase-1-mediated inflammasome activation in BMDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2015</xref>). This could provide a further link between our findings here of disrupted mitochondrial morphology and previous evidence of inflammasome dysregulation in WAS innate immune cells even in the absence of pathogen challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Exploring the functional consequences of disrupted mitochondrial networks in WAS MDMs uncovered profound defects in mitochondrial respiration. Impaired basal mitochondrial respiration in WAS is likely to have a significant impact on cellular functions, through lack of ATP production. Additionally, we also discovered reduced maximal respiratory capacity, meaning that when WASp-deficient MDMs become ‘stressed’, they are unable to increase their respiratory drive in order to meet the required energy demands. Macrophage mitochondria are critical players in the metabolic response to pathogens and cell stress, as they can switch from OxPhos metabolism to glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Neill and Pearce, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Escoll et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, our ECAR analysis revealed that the observed differences in OxPhos are not explained by an upregulation of glycolysis in WAS, with similar rates of glycolysis in healthy donor and WASp-deficient MDMs.</p><p>The discovery of a metabolic defect in WAS MDMs is, to our knowledge, the first description of its kind. However, the idea of a metabolic defect in WAS platelets was inferred as early as 40–50 years ago, with several studies observing a paucity of mitochondria and impaired mitochondrial energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trung et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Verhoeven et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akkerman et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obydennyi et al., 2020</xref>). Although as yet unstudied, extending these metabolic defects to other immune cell lineages may go some way to explaining other immunophenotypic features of WAS including T cell anergy, progressive reduction in B and T lymphocytes with age and increasing development of autoinflammatory symptoms. This is supported by work in non-WAS models, following emerging evidence of the role of immune cell metabolism in autophagy and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarke and Simon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bantug et al., 2018b</xref>). Immune cells particularly susceptible to metabolic dysfunction in the presence of impaired autophagy include T regulatory cells, as well as mature T and B cells, which rely more heavily on OxPhos for their differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarke and Simon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Price et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clarke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bantug et al., 2018a</xref>).</p><p>Our exploration of the role of human WASp in autophagy began by means of evaluating the mechanism of inflammation in WAS, with a view to identifying novel candidate therapeutic targets. Autophagy is important in down-regulating inflammasome activity through effective clearance of intracellular debris such as pathogens or damaged organelles. Here, we have shown for the first time that human WASp is a key player in both non-selective autophagy and selective mitophagy. Moreover, we have uncovered a significant defect in mitochondrial homeostasis with important metabolic consequences and which may have implications well beyond the enhanced inflammatory phenotype of WAS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">WT THP-1</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">TIB-202</td><td valign="top">Male, 1 year infant</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">WAS KO THP-1</td><td valign="top">doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-01676-0">10.1038/s41467-017-01676-0</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Male, 1 year infant</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-human WASP (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BD Bioscience</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 557773, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_396867">AB_396867</ext-link></td><td valign="top">FACS (1:100), WB (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-mouse IgG <break/>Alexa Fluor 647 (Goat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 405301, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_315005">AB_315005</ext-link></td><td valign="top">FACS (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-human LAMP-1 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BD Bioscience</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 17–611043;

Cells were stained with secondary goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 647 antibody (clone Poly4053, BioLegend) to determine percentage of WASp-positive cells by FACS using a BD LSRII instrument (BD Bioscience).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Reagents</title><p>For non-selective autophagy induction and inhibition of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, rapamycin (Calbiochem) and bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) were used at concentrations of 50 nM and 160 nM respectively. CK666 (Abcam) was used to inhibit ARP2/3 in primary MDMs at 20 µM or 100 µM as indicated. CCCP (Merck) to induce mitophagy was used at a concentration of 10 µM for 2 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Cells were seeded in 12 well plates at a density of 0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ well and lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma) containing protease (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma) cocktails after completion of experiments. Protein lysates were reduced with DTT (Thermo Fisher Scientific), heat blocked and separated by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% pre-cast BisTris gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with MES running buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), using NuPAGE (Invitrogen) system. Resolved proteins were transferred to methanol-activated 0.2 µm PVDF membrane (BioRad), using BioRad Mini Transblot Cell wet transfer system (100V for 1 hr) and transfer buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 20% methanol. After blocking in 5% skimmed milk for 1 hr at room temperature, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies [LAMP-1 (1:1000, BD Biosciences), LC3B (1:1000, Sigma) and WASp (1:500, BD Biosciences) as needed, with GAPDH (1:1000, Santa Cruz) as loading control] for either 1 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at concentrations of 1:2000 (GE healthcare) for 1 hr at room temperature and membranes developed after incubating for 2 min with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Where needed, membranes were stripped with ReBlot Plus Strong Antibody Stripping Solution (EMD Millipore), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Densitometries were calculated using ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy</title><p>Cells were seeded onto borosilicate 1.5, 13 mm cover slips (VWR) in 24-well plates at a density of 0.2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well. For podosome analysis, cover slips were pre-treated with fibronectin 10 µg/ml (R and D Systems) overnight before seeding cells. At the end of experiments, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and fixed using 4% chilled paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min on ice, followed by 8% at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were permeabilised with 0.1% triton X-100 (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature and non-specific binding reduced by blocking with 5% BSA in PBS with 5% goat serum (Cell Signalling Technology) for 1 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% BSA/PBS [LC3 (1:200, MBL), LAMP-1 (1:50, CST), vinculin (1:200, Sigma)] and cells incubated for 1 hr at room temperature, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies-conjugated to fluorochromes (all Molecular Probes) [anti-mouse-488 (1:500), anti-rabbit 547 (1:500), anti-rabbit-647 (1:500)] for 1 hr at room temperature. F-actin was labelled with phalloidin-633 (1:200, Molecular Probes). Cover slips were mounted onto Superfrost microscope slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Prolong Diamond anti-fade mounting solution with DAPI (Molecular Probes). Slides were blinded prior to imaging and analysis as indicated in figure legends. Fluorescence microscopy images were acquired using an inverted Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope at 20x or 63x as indicated. Equal numbers of images from sequential fields of view of each blinded slide were saved and analysed using ImageJ before sample identities were released. Super-resolution images were obtained by deconvolving confocal images using Huygens software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p>Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well into Corning Falcon Easy Grip 35-mm tissue culture dishes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After experiments, cells were washed in ice cold PBS, fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde/200 mM sodium cacodylate pH 7.2 and prepared/images acquired as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Identification of potential LC3-interacting domains</title><p>Potential LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) were identified using the iLIR software resource as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalvari et al., 2014</xref>. The software analyses protein sequences for simple four amino acid combinations starting with tryptophan (W) and ending with leucine (L) (WxxL), which they describe as being the shortest sequence required for possible interaction with an Atg8-family protein. Additionally, the team identified extended potential LIR motifs (xLIR) of six amino acid sequences, which they demonstrate confer greater sensitivity and specificity of identifying true LIR domains. Position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) scores are quoted, which compare the similarity of potential new LIR domains with those already validated. The score ranges from −20 to +20 and has been validated for known sequences. A cut off of 9 is used to suggest possible LIR identification, where sensitivity was found to be high, but specificity very low. With increasing PSSM score, the sensitivity decreases, whereas specificity increases. Meaningful PSSM scores are identified in the range 13–17, with balanced accuracy most optimal at 15 or 16.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Extracellular metabolic flux analysis</title><p>A Seahorse XF<sup>e</sup>96 metabolic extracellular flux analyser was used to determine the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in mpH/min and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in pmol/min. In brief, frozen PBMCs were thawed and processed as described above and seeded (according to availability, 0.5 or 1 × 10<sup>5</sup>/well in respective experiments) in serum-free unbuffered RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma Aldrich #R6504) onto Cell-Tak (#354240, Coring, NY, USA) coated cell plates. Mito Stress test was performed by sequential addition of oligomycin (1 μM; Sigma Aldrich 75351), carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP; 2 μM; Sigma Adlrich C2920) and rotenone (1 μM; Sigma Aldrich R8875) at the indicated time points.

&quot;Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein regulates non-selective autophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis in human myeloid cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate the role of WASp in autophagy and mitophagy in immune cells, including primary monocyte/HSPC-derived macrophages from WAS patients, of clear relevance to WAS. Using a model of rapamycin-induced autophagy, the authors show that WASp plays a role in autophagy induction, as indicated by LC3 punctae formation and LC3 lipidation. In SDMs and MDMs from WAS patients, such defects in autophagy induction could be corrected by reconstitution with wild-type WASp, or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. The role of WASp in autophagy was mediated by the WASp effector ARP2/3, since chemical or genetic block of ARP2/3 leads to defects in autophagy, suggesting the involvement of actin cytoskeleton in the processes. WASp and ARP2/3 also regulate mitophagy, mediating the encapsulation of mitochondria in actin cages during mitophagy, and maintenance of mitochondrial networks. Finally, mitochondrial function (oxidative metabolism) was impaired in MDMs from WAS patients, as indicated by Seahorse.</p><p>While the authors' findings suggest how WASp deficiency can perturb autophagy and mitophagy to impair immune cell functions in WAS, there are some concerns that should be addressed before publication. Most notably, key controls are missing from many experiments that make data interpretation difficult. Also, it would also be nice if the authors could provide a bit more mechanistic insight given that some of what they have shown regarding WASp has already been described in other cell types.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In many parts of the paper, the authors are not consistent in presenting data with controls. For example, in Figure 1, while there are untreated controls for both WT THP-1 and WAS KO THP-1 cells in Figure 1A, there is no control for HC cells in Figure 1C and no control at all in Figure 1E and G. In many experiments, different stimulation conditions appear to have been used on cells from the healthy donor and the ARPC1B patient, which makes the results not strictly comparable. For example, in Figure 3E, conditions for healthy donor and ARPC1b patient are not the same.</p><p>2) Previous studies by the same lab and other labs have already shown that WASP and other WASP family proteins including JMY and WHAMM are involved in autophagosome formation. In all cases including the data from the current study, activation of ARP2/3 is required for mediating their effect. It is however unclear whether they use similar mechanisms to initiate the autophagy process. Is it possible that WASP, like JMY, possess LC3-interacting domain and so can be recruited to LC3-containing substrates/cargos for autophagy? Can the authors stain WASP and examine colocalization with LC3? These experiments would also provide more mechanistic insight into some of the authors' findings.</p><p>3) The authors show that MDMs from WAS patients have impaired oxidative metabolism as assessed by Seahorse. Does reconstitution with wild-type WASp and/or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing rescue this defect?</p><p>4) The authors described three main categories of mitochondrial morphology: networked, elongated and fragmented (Figure 5A). Because in many cases elongated mitochondria are considered to be networked, can the authors provide justification from their own experiments or from the literature indicating a functional distinction between networked and elongated mitochondria? The authors should also describe how they scored fragmented, networked, or elongated mitochondria.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55547.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In many parts of the paper, the authors are not consistent in presenting data with controls.

Due to the nature of WAS as a rare disease, access to large number of patient primary cells needed for western blotting is very limited and repeating these experiments would therefore be extremely challenging. For simplicity, this figure has now been revised to display comparable data between the healthy donor and WAS patient (revised Figure 1C). Furthermore, the reduced LC3II protein expression demonstrated in Figure 1C was presented only to support the data from cell lines and is further demonstrated in the LC3 punctae formation visualised by confocal microscopy, as shown in revised Figure 1G.</p><p>For Figure 1E and G, controls were not presented purely to reduce the figure size. Representative images have now been added and can be viewed in revised Figure 1E and G.</p><p>The stimulation conditions used for confocal imaging of primary cells were always the same. We thank the reviewer for picking up a typo in the display for Figure 3E, which should have noted the same conditions for healthy donor and ARPC1B patient, reflecting the true experimental conditions. This figure has now been revised accordingly (revised Figure 3E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Previous studies by the same lab and other labs have already shown that WASP and other WASP family proteins including JMY and WHAMM are involved in autophagosome formation.

Rapamycin-induced autophagy stimulation of primary MDMs did not find consistent localisation of WASp with LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Intracellular staining of WASp with other proteins is notoriously unreliable, even for established WASp functions such as podosome formation. However, analysis of LC3 punctae in eGFP-WASp THP-1 cells also did not demonstrate colocalization between the two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). We know from Figures 1, 3 and 4 that autophagy is impaired in the absence of either WASp or ARP2/3, suggesting that the interaction of the two is crucial. Further imaging looking for ARP2/3 in addition to WASp was not pursued since the role of ARP2/3 and WASp in autophagosome formation may be transient and therefore better captured in a dynamic imaging model. Additionally, the finding of ARP2/3 and/or WASp in complex with LC3 in rapamycin-induced autophagy would not necessarily infer insight into functionality of these interactions. Having said this, our previous work did identify WASp in complex with actin and septins in xenophagy (Lee et al., 2017). It is possible that WASp and/or ARP2/3 might be more easily identified with LC3 in our mitophagy model, but again, further information on the functionality of these interactions would not be gained through confocal imaging.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>a) Healthy donor MDMs cultured with rapamycin and bafilomycin for 6 hours.</title><p>Fixed and stained for LC3 (red), WASp (green) and DAPI (blue).

(Kalvari et al., 2014), to analyse the likelihood of an LC3-interacting region (LIR) in WASp. The software analyses protein sequences for simple four amino acid combinations starting with tryptophan (W) and ending with leucine (L) (WxxL), which they describe as being the shortest sequence required for possible interaction with an Atg8-family protein. Additionally, the team identified extended potential LIR motifs (xLIR) of 6 amino acid sequences, which they demonstrate confer greater sensitivity and specificity of identifying true LIR domains. Position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) scores are quoted, which compare the similarity of potential new LIR domains with those already validated. The score ranges from -20 to +20 and has been validated for known sequences. A cut off of 9 is used to suggest possible LIR identification, where sensitivity was found to be high, but specificity very low. With increasing PSSM score, the sensitivity decreases whilst specificity increases. Meaningful PSSM scores are identified in the range 13-17, with balanced accuracy most optimal at 15 or 16.</p><p>Analysis of WASp’s amino acid sequence using this web resource did not find any xLIR domains (Figure 3—source data 1). Several WxxL motifs were identified, but PSSM scores were low (max. 10), making a functional interaction between WASp and LC3 unlikely. The same process was carried out for all seven ARP2/3 complex subunits. In contrast to WASp analysis, three out of the seven ARP2/3 subunits (ARP2, ARP3 and ARPC2) were found to contain xLIR motifs, with high PSSM scores, highly predictive of functional LIR domains. Additionally, ARPC1B was identified to have a WxxL motif with high PSSM score that could also be predicted to contain a functional LIR motif.</p><p>Whilst the above analysis would support our hypothesis that WASp is acting through ARP2/3 in autophagy, it is also worth mentioning that LIR motif-independent modes of interaction with Atg-8 family proteins have also been reported (Behrends et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors show that MDMs from WAS patients have impaired oxidative metabolism as assessed by Seahorse.

However, recovery of mitochondrial morphology, as seen in revised Figure 5B, would allow us to speculate that this may be the case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors described three main categories of mitochondrial morphology: networked, elongated and fragmented (Figure 5A). Because in many cases elongated mitochondria are considered to be networked, can the authors provide justification from their own experiments or from the literature indicating a functional distinction between networked and elongated mitochondria? The authors should also describe how they scored fragmented, networked, or elongated mitochondria.</p></disp-quote><p>Classification of mitochondrial morphology was based on visual appearances. It is unclear whether there is a functional distinction between networked and elongated mitochondria, but a visual difference was observed, where mitochondria appear more joined together in some cells. We wondered if that could reflect mitochondria in a different state and where found in increased proportion (e.g. ARPC1B-deficient cells) could indicate a potential difference in mitochondrial fission more than fusion. As the reviewer points out, elongated mitochondria are considered to be a form of networked and so figures have been revised to combine elongated and networked morphologies (revised Figure 5A and C).</p></body></sub-article></article>
