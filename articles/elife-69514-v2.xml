Although often treated as a monolithic structure, the basal forebrain features distinct connectivity along its rostrocaudal axis that could impart regional differences in BFCN processing. Here, we performed simultaneous bulk calcium imaging from rostral and caudal BFCNs over a 1-month period of variable reinforcement learning in mice. BFCNs in both regions showed equivalently weak responses to unconditioned visual stimuli and anticipated rewards. Rostral BFCNs in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band were more responsive to reward omission, more accurately classified behavioral outcomes, and more closely tracked fluctuations in pupil-indexed global brain state. Caudal tail BFCNs in globus pallidus and substantia innominata were more responsive to unconditioned auditory stimuli, orofacial movements, aversive reinforcement, and showed robust associative plasticity for punishment-predicting cues. These results identify a functional topography that diversifies cholinergic modulatory signals broadcast to downstream brain regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>cholinergic</kwd><kwd>basal forebrain</kwd><kwd>auditory</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC017078</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polley</surname><given-names>Daniel B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007429</institution-id><institution>Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polley</surname><given-names>Daniel B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Herchel Smith Harvard Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>Blaise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Zdenek et Michaela Bakala Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>Blaise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08MH116135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kimchi</surname><given-names>Eyal Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activity levels in anterior and posterior cholinergic basal forebrain neurons are associated with distinct aspects of global brain state, sensory salience, reward expectation, and aversive reinforcement learning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Basal forebrain projections innervate the neocortex, hippocampus, and amygdala to regulate stimulus salience and global brain state across a wide range of timescales (for recent reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Disney and Higley, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Monosov, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sarter and Lustig, 2020</xref>). The basal forebrain is not a monolithic structure, but rather a constellation of discrete brain areas that feature distinct combinations of neurochemical cell types and distinct arrangements of afferent and efferent connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gielow and Zaborszky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rye et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zaborszky et al., 2012</xref>). Any single region of the basal forebrain is composed of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons, which can each exhibit distinct downstream targeting and functional response properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Do et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laszlovszky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). As a whole, the basal forebrain is understood to contribute to learning, memory, attention, arousal, and neurodegenerative disease processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Everitt and Robbins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Monosov, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zaborszky et al., 2012</xref>). However, the heterogeneity of cell types and projection targets have made it challenging to identify specific computations or specialized feature processing performed by ‘the’ basal forebrain, underscoring the need for cell type-specific recordings from targeted regions in task-engaged animals.</p><p>Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), though numerically the rarest major neurochemical class of basal forebrain neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gritti et al., 2006</xref>), are by far the most extensively studied. In rats and mice, where cholinergic neurons can be accessed for tracing, monitoring, and manipulation with transgenic approaches, BFCNs exhibit distinct arrangements of afferent and efferent connections along the extended rostrocaudal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gielow and Zaborszky, 2017</xref>). BFCNs in rostral structures such as the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) feature strong reciprocal connectivity with prefrontal cortex and lateral hypothalamus, with additional projections to entorhinal cortex, olfactory bulb, and pyriform cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bloem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gielow and Zaborszky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rye et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zaborszky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). By contrast, BFCNs at the caudal tail of the basal forebrain, at the intersection of globus pallidus and substantia innominata (GP/SI), receive strong inputs from the caudate putamen, the medial geniculate, and posterior intrathalamic nuclei, and are the primary source of cholinergic input to the auditory cortex (ACtx), with comparatively weak projections to frontal cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chavez and Zaborszky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rye et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zaborszky et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bulk basal forebrain cholinergic neuron (BFCN) activity and cortical acetylcholine release closely correspond with pupil-indexed global brain state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mid-sagittal diagram of the mouse brain depicting the diversity in major inputs (gray) and outputs (colored) between a rostroventral basal forebrain structure, the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB), and the caudodorsal tail of the basal forebrain, the boundary of the globus pallidus and substantia innominata (GP/SI).

The evidence for this conclusion primarily comes from two types of measurements. First, there are many converging reports of strong, short-latency BFCN responses to aversive stimuli such as air puffs or foot shock whether recordings are made from HDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laszlovszky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sturgill et al., 2020</xref>), from the caudal extreme of the basal forebrain, GP/SI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref>), or from an intermediate region of rodent SI often labeled as nucleus basalis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laszlovszky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>). Second, cortical fluorescence imaging of genetically encoded acetylcholine (ACh) sensors or calcium signals in BFCN axons have demonstrated a strong correspondence between cholinergic activity and behavioral indices of global arousal, as determined from EEG markers, isoluminous pupil diameter changes, and gross motor markers such as grooming or locomotion (ACh sensor imaging – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lohani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Teles-Grilo Ruivo et al., 2017</xref>; calcium imaging for HDB – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sturgill et al., 2020</xref>; nucleus basalis – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>; GP/SI – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson and Mooney, 2016</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, there are many inconsistencies in the emerging BFCN literature. These discrepancies could reflect differences in the anatomical source of BFCN activity, or they could arise from differences in mouse lines, behavioral task designs, and measurement techniques. For example, auditory cue-evoked BFCN responses have been described as absent altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>), observed only for reward-predictive sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crouse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parikh et al., 2007</xref>), or enhanced after reinforcement learning but present even for unconditioned stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, behavioral accuracy in discrimination tasks have been classified from BFCN activity both preceding and following the sensory cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parikh et al., 2007</xref>), only from the post-cue response period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laszlovszky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sturgill et al., 2020</xref>), or only from putative non-cholinergic cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin and Nicolelis, 2008</xref>). Reward-evoked BFCN activity has been described as weak overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crouse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parikh et al., 2007</xref>) or rapid and quite strong, particularly for uncertain rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laszlovszky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sturgill et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Teles-Grilo Ruivo et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, the relationship between BFCN activity and movement is unclear, with variable reports of strong recruitment by orofacial movements or locomotion occurring outside of a behavioral task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson and Mooney, 2016</xref>), strong only for movements associated with reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crouse et al., 2020</xref>), or absent, whether movements were linked to reinforcement or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parikh et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, while mesoscale imaging from the entire dorsal surface of the mouse neocortex was recently used to confirm an overall strong association between motor activity, global brain state, and ACh release, the findings also emphasized clear differences between behavioral states and spatiotemporal ACh dynamics, again suggesting functional heterogeneity in the sources of cholinergic input innervating anterior and posterior cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lohani et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To better understand whether the disparate findings described above may reflect regional specializations for processing sensory and reinforcement signals within the cholinergic basal forebrain, we developed an approach to minimize inter-subject variation by testing all of the experimental features mentioned above in individual mice while making simultaneous fiber-based bulk GCaMP recordings from BFCNs in HDB and GP/SI. For some variables, we observed closely matched responses in rostral and caudal regions, suggesting a common output that would be broadcast to downstream brain regions. For example, both HDB and GP/SI exhibited equivalently weak overall responses to unconditioned visual stimuli and anticipated rewards. For other measures, we noted clear differences between BFCN activity in each region: HDB exhibited a comparatively strong association with pupil-indexed brain state, behavioral trial outcome, and with the omission of expected rewards. Response amplitudes for aversive stimuli were larger in GP/SI, as were responses to orofacial movements, unconditioned auditory stimuli, and learning-related enhancement of punishment-predicting auditory cues. These findings identify a coarse functional topography within the cholinergic basal forebrain that can be interpreted in light of the distinct connectivity of each region and will motivate future hypotheses about the causal involvement of each region in brain function and behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A transgenic strategy for selective GCaMP expression in HDB and GP/SI BFCNs</title><p>To characterize regional specializations within the cholinergic basal forebrain across a wide range of task-related variables, we performed dual fiber imaging from HDB and GP/SI in the right hemisphere of Chat-Cre mice that were crossed to the GCaMP6f reporter line, Ai148 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>).

Ectopic expression in glia and non-cholinergic neurons can also be a problem, even in popular ChAT<sub>(IRES)</sub>-Cre lines, either because the presence of a frt-flanked neo cassette can result in off-target expression, or because a fraction of glutamatergic neurons express ChAT transiently during development and would therefore still be labeled with Cre-based transgenic expression approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nasirova et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used hemizygous offspring from the ChAT<sub>(IRES)</sub>-CreΔneo line, in which the neo cassette is removed to reduce ectopic expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nasirova et al., 2020</xref>). We confirmed that GCaMP expression was almost entirely restricted to cholinergic neurons within the HDB and GP/SI by immunolabeling regions near the end of the fiber tips for ChAT in a subset of implanted mice (N = 4, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for a presentation of all 22 fiber tip locations in 11 mice). ChAT-negative neurons that expressed GCaMP were rare, amounting to just 95/1719 in HDB (5.5%) and 48/764 in GP/SI (6.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, left). As identified in prior studies, we observed aberrant expression in brain regions outside of the basal forebrain, including both the near-complete absence of GCaMP expression in ChAT+ striatal interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right) but also ectopic expression of GCaMP in ChAT-negative cells in neocortex and hippocampus. Therefore, while our transgenic strategy was appropriate for bulk imaging from cholinergic neurons in HDB and GP/SI cholinergic neurons (and in fact was aided by the absence of striatal GCaMP expression), it would not necessarily be a valid strategy for the study of other brain regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Strong coherence between pupil-indexed arousal and cholinergic activity</title><p>Basal forebrain neurons have a well-established role in regulating global brain state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Buzsaki et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). The cholinergic basal forebrain, in particular, is a key regulator of neocortical excitability across sleep states as well as levels of vigilance during quiescent awake states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Buzsaki et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Everitt and Robbins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Teles-Grilo Ruivo et al., 2017</xref>). Under isoluminous lighting conditions, pupil diameter provides a sensitive index of arousal and has been shown to co-vary with GCaMP activity measured in cholinergic basal forebrain axon fields within the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson and Mooney, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). Prior measurements were either made in ChAT-Cre× GCaMP reporter lines or via relatively large viral solution injection quantities (0.4–1 μL), which leaves unresolved the question of how the activity of cholinergic neurons in specific regions of the basal forebrain corresponds to pupil-indexed arousal state. To address this point, we simultaneously monitored spontaneous pupil fluctuations alongside fiber-based GCaMP imaging from HDB and GP/SI. We observed a striking correspondence between spontaneous pupil dilations and slow fluctuations in GCaMP signal amplitudes in both regions of the cholinergic basal forebrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). GCaMP coherence with pupil fluctuations was significantly higher in HDB than GP/SI, where bulk calcium dynamics could account for as much as 80% of the variability in slow pupil changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, statistical reporting provided in figure legends). The timing of correlated GCaMP transients and pupil dilations were similar across brain areas, where GCaMP signals led pupil dilations by approximately 0.7 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>One of the underlying assumptions in our approach is that bulk calcium imaging from ChAT-Cre neurons in the basal forebrain is a useful way to measure the suprathreshold activity of local BFCNs and infer the timing of ACh release in downstream targets. For example, based on the correspondence between basal forebrain bulk GCaMP levels and pupil diameter, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that ACh levels also co-vary with pupil dilations with a similar coherence. HDB and GP/SI BFCNs both project to ACtx, although BFCN → ACtx projections are far more numerous in GP/SI than HDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chavez and Zaborszky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rye et al., 1984</xref>). To monitor ACh dynamics in ACtx related to pupil fluctuations, we expressed the genetically encoded ACh fluorescent sensor, GRAB<sub>ACh</sub>3.0 (ACh3.0), in ACtx neurons and monitored fluorescence dynamic with tapered optical fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pisano et al., 2019</xref>). As expected, coherence between ACtx ACh3.0 fluorescence and pupil fluctuations strongly resembled GCaMP coherence from GP/SI cell bodies, both in terms of the strong coherence with slow (&lt;0.1 Hz) changes in pupil diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and in terms of timing, where ACh3.0 signal surges led pupil dilations by approximately 0.6 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These findings validate our use of bulk fiber-based calcium imaging in the GCaMP reporter line as a useful way to monitor cholinergic basal forebrain activity and additionally demonstrate a strong correspondence between pupil-indexed arousal and activity surges in HDB and – to a lesser extent – GP/SI.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Audiovisual stimulus encoding and habituation across the cholinergic basal forebrain</title><p>Having confirmed that our dual fiber bulk GCaMP imaging approach could capture the expected relationship between pupil-indexed brain state and cortical ACh levels, we next tested regional variations in BFCN responses for passively presented unconditioned auditory and visual stimuli that had no explicit behavioral significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Ripple-evoked BFCN responses decayed in parallel with pupil responses, where responses decreased by approximately 30% after the first presentation before stabilizing at approximately 60% of the initial amplitude across subsequent presentations. Although the ripple-evoked response amplitude was greater overall in GP/SI than HDB, the proportional decay with habituation was equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Rapid habituation of BFCN responses was also observed for auditory ripples presented at lower sound levels, visual gratings at lower contrast, and for moderate intensity pure tones, providing further evidence that BFCN sensory responses were modulated stimulus novelty across a wide range of physical stimulus types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, to control for the possibility that the progressive response decay reflected photobleaching of the sample or another source of measurement noise, we also quantified the amplitude of spontaneous GCaMP transients measured during trials in which neither auditory nor visual stimuli were presented. We found that the amplitude of spontaneous GCaMP transients was unchanged throughout the recording period, confirming that the reduced sensory-evoked GCaMP responses over the test session reflected habituation to stimulus novelty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Stable BFCN responses to reward-predicting cues</title><p>Prior studies have described enhanced BFCN responses to sensory cues associated with reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crouse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parikh et al., 2007</xref>) and co-modulation of BFCN activity rates with behavioral performance accuracy in sensory detection and recognition tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laszlovszky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parikh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sturgill et al., 2020</xref>).

Even when experiments are largely performed on a single species (mice) and focus largely on a single neurochemical cell type (cholinergic neurons), there have still been inconsistencies in the conclusions drawn from different experiments, particularly with respect to how BFCN activity relates to movement, to reward, to conditioned vs. unconditioned sensory cues, and to predicting behavioral outcomes from cue-related activity. We reasoned that this variability could reflect differences in measurement technique, inter-subject variation, and differences in where the recordings were made along the extent of the rostrocaudal basal forebrain. To address this possibility, we developed an approach to study all of the experimental features listed above in each of our subjects while making simultaneous recordings from rostral and caudal regions of the cholinergic basal forebrain that are known to have distinct afferent and efferent connections.</p><p>The findings reported here can be summarized by identifying experimental features where HDB was more strongly involved than GP/SI, where GP/SI was more strongly involved than HDB, and where both structures were equivalently responsive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

In particular, ‘native’ BFCN responses to unconditioned auditory stimuli were markedly stronger in GP/SI compared with HDB, as was learning-related enhancement of punishment-predicting auditory cues. Other reports of BFCNs have either observed that cue-evoked responses only emerge after a learned association with reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crouse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parikh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sturgill et al., 2020</xref>) or were not obviously present either for reward- or punishment-predicting cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>). Although anterior BFCNs receive sparse monosynaptic thalamic inputs from the medial subdivision of the medial geniculate body and neighboring posterior intralaminar nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gielow and Zaborszky, 2017</xref>), the input from auditory thalamic regions to GP/SI appears far more dense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chavez and Zaborszky, 2017</xref>). Single unit recordings from GP/SI have revealed well-tuned short-latency (~10 ms) spiking responses to a broad class of sounds including moderate intensity tones and noise bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chernyshev and Weinberger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maho et al., 1995</xref>). By contrast, single unit recordings from basal forebrain units in the medial septum (rostral to HDB) also identified short-latency responses to unconditioned sounds. However, medial septal units only responded to intense broadband sounds and were derived from pontine central gray afferent inputs, not auditory thalamic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Given that GP/SI is the predominant source of BFCN input to lateral neocortical regions including ACtx, one clear implication that would be important to test in future studies is that auditory stimuli – even sounds with no behavioral relevance – should elicit ACh release in ACtx. ACh acts through local ACtx microcircuits to remove the fetters that normally limit long-term associative plasticity, thereby enabling local synaptic processes that support auditory fear memory encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Letzkus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weinberger, 2004</xref>) and perceptual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Froemke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takesian et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, learning-related plasticity in ACtx requires transient neuromodulatory surges and does not occur when stimuli are presented in a passive context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Froemke, 2015</xref>). This suggests that cholinergic regulation of cortical plasticity is not an all-or-none gating process but instead may reflect a threshold that is only exceeded when sound-evoked cholinergic inputs are themselves transiently amplified through learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref>). Beyond simple gating mechanisms, dual recordings from single BFCNs and ACtx neurons during Pavlovian auditory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref>) and attentionally demanding auditory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laszlovszky et al., 2020</xref>) have demonstrated dynamics in BFCN-cortex synchrony that change in lockstep with associative plasticity and auditory perceptual salience. Although the upstream factors that regulate BFCN plasticity and inter-regional synchrony have yet to be identified, it is clear that models portraying phasic cortical ACh release occurring only at times of reward, punishment, or heightened arousal need to be reevaluated, at least as they relate to the caudal tail of the basal forebrain and the ACtx.</p><p>As for the learning-related enhancement of punishment-predicting – but not reward-predicting cues in GP/SI – this again may reflect the unique input this region of the basal forebrain receives from the medial geniculate and intralaminar thalamic groups, which also exhibit rapid, selective, and long-lasting enhanced spiking to tones associated with aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edeline and Weinberger, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weinberger, 2011</xref>). Learned enhancement of reward-predicting auditory cues have either been observed in BFCN axons arising from more rostral basal forebrain regions that innervate the basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crouse et al., 2020</xref>) and ACtx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>), or have only been described in putative non-cholinergic neurons in HDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin and Nicolelis, 2008</xref>), which therefore offers no point of contradiction with the absence of reward-related enhancement reported here in HDB and GP/SI BFCNs. As mentioned above, another possibility is that HDB and GP/SI BFCNs did exhibit an increased response to reward-predicting cues during the initial association of sound and reward, which occurred during the behavioral shaping period when we did not monitor activity. Collectively, these findings point toward the caudal tail of the basal forebrain, which provides the strongest overall projection from the basal forebrain to ACtx and where approximately 80% of the neurons are cholinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rye et al., 1984</xref>), as a hub for encoding and associating sound with aversive, noxious stimuli, and for regulating inhibitory microcircuits within ACtx for long-term plasticity to enhance the representation of threat-predicting sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our findings support the view that rostral and caudal BFCN responses share many similarities in their response features, particularly as they relate to arousal and reinforcement, yet regional afferent and efferent connectivity differences – particularly in the caudal tail of the basal forebrain – support regional specializations for encoding sensory salience and expressing associative plasticity during aversive reinforcement learning. Interestingly, a neighboring region to GP/SI in the tail of the striatum also receive specialized dopaminergic inputs that do not encode reward value, but rather are activated by potentially threatening sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Menegas et al., 2018</xref>). This raises the interesting suggestion that cholinergic and dopaminergic signaling in the caudal tail of the rodent basal ganglia and basal forebrain may function as a hub for encoding threatening signals and selecting adaptive threat avoidance behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watabe-Uchida and Uchida, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Technical considerations in the interpretation of these findings</title><p>From a technical perspective, fiber-based imaging was the best methodology to address our experimental aims, particularly for the goal of performing simultaneous measurements of rostral and caudal BFCNs over an extended period. BFCNs in GP/SI are arrayed in a thin dorsoventral sheet along the lateral wall of the internal capsule and then split into thin vertically oriented arrangements along the medial and lateral boundaries of the external GP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clayton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref>). This anatomy is not optimal for endoscopic imaging through implanted lenses, as it could be challenging to visualize BFCNs in a single focal plane. Two-photon imaging of the cortical axon terminals from GP/SI BFCNs is feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson and Mooney, 2016</xref>), though these signals would still arise from an indeterminate number of neurons and concerns about tissue bleaching and photodamage would not be compatible with the hours of daily testing over 30+ consecutive days that was performed here. Antidromic or somatic optogenetic tagging of single BFCNs is the gold standard, affording the highest level of spatial and temporal resolution. Our prior work used the antidromic variant of this approach to make targeted single unit recordings from GP/SI BFCNs that project to ACtx, but the yield was punishingly low (~1% of all units recorded) and units could not be held long enough to measure responses to all of the experimental variables tested here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>However, there are important limitations and technical caveats with fiber-based bulk GCaMP imaging that should be taken into consideration in the interpretation of these findings. Because fiber photometry signals arise from populations of neurons, it is impossible to discern whether differences in response amplitude over learning or across different behavioral states reflect the activation of privileged ensembles that were hitherto silent or instead an increased response expressed uniformly across neurons. Conversely, the absence of differences in the population signal could belie striking shifts in the representational dominance of antagonistically related cellular ensembles that would not be captured by changes in net signal amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grewe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gründemann, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). Another caveat in the interpretation of fiber-based GCaMP imaging is that the slow temporal kinetics and poor spatial resolution combines somatic and neuropil-based calcium signals and obscures the relationship to spike rates in distinct types of BFCNs. This would be particularly worrisome if the axons of BFCNs in HDB or GP/SI projected to or through the other region, as this could either produce optical cross-talk (i.e., axon fluorescence originating from BFCNs in region A measured on the region B fiber) or functional cross-talk (i.e., projections from BFCNs in region A modulate the activity of region B). Neither of these possibilities is likely a concern in the interpretation of these findings. Correlating all single trial tone-evoked response amplitudes measured on each fiber reveals a very weak association (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.16, n = 21,099 trials), demonstrating that the activity in HDB and GP/SI can be measured independently. Further, anatomical characterizations suggest that BFCN inputs within the basal forebrain primarily arise from local neurons rather than remote regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gielow and Zaborszky, 2017</xref>). To this point, direct visualization of efferent HDB axons showed that they left the basal forebrain in a medial and dorsal orientation, coming nowhere near the GP/SI fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bloem et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cholinergic regulation of perceptual salience</title><p>Although the proportion of cholinergic neurons declines rostral to GP/SI, the overall spatial arrangement and larger cell body size of BFCNs in nucleus basalis and HDB makes somatic optogenetic tagging of single units somewhat more feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laszlovszky et al., 2020</xref>). An elegant recent study has demonstrated that BFCNs within nucleus basalis and HDB are not an indivisible class, but can themselves be further subdivided into bursting and regular-firing BFCNs, where the proportion of each type varied across the rostral-caudal extent of the basal forebrain and had distinct patterns of synchronization both with respect to each other and with network oscillations measured in ACtx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laszlovszky et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, when studied in the context of an auditory task similar to the paradigm used here, the spike timing of bursting BFCNs showed a stronger coupling with the ACtx on trials where mice made a Go response (regardless of whether it was a hit or false positive) whereas the regular-firing BFCNs showed a stronger coupling with the ACtx on trials where mice made the correct response (regardless of whether it was Go or NoGo).</p><p>Although fiber-based BFCN imaging cannot distinguish between the involvement of each cell type, we also noted a striking correspondence between GCaMP activity in the peri-cue period and the subsequent behavioral outcome (either hit or miss, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–I</xref>). Our findings confirm an association between BFCN activity and trial outcome in the period following the delivery of the auditory cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laszlovszky et al., 2020</xref>), but we observed a clear connection to trial outcome during the preceding 1 s baseline period (thereby obviating any confound related to differences in licking activity between hit and miss trials). Prior studies have also reported that cholinergic levels prior to auditory onset can predict whether the animal would subsequently produce the correct or incorrect operant response, suggesting the bulk measures may be sensitive to pre-cue dynamics that are not resolvable at the level of single neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parikh et al., 2007</xref>). In a recent study, we found that hit or miss trial outcomes in a challenging auditory detection task could be predicted from the degree of synchrony in local networks of ACtx layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons measured from a 1 s period prior to the delivery of the auditory cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Resnik and Polley, 2021</xref>). As the cholinergic basal forebrain has classically been studied as a master regulator of cortical network synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Buzsaki et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Metherate et al., 1992</xref>), one clear suggestion is that ongoing cholinergic dynamics in the period preceding environmental sensory cues strongly regulate cortical network state, which can have profound impacts on the accurate encoding of sensory cues and appropriate selection of cue-directed actions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6.129S-<italic>Chat<sup>tm1(cre)Lowl</sup></italic>/MwarJ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:031661">IMSR_JAX:031661</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Male</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6.Cg-Igs7<sup>tm148.1(tetO-GCaMP6f,CAG-tTA2)Hze</sup>/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:030328">IMSR_JAX:030328</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Female</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-ChAT (goat polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Millipore Sigma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat #: AB144PRRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2079751">AB_2079751</ext-link></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Goat (donkey polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: AB150132RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2810222">AB_2810222</ext-link></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ACh sensor</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr Yulong Li</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GRAB<sub>ACh</sub>3.0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Labview</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">National Instruments</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_014325">SCR_014325</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 2015</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mathworks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version R2021a</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DAPI stain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Vectorlabs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat #: H-1500–10RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2336788">AB_2336788</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Allen Brain Atlas</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lein et al., 2007</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_013286">SCR_013286</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were approved by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Animal Care and Use Committee and followed the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health for the care and use of laboratory animals.

The dorsal surface of the scalp was retracted and the periosteum was removed. Dual optic fiber implants (Doric, 400 μm core, NA 0.48, 1.25 mm diameter low-autofluorescence metal ferrule) were slowly lowered into HDB (0.9 × 0.3 × 4.7) and GP/SI (2.5 × –1.5 × 3.3 mm from bregma, [lateral × caudal × ventral]) in the right hemisphere. Silicon adhesive (WPI Kwik-Sil) was applied to the exposed brain surface.

Video recordings of the pupil under isoluminous background conditions were performed during the final habituation session and the following sensory characterization day. Video recordings were made at 30 Hz with a CMOS camera (Teledyne Dalsa, model M2020) outfitted with a lens (Tamron 032938) and infrared longpass filter (Midopt lp830-25.5). Automated analysis of pupil diameter follows the procedure described previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>. Briefly, each movie was thresholded such that most pixel values within the pupil were below threshold and all other pixels were above threshold. A circle was fit to the pupil by first calculating the center of mass within the pupil and then centering a circle with the corresponding area to that point. Canny edge detection was then used to identify edge pixels within each grayscale image. Edge pixels were removed if they were more than three pixels away from a pupil pixel or outside of an annulus with diameters that were 0.5 and 1.75 the diameter of the initial fit circle. As a final step, an ellipse was fit to the remaining edge pixels using least-squares regression and the pupil diameter was defined from the diameter of a circle with a matching area. This procedure was performed for each image frame using a MATLAB (Mathworks) script adapted from the original publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>).</p><p>Pupil diameter for ACh3.0 sensor imaging experiments was extracted using DeepLabCut (version 2.1.8.2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nath et al., 2019</xref>).

The four cardinal and four intercardinal compass points were marked for each pupil. Marker placement was confirmed by at least one additional investigator. Training was performed on 95% of frames. We used a ResNet-101 based neural network with default parameters for 1,030,000 training iterations. We then used a p-value cutoff of 0.9 to condition the X,Y coordinates for analysis. This network was then used to analyze videos from similar experimental settings from the 10 ACh3.0 sensor imaging mice.

On session 4, pupillometry and fiber imaging was performed in response to the presentation of auditory or visual stimuli. Beginning on day 5, mice were placed on water restriction and were monitored until they reached 80% of their baseline weight. Beginning on day 8 or 9, after several days of behavioral shaping, mice began appetitive operant training that rewarded vigorous licking shortly following the presentation of three different tone frequencies. Finally, on days 13–22, mice were switched to a reinforcement reversal task, where two of the previously rewarded frequencies were switched to neutral or aversive reinforcement. These methods for each of these stages are provided in detail below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sensory characterization</title><p>Visual gratings were generated in MATLAB using the Psychtoolbox extension and presented via an 800 × 480 pixel display (Adafruit 2406) positioned approximately 15 cm from the left eye 45° off midline. Visual gratings were presented with a spatial frequency of 0.035 cycles per degree at three contrasts: 11%, 33%, and 100%. Gratings (2 s duration) were presented at both vertical and horizontal orientations. Spatial drift (2 Hz) was imposed along the orthogonal axis to orientation.</p><p>Auditory stimuli were either pure tones or auditory drifting gratings (i.e., ripples). Stimuli were generated with a 24-bit digital-to-analog converter (National Instruments model PXI-4461) and presented via a free-field speaker (CUI, CMS0201KLX) placed approximately 10 cm from the left (contralateral) ear canal. Free-field stimuli were calibrated using a wide-band free-field microphone (PCB Electronics, 378C01). Pure tones were low (either 6 or 6.8 kHz), mid (9.5 or 11.3 kHz), or high (13.9 or 18.5 kHz) frequencies presented at three intensities (30, 50, and 70 dB SPL). Tones were 0.4 s duration shaped with 5 ms raised cosine onset and offset ramps. Auditory gratings ranged from 2 to 45 kHz with 2 s duration (5 ms raised cosine onset and offset ramps), presented at downward and upward frequency trajectories (at –2 and +2 Hz) at three intensities (30, 50, and 70 dB SPL). The spectrum was shaped with 20 frequency carriers per octave that were sinusoidally modulated with 90% depth at one cycle per octave.</p><p>A single block consisted of 22 unique stimulus trials with a 7 s inter-trial interval (6 visual gratings [2 orientations × 3 contrasts], 9 tones [3 frequencies × 3 levels], 6 auditory gratings [2 directions × 3 intensities] and one silent trial where neither an auditory nor visual stimulus was presented). The stimulus order was randomly determined for each of 20 presentation blocks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Operant training</title><p>Behavioral shaping for the rewarded tone detection task began after the sensory characterization session. In the initial phase of training, mice learned to vigorously lick a spout shortly following tone onset (low, mid, or high frequency, as specified above at 70 dB SPL) in order to receive a liquid reward (10% sucrose in water, 1.5 μL per reward, 1 reward per trial). Initially, tones were paired with rewards (i.e., Pavlovian conditioning), initiated 0.5 s after tone onset. Fiber imaging was not performed during behavioral shaping.</p><p>Once mice were reliably licking prior to reward onset, the requirement to trigger reward delivery (i.e., operant conditioning) was progressively increased. The licking criterion to receive a reward was seven lickspout contacts within a 2.8 s period beginning 0.2 s after stimulus onset, where the interval between any 2 consecutive licks could not exceed 1 s. Individual trials were scored as hits, according to the criterion above, misses (no licks), or partial hits (lickspout contact that did not meet the criterion above). Intertrial intervals were determined randomly from a truncated exponential distribution within a range of 7–10 s. Trials were aborted in the event of lick spout contact in a withhold period of 2 s (initial phase) or 1.5 s (after reversal) preceding stimulus onset. Generally, mice learned to produce 7 licks in 2.8 s to initiate reward with low false alarm rates within two to three sessions.</p><p>In order to analyze licking-related activity, separate lick bouts were also selected from the inter-trial periods. Lick bouts were defined as at least 2 lick contacts less than 250 ms apart, bookended by quiescent lick-free periods at least 1 s each before and after the bout.</p><p>Once the reward rate exceeded 70% across all frequencies for at least one session, mice were transitioned to the reversal stage of the operant task in which one of the three tones remained associated with reward, one was associated with shock, and a third was not associated with reward or punishment (i.e., neutral outcome). The assignment of tone frequency to reinforcement condition was randomized across mice. Punishment was delivered by briefly electrifying the lick spout (0.6mA for 0.4 s) once the lick bout threshold (7 licks in 2.8 s) had been crossed. During this stage, the rewarded tone was presented on 50% of trials and the punished and neutral tones were each presented on 25% of trials. Operant testing was terminated once the Go probability stabilized across all tone frequencies for at least 2 consecutive days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fiber photometry</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>LEDs of different wavelengths provided a basis for separating calcium-dependent (465 nm) and calcium-independent (405 nm) fluorescence.

The optical patch cable was connected to the fiber implant via a zirconia mating sleeve. Bulk fluorescent signals were acquired with a femtowatt photoreceiver (2151, Newport) and digital signal processor (Tucker-Davis Technologies RZ5D). The signal was demodulated by the lock-in amplifier implemented in the processor, sampled at 1017 Hz, and low-pass filtered with a corner frequency at 20 Hz.

Event-related DF/F<sub>0</sub> values were then z-scored relative to baseline activity levels. For passive sensory characterization experiments, the baseline distribution consisted of all DF/F<sub>0</sub> recorded during a 2 s window preceding visual or auditory stimulus onset.

Lag was defined by the peak of the cross-correlation between fluorescence (GCaMP or ACh3.0) and pupil fluctuations. Event-related response amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) were calculated on an individual trial basis. To measure sensory-evoked response amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), the mean fractional change during a 2 s pre-stimulus baseline was subtracted from both the peak fractional change during the 2 s stimulus period and a 0.4 s period immediately preceding stimulus onset. The sensory-evoked response amplitude was then calculated as post−pre. The amplitude of spontaneous transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) was calculated on trials where neither an auditory nor visual stimulus was presented. A threshold was applied to DF/F<sub>0</sub> values for each trial to identify time points corresponding to the bottom 5% of fractional change values. Spontaneous transients were operationally defined as any time point containing a value that was at least 0.5 z-scores above the 5% threshold. Spontaneous activity was then quantified as the mean value for all suprathreshold values within the trial.

We fit the classifier model to a data matrix consisting of the fractional change in fluorescence (binned at 10 ms resolution) either during a 1 s period preceding tone presentation or a 400 ms period following the onset of tone presentation. We used principal components analysis to reduce dimensionality of the data matrix before classification. We then used only the principal components needed to account for 90% of the variance in the data for the SVM-based classification. Leave one-out cross-validation was then used to train the classifier and compute a misclassification rate on the untrained trial. This process was then iterated 50 times, each time ensuring an equivalent number of hit and miss trials in the sample by randomly downsampling the hit trials. We repeated this process for each imaging session independently and calculated the mean decoding accuracy across sessions for each mouse. As a control we randomly assigned the hit and miss labels to confirm that classification accuracy was at chance. The SVM training and cross-validation procedure was carried out in MATLAB using the ‘fitcsvm’ and ‘predict’ functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Histology</title><p>At the conclusion of imaging, mice were deeply anesthetized and prepared for transcardial perfusion with a 4% formalin solution in 0.1 M phosphate buffer.

For all brains, the location of the fiber tip center was identified and translated to a reference atlas of the adult mouse brain created by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In a subset of brains (N = 4), coronal sections (30 µm) were rinsed for 1 hr in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 0.4% Triton-X, and then permeabilized for 1 hr with 1% Triton-X and 5% normal horse serum. Sections where incubated overnight in blocking solution containing the primary antibodies (Goat anti-ChAT 1:100, Millipore, AB144P). Sections were rinsed in PBS then incubated for 2 hr at room temperature in blocking solution containing secondary antibodies, counterstained in DAPI for 5 min, rinsed in PBS, mounted onto glass slides, and then coverslipped. Co-localization of ChAT and GCaMP was quantified in the HDB and GP/SI regions of interest immediately beneath the fiber tip and in the corresponding region in the contralateral hemisphere. Quantification of ChAT and GCaMP was also performed in the striatum from both hemispheres of the same sections. Regions of interest were imaged at 63× using a Leica DM5500B fluorescent microscope. Tiled image stacks were then separated into individual fluorophore channels and labeled cells were manually counted in each channel independently using Adobe Photoshop.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB 2016b (Mathworks). Data are reported as mean ± SEM unless otherwise indicated. Inflated familywise error rates from multiple comparisons of the same sample were adjusted with the Holm-Bonferroni correction. Statistical significance was defined as p &lt; 0.05. For fiber-based imaging, we did not exclude any trials or mice from our analysis. For pupil imaging during BFCN calcium recordings, four mice were excluded from pupil analysis because the automated algorithm failed to identify the perimeter of the pupil.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Software, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Software, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Software, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Software, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures were approved by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #10-03-006A) and followed the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health for the care and use of laboratory animals.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69514-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Figure 1—source data 1 contains the data for Figure 1D.

forebrain throughout the cortex are known to regulate arousal, signal transmission and plasticity. The basal forebrain shows distinct connectivity with the cortex along its anteroposterior axis that could entail distinct modulation of different parts of cortex. By performing long-term imaging of anterior and posterior basal forebrain activity during reinforcement learning, this study finds distinct reward, learning and sensory correlates of anterior and posterior basal forebrain activity, demonstrating that the cholinergic modulation of downstream cortical areas exhibits a functional topography.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69514.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Vinck</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Ernst Strüngmann Institute (ESI) for Neuroscience in Cooperation with Max Planck Society</institution><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.04.16.439895">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.16.439895v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Martin Vinck as the Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An important confound that needs to be more explicitly ruled out is the inadvertent imaging of striatal cholinergic interneurons. Specifically, if the basal ganglia structures near the GP/SI imaging site contribute to the signal, this could artificially inflate the functional differences in this nucleus compared to the HDB. This concern is particularly relevant for the photometry data, which lack cellular resolution. The results from auditory cortical GRAB sensor imaging help (Figures 1H-J), but the lack of a comparison with cortical recordings from more frontal areas makes those experiments inconclusive. In the discussion, the authors do mention lack of GCaMP expression in cholinergic striatal interneurons. Can you show quantification of this?</p><p>2) Related to point (1), we suggest showing quantification of fiber lesion locations for all animals. This is particularly important because anatomical heterogeneity is key to the findings.</p><p>3) Regarding the findings in Figures 2E-G showing very fast (1-trial) adaptation of sensory responses, another confound should be ruled out. Given that the response is higher only in the very first stimulus presentation, an alternative explanation is that, rather than reflecting subsequent adaptation, this instead reflects a startle response to that stimulus. This would be compatible with the accompanying pupil diameter data. Can the authors exclude that possibility? Is there any evidence of a startle response, for instance in body posture?</p><p>4) Discussion, ca. line 420. There was disagreement about the rationale for fiber photometry vs. microendoscopic imaging, in particular regarding lesions to the internal capsule. The authors used a fiber diameter of 400 um, which is not much smaller than a 500-um GRIN lens. Moreover, the single-plane limitation they mention could be easily circumvented with volumetric imaging using e.g. an ETL in a two-photon microscope. This point may not invalidate any of the findings, but the arguments may be inaccurate and if so, the recommendation would therefore be to remove them altogether. A key advantage of the fiber photometry approach, which the authors did not mention, is the ability to simultaneously track bulk activity across two different basal forebrain nuclei. This would be a lot more challenging with cellular-resolution approaches.</p><p>5) The authors interpret their findings on learning-related enhancement in response to reward as negative for both HDB and GP/SI. The major conclusion drawn is that HDB and GP/ SI cholinergic neurons are distinct in some of their functional roles and similar in others. It appears that distinctions between HDB and GP/ SI are not as pronounced as one might have expected. This could be due to a number of factors that may warrant deeper consideration and that need to be discussed:</p><p>a. the measured signal has relatively low cellular resolution and slow kinetics (effects of faster and/or more discrete events within the pooled signal).</p><p>b. the possible role of (poly?) synaptic interconnections between HDB and GP/ SI.</p><p>c. how does HDB vs GP/ SI Ca signaling activity relate to ACh release, behavioral output and/or engagement of their target domains (ie prefrontal cortex vs auditory cortex). In sum, how do the subtle differences in calcium dynamics between HDB and GP/SI cholinergic neurons functionally relate to the behavior of the animal?</p><p>6) While the conclusions as stated by the authors are mostly supported by the data, the conclusion that there are no reward-related learning responses in either BFCN region requires further substantiation. The authors do note that their findings are not necessarily at odds with a previous demonstration of reward-learning related enhancement within the cholinergic basal forebrain because prior studies focused on anatomically distinct populations of BFCNs (i.e. more rostral NBM and GP/SI neurons that project to the amygdala compared to caudal GP/SI neurons that project to the auditory cortex). There may be other important differences: in Crouse et al. (2020) learning-related enhancement emerged from comparisons of calcium activity in cholinergic axons in the BLA between pre-training, training, and post-training/acquisition periods. The authors in this study do not show data from pre-training (i.e. days 5-7 Figure 2A- operant shaping). The negative result of the current study would be further substantiated if the authors were to show that there are no enhancements as the mice initially learn to associate tones with rewards during this period. In the absence of such evidence, we recommend softening the conclusion that there is no reward-learning-related enhancement.</p><p>7) An additional note: upon examining heatmaps shown in Figure 3D and E for hit trials, it appears that in later trials -while there isn't an enhancement to tone responses-, there is a decrease in activity following the reward predictive tone-related activity, which isn't apparent during early trials or on miss trials (~3 seconds following tone onset). The authors should comment on whether this decrease was statistically significant.</p><p>8) Findings in this study emphasize functional heterogeneity within the basal forebrain cholinergic system. While these data are illuminating, they also present an intriguing challenge in interpreting cholinergic responses to auditory cues. If cortically projecting cholinergic neurons show activity in response to naïve auditory stimuli, as well as to stimuli that become paired with aversive outcomes with the only distinction being in the enhancement of activity upon tone-shock pairing, then how do cortical circuits interpret this potential &quot;threshold&quot; of cholinergic activity to gate plasticity that has been shown to occur particularly in the auditory cortex during Pavlovian aversive conditioning?</p><p>9) There are other interpretations of the data that should be considered. Since the authors are measuring the pooled activity of several neurons in each region ( i.e. fiber photometric assays of Ca signaling in the 2 BFCN regions), one might propose that the enhanced responses are a consequence of &quot;learning-activated&quot; privileged ensembles of neurons that are otherwise silent. Similarly, the lack of reward-related responses could also be interpreted as turning on and off different populations of neurons that could also be antagonistically connected to each other. The authors should discuss these data in more depth in the context of a &quot;non-monolithic&quot; basal-forebrain cholinergic system.</p><p>10) One of the major strengths of this study is that all measurements were performed in the same animal across time and regions. This strength should be further leveraged by providing a plot of z-scored dF/F responses to the auditory stimuli across the full timeline shown in Figure 2A for individual animals connected across time points to allow reviewers and readers alike to observe any differences between mice.</p><p>Of course, the strength of the repeated measures aspect of the study depends both on the precise placement and stability of the fiber optics. For completeness and especially because differences in amplitude (or lack thereof) are important to several of the conclusions, the reviewers would like to see the data on the post hoc analysis of the fiber locations in both areas for all 11 mice included in the study. The relocalization data of the fiber tips should be shown in a Supplemental figure.</p><p>Another argument in support of the assumed stability of the recording locations could be obtained if the pupil dilation x Ca signaling (as in Figure 1 E) is shown for the same optical fibers immediately post-implantation, and at 2, 3, and 4 weeks of the experiment. The authors mention that interference between their HDB and GP/SI recordings is unlikely given the different projection patterns and distances between the populations. However, there is a significant basal-forebrain to basal-forebrain connectivity within the cholinergic system (Gielow and Zaborszky 2017). The authors should discuss how this connectivity could affect their interpretations, both in terms of how one region might affect the activity in the other, and in terms of the possible contribution of axonal calcium signals from other cholinergic neurons.</p><p>11) Were the mice head-fixed on a treadmill or not? This should be clearly specified and justified, as treadmill data would have been useful for comparing with previous results on brain state changes during running vs. quiet wakefulness. Running/locomotion is associated with large changes in pupil diameter and is qualitatively different from smaller fluctuations in pupil during quiet wakefulness. It would be useful to dissociate these two conditions, and it still may be possible based on the pupil data alone. This may be an important additional analysis to clarify the role of arousal in modulating cholinergic activity.</p><p>12) Because the GCaMP signal is not deconvolved and decays slowly (especially for example after running periods), it may give the appearance of sustained or elevated cholinergic activity even in the absence of any underlying spiking. Is this what is happening in Figure 3F, G, and H in the increased baseline prior to misses. Would it be possible to do some analysis with a deconvolved signal to try to address this issue, or address this issue in another way?</p><p>13) Was there any difference in cholinergic responses to vertical vs horizontal gratings? Specific optic flow directions may be more salient/threatening to the mouse. For the interpretation of visual responses, it would be useful to dissociate this.</p><p>14) Given that the simultaneous recordings are a major strength of the study, it was somewhat disappointing that there was not more analysis of trial-to-trial variance across the two areas. Most of the results presented are averaged responses split into hits and misses. This rich data could support interesting analyses of the coordination between the two areas. The authors should consider or discuss this possible analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69514.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An important confound that needs to be more explicitly ruled out is the inadvertent imaging of striatal cholinergic interneurons. Specifically, if the basal ganglia structures near the GP/SI imaging site contribute to the signal, this could artificially inflate the functional differences in this nucleus compared to the HDB. This concern is particularly relevant for the photometry data, which lack cellular resolution. The results from auditory cortical GRAB sensor imaging help (Figures 1H-J), but the lack of a comparison with cortical recordings from more frontal areas makes those experiments inconclusive. In the discussion, the authors do mention lack of GCaMP expression in cholinergic striatal interneurons. Can you show quantification of this?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. This was also a concern for us at the outset of the project, but we determined that fluorescence from the striatum was not an issue. However, we appreciate that we did not provide the evidence for this conclusion, so we have made several changes in the revised manuscript to address this important point.</p><p>1. Yes, as the reviewers suggested, the main reason is that for whatever reason, very few striatal cholinergic interneurons expressed GCaMP in the δ-neo ChAT-cre x Ai148 cross. Specifically, we counted 655 ChAT+ neurons that expressed GCaMP in GP/SI compared to just 39 neurons in the entire caudate putamen (a far larger structure) from the same sections in each of the same mice used for histology quantification. So, there are approximately 17x more GCaMP expressing cholinergic neurons in GP/SI than in neighboring regions of the caudate putamen. The same trend was observed in HDB (12x more than in rostral caudate putamen), though the HDB is not really a concern, as the reviewers noted, given its orientation relative to the fiber tip.</p><p>2. With fiber photometry, neurons within the cone of light contribute to the measured signal. Depending on the numerical aperture and fiber diameter, the bulk of the fiber photometry signal arises from fluorescence approximately 0.2mm below the fiber tip (Pisanello et al., 2019). As the reviewers can appreciate from a new figure added at their request, Figure 1 —figure supplement 1, this point is medial and ventral to the bulk of the striatum in all 11 mice.</p><p>At the reviewers’ request, the revised manuscript now includes quantification of striatal ChAT and GCaMP expression in the rostral and caudal sections (Figure 1D). We also revised the text in the beginning of the Results section to make this point clear to the reader at the outset rather than only including this point in the Discussion (Lns 153-160).</p><p>“As identified in prior studies, we observed aberrant expression in brain regions outside of the basal forebrain, including both the near-complete absence of GCaMP expression in ChAT+ striatal interneurons (Figure 1D, right) but also ectopic expression of GCaMP in ChAT-negative cells in neocortex and hippocampus. Therefore, while our transgenic strategy was appropriate for bulk imaging from cholinergic neurons in HDB and GP/SI cholinergic neurons (and in fact was aided by the absence of striatal GCaMP expression), it would not necessarily be a valid strategy for the study of other brain regions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to point (1), we suggest showing quantification of fiber lesion locations for all animals. This is particularly important because anatomical heterogeneity is key to the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 addresses this suggestion by providing the location of all 22 fiber tips (2 fibers in each of 11 mice).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding the findings in Figures 2E-G showing very fast (1-trial) adaptation of sensory responses, another confound should be ruled out. Given that the response is higher only in the very first stimulus presentation, an alternative explanation is that, rather than reflecting subsequent adaptation, this instead reflects a startle response to that stimulus. This would be compatible with the accompanying pupil diameter data. Can the authors exclude that possibility? Is there any evidence of a startle response, for instance in body posture?</p></disp-quote><p>This seems unlikely. Acoustic startle reflex thresholds are much higher, generally around 90 dB SPL. The highest sound level used for the spectrotemporal ripple stimuli in Figure 2 was 70 dB SPL (i.e., 10% of the signal amplitude of 90 dB), which is a moderate intensity sound that does not elicit an acoustic startle response. To address the reviewers’ comment, we included a new analysis, presented as Figure 2, Figure Supplement 2, which shows the BFCN response adaptation for visual stimuli at various contrasts and auditory stimuli at various sound levels. Although we did not measure body posture in our experiments, the reviewers will note the rapid habituation for 50 and 70 dB SPL pure tones and even low-contrast visual gratings, none of which would be expected to elicit a startle response.</p><p>Further evidence arguing against this possibility can be found in Figure 7D-G, which provides within-session changes in tone-evoked response amplitudes during the initial characterization day as well as subsequent test days. Within session adaptation to pure tones: (1) shows very different levels of adaptation between HDB and GP/SI fibers; (2) shows strong GP/SI adaptation on the initial test day but then far less adaptation on subsequent test days; (3) shows a recovery of within-session adaptation but only for the punishment-predicting cue and only in GP/SI. Each of these observations argues against the interpretation that the within-session habituation is confounded by a startle response.</p><p>As a final point, it is not clear to us that a startle response – were it to occur – would even impact our measurement. With our preparation, where the head is completely immobilized, and we are measuring bulk fluorescence with an implanted fiber. Instead, basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) are known to encode surprising and novel environmental stimuli, so the most likely explanation is that the response habituation reflects the rapid change in salience to a novel stimulus that is not associated with behaviorally relevant environmental consequences. This interpretation is supported by Figure 2E, where we show that sound-evoked pupil dilations are also substantially reduced after the first stimulus presentation and habituation at a similar rate to BFCN responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Discussion, ca. line 420. There was disagreement about the rationale for fiber photometry vs. microendoscopic imaging, in particular regarding lesions to the internal capsule. The authors used a fiber diameter of 400 um, which is not much smaller than a 500-um GRIN lens. Moreover, the single-plane limitation they mention could be easily circumvented with volumetric imaging using e.g. an ETL in a two-photon microscope. This point may not invalidate any of the findings, but the arguments may be inaccurate and if so, the recommendation would therefore be to remove them altogether. A key advantage of the fiber photometry approach, which the authors did not mention, is the ability to simultaneously track bulk activity across two different basal forebrain nuclei.

We understand the reviewer’s point regarding the challenge of recording from ensembles of neurons that are not in a single focal plane. We have toned down the language so that Ln 515-516 now states “This anatomy is not optimal for endoscopic imaging through implanted lenses, as it could be challenging to visualize BFCNs in a single focal plane.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors interpret their findings on learning-related enhancement in response to reward as negative for both HDB and GP/SI.

We have made the argument that the distinctions between the HDB and GP/SI are <italic>more</italic> pronounced than expected and indeed the many significant differences between these regions is the main thrust of the paper. However, we take the reviewers’ point that we still could be underestimating the degree of heterogeneity between brain structures due to some of the factors mentioned below. In regard to changes in sound-evoked responses that are associated with reward, we refer the reviewers to point #6 below where we explain changes we have made to soften our interpretation of this finding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. The measured signal has relatively low cellular resolution and slow kinetics (effects of faster and/or more discrete events within the pooled signal).</p></disp-quote><p>We explicitly mention limitations in spatial and temporal resolution with fiber-based GCaMP imaging on Lns 535-538.</p><p>“Another caveat in the interpretation of fiber-based GCaMP imaging is that the slow temporal kinetics and poor spatial resolution combines somatic and neuropil-based calcium signals and obscures the relationship to spike rates in distinct types of BFCNs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The possible role of (poly?) synaptic interconnections between HDB and GP/ SI.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers also raise this issue in Point #10, below. We have revised the text on Lns 538-549 to discuss the role of inter-regional connections between the HDB and GP/SI.</p><p>“This would be particularly worrisome if the axons of BFCNs in HDB or GP/SI projected to or through the other region, as this could either produce optical cross-talk (i.e., axon fluorescence originating from BFCNs in region A measured on the region B fiber) or functional cross-talk (i.e., projections from BFCNs in region A modulate the activity of region B). Neither of these possibilities is likely a concern in the interpretation of these findings. Correlating all single trial tone-evoked response amplitudes measured on each fiber reveals a very weak association (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.16, n = 21,099 trials), demonstrating that the activity in HDB and GP/SI can be measured independently. Further, anatomical characterizations suggest that BFCN inputs within the basal forebrain primarily arise from local neurons rather than remote regions (Gielow and Zaborszky, 2017). To this point, direct visualization of efferent HDB axons showed that they left the basal forebrain in a medial and dorsal orientation, coming nowhere near the GP/SI fiber (Bloem et al., 2014).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. How does HDB vs GP/ SI Ca signaling activity relate to ACh release, behavioral output and/or engagement of their target domains (ie prefrontal cortex vs auditory cortex). In sum, how do the subtle differences in calcium dynamics between HDB and GP/SI cholinergic neurons functionally relate to the behavior of the animal?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not disagree that combining BFCN measurements with measurements of ACh release in the prefrontal cortex and other downstream structures over the course of learning, with changes in reward expectation, with changes in reward value, with changes in attention, etc. are also interesting and important studies to perform. On the other hand, we did provide one analysis of how calcium dynamics relates to cortical ACh release (Figure 1H-J) and added a new section to the Discussion on the point of how bulk calcium measurements for BFNCs could relate to downstream ACh release (Lns 457-458), “Given that GP/SI is the predominant source of BFCN input to lateral neocortical regions including ACtx, one clear implication that would be important to test in future studies is that auditory stimuli – even sounds with no behavioral relevance – should elicit ACh release in ACtx.”</p><p>In reference to the other items listed by the reviewers, we do describe BFCN responses to movement (Figure 5), reward, reward omission, punishment, and changes in punishment-predicting cues over learning (Figures 6-7). Certainly, this goes further than most any other study, particularly in terms of what has been performed in the same animal. Further to this point, we invest a great deal of effort into characterizing the association between changes in calcium signaling and the behavior of the animal. Despite all the aforementioned limitations of single-pixel bulk calcium imaging, the new main figure (Figure 4) shows that we can classify with 80% accuracy whether or not a sensory stimulus on a single trial will be subliminal or behaviorally detected based on BFCN activity preceding stimulus onset. Although the differences that distinguish hit and miss trials are <italic>not</italic> “subtle” (they differ by ~1 s.d.), it seems to us that they provide one important example of how “calcium dynamics between HDB and GP/SI cholinergic neurons functionally relate to the behavior of the animal”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) While the conclusions as stated by the authors are mostly supported by the data, the conclusion that there are no reward-related learning responses in either BFCN region requires further substantiation.

There may be other important differences: in Crouse et al. (2020) learning-related enhancement emerged from comparisons of calcium activity in cholinergic axons in the BLA between pre-training, training, and post-training/acquisition periods. The authors in this study do not show data from pre-training (i.e. days 5-7 Figure 2A- operant shaping). The negative result of the current study would be further substantiated if the authors were to show that there are no enhancements as the mice initially learn to associate tones with rewards during this period. In the absence of such evidence, we recommend softening the conclusion that there is no reward-learning-related enhancement.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct. Thanks for pointing this out. We unplugged the mice for approximately one week in between test session #2 (characterization of sensory response habituation) and the first test session when the mice were performing the operant task. We updated the timeline in Figure 2A to make this point more explicit to the reader. During this approximate one-week period, mice were placed on water restriction and shaped on procedural demands of the Go-NoGo task that required them to produce a lick bout (≥7 licks in 2.8s) to receive water reward. During this brief shaping period, tones were associated with reward, though we did not collect imaging data because the BFCN activity related to the sensory response, licking, and reward were difficult to separate in time, hence we did not feel that it would provide an appropriate baseline measurement.</p><p>Nor did we feel that the tone-evoked responses from the sensory characterization day would be an appropriate baseline. The sensory characterization day featured many fewer pure tone presentation trials (20 trials per frequency on the test day versus ~130 on a typical operant session), were separated from the first operant session by one week, and showed strong habituation over the relatively small number of trials, all of which complicate its use as the pre-learning baseline. For these reasons, the first testing session is the most appropriate basis of comparison for changes that accompany appetitive conditioning. The reviewers will appreciate from Figure 3B-C that mice are still learning the stimulus-reward association when we resume fiber imaging at the start of the operant task.</p><p>However, the reviewers are correct that the reward outcome association was already learned by the first operant testing session, so it has its challenges as well in terms of a baseline against which to measure learning-related changes.</p><p>To address this point, we have:</p><p>1) Added Figure 7D, in which we show the tone-evoked responses during the initial sensory characterization session versus all operant sessions.</p><p>2) Edited the timeline in Figure 2A to clarify for future readers that we did not perform fiber imaging during the initial behavioral conditioning sessions.</p><p>3) We softened the conclusions throughout the paper relating to changes (or lack thereof) for sounds with learned associations to reward.</p><p>4) We explicit state the limitation in our design in identifying a true baseline related to the explanation above on Lns 267-273:</p><p>“Another possibility is that response enhancement to reward-predicting sounds had already occurred during the initial shaping period that preceded the first operant imaging session, thereby escaping our analysis. Although performance in the Go-NoGo auditory task clearly improved over the course of our imaging period (Figure 3B-C), learning related enhancements of cue-evoked BFCN responses can occur within just a few behavioral sessions (Crouse et al., 2020; Sturgill et al., 2020), so we cannot rule out this possibility.”</p><p>And lines 486-489:</p><p>“As mentioned above, another possibility is that HDB and GP/SI BFCNs did exhibit an increased response to reward-predicting cues during the initial association of sound and reward, which occurred during the behavioral shaping period when we did not monitor activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) An additional note: upon examining heatmaps shown in Figure 3D and E for hit trials, it appears that in later trials -while there isn't an enhancement to tone responses-, there is a decrease in activity following the reward predictive tone-related activity, which isn't apparent during early trials or on miss trials (~3 seconds following tone onset). The authors should comment on whether this decrease was statistically significant.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are referring to the bottom-left sub-panels of Figures 3F and 3G, which shows a slightly elevated mean response 3-6s post-stimulus onset early in training compared to late in training. The difference is statistically significant, but we did not choose to emphasize it in the manuscript because the effect is confounded by differences in lick rate. We have created Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 to address the reviewers’ point.</p><p>This figure shows that our mice licked the reward spout for a longer duration earlier in training. Because the lick rate is also elevated in the 3-6s post-stimulus period, the most likely explanation is that the elevated sustained activity reflects the difference in motor activity (which we examine directly in Figure 5). As further proof, we can also look at lick rate in the Miss trials. Later in training, mice tend to lick the spout several seconds after the stimulus was presented (as if they heard it but were too slow to respond). On miss trials, the BFCN activity in the same 3-6s post-stimulus period is also elevated, except here in the <italic>opposite</italic> direction, with activity higher late in training compared to early. In both cases, the elevated activity at longer intervals after stimulus offset may be explained by systematic differences in lick rate. We have edited Lns 260-262 of the text to clarify this point.:</p><p>“Responses were slightly elevated at longer latencies after stimulus onset early in training, though this difference could be explained by differences in lick rate duration over the course of training (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Findings in this study emphasize functional heterogeneity within the basal forebrain cholinergic system. While these data are illuminating, they also present an intriguing challenge in interpreting cholinergic responses to auditory cues. If cortically projecting cholinergic neurons show activity in response to naïve auditory stimuli, as well as to stimuli that become paired with aversive outcomes with the only distinction being in the enhancement of activity upon tone-shock pairing, then how do cortical circuits interpret this potential &quot;threshold&quot; of cholinergic activity to gate plasticity that has been shown to occur particularly in the auditory cortex during Pavlovian aversive conditioning?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, exactly. This is one of the most intriguing and surprising findings that have emerged from this study and the prior study from our lab because it challenges the interpretation that ACh acts as a simple gating mechanism (i.e., on/off) that enables associative plasticity to enhance the representation of behaviorally relevant stimuli. We have now confirmed this result with many different approaches: (1) by recording from optogenetically isolated BFCN units in GP/SI that project to ACtx (Guo et al., Neuron, 2019), by measuring bulk GCaMP activity in GP/SI (this manuscript), and even ACh3.0 sensor activity in several cortical regions (unpublished). They all emphasize that same finding: that moderate intensity sounds with no explicit hedonic value elicit rapid and robust cholinergic responses. As the reviewers point out and we have shown directly in our 2019 paper, there is no long-term representational plasticity in the cortex for sounds experienced in a passive context or for sounds that do not predict reinforcement outcomes, so something beyond the mere presence of ACh must be required to create a permissive state in the cortex for long-term plasticity. Our 2019 paper and a recent paper from the Hangya lab (Laszlovszky et al., Nat. Neuro., 2020) both made paired recordings from BFCN and ACtx units during reinforced auditory learning versus passive listening and both studies identified marked upticks in the LFP coherence and spike-triggered LFP when animals process sounds in the context of Pavlovian auditory trace conditioning (Guo et al., 2019) or operant auditory conditioning (Laszlovszky et al., Nat. Neuro., 2020).</p><p>Although the underlying mechanism is not yet clear, these changes in inter-regional coherence were only observed from BFCN recordings, not when other putative non-cholinergic basal forebrain units were recorded, suggesting that the critical factor that switches downstream networks into modes of plasticity is still related to basal forebrain cholinergic activity, just not the presence or absence of activity. As our study and others (e.g., Crouse et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2020) have noted, the BFCN response is itself plastic, and increases for sounds paired with behavioral reinforcement. As the reviewers suggested, this raises the possibility that the permissive feature is a threshold of ACh activity that is only reached during reinforced learning. Another possibility is that the downstream plasticity is enabled by a confluence of cholinergic inputs from the caudal tail of the basal forebrain (where BFCNs respond even to unconditioned neutral sounds) and more rostral regions (e.g., nucleus basalis or portions of SI) where sensory responses are acquired during learning. These hypotheses (and others) can be tested in future studies that combine regionally targeted BFCN recordings with optogenetic silencing and cholinergic sensory measurements.</p><p>We refer the reviewers to Lns 457-475 of the Discussion where we address the reviewers’ points directly in an abbreviated form:</p><p>“Given that GP/SI is the predominant source of BFCN input to lateral neocortical regions including ACtx, one clear implication that would be important to test in future studies is that auditory stimuli – even sounds with no behavioral relevance – should elicit ACh release in ACtx. ACh acts through local ACtx microcircuits to remove the fetters that normally limit long-term associative plasticity, thereby enabling local synaptic processes that support auditory fear memory encoding (Letzkus et al., 2015; Weinberger, 2004) and perceptual learning (Froemke et al., 2013; Takesian et al., 2018). Importantly, learning-related plasticity in ACtx requires transient neuromodulatory surges and does not occur when stimuli are presented in a passive context (Froemke, 2015). This suggests cholinergic regulation of cortical plasticity is not an all-or-none gating process but instead may reflect a threshold that is only exceeded when sound-evoked cholinergic inputs are themselves transiently amplified through learning (Figure 7C and 7G, Guo et al., 2019). Beyond simple gating mechanisms, dual recordings from single BFCNs and ACtx neurons during Pavlovian auditory learning (Guo et al., 2019) and attentionally demanding auditory tasks (Laszlovszky et al., 2020) have demonstrated dynamics in BFCN-cortex synchrony that change in lockstep with associative plasticity and auditory perceptual salience. Although the upstream factors that regulate BFCN plasticity and inter-regional synchrony have yet to be identified, it is clear that models portraying phasic cortical ACh release occurring only at times of reward, punishment, or heightened arousal need to be reevaluated, at least as they relate to the caudal tail of the basal forebrain and the ACtx.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) There are other interpretations of the data that should be considered. Since the authors are measuring the pooled activity of several neurons in each region (i.e. fiber photometric assays of Ca signaling in the 2 BFCN regions), one might propose that the enhanced responses are a consequence of &quot;learning-activated&quot; privileged ensembles of neurons that are otherwise silent. Similarly, the lack of reward-related responses could also be interpreted as turning on and off different populations of neurons that could also be antagonistically connected to each other. The authors should discuss these data in more depth in the context of a &quot;non-monolithic&quot; basal-forebrain cholinergic system.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct; these are important factors to consider. We now explicitly mention both of these interpretations in the revised “Technical considerations in the interpretation of these findings” section on Lns. 527-535.</p><p>“However, there are important limitations and technical caveats with fiber-based bulk GCaMP imaging that should be taken into consideration in the interpretation of these findings. Because fiber photometry signals arise from populations of neurons, it is impossible to discern whether differences in response amplitude over learning or across different behavioral states reflect the activation of privileged ensembles that were hitherto silent or instead an increased response expressed uniformly across neurons. Conversely, the absence of differences in the population signal could belie striking shifts in the representational dominance of antagonistically related cellular ensembles that would not be captured by changes in net signal amplitude (Grewe et al., 2017; Gründemann, 2021; Taylor et al., 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) One of the major strengths of this study is that all measurements were performed in the same animal across time and regions. This strength should be further leveraged by providing a plot of z-scored dF/F responses to the auditory stimuli across the full timeline shown in Figure 2A for individual animals connected across time points to allow reviewers and readers alike to observe any differences between mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We created a new figure, Figure 7D, which shows tone-evoked response amplitude across all measurement sessions and regions within single animals, as requested. This figure proves useful for addressing several other points above and below, so we thank the reviewers for making this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Of course, the strength of the repeated measures aspect of the study depends both on the precise placement and stability of the fiber optics. For completeness and especially because differences in amplitude (or lack thereof) are important to several of the conclusions, the reviewers would like to see the data on the post hoc analysis of the fiber locations in both areas for all 11 mice included in the study. The relocalization data of the fiber tips should be shown in a Supplemental figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Another good suggestion, thanks. We created a new figure, Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 that provides the post-hoc localization of the fiber center and diameter for all 22 fibers from 11 mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another argument in support of the assumed stability of the recording locations could be obtained if the pupil dilation x Ca signaling (as in Figure 1 E) is shown for the same optical fibers immediately post-implantation, and at 2, 3, and 4 weeks of the experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 7C-D shows tone-evoked response amplitudes from the same fiber over many weeks, which should be sufficient to address the possibility that the implanted fiber tip is not stable. As evidenced by this figure and all of the other analyses in the paper that show sensory-evoked bulk BFCN GCaMP responses over time, if the fiber tip were moving away from GCaMP-expressing cells over time, the signal amplitude would drop out or change indiscriminately across all acoustic test frequencies. Instead, we report that changes in tone-evoked response amplitude either don’t occur (HDB) or occur only for tones associated with punishment (GP/SI), which rules out that possibility. It is not clear why the reviewers felt that pupil-related changes would be a better demonstration for mechanical stability, but it ended up being a moot point for our data because lighting and camera position was not optimized for pupil measurements after the initial test day. These findings argue against the possibility that there were gross changes in the recording location over time. Of course, we cannot rule the possibility that there was some degree of mechanical drift over time that would change the contribution of some neurons within the cone of light across measurements, but it is not clear why the reviewers think this is a pressing issue for an approach that cements a 0.4mm optical fiber into a deep brain area as compared to approaches for long-term chronic neural monitoring based on very thin flexible wires. If anything, mechanical drift should be less of a concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors mention that interference between their HDB and GP/SI recordings is unlikely given the different projection patterns and distances between the populations. However, there is a significant basal-forebrain to basal-forebrain connectivity within the cholinergic system (Gielow and Zaborszky 2017). The authors should discuss how this connectivity could affect their interpretations, both in terms of how one region might affect the activity in the other, and in terms of the possible contribution of axonal calcium signals from other cholinergic neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, we address this point explicitly in the revised Discussion. One way to address the reviewers’ point about functional or even direct optical (viz. inter-regional axon projections) influences between fibers is simply to correlate the responses between the two fibers. We did this for every trial of every tone burst presented to every mouse (n = 21,099 trials, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Even though some degree of correlation is expected from common inputs to both regions (e.g., more intense stimuli elicit more intense responses, responses on hit trials are higher than miss trials) a linear model can only account for 16% of the variance in response amplitude for one fiber knowing the amplitude of the other. We feel that this constitutes fairly strong evidence against the hypothesis that there may be substantive functional/optical cross-talk between our fibers. Generally, the concern about cross-talk is greater for conclusions that anatomically separate regions of the BFCN responded uniformly to various experimental conditions. The main point throughout the paper is just the opposite.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69514-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We believe the reviewers may be mistaken in their interpretation of the Gielow and Zaborsky paper. In this study, the authors injected the starter virus throughout the rostral-caudal length of the basal forebrain, so they would not be able to make a direct measurement of long-range connections between regions. Further, the input cells labeled with the pseudo-typed rabies virus would not necessarily be cholinergic neurons, which further obscures the ability to make any direct assessments of long-range projections between cholinergic neurons. Despite these caveats, the authors conclude on pg. 1825 of the published paper “Across all cytoarchitectonic BFc subregions in all subjects, the number of labeled afferents within a BFc subdivision correlates significantly with the number of starter cells within the same structure (Spearman’s Rho = 0.77; p &lt; 0.001), suggesting that cholinergic corticopetal neurons likely receive local inputs primarily from neighboring rather than remote regions of the BF itself.” In direct personal communication with Prof. Zaborsky about this point, he confirmed that his paper does not make claim “significant basal-forebrain to basal-forebrain connectivity within the cholinergic system” and, if anything, makes the opposite point. The experiment that would test the reviewers’ suggestion would have to restrict the expression of starter virus to cholinergic neurons in one region of the basal forebrain and then co-label the input neurons with ChAT. To the best of our knowledge, there is no public record of this experiment having been performed. In the absence of this direct experiment, the best evidence we can find comes from descriptions of the efferent projection patterns from cholinergic neurons in focal regions of the basal forebrain. As cited in our manuscript, there is no description of efferent axons from focal regions of the basal forebrain traveling through the length of the basal forebrain, rather they exit in distinct trajectories through major white matter fiber bundles.</p><p>These points are summarized on Lns 538-549, where we state:</p><p>“This would be particularly worrisome if the axons of BFCNs in HDB or GP/SI projected to or through the other region, as this could either produce optical cross-talk (i.e., axon fluorescence originating from BFCNs in region A measured on the region B fiber) or functional cross-talk (i.e., projections from BFCNs in region A modulate the activity of region B). Neither of these possibilities is likely a concern in the interpretation of these findings. Correlating all single trial tone-evoked response amplitudes measured on each fiber reveals a very weak association (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.16, n = 21,099 trials), demonstrating that the activity in HDB and GP/SI can be measured independently. Further, anatomical characterizations suggest that BFCN inputs within the basal forebrain primarily arise from local neurons rather than remote regions (Gielow and Zaborszky, 2017). To this point, direct visualization of efferent HDB axons showed that they left the basal forebrain in a medial and dorsal orientation, coming nowhere near the GP/SI fiber (Bloem et al., 2014).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Were the mice head-fixed on a treadmill or not? This should be clearly specified and justified, as treadmill data would have been useful for comparing with previous results on brain state changes during running vs. quiet wakefulness. Running/locomotion is associated with large changes in pupil diameter and is qualitatively different from smaller fluctuations in pupil during quiet wakefulness. It would be useful to dissociate these two conditions, and it still may be possible based on the pupil data alone. This may be an important additional analysis to clarify the role of arousal in modulating cholinergic activity.</p></disp-quote><p>No, the mice were not on a treadmill. This has now been clarified in the Materials and methods (Ln 633): “Mice were placed in an electrically conductive cradle…” and on lns 665-666 “On sessions 1 and 2, mice were habituated to head fixation and the body cradle.” The coherence analysis (Figure 1F-G) shows two peaks between the spontaneous pupil changes and BFCN activity, one corresponding to very slow changes (0.05 Hz) and the other corresponding to more rapid fluctuations (0.4 Hz). The coherence reported here (both between pupil and bulk BFCN activity as well as pupil and cortical ACh release [Figure 1I-J]) resembles previous descriptions of pupil and cholinergic axon activity (see Figure 1h of Reimer et al., Nat Comm 2016) and pupil and ACtx membrane potential (see Figure 2C of McGinley et al., Neuron 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Because the GCaMP signal is not deconvolved and decays slowly (especially for example after running periods), it may give the appearance of sustained or elevated cholinergic activity even in the absence of any underlying spiking. Is this what is happening in Figure 3F, G, and H in the increased baseline prior to misses. Would it be possible to do some analysis with a deconvolved signal to try to address this issue, or address this issue in another way?</p></disp-quote><p>The newly added Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 is relevant to this point by demonstrating that BFCN activity is not elevated prior to false alarms events. The mice are head-fixed in a small cradle so they are definitely not running and – from spending countless hours watching them perform the task – they really don’t exhibit any type of gross motor behavior (e.g., squirming, struggling etc.) when performing the operant task. Instead, on miss trials, mice just appear to “zone out” from time to time and they fail to hear the target sounds. The newly added Figure 4 demonstrates that we can classify miss trials with ~80% accuracy from the activity preceding cue onset. Because HDB is the better predictor of trial outcome but is less modulated by movement than GP/SI, these effects are unlikely due to sustained movement.</p><p>There is no way to deconvolve a bulk GCaMP signal because there is no “ground truth” underlying spiking signal from which to create the convolution function. By contrast, in combined intracellular and GCaMP recordings in single units, one has the ground truth spiking and membrane potential measurements alongside the GCaMP, from which one can calculate a kernel to deconvolve spike rates from fractional change in fluorescence. Of course, one can always apply the single unit GCaMP deconvolution filter to bulk imaging signals but it would just be one of many forms of temporal filtering that would not accomplish the objective of accurately estimating the underlying spiking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Was there any difference in cholinergic responses to vertical vs horizontal gratings? Specific optic flow directions may be more salient/threatening to the mouse. For the interpretation of visual responses, it would be useful to dissociate this.</p></disp-quote><p>We created a new figure to address this question (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1). There are no systematic differences in the responses to vertical vs horizontal visual gratings, nor upward vs. downward auditory gratings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Given that the simultaneous recordings are a major strength of the study, it was somewhat disappointing that there was not more analysis of trial-to-trial variance across the two areas. Most of the results presented are averaged responses split into hits and misses. This rich data could support interesting analyses of the coordination between the two areas. The authors should consider or discuss this possible analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on this suggestion, we created a new main Figure, Figure 4, that presents single trial decoding of behavioral trial outcome based on the activity of each fiber individually, or both fibers combined. This figure shows that we predict trial outcome (hit or miss) with ~80% accuracy based on the mean GCaMP activity before stimulus onset, which is even more accurate than the classification from the stimulus-evoked response itself. HDB classification accuracy was greater overall than GP/SI, and there was no statistical advantage to decoding with both brain areas simultaneously than with just HDB. We feel that this single trial analysis constitutes an important addition to the study and addresses the reviewers’ request for more analysis of trial-to-trial variability, even if it doesn’t reveal any particular cooperativity or computational advantage to decode trial outcome using both regions of the basal forebrain. We tried many other analyses as well that would exploit the advantage of having simultaneous recordings (e.g., noise and signal correlations, coherence analysis) but nothing stood out as being particularly clear or interpretable.</p><p>It is probably not accurate for the reviewers to state “most of the results presented are averaged responses split into hits and misses”. We provide side-by-side visualization of single trial data from both fibers in Figure 2B, Figure 2 FS1A, Figure 3D-E, Figure 4A and C, Figure 5A, Figure 6D, and Figure 7D. Further, hits and misses are only characterized in Figures 3 and 4, which hardly qualifies as “most”. We have made a point of showing raw data in every figure and presenting findings at the individual animal level, wherever possible (i.e, in every figure). Having two fibers also allows us to perform paired statistics rather than unpaired statistics, which reduces the influence of inter-animal variability that can be an issue for approaches that only study one brain structure per animal. Between the addition of the new classifier analysis in Figure 4 and the points above, we hope the reviewers will feel somewhat less disappointed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
