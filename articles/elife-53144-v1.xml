The budding yeast Cdc13, Stn1 and Ten1 proteins form a heterotrimeric complex, and the inactivation of any of its subunits leads to a uniformly lethal phenotype due to telomere deprotection. Although Cdc13, Stn1 and Ten1 seem to belong to an epistasis group, it remains unclear whether they function differently in telomere protection. Here, we employed the single-linear-chromosome yeast SY14, and surprisingly found that the deletion of <italic>CDC13</italic> leads to telomere erosion and intrachromosome end-to-end fusion, which depends on Rad52 but not Yku. Interestingly, the emergence frequency of survivors in the SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ mutant was ~29 fold higher than that in either the <italic>stn1</italic>Δ or <italic>ten1</italic>Δ mutant, demonstrating a predominant role of Cdc13 in inhibiting telomere fusion. Chromosomal fusion readily occurred in the telomerase-null SY14 strain, further verifying the default role of intact telomeres in inhibiting chromosome fusion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single chromosome yeast</kwd><kwd>CST complex</kwd><kwd>chromosome end fusion</kwd><kwd>telomere protection</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFA0500701</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Zhi-Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia-Cheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Man</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Ting-Yi</given-names></name><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Ming-Hong</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jin-Qiu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31230040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Zhi-Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia-Cheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Man</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Ting-Yi</given-names></name><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Ming-Hong</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jin-Qiu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Research Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18JC1420202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Zhi-Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia-Cheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Man</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Ting-Yi</given-names></name><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Ming-Hong</given-names></name><name><surname>Shao</surname><given-names>Yangyang</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Xiaoli</given-names></name><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Zhongjun</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jin-Qiu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Priority Research Program XDB19000000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Zhi-Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia-Cheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Man</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Ting-Yi</given-names></name><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Ming-Hong</given-names></name><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Zhongjun</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jin-Qiu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cdc13 prevents chromosomes from end-to-end fusion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Telomeres, the native ends of eukaryotic linear chromosomes, are critical for the maintenance of genome stability. They protect chromosome ends from nuclease degradation, homologous recombination, and end-to-end fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi and Shore, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Malyavko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McEachern et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Smogorzewska and de Lange, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wellinger and Zakian, 2012</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, telomere length is approximately 300 ± 75 bp, comprising double-stranded TG<sub>1-3</sub>/C<sub>1-3</sub>A repeats and a 12–14 nt-long G-rich single-stranded tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larrivée et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wellinger et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zakian, 1996</xref>). The subtelomeric region consists of X and Y′ elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan and Tye, 1983a</xref>). Y′ elements, located immediately internal to telomeric DNA, are present in zero to four tandem copies and fall into two classes, Y′ long (6.7 kb) and Y′ short (5.2 kb). Y′ elements exhibit homogeneity, showing at least 98% identity, even between different strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan and Tye, 1983a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan and Tye, 1983b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Louis and Haber, 1992</xref>). In contrast, X elements, which are located centromere-proximal to telomeres or Y′ elements, are less conserved, with 8–18% divergence occurring between various X elements, and they are found in virtually all telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Louis and Haber, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Because of the end-replication problem observed in the vast majority of eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Olovnikov, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Watson, 1972</xref>), telomeres progressively shorten at a rate of 3–5 nt per cell division in yeast, leading to chromosome end erosions in the absence of telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lendvay et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lingner, 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marcand et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Singer and Gottschling, 1994</xref>). Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex consisting of the catalytic subunit Est2, the RNA moiety Tlc1, accessory factors Est1 and Est3 and the Pop1/Pop6/Pop7 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lemieux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lendvay et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lundblad and Szostak, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Singer and Gottschling, 1994</xref>). Although the deletion of either <italic>EST1</italic> or <italic>EST3</italic> leads to a defect in telomerase function in vivo, the core telomerase complex formed by the reverse transcriptase Est2 and the RNA template Tlc1 is sufficient to catalyze telomere addition in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lingner et al., 1997a</xref>). Est1 recruits telomerase to telomeres through its interaction with the ssDNA-binding protein Cdc13. Additionally, it promotes G-quadruplex formation to stimulate telomerase activity and provide telomere protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). The function of Est3 is less clear, and it has been suggested to activate telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Talley et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although most of the cells lacking telomerase undergo senescence after 50–100 rounds of cell division, a few cells can maintain their telomeres via recombination-dependent mechanisms, yielding two types of survivors, referred to as Type I and Type II. Type I survivors exhibit massive amplification of subtelomeric Y′ sequences with very short TG<sub>1–3</sub> repeats at the ends, while Type II survivors amplify TG<sub>1-3</sub> repeats and display a heterogeneous pattern of long terminal TG<sub>1–3</sub> tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lundblad and Blackburn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Teng and Zakian, 1999</xref>). The formation of Type I and Type II survivors relies on the <italic>RAD51</italic> and <italic>RAD50</italic> gene epistasis groups, respectively. Thus, the deletion of both <italic>RAD50</italic> and <italic>RAD51</italic> almost eliminates survivor generation, as observed in <italic>rad52</italic>Δ mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Telomeres share many similarities with double-strand breaks (DSBs) and have the potential to trigger DNA damage responses. To counteract this, telomere capping proteins have evolved to distinguish normal chromosome ends from DNA break ends generated from accidental DNA damage. In budding yeast, the double-stranded TG<sub>1-3</sub> repeats and the G tail are bound by an array of Rap1 and Cdc13-Stn1-Ten1 (CST) complexes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourns et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin and Zakian, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nugent et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Price et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ray and Runge, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</xref>). Rap1 is required for cell viability and performs many distinct essential cellular tasks, such as transcription regulation and telomere protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buck and Lieb, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diffley, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lieb et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pardo and Marcand, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shore, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shore and Nasmyth, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tomar et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the causes of lethality due to Rap1 deletion remain a mystery.</p><p>The CST complex specifically binds telomeric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and acts as a telomere-capping protein and telomerase regulator. This trimeric complex structurally resembles heterotrimeric replication protein A (RPA), a eukaryotic major ssDNA-binding protein, indicating that the CST complex may function as a specialized telomere-dedicated RPA-like complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2007</xref>). Cdc13, the major single-stranded telomere-binding protein, plays dual roles in telomere protection and telomerase recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourns et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin and Zakian, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nugent et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</xref>). Cdc13 interacts with Est1 and regulates telomerase access to telomeres in late S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans and Lundblad, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Osterhage et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennock et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Qi and Zakian, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Taggart et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu and Zakian, 2011</xref>), after which G-rich strand extension is limited by Stn1, whose binding site partially overlaps with that of Est1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chandra et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). The Stn1 and Ten1 subunits are recruited to telomere ends via direct interaction with Cdc13. Both Stn1 and Ten1 are reported to display a relatively weak telomeric DNA binding affinity and to exhibit Cdc13-independent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Qian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Qian et al., 2009</xref>). The amino terminus of Stn1 is sufficient for Ten1 binding, while its carboxyl terminus interacts with both Cdc13 and Pol12 (a subunit of the DNA Polα complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grossi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petreaca et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Puglisi et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to limiting G-rich strand extension, Stn1 promotes the recruitment of Polα for lagging strand DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grossi et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, many lines of evidence support the notion that Stn1 is the primary effector of telomere capping. For instance, either fusing the DNA-binding domain of Cdc13 to Stn1 or cooverexpressing Ten1 with a truncated form of Stn1 is sufficient to bypass the essential function of Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennock et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petreaca et al., 2006</xref>). Although Ten1 remains less well characterized, it appears to promote the activity of Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Qian et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, Cdc13, Stn1 and Ten1 are all required for cell viability and telomere length regulation. Loss-of-function mutations in each subunit result in the accumulation of telomeric ssDNA and abnormal elongation of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garvik et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grandin et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grandin et al., 1997</xref>), suggesting that Cdc13, Stn1 and Ten1 are epistatic in telomere protection. Mammalian CST (CTC1-STN1-TEN1) appears to have extratelomeric functions in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Price et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). It remains unclear whether <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> CST has functions in DNA replication other than its confined roles at telomeres. One clue concerning this question comes from the observation that the overexpression of Stn1 results in its mislocalization to a nontelomeric region where it interferes with replication fork integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gasparyan et al., 2009</xref>).

Fluctuations of telomere length were observed in different cell passages as well as different clones in the same passage, and the reason for the fluctuation was not clear.

Thereafter, the plasmid-borne wild-type genes were counterselected on 5′-fluoroorotic acid (5′-FOA) plates. The results showed that Rap1 was indispensable for the viability of the circular-chromosome yeast SY15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that Rap1 is essential not only for telomere protection but also for gene transcription, consistent with a previous report that the telomere binding of Rap1 is not required for its essential functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Zakian, 2003</xref>).

These data indicate that the lethality of CST depletion is mainly caused by defects in telomere protection. However, there has been a debate about whether the CST complex functions like RPA in the replication of telomere DNA sequences, in addition to telomere protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gasparyan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Price et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stewart, 2018</xref>).

Hence, we inserted a 255 bp-long telomeric sequence into a genomic locus between the <italic>PGU1</italic> and <italic>YJR154W</italic> genes in both orientations in the SY15 <italic>cst</italic>Δ <italic>CST</italic> strains. The resultant strains, which were designated SY15<sup>CA255</sup> and SY15<sup>TG255</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), were passaged on plates five times (~100 population doublings). The interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs) of TG255/CA255 determined by Southern blotting were successfully transmitted from generation to generation in all the SY15<sup>CA255</sup> and SY15<sup>TG255</sup> strains, regardless of the presence or absence of <italic>CST</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine whether there was any miniscule contraction or expansion of ITSs after ~100 rounds of replication, we performed PCR analysis, and the amplified DNA fragments from all of the strains were the same size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Further sequencing results for three independent clones of each <italic>cst</italic> mutant confirmed that there were no mutations after ~100 population doublings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that the CST complex does not affect the replication of ITSs; that is, the CST complex might have no function in telomere replication other than the recruitment of Polα for lagging strand synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grossi et al., 2004</xref>).

These results indicated that in these clones, the chromosomal region of ~0.1 kb proximal to telomere XVI-L was intact, while the chromosomal region of ≤43.5 kb proximal to telomere X-R was lost. In wild-type BY4742 and SY14 cells, which were positive controls, all the primer pairs amplified PCR products of the predicted length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 7 and 8 in both panels).</p><p>The borders of telomere erosion in clones 12, 17 and 18 were likely different from those of most clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, for the left chromosome arm (Chr XVI-L) in clone 17, PCR products were detected with primer pairs 10<sup>L</sup> to 16<sup>L</sup> but not with primers 1<sup>L</sup> to 9<sup>L</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left panel, lane 6), indicating that the chromosomal region of ~7.5 kb proximal to telomere XVI-L was lost. For the right chromosome arm (Chr X-R) in clone 17, PCR products were detected with primer pairs 20<sup>R</sup> to 34<sup>R</sup> but not with primers 13<sup>R</sup> to 19<sup>R</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel, lane 6), indicating that the chromosomal region of ~30.0 kb proximal to telomere X-R was lost.</p><p>To further examine whether chromosome fusion took place, we performed PCR analyses with pairs of primers targeting the ends of the two chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, top panel). Presumably, a PCR product would be obtained only if the chromosome ends had fused together. The results showed that the primer pair consisting of 1 <sup>L</sup>-R and 32 <sup>R</sup>-F amplified DNA fragments with a size of ~2 kb in most of the survivor clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), including <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ−5,–11, −21,–47 and −61, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> (bottom panel), while the primer pair consisting of 10 <sup>L</sup>-R and 20 <sup>R</sup>-F amplified a DNA fragment of ~1.8 kb in clone 17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, bottom panel). These PCR products were not detected in the linear-chromosome yeast strains of either BY4742 or SY14. These results strongly support the hypothesis of chromosome fusion in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ survivors.</p><p>To validate chromosome fusion and determine fusion points/sequences in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ survivors, we cloned and sequenced all the PCR products from 71 clones. The sequencing results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>. Notably, in most survived clones, fusion took place in the telomeric 5′-TG<sub>1-3</sub>-3′ region of Chr XVI-L and the distal ‘5′-(CA)<sub>17</sub>-3′’ region, which is located 43.9 kb away from the telomeric TG<sub>1-3</sub> sequence of Chr X-R (e.g., SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ−30, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The retained TG<sub>1-3</sub> sequences of Chr XVI-L in individual circular chromosomes were of different lengths: ranging from 21 to 374 bp long, with an average length of 126 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). These survivors were designated ‘rTG Type’ clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). One of the rTG Type clones was successively passaged on plates, and the cells grew as robustly as the SY15 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Unlike the rTG Type clone, clones 12, 17 and 18 employed non-TG but homologous DNA sequences, which existed on both arms of the linear single chromosome of SY14, to mediate chromosome fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). These survivors were designated as non-TG Type clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Notably, in these non-TG Type clones, the fusion sequences differed, as did their lengths (26, 46 and 7 bp in clones 12, 17 and 18, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting sporadic events of chromosome fusions.

For example, in clone 18, there was a T-C mismatch at the fusion point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Nevertheless, these sequencing results were consistent with the results of the telomere Southern blotting assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>): a 15 kb band emerged in all rTG Type cells, while no 15 kb band was detected in non-TG Type cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Chromosome fusion of SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells is nearly eliminated in the absence of Rad52.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of rTG Type survivors in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ.

To this end, we deleted <italic>RAD52</italic> or <italic>YKU70</italic> in the SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ <italic>CDC13</italic> strain and performed a quantitative survivor formation assay. An aliquot of the cell cultures was plated on either 5′-FOA or yeast complete (YC) medium lacking uracil (Ura<sup>-</sup>) to select for the eviction or the presence of plasmid-borne wild-type <italic>CDC13</italic> genes. Colonies were counted, and the efficiency of chromosomal fusion was measured by dividing the number of cells on 5′-FOA by that on YC medium lacking uracil (Ura<sup>-</sup>). The results revealed that the efficiency of chromosomal fusion in the SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ <italic>rad52</italic>Δ strain was over 60-fold lower than that in the SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that chromosome-end fusions were mainly mediated by the Rad52 pathway. In contrast, the efficiency of chromosomal fusion in the SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ <italic>yku70</italic>Δ strain was comparable to that in the SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that the NHEJ pathway contributes little to chromosomal fusion. Additionally, we characterized chromosome fusion in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ <italic>yku70</italic>Δ survivors. As in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ survivors, we randomly picked 30 single colonies and determined the borders of erosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>), fusion types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and fusion junction sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The colonies that could produce an ~2 kb band using the 1 <sup>L</sup>-R and 32 <sup>R</sup>-F primer pairs were categorized as rTG Type colonies, and further DNA sequencing results confirmed that 29 clones (out of 30) were rTG Type colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). Only one clone produced no PCR products with primers oriented from the centromere to the telomere, though the borders of erosion were determined. These results indicated that the rTG Type survivor generation rate in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ <italic>yku70</italic>Δ cells was comparable to that in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), further supporting the notion that two chromosome ends fused together in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells, likely via the Rad52 pathway (homologous recombination). However, it remained possible that the predominant Rad52-mediated repair of deprotected telomeres in the SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ strain was a result of defective NHEJ activity. To test this hypothesis, we deleted <italic>YKU70</italic> as well as <italic>LIG4</italic> in the SY14 strain and employed a plasmid repair assay as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boulton and Jackson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wilson and Lieber, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang and Paull, 2005</xref>) in the SY14 <italic>lig4</italic>Δ, SY14 <italic>yku70</italic>Δ and SY14 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Compared with the SY14 <italic>lig4</italic>Δ and SY14 <italic>yku70</italic>Δ strains, in which the NHEJ pathway was blocked, the NHEJ pathway in the SY14 strain functioned efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p><p>Pol32 is involved in both break-induced replication (BIR) and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee and Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lydeard et al., 2007</xref>) and is required for survivor generation in telomerase-null BY4742 cells.

Loss-of-function alleles of each subunit result in the accumulation of telomeric ssDNA and the abnormal elongation of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garvik et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grandin et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grandin et al., 1997</xref>). These lines of evidence suggest that Cdc13, Stn1 and Ten1 belong to a single epistatic group involved in telomere protection. To test this hypothesis further, we assessed the frequency of chromosome fusions in SY14 <italic>stn1</italic>∆ and <italic>ten1</italic>∆ cells. The results showed that the frequency of intrachromosomal fusion in the SY14 <italic>stn1</italic>∆ and SY14 <italic>ten1</italic>∆ strains was 0.04‰, which was ~29 fold lower than the 1.14‰ frequency observed in the <italic>cdc13</italic>∆ strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that Cdc13, Stn1 and Ten1 play nonequivalent roles in telomere capping: Cdc13 plays a much more dominant role than Stn1 and Ten1 in inhibiting chromosome end fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The further mapping of chromosome erosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>), the determination of chromosome fusions and the characterization of the fusion types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>) revealed that the frequency of rTG Type survivors (telomeric DNA sequence-mediated fusion) in SY14 <italic>stn1</italic>Δ and SY14 <italic>ten1</italic>Δ cells was ~30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which was much lower than the 92% frequency observed in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Thus, we quantified the chromosome fusion frequency in <italic>cdc13</italic>∆ <italic>stn1</italic>∆ and <italic>cdc13</italic>∆ <italic>ten1</italic>∆ double mutants and found that the further deletion of <italic>CDC13</italic> in <italic>stn1</italic>∆ and <italic>ten1</italic>∆ mutants resulted in approximately 10- and 6-fold increases in chromosome fusion rates compared to the single deletion of <italic>STN1</italic> or <italic>TEN1</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Further detailed mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>) and characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>) of chromosome fusions revealed that the increase in chromosome fusion in <italic>cdc13</italic>∆ <italic>stn1</italic>∆ and <italic>cdc13</italic>∆ <italic>ten1</italic>∆ double mutants was likely attributed to the elevation of the percentage of rTG Type chromosome fusion, which was 86% and 89% in the <italic>cdc13</italic>∆ <italic>stn1</italic>∆ and <italic>cdc13</italic>∆ <italic>ten1</italic>∆ mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), comparable to the 92% rate in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast, 0% (in <italic>cdc13</italic>∆ <italic>stn1</italic>∆) and 3% (in <italic>cdc13</italic>∆ <italic>ten1</italic>∆) of the total survivors were non-TG Type clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5C</xref>). These results further support the conclusion that the presence of Cdc13 in telomeric ssDNA inhibits chromosome fusion. Interestingly, the chromosome fusion rates in the <italic>cdc13</italic>∆ <italic>stn1</italic>∆ and <italic>cdc13</italic>∆ <italic>ten1</italic>∆ strains were significantly lower than those in the <italic>cdc13</italic>∆ strain, suggesting that independent of Cdc13, Stn1 and Ten1 play roles in inhibiting chromosome fusion. This observation is in line with previous reports showing that Stn1 and Ten1 shield chromosome ends from extensive resection by exonucleases, likely because they both bind telomeres with a relatively low affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Qian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Qian et al., 2009</xref>), and Stn1 functions as the primary effector of telomere protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennock et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petreaca et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Petreaca et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sun et al., 2009</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that it is Cdc13, and not Stn1 or Ten1, that plays the major role in inhibiting chromosomal end-to-end fusion.</p><p>Presumably, a lack of Cdc13 protection results in an equal probability of telomere erosion at both ends of the single chromosome in SY14 cells. However, in <italic>cdc13</italic>∆ rTG Type survivors, the resection of two telomeres before circularization was relatively unbalanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We propose that telomere erosion occurred at the two telomeres with an equal probability, but the pre-existing 5′-(CA)<sub>17</sub>-3′ sequence, which is located 43.9 kb away from the telomere of Chr X-R in SY14, provided an optimal complementary sequence to pair with the 5′-TG<sub>1-3</sub>-3′ telomeric sequence of Chr XVI-L, thus favoring the generation (selection) of rTG Type survivors. To test this hypothesis, we constructed the SY14<sup>CA255</sup> strain, in which a 255 bp C<sub>1-3</sub>A sequence was inserted between the <italic>PGU1</italic> and <italic>YJR154W</italic> genes on Chr X-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6A</xref>). The inserted C<sub>1-3</sub>A sequence was located 20.9 kb away from the telomeric TG<sub>1-3</sub> sequence of Chr X-R, more proximal than the (CA)<sub>17</sub> sequence to the telomere of Chr X-R. Likewise, the single or double deletion of the <italic>CST</italic> gene resulted in the death of the majority of SY14<sup>CA255</sup> cells, but some survivors emerged. A single clone of each isogenic survivor was characterized; that is the borders of the erosion and fusion types of these survivors were determined by PCR mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6B–D</xref>). The results revealed that all of the clones were of the rTG Type and utilized CA255 instead of the ‘5′-(CA)<sub>17</sub>-3′’ repeat sequence at their fusion junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6E</xref>). Therefore, chromosome circularization preferentially occurred at sites where complementary sequences existed on two telomeres. However, we could not exclude the possibility that different chromatin structures at the two telomeres also contributed to the unbalanced erosion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Telomerase inactivation in SY14 cells results in cellular senescence and chromosome circularization</title><p>Our previous study showed that a lack of telomerase in SY14 led to senescence and the generation of survivors, whose telomere structures were distinguished from those of canonical Type I and Type II survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shao et al., 2019a</xref>). This phenotype brought to mind the notion that the eroded chromosome ends of SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells might also fuse together. Hence, we constructed the SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ pRS316-<italic>TLC1</italic> and SY15 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ pRS316-<italic>TLC1</italic> strains, in which the chromosomal copy of the <italic>TLC1</italic> gene was deleted, while a plasmid-borne wild-type <italic>TLC1</italic> gene (pRS316-<italic>TLC1</italic>) was introduced. The SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ pRS316-<italic>TLC1</italic> cells and SY15 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ pRS316-<italic>TLC1</italic> cells were grown on plates containing 5′-FOA, which counterselected the clones that had lost the pRS316-<italic>TLC1</italic> plasmid. As a result, the SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ strain and SY15 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ strain were obtained. The phenotypes of senescence and telomere length in the SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ and SY15 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ strains were examined. In liquid-grown culture, three individual colonies senesced and recovered in different passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Southern blotting assay revealed that the telomeres of SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells shortened with increasing passages and reached a critical length at different time points when the cells were in the senescent state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which is an indication of a correlation between telomere erosion and cellular senescence. Normally, Type II survivors grow faster than Type I survivors and eventually come to dominate liquid cultures. Among three individual clones, two (clones 1 and 3) generated Type II survivors with the amplification of TG repeats, while one (clone 2) exhibited a pattern that was totally different from that of either Type I or Type II survivors but was similar to that of SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>), suggesting that chromosome fusion had taken place. In solid medium, the SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells senesced at the 3rd re-streak (~75 generations) on plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), and survivors gradually emerged thereafter. 50 independent clones of survivors were randomly selected, and telomere structure was determined by the telomere Southern blotting assay. The results showed that the telomere band of ~1.3 kb was not seen in all survivors, while a 15 kb band emerged in the majority of clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), similar to the chromosomal end-to-end fusions observed in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ survivors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Further erosion-border mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), fusion type assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and fusion junction sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>) confirmed that most of the survived SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells had experienced chromosomal circularization via homologous TG<sub>1-3</sub>/C<sub>1-3</sub>A DNA sequences, as seen in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ survivors, which could be perpetually maintained under laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As expected, a 15 kb band was detected in all TG Type cells except for two clones, which contained TG<sub>1-3</sub>/C<sub>1-3</sub>A tracts at the junction points that were too short (18 and 20 bp long). Accordingly, no corresponding band was detected in the non-TG Type and NI cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2B</xref>). Notably, in the rTG Type circular chromosome of SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells, the retained TG<sub>1-3</sub>/C<sub>1-3</sub>A sequences at junction points were 18 to 58 bp long (36 bp long on average) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), which was much shorter than those in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ survivors. We propose that in SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells, chromosome fusion takes place passively after telomeres have experienced extensive shortening (crisis), while in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells, chromosome fusion occurs immediately upon telomere deprotection via the loss of Cdc13.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Telomerase inactivation in SY14 cells results in senescence and survivor formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Senescence assay in liquid medium.

With the reduction in chromosome numbers, the frequency of Type II survivor emergence gradually decreased, while Y’ recombination was readily detected, indicating an increase of Type I survivors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>-Ε). These data suggest that the efficiency of telomere recombination is affected by chromosomal numbers in budding yeast. Notably, some distinct bands (indicated by open arrows on the right in the panels) with a size larger or smaller than the Y’-element occasionally emerged in SY7 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ clones (eight chromosomes) as well as in SY <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ clones with fewer chromosomes, suggesting that in yeast strains with eight or fewer chromosomes, chromosome fusions might exist. However, most telomerase-null cells likely prefer to utilize the canonical telomere recombination pathway rather than chromosome fusion to survive. The reasons for this are not clear. One possibility is that multiple Y’-elements exist in either subtelomeric regions in different chromosomes or Y’-elements containing extrachromosomal circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larrivée and Wellinger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2005</xref>), which facilitates telomere recombination. There are no Y’-elements or counterparts thereof in fission yeast. Alternatively, or additionally, the survivors with chromosome fusions presented less of a growth advantage (e.g., slower growth rates) than canonical survivors and were outcompeted during continuous culture.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The Rad52 pathway plays a dominant role in chromosomal end-to-end fusion in SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells</title><p>To investigate whether Rad52 contributes to chromosomal circularization in SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells, we constructed the SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>rad52</italic>Δ pRS316-<italic>TLC1</italic> strain.

The physical and functional interactions between telomeres seem to complicate the study of telomere structure and function. Recently, we successfully constructed single-chromosome yeast strains, SY14 and SY15, which contain two or no telomeres, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shao et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shao et al., 2018</xref>). In this work, we have taken advantage of these single-chromosome yeast strains to elucidate telomere-associated processes, some of which might be difficult to observe in yeast with multiple chromosomes.</p><p>Cdc13, Stn1 and Ten1 form a complex (CST) to protect telomeres and regulate telomere replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chandra et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Churikov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grossi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nugent et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennock et al., 2001</xref>). The deletion of any of the CST genes results in an immediate cessation of cell division, likely due to telomere deprotection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garvik et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grandin et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grandin et al., 1997</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>cdc13-1</italic>, <italic>stn1-13</italic> or <italic>ten1-31</italic> temperature-sensitive mutants all display long single-strand telomeric TG<sub>1-3</sub> DNA at restrictive temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garvik et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grandin et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grandin et al., 1997</xref>). These studies suggest that <italic>CDC13, STN1</italic> and <italic>TEN1</italic> function epistatically in telomere protection. This notion is strengthened but also challenged by the results obtained from our single-chromosome yeast. In SY15 cells containing a single circular chromosome, the deletion of <italic>CDC13</italic>, <italic>STN1</italic> or <italic>TEN1</italic> does not appear to affect cell growth or viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), indicating that the essentiality of CST is mainly due to telomere protection. In contrast, <italic>RAP1</italic> is still essential for the viability of SY15 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating the importance of the transcriptional function of Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Zakian, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lieb et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In single-chromosome SY14 cells, the deletion of <italic>CDC13</italic> results in telomere deprotection, leading to inviability of most of the cells. Unexpectedly, approximately 1‰ of these cells survived through Rad52-mediated chromosomal end-to-end fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Although this phenomenon appears to be common in fission yeast in the absence of telomerase or telomere binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumann and Cech, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martín et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakamura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tashiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang and Baumann, 2008</xref>), it has not been clearly observed or characterized in budding yeast cells with multiple chromosomes. More interestingly, chromosomal fusion events were ~30 fold less common in SY14 <italic>stn1</italic>Δ or SY14 <italic>ten1</italic>Δ cells than in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and the survivor formation rate was significantly improved by the further deletion of <italic>CDC13</italic> in the <italic>stn1</italic>∆ and <italic>ten1</italic>∆ strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), reinforcing the conclusion that it is Cdc13, and probably not Stn1 and/or Ten1, that plays the major inhibitory role in chromosomal fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grandin and Charbonneau, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grandin et al., 2001a</xref>). This idea is supported by the biochemical finding that Cdc13 binds to telomeric DNA with an exceptionally high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nugent et al., 1996</xref>) and thereby inhibits the HR pathway. On the other hand, the chromosome fusion frequency in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ <italic>stn1</italic>Δ or SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ <italic>ten1</italic>Δ cells is &gt;3.8 fold lower than that in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that Stn1 and Ten1 play roles in telomere protection independent of Cdc13 and limit telomere accessibility to prevent inappropriate degradation. This hypothesis is supported by the biochemical findings that both Stn1 and Ten1 exhibit weak telomeric DNA-binding activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Qian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Qian et al., 2009</xref>), and the genetic results showing that the fusion of the DNA-binding domain of Cdc13 to Stn1 or the overexpression of Stn1/Ten1 bypasses the requirement for Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennock et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petreaca et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We were relatively fortunate to detect rTG Type chromosomal fusions in SY14 <italic>cst</italic>Δ or SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells. Presumably, the two telomeres in SY14 <italic>cst</italic>Δ or SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells exhibit an equal probability of undergoing degradation, but the 5′-TG<sub>1-3</sub>-3′/5′-C<sub>1-3</sub>A-3′ sequences retained in the circular chromosomes of the recovered clones all came from Chr XVI-L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The likely reasons for this are as follows: (1) there is a 34 bp 5′- (CA)<sub>17</sub> -3′/5′- (TG)<sub>17</sub> -3′ repeat sequence at the 43.9 kb locus proximal to the Chr X-R telomere, whose 5′- (CA)<sub>17</sub> -3′ sequence matches well with the 5′-TG<sub>1-3</sub>-3′ sequence in the Chr XVI-L telomere; and (2) there is no 5′- C<sub>1-3</sub>A −3′/5′- T<sub>1-3</sub>G-3′ repeat sequence in the Chr XVI-L subtelomere region, which is located telomere-proximal to the essential gene <italic>PLC1</italic>. Accordingly, the 255 bp C<sub>1-3</sub>A/TG<sub>1-3</sub> telomere sequence, which was inserted more proximally to the telomeres than the (CA)<sub>17</sub> repeat sequence, was preferentially utilized as a fusion sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). We are able to recover chromosomal fusion clones of the ‘non-TG Type’. However, their emergence rate was much lower than that of ‘rTG Type’ clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref>), probably because telomere-proximal non-TG sequences showing microhomology are rare, or the efficiency of microhomology-mediated chromosomal fusions is quite low. Thus, the fortuity of identifying a single-chromosome yeast with the original Chr X-R telomere, which contains a 34 bp 5′-(CA)<sub>17</sub> -3′/5′-(TG)<sub>17</sub>-3′ repeat sequence, was beyond our expectations because the availability of a reasonable number of ‘rTG Type’ survivors greatly facilitates the quantification of chromosomal fusions. Chromosomal fusion is readily detected in single-chromosome SY14 yeast but not in sixteen-chromosome BY4742 yeast (wild type) lacking Cdc13 or telomerase. Even if chromosome fusion takes place in BY4742 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ or BY4742 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells, there is little or no chance to recover such survivors, because the low efficiency of chromosome fusion, interchromosomal telomere interaction and unforeseeable growth defect make the mission impossible.</p><p>Both rTG Type (TG/CA) and non-TG Type (other microhomologous sequences) chromosomal fusion appear to require Rad52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), a critical factor for almost all kinds of homologous DNA sequence-mediated activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">San Filippo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Symington, 2002</xref>), such as the double-strand break repair (DSBR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Szostak et al., 1983</xref>), synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nassif et al., 1994</xref>), single-strand annealing (SSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fishman-Lobell et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maryon and Carroll, 1991</xref>) and break-induced replication (BIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McEachern and Haber, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morrow et al., 1997</xref>) pathways. Single-strand annealing is a highly mutagenic homologous recombination pathway that proceeds via the annealing of repeated sequences flanking DSB sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhargava et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis and Symington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fishman-Lobell et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ivanov et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maryon and Carroll, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Symington, 2002</xref>). The process is initiated by the resection of the 5′-ends and exposure of homologous regions oriented in the same direction. After annealing to each other, the nonhomologous tails are removed. This is followed by DNA synthesis that fills in the gaps and ligation. Given that telomere deprotection in SY14 <italic>cst</italic>∆ and SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>∆ cells involves end resection and homologous sequence pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>), we favor the model in which rTG Type and non-TG Type chromosomal fusions are mainly achieved through the SSA pathway. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that chromosomal circularization occurs via the MMEJ or BIR pathway. The latter model is supported by the observation that chromosome fusion in <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells is partially dependent on Pol32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), which is involved in both MMEJ and BIR pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee and Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lydeard et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Information about yeast strains used in this study is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

The results show that the telomeric ssDNA binding protein Cdc13 is the critical component for fusion prevention, while the Stn1 and Ten1 protein do contribute in different ways. It also appears that the replication associated function of the CST heterotrimer is not as critical as previously anticipated. These studies thus provide an unprecedented opportunity to detail the functions of essential chromosomal capping genes in telomeric repeat maintenance in the presence or absence of telomerase.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cdc13 but not Stn1 or Ten1 plays a predominant role in preventing chromosomes from end-to-end fusion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Connie Nugent (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers felt that the single chromosome yeast strains constitute a superb system to assess telomeric functions and phenotypes, including the precise functions of associated proteins. To be able to manipulate strains in complete absence of telomeres allows for very clear and unencumbered experiments and this therefore is a great plus for the paper's experimental lines. However, all three reviewers also thought that as is, there was a bit of a lack of depth and new insights into telomere biology. For example, there is already indirect evidence that CST proteins can be non-essential. On the other hand, given that there is much talk about the interactions between passing replication forks and the end-activities, or capping, of certain factors, they thought that certain rather simple experiments could bring this manuscript up to the level we expect for <italic>eLife</italic>. After thorough discussion, the reviewers request the following experiments:</p><p>1) A major debate in the field is the question of whether the CST-complex does function alike RPA but on telomeric repeat DNA. It is important to recognize that this would be a telomere replication function, not necessarily a protection function. Hence, the conclusion in subsection “The essentiality of CST is solely attributed to its roles in telomere protection” that CST is solely required for telomere protection is not (yet) supported by the experiments. However, this could easily be tested by inserting an adequate telomeric repeat tract (250 bp or so) in both orientations somewhere on the single linear and circular chromosome strains. Then let those four strains lose CST components and monitor the stability of the inserted GT tracts. If there really is no significant internal function for any of the CST components (<italic>cdc13</italic>Δ ; <italic>stn1</italic>Δ <italic>ten1</italic>Δ; or <italic>cdc13/stn1</italic> double; <italic>cdc13/ten1</italic> and <italic>stn1/ten1</italic>), then these non-terminal tracts should be stable in either orientation on the circular chromosome.</p><p>2) All of the yeast survivors require that Pol32 gene be present. If the circularization you observe after <italic>Tlc1</italic> (telomerase) loss is independent of those mechanisms, this circularization should be independent of Pol32. So, verify the <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>cst</italic>Δ with a <italic>pol32</italic>Δ.</p><p>3) Given your results and those in <italic>S. pombe</italic> with three chromosomes, the question arises as to when are there too many linear chromosomes for circularization as a solution to telomere problems? You should be able to readily address that by deleting Tlc1 or Est2 from your intermediate linear chromosome strains. I.e. you show here a single linear chromosome does circularize; how about the intermediate strain with three chromosomes (like <italic>S. pombe</italic>?), with five chromosomes, with 10 chromosomes? The results from this experiment would certainly broaden the scope of the paper enormously.</p><p>4) For technical reasons, it would be good to conclusively assess that NHEJ is indeed still functional in the single linear chromosome strain. A simple linear plasmid transformation and circularization assay would be enough and use <italic>lig4</italic>Δ as negative control.</p><p>The addition of the above experiments was deemed essential by all reviewers for the paper to go forward. Below I add some other comments that were noted by reviewers and that you may or may not address with experiments. However, the reviewers expect them to be at least commented on in the revised manuscript.</p><p>5) SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic> cells carry all the CDC13, STN1 and TEN1 genes. If Cdc13 plays a key role in preventing telomeric fusion, SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic> survivors are expected to contain non-TG type fusion more frequently compared with rTG fusion. However, SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic> and SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic> cells have a similar profile in rTG and nonTG fusion (Figure 4, 5 and 7). Some better explanation is required.</p><p>6) In the PCR mediated breakpoint mappings (first occurrence Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B). It is my understanding that a black dot means that the PCR was productive and this site present in the clone. Therefore, please insert a black dot into ALL squares after the first occurrence of a black dot, indicating that from here on inwards, all PCRs were positive and the chromosomal loci present (not rearranged). As is, those squares are empty, as if the PCR did not work; yet the bands are there.</p><p>7) We found it remarkable that in the Rad52+ cells, the fusion points almost invariably retained all of the Y'-telomere (including some repeats) but had lost over 30 kb of sequences from the other end. The SSA and related mechanisms predict an extended ssDNA for the annealing and such an unbalanced resection is somewhat surprising. Could they comment on what happens to the Y' TELOXVIL in the probably significantly long time until resection hits that hot spot in the subtelomere of TELOXR? Is there a difference in the replication timing of the two ends?</p><p>8) To what do you attribute the telomere length fluctuation observed in Figure 1F among the streakout colonies?</p><p>9) In Discussion, one could bring in the parallel example of chromosomal circularization observed in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, where having just a few chromosomes allows circular survivors to arise when telomerase is deficient. (Paragraph three) I think mentioning this fission yeast case would benefit the discussion because it is an example of cells using chromosome circularization to survive absence of telomerase.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the revised version of your article &quot;Cdc13 but not Stn1 or Ten1 plays a predominant role in preventing chromosomes from end-to-end fusion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been re-reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Raymund Wellinger as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Reviewers all agreed that the additional data generated for the revised manuscript is interesting and renders the paper more suitable for a general readership. However, certain additions and explanations appear to lack specificity and precision and they also thought that the survivor data must be incorporated, given the rather interesting findings. The reviewers agreed that the requested data be incorporated in particular if you do have the data in hand.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>1) Please do include the data on the multiple and single chromosome yeasts and their mode of survival in the absence of telomerase. While a full mechanistic understanding may not be achieved here, it does provide for essential insights into budding yeast chromosome biology. It would also validate the statement that the observations &quot;could never be seen in multiple chromosome yeast&quot;.</p><p>2) The GT-tract stability data is considered extremely interesting, albeit a bit incomplete. Could growth characteristics, viability platings or other data you have address the issue of how frequent complete losses of these tracts occur and what this may cause? Is it possible that such major replication problems go undetected in your assay (because of inviability of the cells) and therefore skew the interpretation derived from it? In case there is no experimental data addressing this possibility directly, you would have to tone down the Discussion &quot;the essentiality of CST is solely attributed to telomere protection&quot; and include the caveat that one-step complete losses may not be recovered in your system</p><p>3) Role of Pol32 in telomere fusion (Figure 4E): Pol32 appears to affect the chromosome fusion rate in <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells. This discrepancy was likely attributed to different telomere structures between SY14 <italic>tlc1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells. The reviewers thought that this speculative idea would need some more direct evidence. Otherwise, it would be better to say &quot;we speculate different telomere structures between SY14 <italic>tlc1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53144.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>After thorough discussion, the reviewers request the following experiments:</p><p>1) A major debate in the field is the question of whether the CST-complex does function alike RPA but on telomeric repeat DNA.

According to this suggestion, we used several single circular chromosome yeast strains, including SY15 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ <italic>CDC13</italic>, SY15 <italic>stn1</italic>Δ <italic>STN1</italic>, SY15 <italic>ten1</italic>Δ <italic>TEN1</italic>, SY15 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ <italic>stn1</italic>Δ <italic>CDC13 STN1</italic>, SY15 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ <italic>ten1</italic>Δ <italic>CDC13 TEN1</italic> and SY15 <italic>stn1</italic>Δ <italic>ten1</italic>Δ <italic>STN1 TEN1</italic> (SY15 <italic>cst</italic>Δ <italic>CST</italic>), to address this issue. Briefly, we inserted a 255 bp-long telomeric sequence into a genomic locus between genes <italic>PGU1</italic> and <italic>YJR154W</italic> in both orientations in SY15 <italic>cst</italic>Δ <italic>CST</italic> strains. The yielding strains, which were designated as SY15<sup>CA255</sup> and SY15<sup>TG255</sup>, respectively, were passaged on plates for five times (~100 population doublings). The inserted TG255/CA255 sequences determined by Southern blotting were successfully transmitted from generation to generation in all the SY15<sup>CA255</sup> and SY15<sup>TG255</sup> strains, regardless of the presence or absence of CST. In order to find out whether there was any tiny contraction or expansion of TG255/CA255 sequences after ~100 rounds of replication, we performed PCR analysis, and the amplified DNA fragments from all of the strains were in the same size. Further sequencing results of three independent clones of each <italic>cst</italic> mutants confirmed that there were no mutations after ~100 population doublings. These results indicate that CST complex does not affect the replication of non-terminal telomeric sequences, and in other words, CST-complex likely has no other telomere replication function than recruitment of Polα for lagging strand synthesis. These results have been presented as Figure 2D and E; Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) All of the yeast survivors require that Pol32 gene be present. If the circularization you observe after Tlc1 (telomerase) loss is independent of those mechanisms, this circularization should be independent of Pol32. So, verify the tlc1Δ cstΔ with a pol32Δ.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer’s suggestion, we deleted <italic>POL32</italic> in SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ pRS316-<italic>TLC1</italic> cells and the plasmid-borne wild-type genes were counter-selected on 5′-fluoroorotic acid (5′-FOA) plates thereafter. The mutants were passaged on plates for ten times until survivors generated. Both of the SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ and SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>pol32</italic>Δ cells senesced at the 3rd re-streak on plates and survivors gradually emerged at the 7th re-streak, suggesting that deletion of <italic>POL32</italic> in SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ strain did not affect the formation of survivors. Further chromosome-fusion mapping and fusion type assay revealed that the rTG Type survivor rate in SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>pol32</italic>Δ cells was 100%, higher than 84% in SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells. These data suggest that Pol32 is not required for the generation of rTG Type survivors in SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells, but might function in non-TG Type formation. This result has been presented in the revised manuscript as Figure 7C and D, Figure 7—figure supplement 5.</p><p>In addition, we also constructed SY14 <italic>pol32</italic>Δ <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ pRS316-<italic>CDC13</italic> strain to examine whether chromosomal circularization relies on Pol32. The quantitative survivor formation assay showed that further deletion of <italic>POL32</italic> in <italic>cdc13</italic>∆ mutant resulted in an approximately 3-fold decrease of chromosome fusion rates compared to single deletion of <italic>CDC13</italic>, indicating chromosomal circularization in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ survivors partially depends on Pol32. But Pol32 seems not to affect chromosome fusion in SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells, supporting the model that in SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells, the presence of Cdc13 at telomeres suppresses chromosome fusion. We included the result in our revised manuscript as Figure 4E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given your results and those in S. pombe with three chromosomes, the question arises as to when are there too many linear chromosomes for circularization as a solution to telomere problems? You should be able to readily address that by deleting Tlc1 or Est2 from your intermediate linear chromosome strains. I.e. you show here a single linear chromosome does circularize; how about the intermediate strain with three chromosomes (like S. pombe?), with five chromosomes, with 10 chromosomes? The results from this experiment would certainly broaden the scope of the paper enormously.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank this reviewer for the suggestion. Chromosome fusion takes place in fission yeast, which usually contains three chromosomes, in the absence of telomerase or telomere binding protein (Baumann and Cech, 2001, Martin et al., 2007, Nakamura et al., 1998, Tashiro et al., 2017, Wang and Baumann, 2008). Since SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells survived via chromosome fusion, we wanted to know whether chromosome fusions readily occurred in budding yeast with the decrease of chromosome numbers. We deleted <italic>TLC1</italic> in a series of chromosome-fused yeast strains, including SY1, SY3, SY5, SY7, SY8, SY9, SY10, SY11 and SY12, which were derived from BY4742 strain and contained different numbers of chromosomes (Figure 6—figure supplement 4A) (Shao et al., 2018). Fifteen single colonies of each <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ strains were immediately passaged on the plates for successive 7 to10 times after <italic>TLC1</italic> deletion. Because not every strain displayed typical senescence and growth crisis, we assumed that such a long time passages allow for the formation of survivors. The telomere pattern of these survivors was examined by the Southern blotting. The results showed that BY4742 <italic>tlc1</italic>∆ generated both Type I and Type II survivors (Lundblad and Blackburn, 1993, Teng et al., 2000, Teng and Zakian, 1999). With the reduction of chromosome numbers, the emergence frequency of type II survivors gradually decreased, while Y’ recombination was readily detected, an indication of an increase of type I survivors (Figure 6—figure supplement 4B-Ε). These data suggest that the efficiency of telomere recombination is affected by chromosomal numbers in budding yeast. Notably, some distinct bands (indicated by open arrows at the right of the panels) with a size larger or smaller than Y’-element occasionally emerged in SY7 <italic>tlc1</italic>∆ clones (eight chromosomes), as well as in SY <italic>tlc1</italic>∆ clones with fewer chromosomes, suggesting that in yeast strains with eight or fewer chromosomes, there might be chromosome fusions, however, most of the telomerase null cells likely prefer to utilize canonical telomere recombination pathway, instead of chromosome fusion, to survive. The reasons for that were not clear. One possibility was that multiple Y’-elements exist in either the sub-telomeric region in different chromosomes or Y’-element containing extra-chromosome circles (Lin et al., 2005), which facilitates telomere recombination. There is no Y’-element or its counterpart in fission yeast. Alternatively or additionally, the survivors with chromosome fusions had less growth advantage (e.g. slower growth rate) than canonical survivors, and were competed out during continuous culture. Because the mechanism of putative chromosome circularization and the reasons why the frequency of Type I (versus Type II survivors) increases with the reduction of chromosome numbers remain to be investigated further in the future, thus, we prefer not to include these results in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For technical reasons, it would be good to conclusively assess that NHEJ is indeed still functional in the single linear chromosome strain. A simple linear plasmid transformation and circularization assay would be enough and use lig4Δ as negative control.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we constructed SY14 <italic>lig4</italic>Δ and SY14 <italic>yku70</italic>Δ strains, and employed a plasmid repair assay as previously described (Boulton and Jackson, 1996, Wilson and Lieber, 1999, Zhang and Paull, 2005). The test plasmid pRS316 contains a CEN/ARS cassette for plasmid maintenance and a <italic>URA3</italic> marker for selection. The plasmid substrate was linearized with EcoRI, generating two ends which are not homologous to yeast genomic sequences, and then the digested plasmids were transformed into SY14, SY14 <italic>lig4</italic>Δ and SY14 <italic>yku70</italic>Δ strains. Yeast transformants bearing only the recircularized plasmids survived on the selective medium. Parallelly, the yeast cells transformed with an equal amount of undigested plasmid pRS316 were plated on uracil- YC medium. Colonies were counted and the efficiency of NHEJ was measured by dividing the number of cells with the cut plasmid by that with uncut plasmid. Compared with SY14 <italic>lig4</italic>Δ and SY14 <italic>yku70</italic>Δ strains, in which the NHEJ pathway is blocked, the NHEJ pathway in SY14 strain was functioning efficiently. The results were presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 4 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The addition of the above experiments was deemed essential by all reviewers for the paper to go forward. Below I add some other comments that were noted by reviewers and that you may or may not address with experiments. However, the reviewers expect them to be at least commented on in the revised manuscript.</p><p>5) SY14 tlc1 cells carry all the CDC13, STN1 and TEN1 genes. If Cdc13 plays a key role in preventing telomeric fusion, SY14 tlc1 survivors are expected to contain non-TG type fusion more frequently compared with rTG fusion. However, SY14 tlc1 and SY14 cdc13 cells have a similar profile in rTG and nonTG fusion (Figure 4, 5 and 7). Some better explanation is required.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raised a point that has confused us as well. We could not provide a compelling explanation at this moment. We noticed that the length of the TG-sequence at fusion junctions in SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells was much shorter than that in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells (Figure 3—figure supplements 2 and 3; Figure 6—figure supplement 3). This result suggests that chromosome fusion in SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ cells takes place after telomeres have experienced extensive shortening, while chromosome fusion in SY14 <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells seems to take place immediately after loss of Cdc13 protection. Thus, rTG fusion only tells the outcome of fusion, but doesn’t reflect any preceding event before fusion. We have included this notion in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the PCR mediated breakpoint mappings (first occurrence Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B). It is my understanding that a black dot means that the PCR was productive and this site present in the clone. Therefore, please insert a black dot into ALL squares after the first occurrence of a black dot, indicating that from here on inwards, all PCRs were positive and the chromosomal loci present (not rearranged). As is, those squares are empty, as if the PCR did not work; yet the bands are there.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for pointing out the mislabeling of our figures. We have inserted black dots into the corresponding squares in the revised manuscript as suggested. Besides, our calculation of “Distance from telomere X-R (kb)” was wrong and we correct it in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) We found it remarkable that in the Rad52+ cells, the fusion points almost invariably retained all of the Y'-telomere (including some repeats) but had lost over 30 kb of sequences from the other end. The SSA and related mechanisms predict an extended ssDNA for the annealing and such an unbalanced resection is somewhat surprising. Could they comment on what happens to the Y' TELOXVIL in the probably significantly long time until resection hits that hot spot in the subtelomere of TELOXR? Is there a difference in the replication timing of the two ends?</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the logic the reviewers had pointed out. To address the reviewer’s concern, we constructed the SY14<sup>CA255</sup> strain in which a 255 bp C<sub>1-3</sub>A sequence was inserted between genes <italic>PGU1</italic> and <italic>YJR154W</italic> on Chr X-R. The inserted C<sub>1-3</sub>A sequence is 20.9 kb away from telomeric TG<sub>1-3</sub> sequence, more proximal than the (CA)<sub>17</sub> sequence to the telomere of Chr X-R. Likewise, deletion of a CST component resulted in death of the majority of SY14<sup>CA255</sup> cells, but survivors emerged. A single clone of each isogenic survivors was characterized, i.e. the erosion-points and fusion types of these survivors were determined by PCR-mapping. The results revealed that all of the clones were rTG Type, which utilized the CA255 instead of the “5′-(CA)<sub>17</sub>-3′” repeat sequence at their fusion junctions. Therefore, chromosome circularization preferentially occurred at the sites where complementary sequences existed on two telomeres. However, we could not exclude the possibility that different chromatin structures at two telomeres also contributed to the unbalanced erosion. These results have been presented in the revised manuscript as Figure 5—figure supplement 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) To what do you attribute the telomere length fluctuation observed in Figure 1F among the streakout colonies?</p></disp-quote><p>Fluctuations of telomere length were indeed observed in different cell passages, as well as in different clones in the same passage, and the reason for the fluctuation was not clear. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the length of telomeres is maintained within a narrow size distribution but the telomeric DNA length at individual telomeres varies (Shampay and Blackburn, 1988, Zakian, 1996). When the chromosome numbers reduced from sixteen in wide-type BY4742 cells to one in SY14, the telomere length variation became apparent. Nevertheless, the telomeres in all of the clones varied within the range of ~250 bp to 350 bp, indicating that the telomere length fluctuation observed is the dynamic nature of the chromosome ends, which might be difficult to tell in wide-type cells in Southern blotting assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Discussion, one could bring in the parallel example of chromosomal circularization observed in S. pombe, where having just a few chromosomes allows circular survivors to arise when telomerase is deficient. (Paragraph three) I think mentioning this fission yeast case would benefit the discussion because it is an example of cells using chromosome circularization to survive absence of telomerase.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. We added this part to the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewers all agreed that the additional data generated for the revised manuscript is interesting and renders the paper more suitable for a general readership.

Could growth characteristics, viability platings or other data you have address the issue of how frequent complete losses of these tracts occur and what this may cause? Is it possible that such major replication problems go undetected in your assay (because of inviability of the cells) and therefore skew the interpretation derived from it? In case there is no experimental data addressing this possibility directly, you would have to tone down the Discussion &quot;the essentiality of CST is solely attributed to telomere protection&quot; and include the caveat that one-step complete losses may not be recovered in your system</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comments. Accordingly, we have added a few sentences to discuss this issue in the revision: “However, it should be noted that the replication of ITSs may encounter difficulties in the absence of CST (Gasparyan et al., 2009, Price et al., 2010, Stewart et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2019), which leads to cell death and might not be recovered in this system. Additionally, or alternatively, the frequency of the expansion/contraction of ITSs in <italic>cst</italic> mutants was too low to be detected within ~100 rounds of replication (Aksenova et al., 2015).” In addition, we have toned down the Discussion: “the essentiality of CST is mainly due to telomere protection” in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Role of Pol32 in telomere fusion (Figure 4E): Pol32 appears to affect the chromosome fusion rate in cdc13Δ cells.

Otherwise, it would be better to say &quot;we speculate different telomere structures between SY14 tlc1Δ and cdc13Δ cells&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>According to this comment, we have revised the statement: “We speculate that this discrepancy could likely be attributed to different telomere structures between SY14 <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ and <italic>cdc13</italic>Δ cells” in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
