Vaccination remains the most effective preventative. Rapid mutation of hemagglutinin allows viruses to escape adaptive immunity. This antigenic drift necessitates regular vaccine updates. Effective vaccine strains need to represent H3N2 populations circulating one year after strain selection. Experts select strains based on experimental measurements of antigenic drift and predictions made by models from hemagglutinin sequences. We developed a novel influenza forecasting framework that integrates phenotypic measures of antigenic drift and functional constraint with previously published sequence-only fitness estimates. Forecasts informed by phenotypic measures of antigenic drift consistently outperformed previous sequence-only estimates, while sequence-only estimates of functional constraint surpassed more comprehensive experimentally-informed estimates. Importantly, the best models integrated estimates of both functional constraint and either antigenic drift phenotypes or recent population growth.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Vaccination is the best protection against seasonal flu. It teaches the immune system what the flu virus looks like, preparing it to fight off an infection. But the flu virus changes its molecular appearance every year, escaping the immune defences learnt the year before. So, every year, the vaccine needs updating. Since it takes almost a year to design and make a new flu vaccine, researchers need to be able to predict what flu viruses will look like in the future. Currently, this prediction relies on experiments that assess the molecular appearance of flu viruses, a complex and slow approach.</p><p>One alternative is to examine the virus's genetic code. Mathematical models try to predict which genetic changes might alter the appearance of a flu virus, saving the cost of performing specialised experiments. Recent research has shown that these models can make good predictions, but including experimental measures of the virus’ appearance could improve them even further. This could help the model to work out which genetic changes are likely to be beneficial to the virus, and which are not.</p><p>To find out whether experimental data improves model predictions, Huddleston et al. designed a new forecasting tool which used 25 years of historical data from past flu seasons. Each forecast predicted what the virus population might look like the next year using the previous year's genetic code, experimental data, or both. Huddleston et al. then compared the predictions with the historical data to find the most useful data types. This showed that the best predictions combined changes from the virus's genetic code with experimental measures of its appearance.</p><p>This new forecasting tool is open source, allowing teams across the world to start using it to improve their predictions straight away. Seasonal flu infects between 5 and 15% of the world's population every year, causing between quarter of a million and half a million deaths. Better predictions could lead to better flu vaccines and fewer illnesses and deaths.</p></abstract><kwd-group

population every year causing an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 deaths annually with the majority of infections caused by influenza A/H3N2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">World Health Organization, 2014</xref>). Vaccination remains the most effective public health response available. However, frequent viral mutation results in viruses that escape previously acquired human immunity. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) monitors influenza evolution by sampling currently circulating viruses, or strains, and analyzing these strains with genome sequencing and serological assays. The WHO GISRS uses these data to select vaccine viruses that should best represent circulating viruses in the next influenza season. However, because the process of vaccine development and distribution requires several months to complete, optimal vaccine design requires an accurate prediction of which viruses will predominate approximately one year after vaccine viruses are selected.</p><p>Historically, the effectiveness of the H3N2 vaccine component has been much lower than the other seasonal influenza subtypes. For example, H3N2’s mean vaccine effectiveness from 2004 to 2015 was 33% compared to 61% for H1N1pdm and 54% for influenza B viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belongia et al., 2016</xref>). Multiple factors can reduce vaccine effectiveness including selection of a vaccine strain that is not antigenically representative of future populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belongia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gouma et al., 2020</xref>) and adaptations of the selected strain to egg-passaging during vaccine production that alter the antigenicity of the resulting vaccine component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zost et al., 2017</xref>). Even when vaccine strains are well-matched antigenically, they may fail to induce a strong immune response due to previous infection history of vaccine recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cobey et al., 2018</xref>). While all of these factors must be addressed to increase vaccine effectiveness, substantial effort has focused on the selection of the most representative strain for the next season’s vaccine.</p><p>Current vaccine predictions focus on the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, which acts as the primary target of human immunity. Until recently, the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay has been the primary experimental measure of antigenic cross-reactivity between pairs of circulating viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirst, 1943</xref>). Most modern H3N2 strains carry a glycosylation motif that reduces their binding efficiency in HI assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zost et al., 2017</xref>), prompting the increased use of virus neutralization assays including the neutralization-based focus reduction assay (FRA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okuno et al., 1990</xref>). Together, these two assays are the gold standard in virus antigenic characterizations for vaccine strain selection, but they are laborious and low-throughput compared to genome sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wood et al., 2012</xref>). As a result, researchers have developed computational methods to predict influenza evolution from sequence data alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Steinbrück et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neher et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite the promise of these sequence-only models, they explicitly omit experimental measurements of antigenic or functional phenotypes. Recent developments in computational methods and influenza virology have made it feasible to integrate these important metrics of influenza fitness into a single predictive model. For example, phenotypic measurements of antigenic drift are now accessible through phylogenetic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neher et al., 2016</xref>) and functional phenotypes for HA are available from deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). We describe an approach to integrate previously disparate sequence-only models of influenza evolution with high-quality experimental measurements of antigenic drift and functional constraint.</p><p>The influenza community has long recognized the importance of incorporating HI phenotypes and other experimental measurements of viral phenotypes with existing forecasting methods to inform the vaccine design process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gandon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morris et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lässig et al., 2017</xref>). Although several distinct efforts have made progress in using HI phenotypes to evaluate the evolution of seasonal influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Steinbrück et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neher et al., 2016</xref>), published methods stop short of developing a complete forecasting framework wherein the evolutionary contribution of HI phenotypes can be compared and contrasted with new and existing fitness metrics. However, unpublished work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref> to the WHO GISRS network incorporates antigenic phenotypes into fitness-based predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morris et al., 2018</xref>; M Łuksza, personal communication, June 2020). Here, we provide an open source framework for forecasting the genetic composition of future seasonal influenza populations using genotypic and phenotypic fitness estimates. We apply this framework to HA sequence data shared via the GISAID EpiFlu database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shu and McCauley, 2017</xref>) and to HI and FRA titer data shared by WHO GISRS Collaborating Centers in London, Melbourne, Atlanta and Tokyo. We systematically compare potential predictors and show that HI phenotypes enable more accurate long-term forecasts of H3N2 populations compared to previous metrics based on epitope mutations alone. We also find that composite models based on phenotypic measures of antigenic drift and genotypic measures of functional constraint consistently outperform any fitness models based on individual genotypic or phenotypic metrics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A distance-based model of seasonal influenza evolution</title><p>We developed a framework to forecast seasonal influenza evolution inspired by the Malthusian growth fitness model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref>. As with this original model, we forecasted the frequencies of viral populations one year in advance by applying to each virus strain an exponential growth factor scaled by an estimate of the strain’s fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref> measured model performance by identifying clades – groups of strains that all share a recent common ancestor – and comparing observed and estimated future clade frequencies. However, as clade definitions are inherently unstable between seasons, we evaluated our models by comparing the genetic composition of observed and estimated future populations with the earth mover’s distance metric. The earth mover’s distance calculates the minimum distance between two populations, given the frequency of each individual within a population and a pairwise ‘ground distance’ between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rubner et al., 1998</xref>). We defined distinct amino acid haplotypes as individuals in our observed and estimated future populations. For frequencies of individuals, we used the observed frequencies of haplotypes in the future and our model’s estimated frequencies. We calculated the ground distance between individuals as the Hamming distance between haplotypes. With this implementation, more accurate projections of the future population’s composition produce smaller earth mover’s distances between the observed and estimated future (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the fitness model for simulated H3N2-like populations wherein the fitness of strains at timepoint <italic>t</italic> determines the estimated frequency of strains with similar sequences one year in the future at timepoint <italic>u</italic>.</title><p>Strains are colored by their amino acid sequence composition such that genetically similar strains have similar colors (Materials and methods).

We calculated the lower bound for each model’s performance as the optimal distance to the future possible given the current sequences at each timepoint. As an additional reference, we evaluated the performance of a ‘naive’ model that predicted the future population would be identical to the current population.

Model forecasts were increasingly more accurate with increasing initial clade frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we counted how often the estimated closest strain to the future population at any given timepoint ranked among the observed top closest strains to the future. We calculated the distance of each present strain to the future as the Hamming distance between the given strain’s amino acid sequence and each future strain weighted by the future strain’s observed or estimated frequency (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3 equ4">Equations 3 and 4)</xref>. The estimated closest strain was in the top first percentile of observed closest strains for half of the validation timepoints and in the top 20th percentile for 100% of timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Percentile ranks per strain based on their observed and estimated distances to the future correlated strongly across all strains and timepoints (Spearman’s <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.87</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In contrast, the naive model’s forecasts of clade frequencies were considerably less accurate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, the naive model’s estimated closest strains to the future were consistently in the top fifth percentile of observed distances to the future and the correlation of its estimated percentile ranks and the observed ranks was strong (Spearman’s <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.78</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B D</xref>). These results suggested that estimating a single closest strain to the future is a more tractable problem than estimating the future frequencies of clades.</p><p>Finally, we tested all of our models on out-of-sample data. Specifically, we fixed the coefficients of each model to the average values across the validation period and applied the resulting models to the next 9 years of previously unobserved simulated data. A standard expectation from machine learning is that models will perform worse on test data due to overfitting to training data. Despite this expectation, we found that all models except for the individual epitope mutation models consistently outperformed the naive model across the out-of-sample data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). The composite model of mutational load and LBI appeared to outperform the true fitness metric with average distance to the future of 7.10 ± 1.19 compared to 7.38 ± 1.89, respectively. However, we did not find a significant difference between these models by bootstrap testing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>) and could not rule out fluctuations in model performance across a relatively small number of data points.</p><p>As with our validation dataset, we tested the true fitness model’s ability to recapitulate clade dynamics and select optimal individual strains from the test data. While observed and estimated clade frequency fold changes correlated more weakly for test data (Pearson’s <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.14</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), the accuracies of clade growth and decline predictions remained similar at 82% and 53%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We observed higher absolute forecast errors in the test data with higher errors for clades between 40% and 60% initial frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The estimated closest strain was higher than the top first percentile of observed closest strains for half of the test timepoints and in the top 20th percentile for 16 (89%) of 18 of timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

These results confirmed that our approach of minimizing the distance between yearly populations could simultaneously capture clade-level dynamics of simulated influenza populations and identify individual strains that are most representative of future populations. However, they also supported the earlier finding that clade frequency forecasts may be inherently more challenging than identification of the closest strain to the future.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Test of best model for simulated populations (true fitness) using 9 years (18 timepoints) of previously unobserved test data and fixed model coefficients.</title><p>These timepoints correspond to the open circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

In addition to the sequence-only models we tested on simulated populations, we also fit models for our new fitness metrics based on experimental phenotypes including HI antigenic novelty and DMS mutational effects. We hypothesized that both HI and DMS metrics would be assigned positive coefficients, as they estimate increased antigenic drift and beneficial mutations, respectively. As antigenic drift is generally considered to be the primary evolutionary pressure on natural H3N2 populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bedford et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref>), we expected that epitope and HI antigenic novelty would be individually more predictive than mutational load or DMS mutational effects. Previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neher et al., 2014</xref>) and our simulation results also led us to expect that LBI and delta frequency would outperform other individual mechanistic metrics.

The epitope antigenic novelty model relies on previously published epitope sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref>). The ‘oracle’ antigenic novelty model relies on sites of beneficial mutations that were manually identified from the entire training and validation time period (Methods). The improved performance of the ‘oracle’ model indicates that the sequence-based antigenic novelty metric can be effective when sites of beneficial mutations are known prior to forecasting.

HI antigenic novelty estimated an average distance to the future of 6.01 ± 1.50 AAs and outperformed the naive model at 16 of 23 timepoints (70%). The coefficient for HI antigenic novelty remained stable across all timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast, epitope antigenic novelty estimated a distance of 7.13 ± 1.47 AAs and only outperformed the naive model at seven timepoints (30%). Epitope antigenic novelty was also the only metric whose coefficient started at a positive value (1.17 ± 0.03 on average prior to October 2009) and transitioned to a negative value through the validation period (−0.19 ± 0.34 on average for October 2009 and after). This strong coefficient for the first half of training windows indicated that, unlike the results for simulated populations, the nonlinear antigenic novelty metric was historically an effective measure of antigenic drift. The historical importance of the epitope sites used for this metric was further supported by the relative enrichment of mutations at these sites for the most successful ‘trunk’ lineages of natural populations compared to side branch lineages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>These results led us to hypothesize that the contribution of these specific epitope sites to antigenic drift has weakened over time. Importantly, these 49 epitope sites were originally selected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref> from a previous historical survey of sites with beneficial mutations between 1968–2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shih et al., 2007</xref>). If the beneficial effects of mutations at these sites were due to historical contingency rather than a constant contribution to antigenic drift, we would expect models based on these sites to perform well until 2005 and then overfit relative to future data. Indeed, the epitope antigenic novelty model outperforms the naive model for the first three validation timepoints until it has to predict to April 2006. To test this hypothesis, we identified a new set of beneficial sites across our entire validation period of October 1990 through October 2015. Inspired by the original approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shih et al., 2007</xref>, we identified 25 sites in HA1 where mutations rapidly swept through the global population, including 12 that were also present in the original set of 49 sites. We fit an antigenic novelty model to these 25 sites across the complete validation period and dubbed this the ‘oracle antigenic novelty’ model, as it benefited from knowledge of the future in its forecasts. The oracle model produced a consistently positive coefficient across all training windows (0.80 ± 0.21) and consistently outperformed the original epitope model with an average distance to the future of 5.71 ± 1.27 AAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results support our hypothesis that the fitness benefit of mutations at the original 49 sites was due to historical contingency and that the success of previous epitope models based on these sites was partly due to ‘borrowing from the future’. We suspect that our HI antigenic novelty model benefits from its ability to constantly update its antigenic model at each timepoint with recent experimental phenotypes, while the epitope antigenic novelty metric is forced to give a constant weight to the same 49 sites throughout time.</p><p>Of the two metrics for functional constraint, mutational load outperformed DMS mutational effects, with an average distance to the future of 6.14 ± 1.37 AAs compared to 6.75 ± 1.95 AAs, respectively. In contrast to the original <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref> model, where the coefficient of the mutational load metric was fixed at −0.5, our model learned a consistently stronger coefficient of −0.99 ± 0.30. Notably, the best performance of the DMS mutational effects model was forecasting from April 2007 to April 2008 when the major clade containing A/Perth/16/2009 was first emerging. This result is consistent with the DMS model overfitting to the evolutionary history of the background strain used to perform the DMS experiments. Alternate implementations of less background-dependent DMS metrics never performed better than the mutational load metric (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>, Materials and methods). Thus, we find that a simple model where any mutation at non-epitope sites is deleterious is more predictive of global viral success than a more comprehensive biophysical model based on measured mutational effects of a single strain.</p><table-wrap id="table6" position="float"><label>Table 6.</label><caption><title>All model coefficients and performance on validation and test data for natural populations ordered from best to worst by distance to the future, as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>.</title><p>Distances annotated with asterisks (*) were significantly closer to the future than the naive model as measured by bootstrap tests (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>).

outperforming the naive model at 17 (74%) timepoints (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>). Delta frequency performed worse than LBI and HI antigenic novelty and was comparable to mutational load. While delta frequency should, in principle, measure the same aspect of viral fitness as LBI, these results show that the current implementations of these metrics represent qualitatively different fitness components. The LBI and mutational load might also be predictive for reasons other than correlation with fitness, see Discussion.</p><p>To test whether composite models could outperform individual fitness metrics for natural populations, we fit models based on combinations of best individual metrics representing antigenic drift, functional constraint, and clade growth. Specifically, we fit models based on HI antigenic novelty and mutational load, mutational load and LBI, and all three of these metrics together. We anticipated that if these metrics all represented distinct, mutually beneficial components of viral fitness, these composite models should perform better than individual models with consistent coefficients for each metric.</p><p>Both two-metric composite models modestly outperformed their corresponding individual models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). The composite of mutational load and LBI performed the best overall with an average distance to the future of 5.44 ± 1.80 AAs. The relative stability of the coefficients for the metrics in the two-metric models suggested that these metrics represented complementary components of viral fitness. In contrast, the three-metric model strongly preferred the HI antigenic novelty and mutational load metrics over LBI for the entire validation period, producing an average LBI coefficient of −0.04 ± 0.09. Overall, the gain by combining multiple predictors was limited and the sensitivity of coefficients to the set of metrics included in the model suggests that there is substantial overlap in predictive value of different metrics.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Natural population model coefficients and distances to the future for composite fitness metrics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coefficients and (<bold>B</bold>) distances are shown per validation timepoint (N = 23) and test timepoint (N = 8) as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

The composite model of mutational load and LBI effectively captured clade dynamics with a fold change correlation of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.35</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and growth and decline accuracies of 87% and 89%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Absolute forecasting error declined noticeably for clades with initial frequencies above 60%, but generally this error remained below 20% on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The estimated closest strain from this model was in the top first percentile of observed closest strains for half of the validation timepoints and in the top 20th percentile for 20 (87%) of 23 timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This pattern held across all strains and timepoints with a strong correlation between observed and estimated strain ranks (Spearman’s <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.66</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The naive model’s performance repeated the pattern we observed with simulated populations: it made poor forecasts of absolute clade frequencies, but its estimated closest strains to the future were consistently highly ranked among the observed closest strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2B C</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested the performance of all models on out-of-sample data collected from October 1, 2015 through October 1, 2019. We anticipated that most models would perform worse on truly out-of-sample data than on validation data. Correspondingly, only the three models with the HI antigenic novelty metric significantly outperformed the naive model on the test data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>). The composite of HI antigenic novelty and mutational load performed modestly, although not significantly, better than the individual HI antigenic novelty model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). Surprisingly, the best model for the validation data – mutational load and LBI – was one of the worst models for the test data with an average distance to the future of 7.70 ± 3.53 AAs. The individual LBI model was the worst model, while mutational load continued to perform well with test data. LBI performed especially poorly in the last two test timepoints of April and October 2018 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These timepoints correspond to the dominance and sudden decline of a reassortant clade named A2/re (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Potter et al., 2019</xref>). By April 2018, the A2/re clade had risen to a global frequency over 50% from less than 15% the previous year, despite an absence of antigenic drift. By October 2018, this clade had declined in frequency to approximately 30% and, by October 2019, it had gone extinct. That LBI incorrectly predicted the success of this reassortant clade highlights a major limitation of growth-based fitness metrics and a corresponding benefit of more mechanistic metrics that explicitly measure antigenic drift and functional constraint. However, we cannot rule out the alternate possibility that the LBI model was overfit to the training data.</p><p>After identifying the composite HI antigenic novelty and mutational load model as the best model on out-of-sample data, we tested this model’s ability to detect clade dynamics and select individual closest strains to the future for vaccine composition.

The estimated closest strain from this model was in the top first percentile of observed closest strains for half of the validation timepoints and in the top 20th percentile for 100% of timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).

For each season when the WHO selected a new vaccine strain and one year of future data existed in our validation or test periods, we measured the observed distance of that strain’s sequence to the future and the corresponding distances to the future for the observed closest strains (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>). We compared these distances to those of the closest strains to the future as estimated by our best models for the validation period (mutational load and LBI) and the test period (HI antigenic novelty and mutational load) using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref>. The observed closest strain to the future represents the centroid of the observed future population, while the estimated closest strains are the models’ predictions of that future population’s centroid. The mutational load and LBI model selected strains that were as close or closer to the future than the corresponding vaccine strain for 10 (83%) of the 12 seasons with vaccine updates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). On average, the strains selected by this model were closer to future than the vaccine strain by 1.93 AAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the two seasons that the model selected more distant strains than the vaccine strain, the mean distance relative to the vaccine strain was 1.58 AAs. The HI antigenic novelty and mutational load model performed similarly by identifying strains as close or closer to the future for 11 (92%) seasons with an average improvement over the vaccine strains of 2.33 AAs. For the one season that the model selected a more distant strain, that selected strain was 0.75 AAs farther from the future than the vaccine strain. Interestingly, the strains selected by the naive model were always better than the selected vaccine strain. Since the naive model predicts that the future will be identical to the present, these strains represent the centroid of each current population. With an average improvement over the vaccine strains of 2.19 AAs, the naive model performed consistently better than the LBI-based model and nearly as well as the HI-based model. These results were consistent with our earlier observations that the naive model often performs as well as biologically-informed models when estimating a single closest strain to the future.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Observed distance to natural H3N2 populations one year into the future for each vaccine strain (green) and the observed (blue) and estimated closest strains to the future by the mutational load and LBI model (orange), the HI antigenic novelty and mutational load model (purple), and the naive model (black).</title><p>Vaccine strains were assigned to the validation or test timepoint closest to the date they were selected by the WHO.

Prior to finalizing our model coefficients for use in Nextstrain, we tested whether our three best composite models could be improved by learning new coefficients per timepoint from the test data. Additionally, we evaluated a composite of FRA antigenic novelty and mutational load. Since the earliest FRA data were from 2012, we anticipated that there were enough measurements to fit a model across the test data time interval. If modern H3N2 strains continue to perform poorly in HI assays, the FRA-based assay will be critical for future forecasting efforts.</p><p>Two of three models performed worse after refitting coefficients to the test data than their original fixed coefficient implementations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). While, the mutational load and LBI model improved considerably over its original performance, it still performed worse than the naive model on average. These results confirmed that the coefficients for our selected best model would be most accurate for live forecasts. Interestingly, the FRA antigenic novelty metric received a consistently positive coefficient of 1.40 ± 0.24 in its composite with mutational load. Unfortunately, this model performed considerably worse than the corresponding HI-based model.

A key innovation of this framework is its ability to directly compare viral populations between seasons using the earth mover’s distance metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rubner et al., 1998</xref>) and eliminate unavoidably stochastic clade definitions from phylogenies. The best models from this framework still effectively capture clade dynamics and accurately identify optimal vaccine candidates from simulated and natural H3N2 populations without relying on clades as model targets. We have further introduced novel fitness metrics based on experimental measurements of antigenic drift and functional constraint. We demonstrated that the integration of these phenotypic metrics with previously published sequence-only metrics produces more accurate forecasts than sequence-only models. Interestingly, we found that a naive model that predicts no change over the course of one year can often identify a single representative strain of the future despite its inability to accurately forecast clade frequencies. We have added this framework as a component of seasonal influenza analyses on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nextstrain.org/">nextstrain.org</ext-link> where it provides real-time forecasts for influenza researchers, decision makers, and the public.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Integration of genotypic and phenotypic metrics minimizes overfitting</title><p>Our evaluation of models by time-series cross-validation and true out-of-sample forecasts revealed substantial potential for model overfitting. We observed overfitting to both specific genetic backgrounds and general historical contexts. A clear example of the former was the poor performance of our DMS-based fitness metric compared to a simpler mutational load metric. Although the DMS experiments provided detailed estimates of which amino acids were preferred at which positions in HA, these measurements were specific to a single strain, A/Perth/16/2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). When we applied these measurements to predict the success of global populations, they were less informative on average than the naive model. To benefit from the more comprehensive fitness costs measured by DMS data, future models will need to synthesize DMS measurements across multiple H3N2 strains from distinct genetic contexts. We anticipate that these measurements could be used to define and continually update a modern set of sites contributing to mutational load in natural populations. This set of sites could replace the statically defined set of ‘non-epitope’ sites we use to estimate mutational load here.</p><p>We observed overfitting to historical context in sequence-based models of antigenic drift. The fitness benefit of mutations that led to antigenic drift in H3N2 in the past is well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wiley et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wolf et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koel et al., 2013</xref>). Although the antigenic importance of seven specific sites in HA were experimentally validated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koel et al., 2013</xref>, these sites do not explain all antigenic drift observed in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neher et al., 2016</xref>). Other attempts to define these so-called ‘epitope sites’ have relied on either aggregation of results from antigenic escape assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wolf et al., 2006</xref>) or retrospective computational analyses of sites with beneficial mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shih et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref>). We found that models based on all of these definitions except for the seven Koel epitope sites overfit to the historical context from which they were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>). These results suggest that the set of sites that contribute to antigenic drift at any given time may depend on both the fitness landscape of currently circulating strains and the immune landscape of the hosts these strains need to infect. Recent experimental mapping of antigenic escape mutations in H3N2 HA with human sera show that the specific sites that confer antigenic escape can vary dramatically between individuals based on their exposure history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast to models based on predefined ‘epitope sites’, our model based on experimental measurements of antigenic drift did not suffer from overfitting in the validation or test periods. We suspect that this model was able to minimize overfitting by continuously updating its antigenic model with recent experimental data and assigning antigenic weight to branches of a phylogeny rather than specific positions in HA.</p><p>Even the most accurate models with few parameters will sometimes fail due to the probabilistic nature of evolution. For example, the model with the best performance across our validation data – mutational load and LBI – was also one of the worst models across our test data. Although we cannot rule out the role of overfitting, this model’s poor performance coincided with unusual evolutionary circumstances. The diversity of H3N2 lineages during our test period was higher than the historical average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koelle et al., 2006</xref>), with the most recent common ancestor of all circulating strains dating eight years back. This persistence of diversity may have reduced the effectiveness of the LBI metric that assumes relatively rapid population turnover. Additionally, this model’s poorest performance occurred in 2019 when it failed to predict the sudden decline of a dominant reassortant clade, A2/re. Only our models based on HI antigenic novelty and mutational load continued to perform as well or better than the naive model during the same time period. These results highlight the challenge of identifying models that remain robust to stochastic evolutionary events by avoiding overfitting to the past.</p><p>Correspondingly, we observed that composite models of multiple orthogonal fitness metrics often outperformed models based on their individual components. These results are consistent with previous work that found improved performance by integrating components of antigenic drift, functional constraint, and clade growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref>). However, the effective elimination of LBI from our three-metric model during the validation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) reveals the limitations of our current additive approach to composite models. The recent success of weighted ensembles for short-term influenza forecasting through the CDC’s FluSight network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reich et al., 2019</xref>) suggests that long-term forecasting may benefit from a similar approach.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Forecasting framework aids practical forecasts</title><p>By forecasting the composition of future H3N2 populations with biologically-informed fitness metrics, our best models consistently outperformed a naive model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>). While this performance confirms previously demonstrated potential for long-term influenza forecasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref>), the average gain from these models over the naive model appears low at 0.96 AAs per year for validation data and 0.85 AAs per year for test data. However, these results are consistent with the observed dynamics of H3N2. First, the one-year forecast horizon is a fraction of the average coalescence time for H3N2 populations of about 3–8 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rambaut et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, we expect the diversity of circulating strains to persist between seasons. Second, H3N2 hemagglutinin accumulates 3.6 amino acid changes per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). This accumulation of amino acid substitutions contributes to the distance between annual populations observed by the naive model. In this context, our model gains of 0.96 and 0.85 AAs per year correspond to an explanation of 27% and 24% of the expected additional distance between annual populations, respectively.</p><p>Several clear opportunities to improve forecasts still remain. Integration of more recent experimental data may improve estimates of antigenic drift. Despite the weak performance of our FRA antigenic novelty model on recent data, continued accumulation of FRA measurements over time should eventually enable models as accurate as the current HI-based models. In addition to these FRA data based on ferret antisera, recent high-throughput antigenic escape assays with human sera promise to improve existing definitions of epitope sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). These assays reveal the specific sites and residues that confer antigenic escape from polyclonal sera obtained from individual humans. A sufficiently broad geographic and temporal sample of human sera with these assays could reveal consistent patterns of the immune landscape H3N2 strains must navigate to be globally successful. Models should also integrate information from multiple segments of the influenza genome and will need to balance the fitness benefits of evolution in genes such as neuraminidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) with the costs of reassortment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Villa and Lässig, 2017</xref>). Our forecasting framework makes the inclusion of fitness metrics based on additional gene segments technically straightforward. However, the definition of appropriate fitness metrics for neuraminidase and other genes remains an important scientific challenge. An additional challenge to model training is a relative lack of historical strains for which all genes have been sequenced. Of the 34,312 H3N2 strains in GISAID with all eight primary gene segments and collection dates between October 1, 1990 and 2019, the majority (24,466 or 71%) were collected after October 1, 2015. Data availability will therefore inform which gene segments are prioritized for inclusion in future models. Finally, forecasting models need to account for the geographic distribution of viruses and the vastly different sampling intensities across the globe. Most influenza sequence data come from highly developed countries that account for a small fraction of the global population, while globally successful clades of influenza H3N2 often emerge in less well-sampled regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Russell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rambaut et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedford et al., 2015</xref>). Explicitly accounting for these sampling biases and the associated migration dynamics would allow models to weight forecasts based on both viral fitness and transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The nature of the predictive power of individual metrics remains unclear</title><p>Prediction of future influenza virus populations is intrinsically limited by the small number of data points available to train and test models. Increasingly more complex models are therefore prone to overfitting. Across the validation and test periods, we found that antigenic drift and mutational load were the most robust predictors of future success for seasonal influenza H3N2 populations.</p><p>Several metrics like the rate of frequency change or epitope mutations are naively expected to have predictive power but do not. Others metrics like the mutational load are not expected to measure adaptation but are predictive. These results point to one aspect that often overlooked when comparing the genetic make-up of an asexual population at two time points: the future population is unlikely to descend from any of the sampled tips but ancestral lineages of the future population merge with those of the present population in the past. Optimal representatives of the future therefore tend to be tips in the present that tend to be basal and less evolved. The LBI and the mutational load metric have the tendency to assign low fitness to evolved tips. The LBI in particular assigns high fitness to the base of large clades. Much of the predictive power, in the sense of a reduced distance between the predicted and observed populations, might be due to putting more weight on less evolved strains rather than <italic>bona fide</italic> prediction of fitness. In a companion manuscript, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barrat-Charlaix et al., 2020</xref> show that LBI has little predictive power for fixation probabilities of mutations in H3N2.</p><p>Our framework enables real-time practical forecasts of these populations by leveraging historical and modern experimental assays and gene sequences. By releasing our framework as an open source tool based on modern data science standards like tidy data frames, we hope to encourage continued development of this tool by the influenza research community. We additionally anticipate that the ability to forecast the sequence composition of populations with earth mover’s distance will enable future forecasting research with pathogens whose genomes cannot be analyzed by traditional phylogenetic methods including recombinant viruses, bacteria, and fungi.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Model sharing and extensions</title><p>The entire workflow for our analyses was implemented with Snakemake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Köster and Rahmann, 2012</xref>).

We discarded the first 10 years as a burn-in period, selected the next 30 years for model fitting and validation, and held out the last 9 years as out-of-sample data for model testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Each simulated population was seeded with the full length HA from A/Beijing/32/1992 (NCBI accession: U26830.1) such that all simulated sequences contained signal peptide, HA1, and HA2 domains. We defined purifying selection across all three domains, allowing the preferred amino acid at each site to change at a fixed rate over time. We additionally defined exposure-dependent selection for 49 putative epitope sites in HA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref>) to impose an effect of antigenic novelty that would allow mutations at those sites to increase viral fitness despite underlying purifying selection.

We simulated populations, as described above, and fit models for each parameter value using the true fitness of strains from the simulator.</p><p>We identified the optimal KDE bandwidth for frequencies as the value that minimized the difference between the mean distances to the future from the true fitness model and the naive model. We set the L1 lambda penalty to zero, to reduce variables in the analysis and avoid interactions between the coefficients and the KDE bandwidths. Higher bandwidths completely wash out dynamics of populations by making all strains appear to exist for long time periods. This flattening of frequency trajectories means that as bandwidths increase, the naive model gets more accurate and less informative. Given this behavior, we found the bandwidth that produced the minimum difference between distances to the future for the true fitness and naive models instead of the bandwidth that produced the minimum mean model distance. Based on this analysis, we identified an optimal bandwidth of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mn>12</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula> or the equivalent of 2 months for floating point dates.

For strains with less than full length nucleotide sequences, we inferred missing nucleotides through TreeTime’s ancestral sequence reconstruction analysis. We defined weights for strains at timepoint <italic>t</italic> based on their projected future frequencies. We defined weights for strains at timepoint <italic>u</italic> based on their observed frequencies. We then identified the fitness coefficients that provided projected future frequencies that minimized the EMD between the estimated and observed future populations. With this metric, a perfect estimate of the future’s strain sequence composition and frequencies would produce a distance of zero. However, the inevitable accumulation of substitutions between the two populations prevents this outcome. We calculated EMD with the Python bindings for the OpenCV 3.4.1 implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradski, 2000</xref>). We applied the Nelder-Mead minimization algorithm as implemented in SciPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>) to learn fitness coefficients that minimize the average of this distance metric over all timepoints in a given training window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Lower bound on earth mover’s distance</title><p>The minimum distance to the future between any two timepoints cannot be zero due to the accumulation of mutations between populations. We estimated the lower bound on earth mover’s distance between timepoints using the following greedy solution to the optimal transport problem.

For each strain in the future timepoint <italic>u</italic>, we identified the closest strain in the current timepoint by Hamming distance and added the frequency of the future strain to the optimal frequency of the corresponding current strain. This approach allows each strain from timepoint <italic>t</italic> to accumulate frequencies from multiple strains at timepoint <italic>u</italic>.

We partitioned our training and validation data into six month seasons corresponding to winter in the Northern Hemisphere (October–April) and the Southern Hemisphere (April–October) and trained models to estimate frequencies of populations one year into the future from each season in six-year sliding windows. To calculate validation error for each training window, we applied the resulting model coefficients to estimate the future frequencies for the year after the last timepoint in the training window. These validation errors informed our tuning of hyperparameters. Finally, we fixed the coefficients for each model at the mean values across all training windows and applied these fixed models to the test data to estimate the true forecasting accuracy of each model on previously unobserved data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-6"><title>Model comparison by bootstrap tests</title><p>We compared the performance of different pairs of models using bootstrap tests. For each timepoint, we calculated the difference between one model’s earth mover’s distance to the future and the other model’s distance.

To determine whether the first model generally outperformed the second model, we bootstrapped the empirical difference distributions for n = 10,000 samples and calculated the mean difference of each bootstrap sample. We calculated an empirical p value for the first model as the proportion of bootstrap samples with mean values greater than or equal to zero. This p value represents how likely the mean difference between the models’ distances to the future is to be zero or greater. We measured the effect size of each comparison as the mean ±the standard deviation of the bootstrap distributions.

Briefly, for each pair of strains in adjacent seasons, we counted the number of amino acid differences between the strains’ HA sequences at 49 epitope sites. The one-based coordinates of these sites relative to the start of the HA1 segment were 50, 53, 54, 121, 122, 124, 126, 131, 133, 135, 137, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 163, 164, 172, 173, 174, 186, 188, 189, 190, 192, 193, 196, 197, 201, 207, 213, 217, 226, 227, 242, 244, 248, 275, 276, 278, 299, and 307.

Following the general approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shih et al., 2007</xref>, we manually identified 25 sites in HA1 where mutations rapidly swept through the global population. We required mutations to emerge from below 5% global frequency and reach &gt; 90% frequency. Although we did not require sweeps to complete within a fixed amount of time, we observed that they required no longer than one to three years to complete. To minimize false positives, we eliminated any sites where one or more mutations rose above 20% frequency and subsequently died out. If two or more sites had redundant sweep dynamics (mutations emerging and fixing at the same times), we retained the site with the most mutational sweeps. Based on this requirements, we defined our final collection of ‘oracle’ sites in HA1 coordinates as 3, 45, 48, 50, 75, 140, 145, 156, 158, 159, 173, 186, 189, 193, 198, 202, 212, 222, 223, 225, 226, 227, 278, 311, and 312.</p><p>To estimate antigenic drift with HI data, we first applied the titer tree model to the phylogeny at a given timepoint and the corresponding HI data for its strains, as previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neher et al., 2016</xref>.

Finally, we calculated each strain’s ability to escape cross-immunity using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref> with the pairwise distances between epitope sequences replaced with pairwise antigenic distance from HI data.

For both metrics, we calculated the distance between HA amino acid sequences of each strain and its ancestral sequence in the previous season, to enable comparison of these metrics with the DMS mutational effects and mutational load metrics. For the ‘DMS entropy’ metric, we calculated the distance between sequences such that each mismatch was weighted by the inverse entropy of DMS preferences at the site of the mismatch. We expected this metric to produce a negative coefficient similar to the mutational load metric, as higher values will result from mutations at sites with lower entropy and, thus, lower tolerance for mutations. For the ‘DMS mutational load’ metric, we defined a novel set of non-epitope sites corresponding to each position in HA with a standardized entropy less than zero. With this metric, we sought to identify more highly conserved sites without weighting any one site differently from others. We anticipated that this lack of site-specific weighting would make the DMS mutational load metric even less background-dependent than the DMS entropy and DMS mutational effect metrics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Clade growth</title><p>We estimated clade growth for each strain using local branching index (LBI) and the change in frequency over time (delta frequency).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and George Perry as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below address clarity and presentation and would strengthen an already promising manuscript.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a monumental effort to compare methods of predicting H3 evolution. The study demonstrates the value of composite, open-source models that integrate multiple types of genetic and phenotypic data. And it is particularly valuable for understanding the context under which different models and types of data perform better. Interestingly they find that HI titers combined with sequence-based mutational load provide the best predictive power. Along the way, the study also uncovers insights about the forces behind influenza evolution that are interesting in their own right. The exploration into why previously identified epitopes fail to predict modern patterns of evolution explains why HI is a better predictor. But it also highlights the flexibility of HA antigenicity and the volatility of the human immune landscape. Overall, the study highlights the sobering complexity of predicting H3 evolution in a variable and changing human immune landscape and the need for multiple strategies and forms of data integration to improve composite models going forward. This is interesting work for anyone interested in predicting evolution.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be helpful to further explore model performance in different contexts.</p><p>a) Overall, do the models perform any better or worse at predicting Northern v Southern hemisphere viruses populations?</p><p>b) I'm surprised the authors don't discuss more the recent problem of multiple H3 cocirculating clades (observed in Figure 9). Predicting H3 evolution has always been difficult, but at least there was generally a linear tree and a single dominant H3 clade at any given time. Did certain models better predict the emergence and persistence of this tree pattern? Do they offer insights?</p><p>2) Given that this study tackles a very real world problem (selecting strains for influenza vaccines), it would be helpful to have these results better translated for readers with public health backgrounds.</p><p>a) A simple addition would be an opening table/chart that describes the different models and categorizes them (lab data, sequence-based, tree-based etc.)</p><p>b) Figure 8 nicely visualizes model performance against actual vaccine strains. But can you quantify/summarize the results in this figure better (i.e., exactly how much 'closer' to the future than the vaccine strain?). Perhaps also including additional models in those measures?</p><p>c) In the Introduction can you provide more context for this study? What is the current range of influenza vaccine effectiveness? How frequent are H3 mismatches? And how well have we been trending at matching H3 vaccine strains to H3s in circulation? Are we making any discernible progress? Or have improvements in modeling been offset by the H3 cocirculating clades problem?</p><p>d) A key message from this study is how challenging prediction H3 is, even with new analysis tools and new types of experimental data. We have so much further to go. It's worth highlighting in the Discussion how CDC FluSight has collectively advanced epi flu forecasting by making weighted ensembles drawn from multiple modeling groups and how valuable a similar program would be for vaccine strain selection.</p><p>3) Some epitopes are more important than others. Did you consider weighting epitopes differently? Or would that just exacerbate overfitting? And how do you handle glycosylations in the model?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60067.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be helpful to further explore model performance in different contexts.</p><p>a) Overall, do the models perform any better or worse at predicting Northern v Southern hemisphere viruses populations?</p></disp-quote><p>We investigated whether our best model, HI antigenic novelty and mutational load, projected better estimates of the future for the Northern Hemisphere (forecasts made in October) or the Southern Hemisphere (forecasts made in April).

Did certain models better predict the emergence and persistence of this tree pattern? Do they offer insights?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this was an oversight on our part to not mention the unusual diversity of H3N2 clades in the last decade. We have modified the following paragraph in the Discussion to mention this pattern and its potential role in the performance of our models:</p><p>“Even the most accurate models with few parameters will sometimes fail due to the probabilistic nature of evolution. […] These results highlight the challenge of identifying models that remain robust to stochastic evolutionary events by avoiding overfitting to the past.”</p><p>As we note in this new text, we cannot disentangle model overfitting from changes in underlying evolutionary processes. This limitation unfortunately prevents us from identifying models that predicted the emergence or persistence of H3N2's current diversity. However, we can identify the models that are most robust to both overfitting and evolutionary change. We hope that this revised text clarifies these complexities and the reasons for selecting the HI antigenic novelty and mutational load model as our best model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given that this study tackles a very real world problem (selecting strains for influenza vaccines), it would be helpful to have these results better translated for readers with public health backgrounds.</p><p>a) A simple addition would be an opening table/chart that describes the different models and categorizes them (lab data, sequence-based, tree-based etc.)</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a table to the first section of the Results (Table 1) as a summary of all primary models used with the simulated and natural populations. We reference this new table from the initial list of models in the same section (subsection “A distance-based model of seasonal influenza evolution”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Figure 8 nicely visualizes model performance against actual vaccine strains. But can you quantify/summarize the results in this figure better (i.e., exactly how much 'closer' to the future than the vaccine strain?). Perhaps also including additional models in those measures?</p></disp-quote><p>To better represent and quantify how much closer to the future the observed and estimated closest strains are than the selected vaccine strains, we calculated the distance to the future of these strains relative to the vaccine strain at the corresponding timepoints and plotted these values in a new figure supplement (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). Strains with relative distances greater than zero were farther from the future than the vaccine strain. We have also added the closest strain selected by the naive model to Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1, as an additional reference point for the strains selected by biologically-informed models.</p><p>We have updated the corresponding section of the Results to include a clearer description of how these closest strains are calculated, what they represent, and how much closer to the future each strain is than the vaccine strain:</p><p>“For each season when the WHO selected a new vaccine strain and one year of future data existed in our validation or test periods, we measured the observed distance of that strain’s sequence to the future and the corresponding distances to the future for the observed closest strains (Equation 3). […] These results were consistent with our earlier observations that the naive model often performs as well as biologically-informed models when estimating a single closest strain to the future.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) In the Introduction can you provide more context for this study? What is the current range of influenza vaccine effectiveness? How frequent are H3 mismatches? And how well have we been trending at matching H3 vaccine strains to H3s in circulation? Are we making any discernible progress? Or have improvements in modeling been offset by the H3 cocirculating clades problem?</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the Introduction, splitting the first paragraph into two paragraphs (the first introducing seasonal influenza A/H3N2 and the second introducing predictive methods) and adding a new paragraph in between that summarizes vaccine effectiveness for H3N2 and factors affecting this effectiveness. This new paragraph is included below:</p><p><bold>“</bold>Historically, the vaccine effectiveness of the H3N2 vaccine component has been much lower than the other seasonal influenza subtypes. […] While all of these factors must be addressed to increase vaccine effectiveness, substantial effort has focused on the selection of the most representative strain for the next season’s vaccine.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) A key message from this study is how challenging prediction H3 is, even with new analysis tools and new types of experimental data. We have so much further to go. It's worth highlighting in the Discussion how CDC FluSight has collectively advanced epi flu forecasting by making weighted ensembles drawn from multiple modeling groups and how valuable a similar program would be for vaccine strain selection.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the following sentence in the Discussion to explicitly mention the CDC’s FluSight network:</p><p>“The recent success of weighted ensembles for short-term influenza forecasting through the CDC’s FluSight network (Reich et al., 2019) suggests that long-term forecasting may benefit from a similar approach.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some epitopes are more important than others. Did you consider weighting epitopes differently? Or would that just exacerbate overfitting? And how do you handle glycosylations in the model?</p></disp-quote><p>Prior to our discovery of overfitting related to previously defined epitope sites, we had planned to test models fit to weighted epitope sites (for example, assigning more weight to Koel et al.’s seven sites than others). In light of model performance based on unweighted sites, we reasoned that weighting sites would most likely increase overfitting.</p><p>We chose not to fit models based on glycosylation sites based on two lines of reasoning. As these sites accumulate slowly in H3N2 relative to epitope mutations (six sites between 1968 and 2012), we expected there would not be a strong signal in year-to-year forecasts despite the biological importance of these events when they do occur. We also considered the results of Łuksza and Lässig’s original analysis which found that adding glycosylation sites did not improve their full fitness model and that these sites appeared correlated with epitope mutations.</p><p>As we briefly describe in the Discussion, we anticipate that antigenic escape assays like those presented in Lee et al., 2019, could allow us to identify and weigh contemporary epitope sites. How to effectively translate these antigenic escape data to fitness metrics is an active area of research in the Bedford lab.</p></body></sub-article></article>
