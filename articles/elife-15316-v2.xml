access specific DNA elements. To gain insight into nucleosome dynamics, and to follow how dynamics change during differentiation, we used a technique called time-ChIP to quantitatively assess histone H3.3 turnover genome-wide during differentiation of mouse ESCs. We found that, without prior assumptions, high turnover could be used to identify regions involved in gene regulation. High turnover was seen at enhancers, as observed previously, with particularly high turnover at super-enhancers. In contrast, regions associated with the repressive Polycomb-Group showed low turnover in ESCs. Turnover correlated with DNA accessibility. Upon differentiation, numerous changes in H3.3 turnover rates were observed, the majority of which occurred at enhancers. Thus, time-ChIP measurement of histone turnover shows that active enhancers are unusually dynamic in ESCs and changes in highly dynamic nucleosomes predominate at enhancers during differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15316.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15316.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15316.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In animal, plant and other eukaryotic cells, DNA wraps around histone proteins to form structures called nucleosomes. This compacts long strands of DNA to fit them inside a cell. However, nucleosomes also act as barriers that can prevent access to the DNA. This affects the activity, or “expression”, of genes because gene expression requires proteins called transcription factors to bind to specific DNA regions. Therefore, nucleosomes must be disrupted or removed in order to access their DNA and allow their genes to be expressed.</p><p>Transcription factors can bind to DNA sequences called enhancers to activate nearby genes. Groups of enhancers, called super-enhancers, also exist to further bolster the activity of certain genes, particularly those involved in determining cell identity. Recent work has shown that nucleosomes are frequently lost and then replaced by new ones (in a process referred to as turnover) in DNA regions that include enhancers. Measuring the rate of turnover of nucleosomes can thus provide information about which DNA regions regulate gene expression.</p><p>Embryonic stem cells can transform or “differentiate” into any type of cell in the body. During this transformation process, different genes are switched on or off in the cell in order to give it a new identity. It is not known how nucleosome turnover changes when this happens.</p><p>Deaton et al. have now developed a new method called time-ChIP that can measure the rate of nucleosome turnover across the entire DNA of a cell. Using this technique to analyze mouse embryonic stem cells revealed that nucleosome turnover occurs rapidly at enhancers. Furthermore, nucleosomes at super-enhancers are particularly dynamic and turn over more quickly than in any other DNA region.</p><p>Deaton et al. next analyzed how turnover changes after the mouse embryonic stem cells have developed into neural stem cells. This revealed that the regions of DNA where high turnover occurs change as the cells differentiate, in part because this transformation activates a different set of enhancers. However, the most rapid turnover still takes place at enhancers.</p><p>Overall, these observations suggest that the high rate of nucleosome turnover at enhancers makes DNA accessible to transcription factors. The next step is to use the new time-ChIP method to study how nucleosome turnover changes during the processes that pattern gene expression as an animal develops from an embryo.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15316.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15316.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>histone H3.3</kwd><kwd>turnover</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01 GM48405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kingston</surname><given-names>Robert E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIA-PRO/100537/2008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jansen</surname><given-names>Lars ET</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/33567/2008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gómez-Rodríguez</surname><given-names>Mariluz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>installation grant 1818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jansen</surname><given-names>Lars ET</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2013-CoG-615638</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jansen</surname><given-names>Lars ET</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nucleosomes at enhancers are unusually dynamic and change histone turnover rates during differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The organization of the genome into chromatin acts as a mechanism for regulating access to the information encoded in DNA. The simplest repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome consisting of a histone octamer, made up of two copies each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, around which approximately 147 bp of DNA is wrapped. Variants of the histone proteins exist that have distinct incorporation dynamics and functions. These include a number of histone H2A variants such as H2A.Z, H2A.X and macroH2A and histone H3 variants such as H3.3 and CENP-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maze et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Skene and Henikoff, 2013</xref>).</p><p>As nucleosomes can act as barriers to reading the DNA sequence, they must be disrupted in order for many processes requiring DNA access to occur. Transcription and the binding of proteins to regulatory regions are known to be dependent upon increased accessibility to nucleosomal DNA. Therefore, assessment of nucleosome turnover can provide important information concerning which genomic regions are involved in regulation and the extent to which nucleosome dynamics contribute to their function.</p><p>Nucleosome dynamics is a generally underexplored property of chromatin. Previous studies examining nucleosome turnover genome-wide have made use of two main strategies – induction of epitope-tagged histone transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kraushaar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yildirim et al., 2014</xref>) and metabolic labeling of histone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deal et al., 2010</xref>). These have yielded a number of insights into the genome-wide pattern of nucleosome turnover in Drosophila and mammalian systems. Such insights include high nucleosome turnover at gene bodies, regulatory elements and replication origins in Drosophila cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deal et al., 2010</xref>) and, in mouse cells, rapid deposition of H3.3-containing nucleosomes at enhancers and promoters associated with active histone modification marks and the histone variant H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kraushaar et al., 2013</xref>). However, each set of techniques has limitations. For example, systems based on inducible histones have a lag time after induction before histones are synthesized and incorporated into chromatin. In addition, they mainly look at where newly synthesized histones are deposited rather than disruption of existing histones. A TET-OFF system examining dissociation of tagged histones has recently been described although a significant proportion of tagged histone is observed up to 12 hr after addition of doxycycline, limiting the sensitivity of this technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ha et al., 2014</xref>). Metabolic labeling methods such as 'CATCH-IT', on the other hand, are not specific for particular histone variants and have limited resolution at the level of individual genes. CATCH-IT analyzes incorporation rates rather than existing histones and cannot be employed for long chase times.</p><p>To circumvent these limitations, we have employed a newly developed method called time-ChIP (Gómez-Rodríguez et al., submitted) to assess histone turnover genome-wide during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to neural stem cells (NSCs). Time-ChIP is based on SNAP technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keppler et al., 2003</xref>), where histones are tagged with the suicide enzyme SNAP. Pulse labeling with a SNAP-tag specific biotin moiety leads to covalent biotinylation of the SNAP-tagged histone pool. Histone dynamics can then be determined by following the loss of biotin-labeled histones over time as nucleosomes are disrupted and replaced with nucleosomes comprised of newly synthesized unlabeled histones. Sequencing of the DNA associated with these biotinylated histones allowed us to quantify relative histone turnover genome-wide. Previous studies using SNAP-tagged histones suggest that they are recognized by the correct chaperone proteins and incorporated into chromatin at the appropriate cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dunleavy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foltz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ray-Gallet et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Time-ChIP allows labeling of existing, incorporated histones, is specific for particular histone variants and allows us to study histone dynamics in vivo. We focused on measuring turnover of the histone variant H3.3. In contrast to canonical H3, histone H3.3 is deposited independently of replication at places where nucleosomes are disrupted such as promoters, the bodies of active genes, and regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwartz and Ahmad, 2005</xref>). Therefore examining this variant is likely to yield insights into the dynamics at regions important for gene regulation.</p><p>To examine H3.3 turnover at developmental loci and regulatory elements, and understand how turnover changes during cell specification, we applied time-ChIP to neural differentiation of mouse ESCs. We found that time-ChIP could be used a priori to identify regions important for gene regulation; specifically, enhancer regions stood out for their rapid turnover. In ESCs, consistent with previous work, we found high H3.3 turnover at active enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kraushaar et al., 2013</xref>) with even higher rates of turnover observed at super-enhancers. We also observed high turnover of histone H3.1 at these regions. Regions bound by Polycomb-group proteins, which are involved in developmental gene repression, showed H3.3 enrichment in ESCs but low turnover compared to active regions. Upon differentiation to NSCs, many changes in H3.3 turnover were observed, with ESC and NSC enhancers overrepresented in the set of regions showing changes. We corroborated our time-ChIP findings by correlating H3.3 turnover with DNA accessibility measured by micrococcal nuclease (MNase) titration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mieczkowski et al., 2016</xref>) and found good correlation at enhancers and other active regions. Our findings demonstrate the utility of time-ChIP for profiling H3.3 turnover during differentiation, for determining relative rates of turnover at regulatory elements, and for characterizing known and potentially novel regulatory regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Time-ChIP reports histone H3.3 turnover genome-wide</title><p>We used time-ChIP to assess histone H3.3 turnover genome-wide in ESCs in an unbiased manner. To do this, we used a SNAP-tagged histone H3.3 which can be labeled with fluorescent or biotin-containing substrates in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ray-Gallet et al., 2011</xref>). We generated ESC lines expressing SNAP-tagged H3.3 in single copy from a defined locus. To achieve this we used recombination-mediated cassette exchange to insert H3.3 C-terminally tagged with SNAP and HA-tags into A2lox-Cre ESCs which allow for dox inducible transgene expression from the <italic>hprt</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iacovino et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Western blotting showed that H3.3_SNAP was expressed at low levels relative to total endogenous H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and undetectable when blotting was performed using an H3.3-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was desirable, as we wanted H3.3_SNAP to act as a tracer to report the turnover of all H3.3 rather than overwhelm the cells with high levels of transgenic histone. We also generated a line expressing low levels of SNAP-tagged histone H3.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Post-translational modifications were detected on the SNAP-tagged histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15316.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Time-ChIP assay in H3.3_SNAP ESCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot for total H3 in H3.3_SNAP ESCs after 48 hr dox induction of transgene.

After inducing tagged H3.3 for 48 hr, H3.3_SNAP was biotin labeled in intact cells by adding the cell permeable molecule chloropyrimidine biotin (CP-biotin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Correa et al., 2013</xref>) to the media for 40 min followed by a wash step to remove unbound substrate. A portion of the labeled cells was harvested immediately representing the 0 hr time point and the remaining cells were re-plated for harvest at 3 hr, 6 hr and 12 hr post-labeling. Nuclei were isolated from these cells, chromatin liberated by MNase digestion and biotin labeled H3.3 recovered by streptavidin pull-down. DNA was purified from the recovered nucleosomes, quantified and prepared for sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected, decreasing amounts of DNA were recovered over time as biotin labeled H3.3_SNAP was replaced by newly synthesized H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Approximately the same number of reads was sequenced from each time point. A spike-in control was added when preparing the sequencing libraries to verify that the proportion of reads resulting from pull-down of SNAP-tagged histones was consistent with expectation for each time point. Later time points in each experiment had fewer fragments associated with tagged histones compared to spike-in fragments and thus were consistent with the expected overall H3.3 turnover rate in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and Materials and methods).</p><p>To validate that the SNAP tagged histone showed appropriate localization, we analyzed the 0 hr sample. As expected, H3.3 was enriched at enhancers and the promoters and bodies of active genes. H3.3 also showed high enrichment at transcription termination sites (TTSs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To ensure that the biotin labeling of H3.3 was representative of all tagged H3.3, we compared the enrichment profiles for the H3.3 0 hr sample to those generated by performing HA ChIP for transgenic H3.3_SNAP_HA and the two correlated well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To further validate our approach we examined the transcription start sites (TSSs) of active genes as these are elements where one would expect high H3.3 turnover. We plotted H3.3 time-ChIP data for the 0 hr, 3 hr, 6 hr and 12 hr time points over the transcription start sites (TSSs) of active genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As MNase was used to digest the chromatin, a characteristic MNase digestion pattern was observed consisting of a nucleosome 'depleted' region at the TSS and a well-positioned +1 nucleosome. As time progressed, labeled H3.3 was lost from these TSSs at an appreciable rate, particularly upstream of the TSS, as indicated by the fact that the profiles for each time point were well spaced apart. In contrast, at the TSSs of silent genes, H3.3 was less enriched and the profiles for each time point were closer together indicating slower H3.3 turnover compared to active promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Fast H3.3 turnover at the TSSs of active genes was evident at the level of individual loci as well as when average behavior was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). H3.3 enrichment and rapid turnover was also observed at the 3’ ends of expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). These observations are consistent with the displacement of nucleosomes by the transcription machinery and the enrichment of the replacement H3 variant, H3.3, at sites of active transcription as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>). The timeframe for turnover of H3.3_SNAP is concordant with previous estimates based on incorporation of H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kraushaar et al., 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15316.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Measuring H3.3 turnover in ESCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average H3.3 profiles for 0 hr, 3 hr, 6 hr and 12 hr time points over the transcription start sites (TSSs) of expressed and silent genes in ESCs.

Regions of high turnover will have fewer reads in later time points than regions with slower turnover when compared to the number of reads seen for these regions at 0 hr. To examine how turnover compared between different regions, it was necessary to develop a method to quantify turnover rate. To do this we used data from the 0 hr, 3 hr, 6 hr and 12 hr time points to calculate a 'turnover index'. The genome was divided into 1 kb bins and, for each bin, signal from each time point was fitted to a simple linear regression model. The slope of the linear regression was weighted to account for significance of the data fit by the linear model and multiplied by minus 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and Materials and methods). The resulting value was taken as the turnover index (TI) such that regions with fast H3.3 turnover had higher positive TI values. Indeed, at the TSSs of active genes, TI was highest upstream of the TSS reflecting what we observed when individual time points were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We calculated TI for three individual biological replicates and these samples correlated well with each other having R values of 0.67–0.82 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, for subsequent analyses, we used the mean TI of the three replicates as the TI measurement. This TI reflects relative H3.3 turnover between different genomic sites and, by its nature, is internally comparable across the genome.</p><p>Having established time-ChIP as a method for assessing H3.3 turnover and shown that it offers reproducible measurements genome-wide we then went on to examine H3.3 turnover in ESCs in more depth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Time-ChIP identifies regulatory regions in ESCs</title><p>We were interested in how turnover relates to regulation, so, without prior assumptions, we used TI to pick out the 1000 1 kb bins with the highest H3.3 turnover in ESCs (False Discovery Rate (FDR) = 0.003) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The majority of these (approximately 77%) were located in at least one annotated regulatory region such as a promoter, gene body, TTS or enhancer. High TI regions were overrepresented, as compared to the occurrence of the features in the genome, at promoters, the 5’ end of genes, TTSs, and enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In particular, high H3.3 enrichment and TI occurred at TTSs, often at those close to other transcription units, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and at enhancers and super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We examined the high TI regions that did not correspond to annotated genomic features in more detail. Some of these overlapped with a larger UCSC gene set, leaving 146 high TI regions in truly unannotated locations. It is likely that a portion of these represents unidentified regulatory regions or regions with regulatory functions in differentiated cells (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Indeed, 95 of these 146 unannotated regions were located within 50 kb of genes robustly expressed (FPKM &gt; 9.5) in ESCs (p-value = 0.001) suggesting potential regulatory roles for them in ESCs. Thus, without prior assumptions, time-ChIP identifies known regulatory, and also potential novel regulatory regions. We conclude that time-ChIP can be used to identify regions important for gene regulation.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15316.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Regions with high TI in ESCs have regulatory functions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representation of annotated genomic features in the 1000 highest TI regions in ESCs relative to their representation in the genome as a whole.

TI in fact did correlate with gene activity and was higher over the promoters, bodies and TTSs of highly expressed genes compared to genes with little or no expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). ESC enhancers showed particularly high TI values. This was consistent with their overrepresentation in the set of regions with the highest TI in ESCs, and further indicated that enhancers are especially dynamic.</p><p>We examined enhancers in more detail, and found that TI distinguishes isolated enhancers from the grouped enhancers that modulate expression of genes involved in cell identity; super-enhancers or locus control regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Magram et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). Plotting average TI profiles over conventional ESC enhancers and ESC super-enhancer constituents revealed higher H3.3 TI over the constituent enhancers that make-up super-enhancers domains compared to conventional enhancers despite the fact that these regions are similar in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). When TI was calculated using a smaller 300 bp bin size, exceptionally high H3.3 turnover was still evident at super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also examined turnover of histone H3.1 at ESC enhancers and super-enhancers by performing H3.1 time-ChIP in the same manner as was done for H3.3. Although the depth of sequencing required to interrogate H3.1 limits the resolution of H3.1 time-ChIP, we clearly saw elevated TI over enhancers compared to randomized regions in two seperate biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, super-enhancer constituents showed higher H3.1 turnover than conventional enhancers, consistent with the results for H3.3. The high H3.1 and H3.3 TI observed at super-enhancers suggests that nucleosomes are more frequently disrupted at these regions regardless of which H3 variant they contain. We conclude that TI offers a metric for identifying enhancers and super-enhancers, and that super-enhancers have an unusually dynamic nucleosome population.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PcG-repressed loci show H3.3 enrichment but reduced TI in ESCs</title><p>Having observed increased TI associated with activation, we were interested in examining regions associated with repression. Heterochromatin, the most extensively repressed segment of the genome, does not have H3.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating a lack of turnover and causing us to be unable to measure H3.3 turnover at these regions. However Polycomb-Group (PcG) regulated genes are bound by H3.3 in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), although H3.3 levels at these genes were lower than at enhancers and CpG islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). PcG proteins mediate repression, at least in part, through chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Simon and Kingston, 2013</xref>).

Using these criteria, 34,070 1 kb bins were identified which changed TI during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>) with more bins showing increased TI in NSCs compared to ESCs (19,870 bins compared to 14,200). Strikingly, regions showing higher TI in ESCs were enriched for the presence of an ESC enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and, similarly, regions with increased TI in NSCs were enriched for NSC enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, enhancer regions showed high H3.3 turnover in a manner that correlated with cell type-specific enhancer activity. Interestingly, NSC enhancers were also somewhat overrepresented in regions with higher turnover in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This could reflect roles for these enhancers in both ESCs and NSCs, or could reflect a ‘poised’ state for these enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferrari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>).

We wished to test this hypothesis by measuring the accessibility of DNA to enzymatic access genome-wide. DNase hypersensitivity, or the conceptually related technique ATAC-seq, detects regions of open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">John et al., 2013</xref>). We examined H3.3 turnover over previously annotated DNase hypersensitive sites in mouse ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vierstra et al., 2014</xref>) and found that TI was indeed high over these sites in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). TI over ESC DNase sensitive regions was reduced in NSCs consistent with regulatory changes during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). To expand upon this analysis, we used MNase, which is capable of measuring accessibility more broadly than these aforementioned technologies. It is established that nucleosomes have differential accessibility to MNase, with some nucleosomes liberated at low MNase and some requiring high MNase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knight et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We have recently developed a metric that measures how nucleosomes respond to a titration of MNase. Nucleosomes that show decreased signal as MNase concentration decreases are deemed inaccessible (more MNase is needed to liberate them), while nucleosomes that show increased signal as MNase concentration decreases are deemed accessible (they are released at low MNase concentration and their associated DNA is over-digested at high concentrations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">[Mieczkowski et al., 2016</xref>]) We therefore expanded upon the relationship between TI and DNase hypersensitity to examine whether this new parameter and H3.3 turnover were correlated.</p><p>ESC and NSC chromatin was digested with a range of concentrations of MNase – 1U, 4U, 16U and 64U. We then calculated the ‘MNase accessibility’ (MACC) metric that reflects the change in signal at a particular locus in response to decreasing MNase concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mieczkowski et al., 2016</xref>). The metric is designed so that positive MACC values reflect regions that are easily digested by MNase and therefore are classed as 'accessible'. MNase titration was performed on two biological replicates of H3.3_SNAP ESC and NSC chromatin ('a' replicates). The same assay was also carried out on different ESC and NSC lines ('b' replicates) thus increasing the number of replicates we could assess and providing greater confidence in our findings.</p><p>We examined annotated genomic elements to see if turnover index correlated with DNA accessibility as assessed by MACC. At the TSSs of genes that change expression upon neural differentiation, TI and MACC were positively correlated in a cell-type specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).

When the magnitude of TI and MACC at ESC enhancers was assessed, both had values well above the genome average in ESCs but not in NSCs, consistent with their regulatory role in pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). As well as being evident on a global scale, the relationship between TI and MACC at enhancers was also apparent at the level of individual loci.

These findings indicate that, at enhancers, increased turnover of nucleosomes might account for increased accessibility to the DNA sequence. This is consistent with increased transcription factor binding at these sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our unbiased assessment of H3.3 turnover identified enhancers as having highly dynamic nucleosomes. Notably, the clustered enhancers that make up super-enhancer domains were more rapidly turned over than conventional ESC enhancers. Measurement of H3.1 turnover showed the same phenomenon. These observations are consistent with the notion that nucleosomes must be disrupted in order to allow transcription factor binding and are consistent with increased DNA accessibility at enhancers. Notably, our data suggest that nucleosomes are frequently disrupted at enhancers regardless of which H3 variant they contain. Nucleosomes containing H3.3 predominate at these regions due to the high levels of nucleosome disruption but both H3.1 and H3.3 show rapid turnover. A variety of mechanisms might be used to generate high turnover in enhancers. Pioneer transcription factors such as Oct4 and Sox2 occupy these sets of ESC enhancers and super-enhancers and can bind partial motifs on the nucleosome surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>). These factors might contribute to nucleosome turnover, either directly through their binding or by recruiting remodeling complexes that facilitate turnover. Transcription through enhancers might also contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). It is intriguing that super-enhancers show significantly higher turnover than enhancer elements. This could reflect a synergistic interaction between adjacent enhancer modules, or might indicate that the individual enhancer modules within super-enhancers each have intrinsically high turnover. In either case, the ability of turnover to identify these regions is striking and is likely to be related to their potency.</p><p>High histone turnover at enhancers was not limited to ESCs, but was also seen when we looked at lineage-committed NSCs, indicating that this property is seen both in pluripotent and in differentiated cell lineages. There were significant changes in where high turnover occurred in NSCs due to the activation of a distinct set of enhancers. In broad classifications, regions with rapid turnover were in general similar between ESCs and NSCs, except that gene bodies were overrepresented in high turnover regions in the differentiated cells but not in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Increased turnover in gene bodies might reflect widespread transcriptional activation and consequent histone turnover in differentiated cells. Alternatively, it might be that pluripotent cells have a plastic chromatin structure at the promoters of genes poised for activation in future lineages, increasing turnover relative to gene bodies at those locations.</p><p>Many unannotated regions showed differentiation-associated turnover changes, approximately one-quarter of turnover changes occurred outside of genes and enhancers. Many of these regions are likely to represent genomic elements with hitherto unknown roles in cell fate specification. In support of this, over 20% of the unannotated regions with the largest changes in turnover were located close to genes that changed expression during neural differentiation.</p><p>Nucleosome turnover might be related to accessibility of the underlying sequence as regions with rapid turnover are likely to have DNA sequences that are exposed for protein binding more frequently. To begin to analyze whether this is true, we measured accessibility genome wide using MNase, which is able to probe accessibility everywhere in the genome, and compared the resultant accessibility metric to turnover index. At ESC enhancers, both TI and MACC had high values and the two metrics were highly correlated. Similarly at the TSSs of expressed genes, TI and MACC had higher than average values while at repressed PcG targets both turnover and accessibility were reduced. These data thus cross validate these two distinct metrics and support the hypothesis that regions of high turnover correspond to regions of high DNA accessibility.</p><p>Our work and previous work are consistent in showing high incorporation rates for histone H3.3 and high turnover for that histone in enhancers and other regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kraushaar et al., 2013</xref>). We have extended these observations by also showing high turnover of H3.1 at enhancer regions and in demonstrating more rapid turnover of both H3.3 and H3.1 at super-enhancers compared to conventional enhancers. Notably, we also observed high H3.3 turnover around the transcription termination sites of expressed genes with our sets containing the (1000) highest TI regions showing a large overrepresentation of TTSs. RNA Polymerase II occupancy or transcription itself could contribute to nucleosome displacement at these regions. Indeed, enrichment of RNA Pol II and nascent transcription at the 3’ end of genes has been reported to be widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anamika et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rahl et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Time-ChIP allows examination of relative histone turnover in a genome-wide manner at high resolution, with changes in turnover evident at individual gene loci and regulatory elements. Labeling of SNAP-tagged histones for time-ChIP takes approximately one hour meaning that very rapid turnover might be missed and consequently turnover underestimated for some regions. Nevertheless, labeling time is relatively short compared to the cell cycle time of ESCs (12 hr) and NSCs (18 hr) and most H3.3 enriched loci are still detectable at the first time point as evidenced by the strong correlation between ChIP for H3.3_SNAP_HA and the H3.3 0 hr time-ChIP sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We are therefore confident that we accurately quantify relative turnover for the vast majority of H3.3-enriched regions. In this study, H3.3 turnover was assessed because of its enrichment at regions important for gene regulation. In theory, however, time-ChIP can be applied to study the dynamics of any core histone or histone variant. We performed time-ChIP for H3.1 but a comprehensive assessment of its turnover, and that of other broadly distributed histones, is currently limited by the depth of sequencing required. Measuring nucleosome dynamics provides a distinct measure of chromatin characteristics that can help identify and functionally characterize regulatory elements.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Generation and maintenance of H3_SNAP ESCs and NSCs</title><p>A p2lox plasmid containing H3.3 cDNA and a C-terminal SNAP_3xHA tag was introduced into A2lox.Cre ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iacovino et al., 2011</xref>) by nucleofection (Lonza, Switzerland). 24 hr prior to transfection 500 ng/ml doxycycline was added to induce Cre expression and facilitate integration of H3.3_SNAP_HA into the <italic>hprt</italic> locus. 24 hr after transfection selection was initiated with 300 ug/ml G418 and after 7–9 days colonies were picked and screened for presence of H3.3_SNAP_HA.

The TSS profiles were calculated and plotted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tolstorukov et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Spike-in control</title><p>For each time point the number of reads aligning to the spike-in control was compared to the number of reads aligning to the mouse genome. The greater the number of spike-in reads relative to mouse genomic reads, the smaller the quantity of genomic DNA sequenced from the time point sample. We used this relationship to calculate the relative number of 'sequencing reads' for each time point relative to the 0 hr time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Time-ChIP: TI calculation</title><p>The genome was divided into 1 kb bins and, for each sample, the number of tags per bin was calculated as reads per million to normalize for library size. Data for each time point was then input subtracted. For each 1 kb bin, TI was calculated by fitting the number of reads for each time point to a simple linear regression model. A Kendall rank correlation test was used to assess how well points fit the linear model. The slope of the line fitted by linear regression was weighted by multiplying by 1-p-value from the Kendall test. Such weighting was introduced to reduce the TI values for the bins where the statistical significance of the fit was low, and thus it ensures a conservative estimation of TI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abubucker et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, the sign of the slope was reversed such that positive TI values represented high turnover. As data for individual biological replicates correlated well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), the mean of these replicates was used for further analysis. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> a 300 bp bin size was used for calculating TI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Identification of top TI regions</title><p>To identify regions with the highest H3.3 turnover a sliding window calculation was performed that calculated the mean TI over a window size of three 1 kb bins. This allowed us to identify high TI bins whose neighboring bins also had high turnover. Regions corresponding to repeats were manually removed and the 1000 bins with the highest TI value were chosen as the set of highest TI regions for the cell type in question. An FDR threshold was calculated for these regions by taking the lowest TI value in this set and seeing how frequently it occurred in 1000 randomly selected 1 kb bins. This random selection was performed 100 times and for each test; FDR = # bins with TI value above threshold/# total bins. The highest value from these 100 tests was chosen as the final FDR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Detecting differences in TI between ESCs and NSCs</title><p>TI difference for each 1 kb bin was calculated (mean ES TI – mean NS TI) and p-values were computed using the empirical Bayes method (limma package in R) on TI data from each of the three replicates. Bins with a TI difference in the 0.975 quantile with p-values ≤ 0.01 were selected as changing TI during differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>Definition of unannotated regions and overlap with genes</title><p>Regions were defined as occurring in an unannotated region if they did not overlap a gene or an enhancer element. To ensure elements were truly unannotated we extended our gene set to include all UCSC mm9 genes and predicted genes (52,199 genes). To determine whether unannotated regions of interest overlapped particular gene sets in a statistically significant manner we used GAT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gat.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html">http://gat.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heger et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>MACC calculation</title><p>MACC was calculated as described in Mieczkowski et al.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-8"><title>ChIP-seq analysis</title><p>To determine regions of ChIP-seq tag enrichment (peaks), we analyzed tag counts in a 1 kb window over the chromosome length with the step of 200 bp. Statistical significance of enrichment of ChIP vs input was estimated using negative binomial distribution, with the estimate of the mean based on the tag counts in input, and the size parameters selected based on manual inspection of resulting peak calls. Regions of significant enrichment were generated by merging adjacent significantly enriched windows separated by 1 kb or less. In ESCs, PcG targets were defined as having overlapping peaks of Ring1b Cbx2, Cbx7, Ezh2 and H3K27me3. For NSCs, PcG targets were defined as having overlapping peaks of Ring1b and H3K27me3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-9"><title>Gene expression</title><p>Expression data for TSS plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> was taken from West et al.

Expression data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> is from RNA-seq data performed on J-1 ESCs and NSCs differentiated in vitro from these cells. RNA-seq tags were aligned to the mouse genome (mm9) using the Tophat software package with default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>). FPKM values and differential gene expression between ESC and NSC were calculated using Cufflinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>) and Cuffdiff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Trapnell et al., 2013</xref>) packages respectively. Genes changing expression between ESCs and NSCs were defined as those showing at least a three-fold (for comparison with unannotated regions changing turnover during differentiation) or a four-fold change (MACC analysis) in FPKM value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-10"><title>Data availability</title><p>High throughput sequencing data has been deposited in GEO and is accessible using the following links.</p><p>Time-ChIP: GSE78876</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78876">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78876</ext-link></p><p>ChIP-seq: GSE78899</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78899">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78899</ext-link></p><p>MNase titration and RNA-seq: GSE78984</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78984">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78984</ext-link></p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ivan Correa (NEB) for the gift of the CP-biotin substrate, Michael Kyba for supplying the A2lox.Cre ESCs and Sihem Cheloufi for assistance isolating embryonic NSCs.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers all applauded the new methods developed in the manuscript and the promise that these methods will lead to advances in the field. However, it was felt that such advances and novel discoveries were not contained in the manuscript submitted. Most of the results confirm observations previously made with other approaches. It was suggested that the current manuscript would be more appropriate for a high impact methods journal. The reviews also contain several comments and technical points that we help you will find helpful.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript uses a novel technique to measure histone H3.3 turnover to generate a turnover index. The experiments are carefully done, well presented and well written. The results are largely predictable (e.g. high turnover at accessible act sites and low turnover at less accessible inactive sites).</p><p>1) While the method is commendable my sense is that to have a high enough impact for <italic>eLife</italic> the manuscript really needs to emphasize novel findings from this method that we did not know already.</p><p>2) Why study only the replacement variant of H3. Comparison to H3.1 would have increased the impact of the work. It might also allow some measurements on the rate of turnover during the cell cycle.</p><p>3) Other H3 tags have been shown to interfere with modification of the histone. This study needs some general controls for the stability of the nucleosomes containing the tagged histone and for the presence of histone modifications on the tagged vs. endogenous histone.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Enhancer regions show high histone H3.3 turnover that changes during differentiation&quot; Deaton et al. developed a new approach to study variant histone H3.3 turnover and performed a thorough systematic investigation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and neural precursors. They correlate such turnover with ESC promoters, with gene expression and with other metrics that allow regulatory region identification (i.e., H3K27ac and enhancers). The authors also employed their newly developed method called time-ChIP to assess histone turnover genome-wide after differentiation of mESCs to neural stem cells (NSCs), albeit differentiation occurred in mouse embryo brains. The authors found high histone turnover in the regions that are involved in gene regulation particularly, enhancers and super-enhancers. The turnover is quantitated by a turnover index (TI) in those regions. The results were further corroborated by MNase accessibility metric (MACC), a measure of chromatin/DNA accessibility. The overall approach is solid but we did not see a significant advantage over previously published approaches, i.e., the TET-OFF approach to H3.3 turnover by Zhao's lab. Also, the authors claim that their dual approach would be useful in identifying novel regulatory regions, but they did not pursue this avenue of investigation in a tangible way.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> described the general approach to histone H3.3 tagging and thence turnover but lacked good controls; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> was somewhat ambiguous. This needs to be a crystal clear figure with obvious controls – it's not. The authors point out that much of the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are as expected based on previous studies of H3.3 and known histone turnover in active regions vs. less turnover in inactive. The conclusions are compatible with the work from Henikoff, Allis and specifically Zhao's 2014 Epigenetics Chromatin paper on H3.3 turnover in mESC using a TET-OFF strategy. The study does not consider the presence of fragile nucleosomes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows turnover correlates with gene activity, promoters and enhancers, particularly super-enhancers. The analysis here was a bit deeper than in the Zhou paper but also with a slightly different emphasis. The authors then concentrated on polycomb-repressed genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and show a lower turnover, again, as expected. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> revealed a whole new set of genes that are activated upon neural differentiation, which had lost polycomb (PcG) binding, but again as expected these data showed a dramatic increase in H3.3 enrichment and histone turnover, whereas regions that are still bound by PcG in NSCs, were no longer enriched in H3.3 as they were in ESCs. Interestingly, gene bodies showed high turnover in NSC vs ESC. Remarkably, the NSC lines derived from embryos had rather rapid cell cycles vs. some generated in culture. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is an ESC-NSC comparison but we found nothing striking.</p><p>Strengths: This study offers two potentially useful tools to study nucleosome dynamics: first, to quantify the histone turnover rate (TI) and second, the MNase accessibility metric (MACC); the latter study appears to also be submitted elsewhere. The results are clean and the data presented in this study are largely convincing. The approach may indeed provide insight into identification of novel regulatory regions but the authors need to prove it.</p><p>Weaknesses: This study does not break new conceptual ground or add significantly to our present understanding of nucleosome dynamics linked with transcription and silencing. It has long been known from a number of studies that gene expression positively correlates with the occupancy of H3.3 in the regulatory regions (especially promoters and enhancers) and generally associates with high nucleosome dynamics.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This paper describes the application of a novel technique (time-ChIP) involving an induced histone variant coupled to a SNAP tag. The system is used in this paper to determine the genome-wide histone turnover of the H3.3 variant in a developmental context (ES to neuronal ES). The authors conclude that regions of the genome experiencing active regulation (promoters, enhancers, and super-enhancers) experience faster histone turnover relative to silenced or inactive regions. Additionally, the authors describe a relationship between polycomb repressive complex and the stabilization of chromatin during neuronal differentiation. Finally, the authors propose this technique as a potential method of identifying previously uncharacterized active regulatory regions.</p><p>At first glance, the study seems interesting and relevant to the field of nucleosome regulation. However, there were several analytical steps that lacked appropriate details which significantly impaired the full interpretation of the analysis and conclusions. It is difficult to recommend for publication without additional details of the methodology to make an informed decision.</p><p>A more detailed description of how the spike-in control was used is critical. How was this spike-in used to normalize or control the data?</p><p>The authors state that they achieved greater DNA recovery the closer to the pulse they collected chromatin which is expected and serves as a good internal control. However, if the genome-wide normalization is based on the relative chromatin enrichment, the TI calculation could merely be mirroring the increased DNA recovery and not, on any sites, actual turnover. Further details on how the data was specifically normalized would clarify this concern. Additionally, it would be important to know the robustness of this TI calculation given alternative normalization approaches. For example, the authors show there is minimal turnover at silent genes. If this is expected to be a relative constant, how do their findings hold up if normalized to turnover at silent genes?</p><p>What is the rationale for the use of 1kb windows for the calculation of the TI index? This time-ChIP data is presumably at nucleosome resolution since it is MNase-based. It would be of far greater value to see the extent of histone turnover extending into genes rather than what appears to be arbitrary 1 kb blocks. If there is a reason why the data is kept at 1kb blocks, the authors should also explain the limits of the spatial resolution of their data.</p><p>The use of linear regression slopes as the TI index raises concerns that the authors are assuming a linear relationship in histone turnover. What about regions that experience little turnover for long periods followed by spurts of high turnover? Would the TI metric pull that data out or would it be removed from consideration because of the weighting schema used to punish poorly fit regression models? Again this speaks to the concerns regarding the robustness of the TI metric.</p><p>How is the MACC calculated? There is insufficient information for the nature of this calculation, which is concerning since an entire section of the paper is based on this calculation. A reference to a submitted paper that was not provided is insufficient to judge the nature of the analysis and findings.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Enhancer regions show high histone H3.3 turnover that changes during differentiation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>This is a highly interesting study and certainly contributes to our understanding of nucleosome dynamics at enhancers and super-enhancers. However, it is mainly a techniques paper that states that there is high turnover at enhancers/super-enhancers and extends the work of Zhao while adding a large amount of new detail. We point out that Zhao's 2014 Epigenetics paper used the TET-OFF strategy referred to by the author in his rebuttal but Zhao also has a very nice Genome Bio paper, PMC3983652, that was cited by the author and which incorporates many and earlier time points. Although performed in MEFs, that study also shows H3.3 at high resolution and demonstrate high H3.3 turnover at enhancers and low at H3K27me3 rich regions using linear regression models in a TET-ON H3.3 system. The author's new strategy is probably more accurate versus attempting to measure turnover by regression.</p><p>1) While the Discussion does in fact mention that Zhao came to the same conclusion on enhancers and cites the right paper, it comes too late in the manuscript. Hence, the Abstract makes an inappropriate novelty claim regarding high H3.3 turnover at regions known to be involved in gene regulation. Since Zhao has already shown this then they should acknowledge it in the Abstract and Introduction, i.e., &quot;As previously shown, we found high H3.3 turnover at active regulatory regions including enhancers. However, we also find that even higher turnover occurs at super-enhancers[…]&quot;.</p><p>2) The authors have also satisfied the technical concerns that were raised in the previous review.</p><p>3) The revised version now included the requested statistical information.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15316.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>1) While the method is commendable my sense is that to have a high enough impact for eLife the manuscript really needs to emphasize novel findings from this method that we did not know already.</italic></p><p>We respectfully dispute the statement concerning ‘novel findings’; while many in the chromatin field take as a given that regulatory regions such as enhancers will have high turnover, there is scant data on this point, and the data that exists is not particularly compelling. The previous work uses protein induction strategies that have time delays, lessening precision. In addition, the difference between super-enhancers and enhancers is novel, as is the extent to which turnover is increased over gene bodies upon differentiation. We have examined turnover during differentiation, which has not to our knowledge been previously studied, and find that enhancers show the most frequent changes in turnover. Enhancers are central and highly studied, these are key data on a key topic.</p><p><italic>2) Why study only the replacement variant of H3.

(The reason H3.1 is difficult to study intensively right now is necessary read depth and attendant cost.) The data are noisy due to read depth even at enhancers. We now include these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and it buttresses the H3.3 data.</p><p><italic>3) Other H3 tags have been shown to interfere with modification of the histone. This study needs some general controls for the stability of the nucleosomes containing the tagged histone and for the presence of histone modifications on the tagged vs. endogenous histone.</italic></p><p>Looking at modifications on the tagged histone is tough due to the low expression level, however we can see K4me3 on H3.3 and K27me3 on H3.1 and have included these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). All of our data speaks to the stability of the tagged histone on chromatin (where we are using it) as we find turnover numbers that span hours and that are concordant with previous estimates. For example, Kraushaar et al. find H3.3 incorporation to occur in a 3-24 hour time frame. This has been added to the text (Results section).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>Weaknesses: This study does not break new conceptual ground or add significantly to our present understanding of nucleosome dynamics linked with transcription and silencing. It has long been known from a number of studies that gene expression positively correlates with the occupancy of H3.3 in the regulatory regions (especially promoters and enhancers) and generally associates with high nucleosome dynamics.</italic></p><p>See above for the rebuttal on novelty; again the data are scant and no one has rank ordered turnover in active genes vs. enhancers vs. super-enhancers previously and these are high impact issues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>At first glance, the study seems interesting and relevant to the field of nucleosome regulation. However, there were several analytical steps that lacked appropriate details which significantly impaired the full interpretation of the analysis and conclusions. It is difficult to recommend for publication without additional details of the methodology to make an informed decision.</italic></p><p><italic>A more detailed description of how the spike-in control was used is critical. How was this spike-in used to normalize or control the data?</italic></p><p>The spike-in is a control to verify that the proportion of sequencing reads resulting from pull-down of SNAP-tagged histones was consistent with the experimental data for each time point, one cannot normalize due to the nature of the experiment. We apologize for not having made this clear, and have expanded upon this in the text (subsection “Time-ChIP reports histone H3.3 turnover genome-wide”, second paragraph and Materials and methods).</p><p><italic>The authors state that they achieved greater DNA recovery the closer to the pulse they collected chromatin which is expected and serves as a good internal control. However, if the genome-wide normalization is based on the relative chromatin enrichment, the TI calculation could merely be mirroring the increased DNA recovery and not, on any sites, actual turnover. Further details on how the data was specifically normalized would clarify this concern.</italic></p><p>Although we used a spike in control (as described above) we did not perform any normalization of the sequencing data. Rather, we look at the relative number of reads for different genomic regions at each time point when assessing turnover. Thus these data are internally compared to each other; the turnover rates reflect that internal comparison. For example, high turnover regions such as enhancers will have fewer reads in later time points compared to regions with slower turnover and the TI calculation reflects this. We apologize for not making this clear initially and have expanded upon this in the text (subsection “Time-ChIP reports histone H3.3 turnover genome-wide”, fifth paragraph).</p><p><italic>Additionally, it would be important to know the robustness of this TI calculation given alternative normalization approaches. For example, the authors show there is minimal turnover at silent genes. If this is expected to be a relative constant, how do their findings hold up if normalized to turnover at silent genes?</italic></p><p>As discussed above the read counts are not normalized and we compare relative turnover rates between different genomic regions. By its nature, the TI metric is internally “normalized” across the genome as we look at turnover at silent sites as well as active regions, and the metric provides a direct comparison between these rates. The silenced regions, such as those occupied by Polycomb, have lower TI.</p><p><italic>What is the rationale for the use of 1kb windows for the calculation of the TI index?</italic></p><p>1kb was used as the bin size due to read depth, particularly when looking at regions with lower amounts of H3.3 and when examining H3.1 turnover. Enhancers can be done in smaller windows. We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> which shows turnover at enhancers and super-enhancers when TI is calculated using a 300bp bin size (subsection “Time-ChIP identifies regulatory regions in ESCs”, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>The use of linear regression slopes as the TI index raises concerns that the authors are assuming a linear relationship in histone turnover. What about regions that experience little turnover for long periods followed by spurts of high turnover?</italic></p><p>We examine large numbers of stably pluripotent or differentiated cultures, so do not expect complicated behavior in the regions examined. We agree that a non-linear analysis might well be needed if one is doing an acute response; we do not have data that could be used to test this supposition though.</p><p><italic>How is the MACC calculated?

Hence, the Abstract makes an inappropriate novelty claim regarding high H3.3 turnover at regions known to be involved in gene regulation. Since Zhao has already shown this then they should acknowledge it in the Abstract and Introduction, i.e., &quot;As previously shown, we found high H3.3 turnover at active regulatory regions including enhancers. However, we also find that even higher turnover occurs at super-enhancers […]&quot;.</italic></p><p>We have edited the Abstract (“High turnover was seen at enhancers, as observed previously”) and the Introduction (“In ESCs, consistent with previous work, we found high H3.3 turnover at active enhancers (Ha et al., 2014; Kraushaar et al., 2013)[…]”) to refer to both the Kraushaar and Ha papers from Zhao’s group.</p></body></sub-article></article>
