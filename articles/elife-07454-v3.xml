Understanding these is therefore crucial in the investigation of biological systems. Despite all past efforts, we still lack a thorough understanding of the energetics of association of proteins. Here, we introduce a new and simple approach to predict binding affinity based on functional and structural features of the biological system, namely the network of interfacial contacts. We assess its performance against a protein–protein binding affinity benchmark and show that both experimental methods used for affinity measurements and conformational changes have a strong impact on prediction accuracy. Using a subset of complexes with reliable experimental binding affinities and combining our contacts and contact-types-based model with recent observations on the role of the non<bold>-</bold>interacting surface in protein–protein interactions, we reach a high prediction accuracy for such a diverse dataset outperforming all other tested methods.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07454.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07454.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07454.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins help to copy DNA, transport nutrients and perform many other important roles in cells. To perform these tasks, proteins often interact with other proteins and work together. These interactions can be very complex because each protein has a three-dimensional shape that may change when it binds to other proteins. Also, two proteins may form several connections with each other.</p><p>It is possible to carry out experiments to calculate how likely it is that two proteins will physically interact with each other and how strong their connections will be. However, these measurements are time consuming and costly to do. Some researchers have developed computer models to help predict the interactions between proteins, but these models are often incorrect because they leave out some of the chemical or physical properties that influence the ability of proteins to interact.</p><p>With the aim of making a better model, Vangone and Bonvin examined 122 different combinations of proteins whose abilities to interact had previously been experimentally measured. Vangone and Bonvin found that the number of connections between each pair of proteins was a strong predictor of how tightly the proteins connect to each other. Particular features of the surface of the proteins—specifically, the region defined as the non-interacting surface—can also influence how strong the interaction is.</p><p>Vangone and Bonvin used this information to develop a new model that predicts how tightly proteins interact with each other based on the number of connections between the two proteins and the characteristics of the non-interacting surface. The model is simple, and Vangone and Bonvin show that it is more accurate than previous models. Defects in the interactions between proteins can lead to many diseases in humans, so this model may be useful for the development of new drugs to treat these conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07454.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07454.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>protein–protein complexes</kwd><kwd>binding affinity</kwd><kwd>protein contacts</kwd><kwd>buried surface area</kwd><kwd>protein–protein interactions</kwd><kwd>non<bold>-</bold>interacting surface</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WeNMR e-Infrastrure project, grant 261572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vangone</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><name><surname>Bonvin</surname><given-names>Alexandre MJJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The number of contacts at the interface of a protein–protein complex, together with the properties of the surface, provides a simple, but well-performing predictor of binding affinity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interactions between proteins play a central role in the processes happening in the cells, from DNA replication to protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones and Thornton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberts, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nooren and Thornton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perkins et al., 2010</xref>). Perturbations in those interaction networks can lead to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stites, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sugiki et al., 2014</xref>). Characterizing these protein–protein interactions (PPIs) is therefore crucial for a proper understanding of mechanisms in biological processes for disease research and for drug development, as most common targets of drugs are proteins (such as enzymes, ion channels, and receptors).</p><p>Exploring recognition processes at atomic level requires knowledge of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the associated molecular complexes. It is however the binding affinity (BA) (i.e., the natural inclination of molecules to associate) that defines whether or not complex formation will occur. The BA is therefore the key for understanding and predicting recognition, association and dysfunction phenomena related to protein complexes. It has been shown that changes in BA caused by mutations or post-translational modification errors lead to various diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vidal et al., 2011</xref>). Commonly, the affinity of an interaction is described through the equilibrium dissociation constant K<sub>d</sub>, or, in thermodynamic terms, the Gibbs free energy ΔG (ΔG = RT ln K<sub>d</sub>). Measuring K<sub>d</sub> values experimentally is a time-consuming and expensive process. Many computational methods aimed at predicting BA have been developed. Gaining the ability to predict BA is indeed an urgent need as it offers great opportunities not only to control interactions and develop innovative therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keskin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aloy and Russell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beltrao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kiel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dell'Orco, 2009</xref>), but also for other applications such as protein engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kortemme et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sharabi et al., 2011</xref>), computational mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Shimon and Eisenstein, 2010</xref>), and docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halperin et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Different methods aimed at predicting BA have been proposed throughout the years, varying greatly in terms of accuracy and computational cost. Exact methods such as free energy perturbation and thermodynamics integration can be very accurate, but due to their computational costs their application is extremely limited (mostly to low throughput studies and mainly for small drug binding or mutations). Methods based on empirical functions (empirical, force-field-based potentials, statistical potentials, and scoring functions used in docking) are much faster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Audie and Scarlata, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Su et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moal and Bates, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kastritis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2014</xref>). However, even if some have been very successful on small training sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Horton and Lewis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Audie and Scarlata, 2007</xref>), most published models still fail to systematically predict BA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kastritis and Bonvin, 2010</xref>) for large datasets or discriminate between binders and non-binders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sacquin-Mora et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleishman et al., 2011</xref>). The main weaknesses of these methods are that they usually neglect factors such as conformational changes upon binding, allosteric regulation, and solvent and co-factor effects, which may all contribute to the binding strength.</p><p>Binding between two proteins is mainly defined by their contact region, the interface, and it is indeed the network of contacts between surface residues that holds complexes together, defines their specificity and contributes to their interaction strength. The importance of such inter-residue contacts has already been established in docking. In the Critical Assessment of Prediction of Interactions (CAPRI) experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janin et al., 2003</xref>), for instance, assessment of the accuracy of the docked models is based on a combination of positional root mean square deviation (RMSD) criteria and conservation of intermolecular contacts with respect to the native structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lensink et al., 2007</xref>). In the context of scoring, considering the conservation of contacts at the interface across docking models has been shown to improve the ranking of docked models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oliva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chermak et al., 2014</xref>). The atom contact frequency in a set of predictions, a similar concept, has also been included in the ZRANK docking pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hwang et al., 2010</xref>). Next to their use in scoring, contacts have been introduced as a way to cluster docking solutions based on the fraction of common inter-residue contacts among a set of decoys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rodrigues et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>However, in addition to properties of the interface, a recent work has also demonstrated an effect of the non-interacting surface (NIS) on BA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kastritis et al., 2014</xref>), a finding that has been corroborated in a recent study by Marillet et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marillet et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here we show how the network of contacts at the interface of a protein–protein complex can help in describing the BA of the interaction. Based on the number contacts at the interface, we propose an innovative and very simple method to predict BA. To this end we used the protein–protein BA benchmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kastritis et al., 2011</xref>) consisting of 144 non-redundant protein–protein complexes with experimentally determined K<sub>d</sub> (ΔG) and available 3D structures.</p><p>Our results show that interfacial contacts, which have so far been neglected in the rationalization and prediction of BA, can be considered the best structural property to describe binding strength. Based on this observation, we describe an extremely simple BA predictor that accounts for different types of contacts and shows the best performance reported so far (to our knowledge) on such a large and diversified dataset of complexes. Its performance is compared to other previously published predictor methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moal et al., 2011</xref>). Further, we analyze the impact of the experimental method used to characterize BA on the prediction performance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Considering the critical role of the BA in the study of protein–protein complexes and the still elusive approaches to predict it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kastritis and Bonvin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleishman et al., 2011</xref>), we demonstrate here that the network of inter-residue contacts (ICs) between two interacting proteins is a good descriptor for the BA. Using the structure-based BA benchmark of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kastritis et al. (2011)</xref>, we correlated ICs with experimentally determined BA data (K<sub>d</sub> or ΔG) for protein complexes (bound forms). The diversity of experimental methods used to measure BA in this benchmark allows us to underline their limitations and reliability for use in BA prediction. From the original dataset of 144 complexes, we removed the cases with ambiguity in the exact K<sub>d</sub> values and all complexes with missing or unresolved residues (&gt;2) at the interface (data reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For the remaining 122 complexes, we calculated the number of ICs and evaluated their correlation (expressed through the Pearson's correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic>) with the experimental ΔGs.

We therefore systematically evaluated the effect of the distance on defining the inter-residues network by varying the cut-off distance between 3 Å and 20 Å (see ‘Materials and methods’). For each distance cut-off the number of ICs was correlated with the experimental ΔGs.

For the set of 122 complexes used in this work, ten different experimental methods have been used to detect the ΔGs: stopped-flow fluorimetry (8 cases), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (40 cases), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/UV absorption spectroscopy (14 cases), sedimentation (1 case), radioligand binding (competitive binding experiments) (2 cases), potentiometry (1 case), reduction assay (1 case), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (19 cases), inhibition assay (17 cases), fluorescence spectrophotometric assays (19 cases).</p><p>We analyzed separately the BAs from the various experimental methods with enough data points (≥8) and compared the prediction performance with the full data set.

Indeed, a weak complex is expected to be less tightly packed than a strong one, a difference that should be better reflected in the ICs than in the BSA. In particular, the origin of this difference might reside in the fact that the contribution of each residue to the BSA will greatly depend on the solvent-accessible surface area of the residue in the free form, whereas this does not affect ICs. To illustrate this point we checked the main differences between ICs and BSA for the complex between Fab D3H44 and Tissue factor (PDB code: 1JPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faelber et al., 2001</xref>]; ΔG<sub>exp</sub> = −13.6 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>). This complex has a BSA of 1852 Å<sup>2</sup> and 83 ICs at 5.5 Å, resulting in a ICs-based affinity prediction of −12.8 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> and a BSA-based one of −10.3 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>. The relative contribution of each interfacial Fab residue to the total BSA and number of ICs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5A—figure supplement 1A</xref>: The contributions of the various residues to the ICs are more equally distributed than for the BSA. The latter shows high contributions for some residues, which is closely related to their solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) in the free form (defined here as the conformation extracted from the complex, that is, without any conformational changes—see ‘Materials and methods’) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5B—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the surface representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Indeed, because BSA<sub>Fab</sub> = ASA<sub>Fab_free</sub> −ASA<sub>Fab_complex</sub>, when a residue is at the core of the binding interface (in other words totally shielded by Tissue factor) the ASA<sub>Fab_complex</sub> will be close to 0, resulting in BSA<sub>Fab</sub> ∼ASA<sub>Fab_free</sub>. In contrast, residues already almost fully buried in the free form will not contribute to the BSA, whereas they might be able to form contacts in our ICs model.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07454.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Surface representation of Fab D3H44; residues at the interface are colored according to their contribution (in percentage) to <bold>(A)</bold> the buried surface area (BSA) of Fab upon complex formation and <bold>(B)</bold> the total number of inter-residue contacts (ICs) made.</title><p>Increasing graduation of pink is used for the ranges 0–2%, 2–4%, 4–6%, and above 6% of BSA/ICs contribution.

This resulted in a dataset of 122 complexes, covering diverse types of biological functions including antibody/antigen (A or AB with bound antibody, 10 cases), enzyme/inhibitors (EI, 34 cases), enzyme/substrate (ES, 9 cases), enzyme/regulatory subunit (ER, 7 cases), G-protein containing (OG, 15 cases), membrane receptors (OR, 7 cases), miscellaneous (OX, 26 cases), and non-cognate complexes (NC, 9 cases).

Please try to find the underlying reason for this. I suspect I know the reason</italic>.</p><p>To shed light about the better performance of ICs vs BSA, we analyzed in detail some cases comparing differences between interface residues in terms of their their BSA and ICs. In the revisited manuscript we report the results of this analysis using as test case the complex between the Fab D3H44 and the Tissue factor, focusing the attention on Fab interface (PDB code; 1JPS); the new data are in paragraph “Insights on the difference between ICs and BSA”, including details in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>.</p><p>Considering one of the two interacting protein (but the same concepts applies to the other as well), both ICs and BSA parameters detect roughly the same residues at the interface, but when counting the contribution of each residue to the total BSA and ICs the results can greatly vary. To highlight this, we calculate the relative contribution (percentage) of each residue to the total BSA or number of ICs.</p><p>We found the following aspects:</p><p>The contribution of a residue to the ICs mostly depends on its position with respect to the binding partner rather than its solvent accessibility: every core residues (even those rather buried already in the free form), i.e. the ones positioned at the center of the binding site equally facing the interacting partner, have about the same contribution to the total ICs value (around 6% in the reported example case).</p><p>The contribution of each residue to the BSA highly depends on its ASA in the free form instead of its relative position with respect to the binding partner. Indeed, as BSA <sub>protein</sub> = ASA<sub>protein_free</sub> – ASA<sub>protein_in_complex</sub>, the core residues will be almost totally shielded by the interacting protein (means ASA<sub>protein _ in_complex</sub> ∼ 0), resulting in BSA<sub>protein</sub> ∼ ASA<sub>protein_free</sub>. This implies that residues already quite buried in the free form will have small contribution while they still might make several contacts. This results in an unequal contribution of residues in the interface (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As an illustration, in the example case reported in the revisited paragraph, ASP_H52, which has a ASA of ∼ 20 Å<sup>2</sup> in the free form, contributes poorly to the BSA while still forming 4 ICs. Further examples are reported in the text (subsection “Insights on the difference between ICs and BSA”). This dependency of the BSA on the ASA of the free form brings an unequal evaluation of core residues and an underestimation of partially buried residues located anyhow in an optimal position to contact the partner. The ICs seem less biased toward the size of the residue itself and more influenced by its orientation with respect to the binding partner.</p><p><italic>The fact that the 4Å cutoff is optimal is significant, in my opinion. The authors should try to explain</italic>.</p><p>The 4Å cutoff is indeed close to the well accepted value of 3.9Å used to define non -bonded contacts for example in the ligplot/dimplot software. This optimal value was obtained considering the complete initial dataset; however, after removing the data collected with less reliable experimental methods we re- optimize such threshold up to 5.5 Å, at which we got the highest Pearson’s correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic>) of -0.59. We then kept this 5.5Å cutoff for the further analysis on the reliable dataset.</p><p>This 5.5Å threshold allows us to include different non-bonded interactions, including salt-bridged (often counted up to 5Å cutoff).</p><p><italic>It is not clear that the minimum correlation is at 20Å, since this is the largest interface distance tested</italic>.</p><p>Considering it is a new approach to correlate contacts with the binding affinity, we tested the impact of distance threshold on the correlation, checking correlations in the range between 3.0 Å and 20.0 Å. We observed the maximum correlation at 5.5 Å followed by a gradually drop off (reaching the low significant value of <italic>R</italic> = -0.18); therefore we would not expect an increasing of it after 20.0 Å. Also increasing the cutoff further would make the ICs dependent on the protein sizes as more contacts will be detected for larger proteins, even at similar interface sizes.</p><p><italic>Mean absolute error is not a very standard error measure. Please use a measure that is more common in the literature</italic>.</p><p>We changed it reporting the more commonly used Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (for instance as reported in Moal et al. Bioinformatics 2011).</p><p><italic>The fact that only three fitting parameters were used effectively eliminates the possibility of overfitting. Still, I think the success of the method raises important questions. Do all contacts contribute equally to BA? What if contacts were to be grouped into e.g. salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, etc.? I don't think it would be hard to count these. Horton and Lewis did something like this, separating polar from nonpolar buried surface area. I don't see that they report the error, but their</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"><italic>Table 2</italic></xref> <italic>suggests it is comparable to that in the present work. Chothia and Janin also indicate the importance of separating polar and nonpolar contacts</italic>.</p><p>This was an excellent suggestion! Following the reviewer suggestion, we checked if all residues contributed equally to the ICs parameter classifying them (and the resulting contact classes) according to their polar/apolar/charged character and to their hydrophobic/hydrophilic one. We trained multiple models using those different classifications. The results have been reported in the new paragraph “Structural properties contributing to binding affinity”<italic>,</italic> with updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and two new supplementary tables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2 tbl3">Table 2 and 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>As foreseen by the reviewer, the correlations improve in all the classification considered. In particular, from a correlation of <italic>R</italic>= -0.59 when considering all the ICs, we obtained a correlation of -0.67 and -0.60 for the polarity- and hydrophobicity- based classification, respectively. Improvements have been observed also for the BSA, which <italic>R</italic> went from -0.46 to -0.48 when polarity classification has been considered.</p><p>Based on these new findings, we then trained the combined ICs/NIS (Non Interacting Surface, in Kastritis et al. JMB 2014) models using polarity-based ICs classification. From <italic>R</italic>= -0.67 obtained in the previous version of the work, we reached a correlation of <italic>R</italic>= -0.73 in this revisited version!</p><p>Finally, due to the fact that some of the tested models were trained on more than 3 parameters, we applied the AIC method to detect only the significant variables bypassing the risk of overfitting (details added in the Materials and methods section, paragraph “Correlations, prediction power and cross-validation”).</p><p><italic>The current results are not compared quantitatively to methods from the literature. Doing this would make it clear to what extent the new method is better than the existing ones</italic>.</p><p>We added this part (subsection “The effect of conformational changes on binding affinity prediction accuracy” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), providing comparisons with a large number of other methods (110 in total). From the plot it is clear that our method outperforms all reported ones and is also the most robust in case of conformational changes.</p><p><italic>In general I think this paper is promising. I don't doubt that it will eventually be published, either here or elsewhere. However the questions it raises ought to be answered. Otherwise this paper will merely report a phenomenon, without adding understanding. Also the comparison to past methods should be improved</italic>.</p><p>We hope the new insights we added and the clear comparison with the past methods made clearer the new aspects (and performance) presented in the work.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>It is an interesting work dealing with the prediction of energies of protein - protein interactions.
