glycosylation, which can impact cancer progression and therapeutic responses. The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) produces uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a major substrate for glycosylation in the cell. Prior studies have identified the HBP as a promising therapeutic target in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). The HBP requires both glucose and glutamine for its initiation. The PDA tumor microenvironment is nutrient poor, however, prompting us to investigate how nutrient limitation impacts hexosamine synthesis. Here, we identify that glutamine limitation in PDA cells suppresses de novo hexosamine synthesis but results in increased free GlcNAc abundance. GlcNAc salvage via N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK) is engaged to feed UDP-GlcNAc pools. <italic>NAGK</italic> expression is elevated in human PDA, and <italic>NAGK</italic> deletion from PDA cells impairs tumor growth in mice. Together, these data identify an important role for NAGK-dependent hexosamine salvage in supporting PDA tumor growth.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside tumors, cancer cells often have to compete with each other for food and other resources they need to survive. This is a key factor driving the growth and progression of cancer. One of the resources cells need is a molecule called UDP-GlcNAc, which they use to modify many proteins so they can work properly. Because cancer cells grow quickly, they likely need much more UDP-GlcNAc than healthy cells.</p><p>Many tumors, including those derived from pancreatic cancers, have very poor blood supplies, so their cells cannot get the nutrients and other resources they need to grow from the bloodstream. This means that tumor cells have to find new ways to use what they already have. One example of this is developing alternative ways to obtain UDP-GlcNAc. Cells require a nutrient called glutamine to produce UDP-GlcNAc. Limiting the supply of glutamine to cells allows researchers to study how cells are producing UDP-GlcNAc in the lab.</p><p>Campbell et al. used this approach to study how pancreatic cancer cells obtain UDP-GlcNAc when their access to glutamine is limited. They used a technique called isotope tracing, which allows researchers to track how a specific chemical is processed inside the cell, and what it turns into. The results showed that the pancreatic cancer cells do not make new UDP-GlcNAc but use a protein called NAGK to salvage GlcNAc (another precursor of UDP-GlcNAc), which may be obtained from cellular proteins. Cancer cells that lacked NAGK formed smaller tumors, suggesting that the cells grow more slowly because they cannot recycle UDP-GlcNAc fast enough.</p><p>Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer deaths and is notable for being difficult to detect and treat. Campbell et al. have identified one of the changes that allows pancreatic cancers to survive and grow quickly. Next steps will include examining the role of NAGK in healthy cells and testing whether it could be targeted for cancer treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group

frequently observed in malignancies, impacting tumor growth as well as immune and therapeutic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akella et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mereiter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Munkley, 2019</xref>). Several types of glycosylation, including O-GlcNAcylation and N-linked glycosylation, are dependent on the glycosyl donor uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which is synthesized by the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). The HBP branches off from glycolysis with the transfer of glutamineâs amido group to fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P) to generate glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P), mediated by the rate limiting enzyme glutamineâfructose-6-phosphate transaminase (GFPT1/2). The pathway further requires acetyl-CoA, ATP, and uridine triphosphate (UTP) to ultimately generate UDP-GlcNAc. O-GlcNAcylation, the addition of a single N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moiety onto a serine or threonine residue of intracellular proteins, is upregulated in multiple cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akella et al., 2019</xref>). Targeting O-GlcNAcylation suppresses the growth of breast, prostate, and colon cancer tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Caldwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferrer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, highly branched N-glycan structures are sensitive to HBP flux and are upregulated in malignant tissueÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lau et al., 2007</xref>), and targeting the relevant Golgi GlcNAc transferase enzymes can limit tumor growth and metastasis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Granovsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, improved understanding ofÂ the regulation of the HBP in cancer could point towards novel therapeutic strategies.</p><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a deadly disease with a 5 year survival rate of 9% and a rising number of annual deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rahib et al., 2014</xref>) (ACS Cancer Facts and Figures 2019, NIH SEER report 2019). Mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic> occur in nearly all cases of human PDA and drive extensive metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. Enhanced flux into the HBP was identified as a primary metabolic feature mediated by mutant KRAS in PDA cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ying et al., 2012</xref>). Hypoxia, a salient characteristic of the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lyssiotis and Kimmelman, 2017</xref>), was shown to further promote expression of glycolysis and HBP genes in pancreatic cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guillaumond et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, the glutamine analog 6-diazo-5-oxo-<sc>l</sc>-norleucine (DON), which inhibited the HBP, suppressed PDA metastasis, and sensitized PDA tumors to anti-PD1 therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>). DON has also been reported to sensitize PDA cells to the chemotherapeutic gemcitabine in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, a recently developed inhibitor targeting the HBP enzyme phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase 3 (PGM3) enhances gemcitabine-mediated reduction of xenograft tumor growth in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ricciardiello et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the HBP may represent a therapeutic target in PDA, although the regulation of UDP-GlcNAc synthesis and the optimal strategies to target this pathway for therapeutic benefit in PDA remain poorly understood.</p><p>An outstanding question is the impact of the tumor microenvironment on UDP-GlcNAc synthesis. The HBP has been proposed as a nutrient-sensing pathway since its rate-limiting step, mediated by GFPT1/2, requires both glutamine and the glycolytic intermediate fructose-6-phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Denzel and Antebi, 2015</xref>). In hematopoietic cells, glucose deprivation limits UDP-GlcNAc levels and dramatically reduces levels of the N-glycoprotein IL3RÎ± at the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on the HBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wellen et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, O-GlcNAcylation of certain nuclear-cytosolic proteins, including cancer-relevant proteins such as Myc and Snail, has been demonstrated to be nutrient sensitive, impacting protein stability or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Housley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Swamy et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, the PDA tumor microenvironment is thought to be particularly nutrient poor, owing to its characteristic dense stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Halbrook and Lyssiotis, 2017</xref>). This raises the question of how nutrient deprivation impacts the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc and its utilization for glycosylation. Understanding how PDA cells regulate these processes under nutrient limitation could identify therapeutic vulnerabilities. In this study, we investigated the impact of nutrient deprivation on the HBP and glycosylation in PDA cells, identifying a key role for hexosamine salvage through the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK) in PDA tumor growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tetra-antennary N-glycans and O-GlcNAcylation are minimally impacted by nutrient limitation in pancreatic cancer cells</title><p>To examine the effects of nutrient deprivation on glycosylation, we cultured cells under glucose or glutamine limitation and examined O-GlcNAc levels and cell surface phytohemagglutinin-L (L-PHA) binding, a readout of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 5 (MGAT5)-mediated cell surface N-glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>), which are highly sensitive to UDP-GlcNAc availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lau et al., 2007</xref>). We focused on glucose and glutamine because of their requirement to initiate the HBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, as a positive control, we examined HCT-116 and SW480 colon cancer cells, previously documented to have glucose-responsive O-GlcNAcylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steenackers et al., 2016</xref>), which we also confirmed in HCT-116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Indeed, L-PHA binding was suppressed by glucose restriction in SW480 cells and by glutamine restriction in both colon cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, to test whether glycans were sensitive to nutrient restriction in PDA cells, we examined L-PHA binding and O-GlcNAc levels under nutrient deprivation conditions in a panel of human PDA cell lines, including PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2, AsPC-1, and HPAC. Across these cell lines, no consistent changes in L-PHA binding were observed under glucose or glutamine limitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). We also examined L-PHA binding in PDA cells under oxygen- or serum-deprived conditions and observed minimal changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D,E</xref>). O-GlcNAcylation was minimally altered by culture in low glutamine and exhibited variable changes in response to glucose limitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), consistent with stress-induced regulation of this modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taylor et al., 2008</xref>). Since glycosylation may be maintained through either sustained ability to add the modifications or through changes in turnover, we assayed active O-GlcNAcylation by inhibiting O-GlcNAcase with Thiamet G (TMG). TMG treatment resulted in equivalently elevated O-GlcNAcylation levels in high and low glutamine conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating that glutamine restriction does not limit the capacity of cells to add the O-GlcNAc modification. Mia-PaCa-2 cells exhibited some cell death in low glutamine, though this was not exacerbated by TMG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, under a variety of nutrient stress conditions, neither L-PHA binding nor O-GlcNAcylation were consistently suppressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Glutamine restriction in particular had remarkably little impact on O-GlcNAcylation and L-PHA binding, raising the question of how UDP-GlcNAc is generated during nutrient limitation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MGAT5-dependent N-glycans are minimally impacted by glucose or glutamine deprivation in PDA cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP).

In addition to de novo synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc via the HBP, free GlcNAc in the cell can also be phosphorylated via N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK) to produce GlcNAc-P and then regenerate UDP-GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, NAGKâs roles in physiology and cancer biology have been minimally studied. To investigate the possibility that UDP-GlcNAc is generated through mechanisms other than its synthesis from glucose, we first designed a stable isotope labeling strategy to quantify the fraction of the glucosamine ring that is synthesized de novo in glutamine-replete versus -restricted conditions. Since multiple components of UDP-GlcNAc [glucosamine ring, acetyl group, uridine (both the uracil nucleobase and the ribose ring)] can be synthesized from glucose, UDP-GlcNAc isotopologs up to M+16 can be generated from glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moseley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In order to measure the glucose carbon incorporated into GlcNAc-P and UDP-GlcNAc via the HBP, all isotopologs containing a fully labeled glucosamine ring are added together (% labeled GlcN indicates sum of M+6, M+8, M+11, and M+13 for UDP-GlcNAc and sum of M+6 and M+8 for GlcNAc-P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>After 48 hr of glutamine restriction, cells were incubated with fresh low glutamine medium containing [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose to track the incorporation of glucose carbons into hexosamine intermediates. Across multiple PDA cell lines, the fractional labeling of the glucosamine ring in both GlcNAc-P and UDP-GlcNAc pools was markedly suppressed by glutamine restriction, indicating decreased de novo synthesis in low glutamine conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1CâE</xref>). Notably, labeling into the ribose component of UDP-GlcNAc was also suppressed (% labeled ribose indicates sum of isotopologs containing M+5 [i.e., M+5, M+7, M+11, and M+13]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistently, incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C glucose into UTP was suppressed upon glutamine restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), even though UTP levels were maintained or increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting a role for nucleoside salvage in maintaining nucleotide pool in these conditions. This is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that autophagy/ribophagy is a source of nucleosides in amino acid-deprived conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wyant et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, silencing of either of the uridine salvage enzymes uridine kinase 1 or 2 (UCK1/2) resulted in decreased UDP, UTP, and UDP-GlcNAc levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B,C</xref>), indicating that nucleoside salvage contributes to maintaining uridine phosphate and UDP-GlcNAc pools.Â Thus, glutamine restriction suppresses the de novo synthesis of both GlcNAc-P and UTP, both of which are required to produce UDP-GlcNAc.</p><p>We noted that GlcNAc-P and UDP-GlcNAc pools labeled from glucose with similar but not identical kinetics. While this is potentially due to limitations in detection since GlcNAc-P is much less abundant than UDP-GlcNAc, we considered whether GlcNAc-P-independent pathways may also have minor contributions to glucose-dependent UDP-GlcNAc labeling. Although pathways through which glucose can feed into UDP-GlcNAcâs glucosamine ring independent of the HBP have not been described in mammalian cells to our knowledge, we nevertheless tested the two major metabolic branch points diverging from UDP-GlcNAc, which mediate UDP-GalNAc and sialic acid synthesis. UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (GALE) interconverts UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc, and UDP-GlcNAc-2-epimerase/ManAc kinase (GNE) initiates sialic acid biosynthesis. Silencing of neither GALE nor GNE reduced UDP-GlcNAc labeling from glucose, however, indicating that these enzymes are unlikely to facilitate a bypass pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D,E</xref>). Although a minor contribution from another unknown pathway cannot be ruled out, the slight apparent differences in timing of GlcNAc-P and UDP-GlcNAc labeling most likely reflect technical limitations.

Removal of the phosphatase inhibitor Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> from the sample buffer prevented the mobility shift, suggesting that NAGK may be phosphorylated on one or more residues in low glutamine conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3D</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that under low glutamine conditions, GlcNAc availability for salvage increases and the salvage enzyme NAGK is subject to regulation.</p><p>These findings prompted us to investigate the role of NAGK in UDP-GlcNAc synthesis in PDA cells. We functionally examined the role of NAGK in PDA cell lines by using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to generate NAGK knockout (KO) PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 clonal cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>). N-[1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]acetyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine (<sup>13</sup>C GlcNAc) was efficiently salvaged in control cells, and this was suppressed by NAGK deletion, as evidenced by reduced fractional labeling of GlcNAc-P and UDP-GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Since we did not observe any residual protein expression, we hypothesized that the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) salvage enzyme GalNAc kinase (GALK2) might be responsible for the remaining GlcNAc salvage in the absence of NAGK. Indeed, silencing of GALK2 further suppressed incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C GlcNAc into GlcNAc-P and UDP-GlcNAc in the NAGK KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that knockout cells would conversely conduct increased de novo UDP-GlcNAc synthesis. To test this, we incubated cells with [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose and examined incorporation into GlcNAc-P and UDP-GlcNAc. Indeed, in the absence of NAGK, we observed increased glucose-dependent fractional labeling of the glucosamine ring of UDP-GlcNAc and GlcNAc-P, but not the ribose component of UDP-GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D,E</xref>). This effect was also observed with knockdown of NAGK by shRNA, though to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Incorporation of glucose into F-6-P did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and the proportion of UDP-GlcNAc containing an M+5 ribose ring was also unchanged in knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), as expected. Thus, when NAGK is deleted and GlcNAc salvage is suppressed, de novo hexosamine synthesis increases.</p><p>We next assessed changes in the levels of hexosamine intermediates in control and NAGK KO cell lines. In PANC-1 KO cells in 4 mM glutamine, GlcN-P increased significantly, consistent with increased de novo synthesis in the absence of NAGK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). GlcNAc-P was modestly reduced in KO cells, though UDP-GlcNAc levels were maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In MIA PaCa-2 cells, GlcNAc-P was markedly suppressed in the absence of NAGK, though UDP-GlcNAc was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). We also measured HBP metabolites under glutamine restriction, where we expected NAGK would play a more significant role in UDP-GlcNAc generation. We were only able to measure metabolites accurately in PANC-1 KO cells because MIA PaCa-2 NAGK KO cells began to die quickly in low glutamine, which will be discussed further in the next section. GlcN-P decreased in control and KO cells, consistent with reduced de novo hexosamine synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). GlcNAc-P levels decreased in low glutamine in control cells and decreased further in cells lacking NAGK, consistent with contributions from both de novo synthesis and salvage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Reciprocally, GlcNAc abundance was elevated upon glutamine limitation in both control and NAGK KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). UDP-GlcNAc abundance was modestly reduced in NAGK KO cells relative to controls under glutamine restriction, though levels were still comparable to that in high glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), possibly reflecting changes in utilization. GALK2 silencing did not further suppress UDP-GlcNAc in NAGK KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D</xref>), suggesting that GALK2 may not have a major role in physiological GlcNAc salvage.

From analysis of publicly available microarray data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pei et al., 2009</xref>) and gene expression data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we indeed found <italic>NAGK</italic> expression to be increased in tumor tissue relative to adjacent normal regions of the pancreas or to pancreas GTEx data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). <italic>GFPT1</italic> expression was also increased in tumor tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), consistent with its regulation by mutant KRAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ying et al., 2012</xref>). Two other HBP genes, <italic>PGM3</italic> and <italic>UAP1</italic>, did not show significantly increased expression in PDA tumors in these datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We then studied the role of NAGK in tumor growth in vivo by injecting NAGK CRISPR KO cells into the flank of NCr nude mice. Final tumor volume and weight were markedly reduced in the absence of NAGK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4CâD</xref>). Of note, initial tumor growth was comparable between control and KO cells, but the NAGK knockout tumors either stopped growing or shrank while control tumors continued to grow larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Interestingly, KO tumor samples showed increased L-PHA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that NAGK deficiency results in altered glycosylation within tumors. This could possibly reflect either elevated de novo synthesis in the small tumors that form or differences in cellular composition. For example, activated fibroblast marker Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA) was more abundant in the NAGK KO tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Residual NAGK signal in whole tumors also presumably reflects expression in other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), since NAGK was undetectable in the clonal cell lines used for injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Taken together, these data are consistent with the notion that NAGK is dispensable when nutrients are abundant but becomes more important as the tumors outgrow their original nutrient supply and become more dependent on scavenging and recycling and indicate that NAGK-mediated hexosamine salvage supports tumor growth in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we identify a key role for NAGK in salvaging GlcNAc for UDP-GlcNAc synthesis in PDA cells. We show that glutamine deprivation suppresses de novo hexosamine biosynthesis, which is reciprocally increased upon NAGK deletion. Glutamine deprivation also results in increased availability of GlcNAc for salvage. <italic>NAGK</italic> expression is elevated in human PDA tumors, and NAGK deficiency suppresses GlcNAc salvage in cells and tumor growth in mice.</p><p>This work raises several key questions for future investigation. First, the sources of GlcNAc salvaged by NAGK remain to be fully elucidated. GlcNAc may be derived from recycling of GlcNAc following O-GlcNAc removal or breakdown of glycoconjugates. Additionally, GlcNAc may be recovered from the environment. Nutrient scavenging via macropinocytosis is a key feature of PDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Commisso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamphorst et al., 2015</xref>). Macropinocytosis has mostly been associated with scavenging of protein to recover amino acids, but lysosomal break down of glycoproteins may also release sugars including GlcNAc. Additionally, ECM components, including hyaluronic acid (HA), which is a polymer of GlcNAc and glucuronic acid disaccharide units, may be additional sources of GlcNAc for salvage in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, in a manuscript co-submitted with this one, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2020</xref>Â identify HA as a major source of scavenged GlcNAcÂ . Our manuscript and the Kimet al.âs manuscript together indicate that NAGK may take on a heightened importance in the context of high GlcNAc availability and nutrient deprivation, a situation that is likely to occur within the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>Furthermore, the key fates of UDP-GlcNAc that support tumor growth remain to be elucidated. Sufficient UDP-GlcNAc is required for protein glycosylation to maintain homeostasis and prevent ER stress, particularly in a rapidly dividing cell. Additionally, a wide range of cancers exhibit elevated O-GlcNAc, which could contribute to driving pro-tumorigenic transcriptional and signaling programs. In PDA specifically, the glycan CA19-9 is currently used as a biomarker for disease progression and recent studies point to a functional role for CA19-9 in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Engle et al., 2019</xref>). UDP-GlcNAc is also required for HA synthesis, which is present in low amounts in normal pancreas but increases in PanIN lesions and PDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Provenzano et al., 2012</xref>). PDA cells are capable of producing HA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mahlbacher et al., 1992</xref>). Depletion of fibroblasts in an autochthonous PDA mouse model results in a decrease in collagen I, but not HA in the tumor microenvironment, indicating that HA must be generated by another cell type, possibly the tumor cells themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ãzdemir et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that treatment of PDA with exogenous hyaluronidase can increase vascularization and improve drug delivery to the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacobetz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Provenzano et al., 2012</xref>), although a phase III clinical trial reported no improvement in overall patient survival when combining pegylated hyaluronidase with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Van Cutsem et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, it was shown that inhibiting the HBP by treatment with DON depletes HA and collagen in an orthotopic mouse model. DON treatment also increased CD8 T-cell infiltration into the tumor, sensitizing the tumor to anti-PD1 therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, targeting the HBP holds promise for improving the efficacy of other therapeutics. The findings of the current study suggest that in addition to de novo hexosamine synthesis, targeting of hexosamine salvage warrants further investigation in terms of potential for therapeutic intervention. Of note, an inhibitor targeting PGM3, which converts GlcNAc-6-P to GlcNAc-1-P and is thus required for both de novo UDP-GlcNAc synthesis and GlcNAc recycling, showed efficacy in treating gemcitabine-resistant patient-derived xenograft PDA models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ricciardiello et al., 2020</xref>), as well as in breast cancer xenografts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ricciardiello et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Finally, almost nothing is currently known about the role of NAGK and GlcNAc salvage in normal physiology. Even in non-cancerous IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cells, a substantial proportion of the UDP-GlcNAc pool remains unlabeled from <sup>13</sup>C-glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wellen et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that salvage may contribute to UDP-GlcNAc pools in a variety of cell types. However, while GFPT1 is required for embryonic development in mice, NAGK knockout mouse embryos are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dickinson et al., 2016</xref>). NAGK deficiency has not yet been characterized in postnatal or adult mice. Perhaps GlcNAc salvage is dispensable when nutrients are available and cells are not dividing, as in most healthy tissues. However, in a tumor, in which cells are proliferating and nutrients are spread thin, NAGK and GlcNAc salvage may become more important in feeding UDP-GlcNAc pools. Related questions include elucidating the mechanisms regulating NAGK gene expression and putative post-translational modification, as well as understanding the role of GALK2 in hexosamine salvage.</p><p>In sum, we report a key role for NAGK in feeding UDP-GlcNAc pools in PDA cells and in supporting xenograft tumor growth. Further investigation will be needed to elucidate the physiological functions of NAGK, as well as the mechanisms through which it supports tumor growth and its potential role in modulating therapeutic responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Antibodies used in this study wereÂ asÂ follows: O-GlcNAc CTD110.6 (Cell Signaling 9875S), tubulin (Sigma T6199), HSP60 (Cell Signaling 12165S), NAGK (Atlas Antibodies, HPA035207), and PARP (Cell Signaling 9532).</p><p>For blots showing the mobility shift for NAGK in low glutamine, samples were prepared in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma, I3021), 1 mM PMSF, 1.5 ÂµM aprotinin, 84 ÂµM leupeptin, 1 ÂµM pepstatin A, Â±10 mM NaF, and 20 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> as indicated. To visualize the NAGK mobility shift in response to low glutamine, 20 Âµg total protein per sample was separated across 12.5 cm of 11% SDS-PAGE resolving space under reducing conditions using the large electrophoresis systems available from C.B.S. Scientific until approximately 3 cm of separation was obtained between the 25 and 37 kDa protein standards (Bio-Rad; 1610375). Using electrophoresis, proteins were transferred (30 V, 4Â°C, overnight) to 0.45 ÂµM pore size nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, 10600002). The primary antibodies used were NAGK (Proteintech, 15051â1-AP), AKT phosphoS473 (Cell Signaling Technology, 4060), and Vinculin (Sigma, V9264). Membranes were developed using the LI-COR Odyssey CLx system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RT-qPCR</title><p>For RNA extraction from cells, cells were put on ice, washed with PBS, and scraped into PBS. Samples were then spun down at 200 g for 5 min and resuspended in 100 ÂµL Trizol (Life Technologies). For RNA extraction from tissue, samples were resuspended in 500 Î¼L Trizol and homogenized using a TissueLyser twice for 30 s at 20 Hz. For both cells and tissue, RNA was extracted following the Trizol manufacturer protocol. cDNA was prepared using high-capacity RNA-to-cDNA master mix (Applied Biosystems, 4368814) according to kit instructions. cDNA was diluted 1:20 and amplified with PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, A25778) using a ViiA-7 Real-Time PCR system. Fold change in expression was calculated by the ÎÎC<sub>t</sub> method using HPRT as a control. Please see table at end of chapter for primer sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Lectin binding assay</title><p>Cells were put on ice, washed with PBS, and then scraped into PBS. Samples were then spun down at 200 g for 5 min and resuspended in 3% BSA with fluorophore-conjugated lectin added 1:1000 (Vector Labs FL-1111â2). Samples were covered and incubated on ice for 30 min at room temperature, then spun down, and resuspended in PBS before analysis with an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data was further analyzed using FlowJo 8.7.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Metabolite quantitation and labeling</title><p>For all metabolite quantitation experiments, each sample was collected from a 10 cm sub-confluent plate of cells. To achieve similar confluency and protein content at the experiment endÂ point, cells were initially plated more densely for the nutrient-deprived samples than for the nutrient-replete samples. For low glutamine experiments, PANC-1 cells were plated 3 ÃÂ 10<sup>5</sup> for 4 mM glutamine samples and 5.5 ÃÂ 10<sup>5</sup> for 0.05 mM samples. MIA PaCa-2 cells were plated 3 ÃÂ 10<sup>5</sup> for 4 mM samples and 1.2 ÃÂ 10<sup>6</sup> for 0.05 mM samples.</p><p>Samples were prepared according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2016b</xref>. Briefly, cells were put on ice and washed 3Ã with PBS. Then, 1 mL of ice cold 80% methanol was added to the plate, and cells were scraped into solvent and transferred to a 1.5 mL tube. For quantitation experiments, internal standard containing a mix of <sup>13</sup>C labeled metabolites was added at this time. Samples were then sonicated and spun down, and the supernatants were dried down under nitrogen. The dried samples were then resuspended in 100 ÂµL of 5% sulfosalicylic acid and analyzed by liquid chromatographyâhigh-resolution mass spectrometry as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2016b</xref>) with the only modification that the LC was coupled to a Q Exactive-HF with a heated ESI source operating in negative-ion mode alternating full scan and MS/MS modes. The [M-H]<sup>â</sup> ion of each analyte and its internal standard was quantified, with peak confirmation by MS/MS. GlcNAc quantification was done on a triple quadropole instrument exactly as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2016b</xref>). Data analysis was conducted in Thermo XCalibur 3.0 Quan Browser and FluxFix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Trefely et al., 2016</xref>). For quantitation experiments, samples were normalized first to peak integrations of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled internal standard components and then to protein content in the sample, measured by BCA assay. Relative quantification was then calculated by normalizing to the control condition in each experiment.</p><p>For glucose labeling experiments, cells were cultured in DMEM without glucose, glutamine, or phenol red supplemented with 10 mM [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose (Cambridge Isotopes, CLM-1396â1), 4 mM glutamine, and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated for the indicated time, and samples were prepared as above. For GlcNAc labeling experiments, cells were cultured in DMEM without glucose, glutamine, or phenol red supplemented with 10 mM N-[1,2â13 C2]acetyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine (<sup>13</sup>C GlcNAc) (Omicron Biochemicals, GLC-006), 4 mM glutamine, 10 mM glucose, and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated for the indicated time, and samples were prepared as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Soft agar colony formation assay</title><p>Cells were trypsinized and counted using a Bright-Line hemacytometer (Sigma, Z359629). The bottom agar layer was prepared by adding Bacto Agar (BD Bioscience, 214050) to cell culture media for a final concentration of 0.6%. TwoÂ milliliter bottom agar was added to each well of a six-well tissue culture plate. Once bottom agar solidified, top layer agar was prepared by combining trypsinized cells with the bottom agar mix for a final concentration of 0.3% Bacto Agar. OneÂ milliliter top layer agar was added to each well with a bottom layer of agar. Cells were plated 2.5 ÃÂ 10<sup>4</sup> per well. 0.5 mL DMEM high glucose with 10% calf serum was added to cells every 7 days. Images were taken after 3 weeks. Images were blinded, and colonies per image were counted using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>2D proliferation assay</title><p>Cells were plated 3.5 ÃÂ 10<sup>4</sup> per well of a six-well plate. For each day that counts were recorded, three wells were trypsinized and cells were counted twice using a hemocytometer (Sigma, Z359629). The average of the two counts was recorded for each well, and the average count of the three wells was used to graph the data. For proliferation assays in 0.05 mM glutamine, trypan blue was used during cell counts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Bioinformatics data analysis</title><p>The PDAC expression profiling dataset (GEO accession GSE16515, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pei et al., 2009</xref>) from NCBI GEO Profile database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edgar et al., 2002</xref>) was used to compare the expression level between human normal and PDAC tumor samples. The dataset consists of 52 samples, in which 16 samples are matched tumor and normal tissues, and 20 samples are only tumor tissues. The statistical analysis was conducted by one-way ANOVA; the level of significance was evaluated by p&lt;0.01 and plotted in box-and-whisker diagram. Comparison of HBP gene expression between tumor (TCGA PAAD dataset) and normal tissue (GTEx) was also conducted using GEPIA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tang et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Tumor growth in vivo</title><p>3 ÃÂ 10<sup>6</sup> PANC-1 NAGK CRISPR cells were injected with 1:1 Matrigel (Corning, CB354248) into the flanks of NCr nude mice and measured with calipers once per week for 22 weeks. At the experiment endÂ point (22 weeks or when tumor reached 20 mm in length), mice were euthanized with CO<sub>2</sub> and cervical dislocation. Tumors were removed, weighed, cut into pieces for analysis, and frozen. All animal experiments were approved by the University of Pennsylvania and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Funding sources: This work was supported by R01CA174761 and R01CA228339 to KEW.

maintain metabolite pools in the context of nutrient scarcity. How tumors, in particular notoriously-nutrient deprived tumors found in the pancreas, sustain survival and proliferation in the face of nutrient limitation is an area of profound interest to the fields of cancer and metabolism. Here, the authors identify a hexosamine salvage pathway that enables pancreatic cancer cells to maintain precursors required for protein glycosylation even in the context of severe nutrient restriction. The authors find that glutamine restriction activates N-acetylglucosamine salvage mediated by the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK) and identify NAGK as a critical mediator of pancreatic cancer cell growth in vivo. This work reveals the interplay between de novo synthesis and salvage of metabolites required for protein glycosylation and provides insight into the mechanisms underpinning the metabolic plasticity and resilience of pancreatic tumors.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Glutamine deprivation triggers NAGK-dependent hexosamine salvage&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at eLife&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate mechanisms by which pancreatic cancer cells maintain UDP-GlcNAc pools for protein glycosylation within a nutrient-poor microenvironment. This work gains significance in light of recent publications documenting the importance of protein glycosylation for PDAC progression (i.e., PMID: 30853214, PMID: 29100056) and provides evidence in support of a novel mechanism by which pancreatic cancer cells maintain metabolite pools in the context of nutrient scarcity. The authors report the surprising observation that cultured pancreatic cancer cells appear to preserve protein glycosylation despite reduced glutamine availability. The proposed mechanism implicates NAGK as a mediator of GlcNAc salvage for UDP-GlcNAc synthesis under glutamine deprivation, which both suppresses de novo UDP-GlcNAc synthesis through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway and induces NAGK expression. NAGK has been the subject of very little study in cancer and is entirely uncharacterized in pancreatic cancer to date, underscoring the novelty of this work and its likelihood to open up new lines of investigation in PDAC and other cancer types. Though the authors' focus on glutamine is understandable, experiments under glucose-limiting conditions are also performed here given the requirement for both nutrients to initiate the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, and glucose restriction is relevant to the pancreatic tumor microenvironment (PMID: 30990168). Further examination of the significance of low-glucose conditions for NAGK activity and UDP-GlcNAc maintenance in PDAC cells would be helpful to place these findings in context. The authors should additionally address the following points to clarify their model and strengthen their conclusions:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The reviewers expressed some confusion with isotope tracing data presented in Figure 2 and Figure S2. Figure S2 shows no apparent M+6 in GlcNAc-P (in contrast to what is shown in Figure 2) and a similar amount of M+6 enrichment in UDP-GlcNAc in both high and low glutamine conditions, contrasting with reduced M+6 following glutamine deprivation in Figure 2C. Is it possible that Figure 2C might be showing M+8 for GlcNAc-P (middle) and M+5 for UTP (bottom), instead of what is listed? A related question based on Figure 2C is why, under glutamine restriction, GlcNAc-P labeling is completely abolished but labeling of UDP-GlcNAc (which is downstream) is only decreased by about half?</p><p>Given the potential issues with these data, it is hard to evaluate the conclusion that glucose tracing to UDP-GlcNAc is reduced during conditions of low glutamine. Importantly, Figure S2C appears to show that both M+6 and M+8 of UDP-GlcNAc is maintained during low glutamine, raising the possibility that synthesis of the glucosamine ring is not disrupted by low glutamine, which appears based on Figure S2 to specifically reduce synthesis of UTP. Given the critical importance of these tracing data to the central model of the paper-namely, that glutamine restriction reduces de novo GlcNAc synthesis-it is important for the authors to address these concerns. Additional concerns raised by the isotope tracing data are listed below.</p><p>2. In Figure 1, the authors show that protein glycosylation is preserved in PDAC cells even under low glutamine conditions. Given that PDAC cells are reported to be quite reliant on glutamine availability, is the viability of these cells affected under these growth conditions? Can the authors design experiments to determine whether the modification is maintained because of sustained deposition of GlcNAc or because of changes in cell survival/protein turnover and/or removal of glycoslyation?</p><p>3. It will be important for the authors to investigate whether NAGK deletion affects levels of glycosylation in cultured cells (especially during culture under low glutamine) and, if possible, in tumor samples. Figure 3D shows that UDP-GlcNAc pools are equivalent in NAGK deleted cells cultured in low or high glutamine, which at face value argues against NAGK as an important source of UDP-GlcNAc during glutamine restriction, but this interpretation could be affected by changes in overall cellular capacity for protein glycosylation.</p><p>4. As NAGK loss-of-function experiments are limited to the PANC-1 cell line, the authors should repeat a few key experiments in an additional NAGK knockdown/knockout PDAC cell line.</p><p>5. The authors nicely demonstrate that glutamine deprivation reduces flux through the HBP while inducing NAGK and enabling UDP-GlcNAc maintenance via GlcNAc salvage. The PDAC microenvironment also features restricted levels of glucose, such that PDAC cells face reduced levels of both nutrients relevant to the HBP in intact tumors. However, the impact of glucose restriction on UDP-GlcNAc pools presented in Figure S2B is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the compelling results of in vivo studies presented in Figure 4E and F, which suggest a critical role for NAGK to support PDAC cell proliferation within a nutrient-restricted tumor microenvironment where glucose is relatively low. As glucose levels in PDAC interstitial fluid are reported to be in the low millimolar range (PMID: 30990168), it would be informative to repeat the HBP metabolite measurements at higher glucose levels than those used in the present version of the manuscript and assess whether PDAC cells can maintain UDP-GlcNAc levels under these less stringent but physiologically relevant conditions (perhaps together with glutamine restriction to induce NAGK), and to perform proliferation assays in control versus NAGK knockdown/knockout cells under these glucose-low conditions.</p><p>6. Reviewers requested additional details for the Materials and methods section. Cell seeding numbers and incubation times prior to sample collection should be added to metabolite quantitation and labeling, Western blotting, RT-qPCR and lectin binding assay sections. The normalization methods used for metabolite quantification and isotope correction should be provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62644.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

To make this clear, we have a) changed the labeling on the graphs in Figure 2D to reference the part of the molecule that is labeled, b) provided text edit to explicitly describe how the data is represented, and c) added additional labeling of the graphs in Figure S2.1C-D. We hope the reviewers find the new presentation of the data to be clear.</p><p>2) Discrepancy between GlcNAc-P and UDP-GlcNAc labeling: Thank you for pointing this out. We have now repeated these experiments in PANC-1 cells, as well as in two other PDA cell lines, and we find that while there are some slight differences in the timing of labeling into GlcNAc-P and UDP-GlcNAc, the labeling tracks much more closely than that reported in the initial submission (revised Figure 2D and S2.1C-D). We believe the initial result of complete loss of GlcNAc-P labeling in low glutamine reflected technical limitations in detection. We have further optimized metabolite extraction efficiency, and signal has improved. Now, in multiple repeats in several cell lines, we see markedly suppressed but detectable labeling of GlcNAc-P under glutamine restriction, and this tracks closely with UDP-GlcNAc labeling. Nevertheless, there are subtle differences in the timing of GlcNAc-P and UDP-GlcNAc labeling, particularly in PANC-1 cells where GlcNAc-P labeling under glutamine restriction is very low. To consider the possibility of a minor GlcNAc-P-independent route to UDP-GlcNAc synthesis from glucose, we have also conducted experiments involving silencing of the 2 major pathways that branch off from UDP-GlcNAc to generate UDP-GalNAc or sialic acid. In particular, we hypothesized that the reversible enzyme GALE (UDP-galactase-4-epimerase), which interconverts UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc, would be a plausible candidate to enable entry of glucose carbon into the UDP-GlcNAc pool in a manner independent of GlcNAc-P, although such a route has not been annotated to our knowledge. We also tested GNE (bifunctional UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase), which mediates the first step towards CMP-sialic acid synthesis from UDP-GlcNAc. Glucose-dependent labeling of UDP-GlcNAc was not reduced, however, by silencing of either enzyme in high or low glutamine conditions (revised Figure S2.2D). Thus, the slight difference in incorporation is most likely due to a difference in detection, since UDP-GlcNAc is much more abundant than GlcNAc-P, rather than a bypass route, though we cannot rule out the possibility of a minor contribution from an unknown pathway. We have revised the text to state this. Regardless, the core conclusion that de novo hexosamine synthesis from glucose is suppressed in low glutamine conditions is strongly supported by the data.</p><p>3) Labeling of ribose component of UDP-GlcNAc: In response to the reviewer query, we have also further explored the interesting observation that in addition to reduced de novo synthesis of the glucosamine component of UDP-GlcNAc, labeling of the ribose component is also strikingly reduced in low glutamine conditions (revised Figure 2D, S2.1C, S2.2A). We now explicitly highlight this in Figure 2D. These data suggest that nucleoside salvage is also triggered under low glutamine conditions, which is consistent with findings of a prior study that demonstrated that autophagy sustains uridine phosphate pools in the absence of glutamine (Guo et al., Genes Dev, 2016). Uridine is salvaged via the enzymes uridine-cytidine kinase 1 and 2 (UCK1/2), both of which are expressed in PDA cells. We have used RNAi to silence UCK1 or UCK2, finding that silencing of either enzyme reduces uridine phosphate and UDP-GlcNAc pools (revised Figure S2.2B-C). Thus, the data now clearly indicate that de novo hexosamine and nucleotide synthesis are suppressed in the context of glutamine restriction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 1, the authors show that protein glycosylation is preserved in PDAC cells even under low glutamine conditions. Given that PDAC cells are reported to be quite reliant on glutamine availability, is the viability of these cells affected under these growth conditions? Can the authors design experiments to determine whether the modification is maintained because of sustained deposition of GlcNAc or because of changes in cell survival/protein turnover and/or removal of glycoslyation?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, and we have conducted new experiments to address this point. In revised Figures 1G and S1F, we have explicitly tested the ability of cells to continue to deposit GlcNAc by examining changes in O-GlcNAcylation in the presence of the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor Thiamet G. We demonstrate that under low glutamine conditions, O-GlcNAcylation still actively occurs in low glutamine and to a similar extent to that observed in high glutamine conditions. This supports the model that the modification is maintained at least in part because of sustained deposition of GlcNAc. We have also blotted for cleaved PARP-1 in these experiments to assess viability (Figures 1G and S1F). Additionally, we point out that, as stated in the methods, for all flow experiments we used DAPI or Ï staining to gate out dead cells, so the results in Figure 1 for LPHA staining are representative of live cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It will be important for the authors to investigate whether NAGK deletion affects levels of glycosylation in cultured cells (especially during culture under low glutamine) and, if possible, in tumor samples. Figure 3D shows that UDP-GlcNAc pools are equivalent in NAGK deleted cells cultured in low or high glutamine, which at face value argues against NAGK as an important source of UDP-GlcNAc during glutamine restriction, but this interpretation could be affected by changes in overall cellular capacity for protein glycosylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted several experiments to examine the effects of NAGK deletion on glycosylation. In tumor lysates, the LPHA signal is elevated in NAGK KO as compared to control tumors (Figure S4D). While this is converse to what might have been anticipated, it is consistent with the model that NAGK impacts glycosylation. The increased signal may reflect upregulation of de novo synthesis in the cancer cells within the small tumors that form in the absence of NAGK, compensatory regulation of glycosylation turnover, or high LPHA signal from other cells within the tumor. We have also conducted experiments examining glycosylation in cultured cells as well. Unfortunately, results were inconsistent from clone to clone, with some but not all NAGK KO clones showing reduced L-PHA binding. While it is disappointing that results were not as clear cut as we would have hoped, the regulation of glycosylation is complex and will require substantial additional work beyond this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The authors nicely demonstrate that glutamine deprivation reduces flux through the HBP while inducing NAGK and enabling UDP-GlcNAc maintenance via GlcNAc salvage. The PDAC microenvironment also features restricted levels of glucose, such that PDAC cells face reduced levels of both nutrients relevant to the HBP in intact tumors.

While further investigation is certainly required, the quantification of UDP-GlcNAc in 5 mM and 0.1 mM glucose suggests that UDP-GlcNAc levels are more responsive to changes in glucose than changes in glutamine, and that the salvage pathway may be most important under conditions of glutamine restriction. We hypothesize that in addition to NAGK regulation, this is due to increased free GlcNAc available for salvage under glutamine restriction, which we now report in revised Figure 3A. Further investigation will be needed to ascertain the sources of GlcNAc under glutamine restriction (lysosomal breakdown of glycoconjugates is one possibility, but will require additional study). In the manuscript co-submitted with this one by Lyssiotis and colleagues (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.293803v1), hyaluronic acid is proposed as a key source of GlcNAc in the tumor microenvironment. Taking the two studies together, it is likely that salvage is facilitated under conditions in which free GlcNAc abundance is elevated. We have added discussion to this point to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Reviewers requested additional details for the Materials and methods section.
