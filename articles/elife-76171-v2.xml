stressors reprogram the cellular proteome by activating the integrated stress response (ISR). In its canonical form, stress-sensing kinases phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 (eIF2-P), which ultimately leads to reduced levels of ternary complex required for initiation of mRNA translation. Previously we showed that translational control is primarily exerted through a conformational switch in eIF2’s nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, which shifts from its active A-State conformation to its inhibited I-State conformation upon eIF2-P binding, resulting in reduced nucleotide exchange on eIF2 (Schoof et al. 2021). Here, we show functionally and structurally how a single histidine to aspartate point mutation in eIF2B’s β subunit (H160D) mimics the effects of eIF2-P binding by promoting an I-State like conformation, resulting in eIF2-P independent activation of the ISR. These findings corroborate our previously proposed A/I-State model of allosteric ISR regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>eIF2B</kwd><kwd>ISR</kwd><kwd>ISRIB</kwd><kwd>eIF2</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Calico Life Sciences LLC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The George and Judy Marcus Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001491</institution-id><institution>Belgian-American Educational Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boone</surname><given-names>Morgane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Child Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lawrence</surname><given-names>Rosalie E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014989</institution-id><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Investigator Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frost</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Scholar grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frost</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Lan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetically induced conformational modulation of eIF2B activates the Integrated Stress Response by impairing nucleotide exchange.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coping with cellular stressors, manifesting as either intrinsic cues or environmental insults, is key to preserving cellular and organismal health. One strategy is to activate the integrated stress response (ISR), a conserved eukaryotic signaling network that reprograms translation toward damage mitigation and recovery, or apoptosis when stress is irremediable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</xref>). The ISR integrates diverse stresses through at least four stress-sensing kinases – PERK, HRI, GCN2, PKR, and perhaps MARK2, via phosphorylation of a single serine, S51 of the α subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2021</xref>). eIF2 is a central player in translation initiation, mediating start codon recognition on the mRNA and delivery of the initiator methionine tRNA. Phosphorylation of eIF2 disrupts this process and leads to a precipitous drop in global protein synthesis. Conversely, the translation of a subset of stress-responsive mRNAs, such as <italic>ATF4</italic>, generally repressed by the presence of 5’ UTR upstream open reading frames (uORFs), is induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harding et al., 2000</xref>). The alternative translation program, that is, thus set in motion drives the cell’s return to homeostasis. While the ISR is inherently cytoprotective, its dysregulation has been documented in multiple disease states. Specifically, the ISR has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2013</xref>), brain-injury induced dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sen et al., 2017</xref>), aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krukowski et al., 2020</xref>), diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulkarim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harding et al., 2001</xref>), and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koromilas et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistically, it is the level of ternary complex (TC) that determines the regulation of translation initiation by the ISR. The TC consists of eIF2 (heterotrimer composed of an α, β, and γ subunit, containing a GTPase domain in its γ subunit), the initiator tRNA loaded with methionine (Met-tRNA<sup>i</sup>), and GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Algire et al., 2005</xref>). Once the TC associates with the 40 S ribosomal subunit, additional initiation factors, and the 5’ methylguanine cap of the mRNA, the pre-initiation complex scans the mRNA for a start codon. Recognition of the start codon leads to GTP hydrolysis and triggers the release of eIF2 now bound to GDP (as reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinnebusch et al., 2016</xref>). The large ribosomal subunit joins and the assembled 80 S ribosome proceeds with elongation of the polypeptide chain. Crucially, for every round of cap-dependent translation initiation, eIF2 requires GDP-to-GTP exchange, catalyzed by its dedicated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), eIF2B. Failure to complete this step impacts the cellular concentration of the TC, which impairs the translation of most mRNAs. At the same time, lower TC concentrations can induce the translation of specific stress-responsive ORFs, some of which are regulated by uORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vattem and Wek, 2004</xref>). Thus, the ISR regulates translation by tuning the available pool of TC.</p><p>Given its central role in controlling TC levels and mRNA translation, many eIF2B mutations result in an aberrant ISR and severe disease, such as Vanishing White Matter Disease (VWMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leegwater et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van der Knaap et al., 2002</xref>). Molecularly, eIF2B is a large, heterodecameric complex composed of two copies each of an α, β, γ, δ, and ε subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kashiwagi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zyryanova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wortham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordiyenko et al., 2014</xref>). It has long been established that phosphorylation of eIF2 (eIF2-P) converts eIF2 from an eIF2B substrate to an eIF2B inhibitor, leading to a reduction in GEF activity and ISR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Siekierka et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matts et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Konieczny and Safer, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salimans et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rowlands et al., 1988</xref>). Earlier atomic-resolution snapshots of the eIF2-bound and eIF2-P-bound human eIF2B complexes suggested steric hindrance to be the predominant mechanism for inhibition, given the proposed overlap of binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kenner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kashiwagi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adomavicius et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gordiyenko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bogorad et al., 2017</xref>). However, we and others recently discovered that binding of the inhibitor eIF2-P to a distinct binding site — located on the face of the eIF2B complex opposite of the substrate-binding site — allosterically switches eIF2B from its active ‘A-State’ (which can readily engage eIF2 and catalyze nucleotide exchange) to an inhibited ‘I-State’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schoof et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zyryanova et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The multi-subunit composition of eIF2B also lends itself to regulation at the level of complex assembly. The decameric holoenzyme is built from two eIF2Bβγδε tetramers and one eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>). The eIF2Bε subunit harbors the enzyme’s catalytic center but only contains a small part of the binding surface of eIF2. Two of four interfaces between eIF2 and eIF2B (IF1 and IF2) reside in eIF2Bε. Thus, poor substrate-binding severely limits eIF2Bε’s catalytic activity. The substrate-binding surface is increased upon addition of more subunits (a third interface, IF3 in eIF2Bβ). Yet, even when embedded in the eIF2Bβγδε tetramer subcomplex, the specific enzyme activity (<italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>/<italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic>) of eIF2Bε is ~100 fold lower compared to the fully assembled eIF2B(αβγδε)<sub>2</sub> decamer (tetramer <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>/<italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> = 0.07 min<sup>–1</sup>µM<sup>–1</sup>, decamer <italic>k<sub>ca</sub></italic><sub>t</sub>/<italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> = 7.24 min<sup>–1</sup>µM<sup>–1</sup>), in which the substrate-interacting surface is further extended by bridging the twofold symmetric interface formed between the two tetrameric subcomplexes (a fourth interface, IF4 in eIF2Bδ’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schoof et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kenner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kashiwagi et al., 2019</xref>). eIF2B activity, assembly-state, and conformation are all modulated by the ISR inhibitor, ISRIB. This small molecule binds in a deep groove spanning across the symmetry interface of the two eIF2B tetramers and enhances its GEF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sekine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zyryanova et al., 2018</xref>). ISRIB exerts these effects by acting on both eIF2B assembly and conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schoof et al., 2021a</xref>). When eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> levels are low, pharmacological dimerization of tetrameric subcomplexes by ISRIB rescues eIF2B function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schoof et al., 2021a</xref>). When eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> levels are saturating and eIF2B decamers are therefore fully assembled, ISRIB binding stabilizes eIF2B in the active ‘A-State’, reducing its affinity for the inhibitor eIF2-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schoof et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zyryanova et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Given these insights, we here revisit previous observations concerning a histidine to aspartate point mutation in eIF2Bβ (βH160D) that straddles the junction of the β-β’and β-δ’ interface (the ‘ notation indicates that the subunit resides in the adjoining, second tetramer in eIF2B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>). We formerly observed that this missense mutation blocked ISRIB-driven assembly of eIF2B tetramers into octamers in vitro, underlining the importance of the H160 residue in stabilizing the octamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether the change to aspartic acid, predicted to be repulsed by the apposed D450 in δ’, precluded decameric assembly or activated the ISR, remained unknown. Here, we show that the βH160D mutation does not affect decameric holoenzyme formation when all subunits are present. However, this mutation stabilizes eIF2B in an inactive conformation reminiscent of the inhibited ‘I-State’, normally promoted by eIF2-P binding. Concomitantly, cells with this mutation constitutively activate the ISR, even in absence of stress and eIF2-P. These results validate the A/I-State model of eIF2B and ISR regulation by showing that a conformational change in eIF2B is sufficient to impair its enzymatic function and activate the ISR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The eIF2B βH160D mutation does not block decamer assembly in vitro</title><p>To dissect the regulation of eIF2B assembly and activity, we purified human eIF2Bβδγε tetramers both with and without the βH160D mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Indeed, eIF2 dissociation from tetrameric eIF2B can be thought of as being 100% fast phase as the dissociation constant was indistinguishable from the fast phase dissociation constant for both WT and βH160D (<italic>k<sub>d</sub></italic> = 0.12 s<sup>–1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The fraction of eIF2 molecules that dissociate from decamers with fast phase kinetics may therefore only be engaging eIF2B through interfaces 1–3 (interfaces 1 and 2 in eIF2Bε and interface 3 in eIF2Bβ). In contrast, the eIF2 molecules that dissociate with slow phase kinetics may additionally contact interface 4 in eIF2Bδ’, reaching across the central symmetry interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schoof et al., 2021a</xref>). This explanation would be consistent with identical dissociation constants for tetramer dissociation and fast phase dissociation from the decamers. For eIF2-binding, the βH160D decamers can therefore be thought of as more like isolated tetramers. That is, eIF2 readily associates but then is likely to dissociate too rapidly for efficient catalysis.</p><p>We further interrogated the biphasic dissociation behavior of eIF2 from WT and βH160D decamers by varying the time allowed for eIF2 binding to eIF2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). For both WT and βH160D we observed an exponential decrease in the percentage of fast phase dissociation, which within two minutes plateaued at ~11% fast phase dissociation for eIF2 binding to WT and at ~55% fast phase dissociation for eIF2 binding to βH160D decamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These data argue that at equilibrium the fast phase dissociation plays a small part in the engagement between eIF2 and WT eIF2B but plays a significant part in substrate engagement with βH160D decamers. This kinetic behavior can be explained by a model proposing stepwise engagement between eIF2 and eIF2B in a process that first entails engagement of 3 interaction interfaces (IF1-3), followed by a second, slower step that engages the fourth interaction interface (IF4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H, I</xref>). In this model, the βH160D mutation does not affect the on/off rates of eIF2 engagement with eIF2B through interfaces 1–3, but slows the on-rate (<italic>k<sub>2</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H, I</xref>) of converting from 3 interface engagement to four interface engagement. Such a mechanism can explain the accumulation of the ‘intermediate’ fast phase dissociation species.</p><p>We next assessed eIF2-P binding to the immobilized eIF2B species. For both WT and βH160D decamer binding, this interaction could be modeled using one-phase association and dissociation kinetics. The overall affinity of eIF2-P for both species was largely comparable (WT <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> = 14 nM; βH160D <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> = 8.1 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>). As expected owing to the absence of the dimeric eIF2Bα subunit, which constitutes part of the eIF2-P binding site, we observed no noticeable eIF2-P binding to WT tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>From these results, we conclude that the βH160D decamer shares a number of properties with the eIF2-P-bound decamer: (1) reduced intrinsic GEF activity, (2) impaired substrate binding, and (3) insensitivity to ISRIB. Owing to these similarities, we wondered whether the βH160D mutation mimics eIF2-P binding and shifts eIF2B into an I-State or ‘I-State like’ conformation. To assess this notion, we determined the structure of the βH160D eIF2B decamer using single-particle cryo-EM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The βH160D mutation shifts eIF2B into an inhibited conformation</title><p>We prepared the βH160D decamer by combining βH160D tetramers and eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub>, and subjected the sample to cryo-EM imaging.

This map allowed us to build an atomic model of how the βH160D substitution alters the conformation of the eIF2B decamer. By superimposing the βH160D decamer structure and our previously published A-State structure (eIF2B-eIF2 complex, PDB ID: 6O81), we observed a significant difference in their overall architecture: the two tetramer halves of the βH160D decamer underwent a rocking motion that changed the angle between them by approximately 3.5° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This rocking motion repositions the two tetramer halves in an orientation comparable to the I-State structure (eIF2B-eIF2αP complex, PDB ID: 6O9Z), although not reaching the 6° angle observed for the eIF2-P-inhibited decamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). To further understand how the βH160D mutation affects the conformation and dynamics of the decamer, we performed additional cryo-EM analysis of both the WT and the βH160D decamer particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>). We found the following: (1) in both the WT and the mutant, the two tetrameric halves can undergo rocking motions around the central axis; (2) the βH160D mutation shifts the mean conformation of the decamer towards the I-State; and (3) the βH160D dataset likely represents particles that follow a continuous conformation distribution, rather than a mixture of distinct A and I-State populations. These observations validate our hypothesis that the βH160D mutation shifts eIF2B from the active conformation towards an inhibited conformation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Overall architecture of eIF2B<sup>βH160D</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Atomic model of eIF2B<sup>βH160D</sup> decamer (yellow) superimposed into the cryo-EM map (gry), showing the overall structure of the molecule.

In <bold>step 1</bold>, we performed 3D variability analysis in cryoSPARC for the apo vs the H160D to examine the range of rocking motion between the two tetrameric halves. Twenty frames were generated for each structure to represent snapshots of the motion. The first and the last frames represent the two extreme positions of this rocking motion. In the apo structure, the molecule rocks between a state that is very close to the classic A-state (number 1 in the figure) and a classic I-state (number 3 in the figure). In the H160D structure, the molecule rocks between a state that is similar to the consensus H160D state (number 2 in the figure) and a state that is similar to the classic I-state (also similar to the I-state in the apo data). Therefore, H160D and apo both reach similar conformations on the side of the I-state, but apo has a wider range of motion compared to H160D. Having established the range (by the 3D variability analysis) and the mean position of this motion (the consensus structure) in both apo and H160D, we next determined the particle distribution across these three states (1, 2, or 3) in the apo vs the H160D dataset. In <bold>step 2</bold>, we performed heterogeneous refinement of the two datasets separately, using the three models (indicated by numbers 1, 2, and 3 throughout this figure; all maps are low pass filtered to 20 Å) obtained from step 1 as reference models. The apo dataset separated into three classes: 66.3% of all particles went into a class that is similar to the classic A-State (class a), and 26.5% of all particles went into a class, that is, similar to the classic I-State (class b), and a small percentage went into a third class that did not result in a high resolution structure. In the H160D dataset, the majority of all particles went into two classes (class a and class b), both of which are similar to the consensus H160D structure.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-76171-fig4-figsupp3-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig4s4" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 4—figure supplement 4.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM analysis of the conformation and dynamics of the WT decamer and the βH160D decamer – part 2.</title><p>Having finished the 3D classification, we then performed local resolution analysis to examine the quality of the density maps in <bold>step 3</bold> to investigate the potential for different subpopulations of particles within each dataset. As shown in <bold>step 3</bold>, in the apo structure, class a showed a slight improvement in overall resolution (2.8 Å for the class and 2.9 Å for the consensus), as well as improvements in local map quality in the flexible regions of the molecule (see the top of the ‘wings’ in both these maps). Class b has a reduced global resolution, local resolution around the flexible regions, as well as a worse FSC profile (see the FSC plots). Class b could therefore either represent particles that are more I-State like that got separated from the consensus structure, or particles that are more damaged (as suggested by the worse FSC profile and the worse map quality in the flexible regions). For the H160D dataset, classification resulted in two classes that are both similar to the consensus structure (classes a and b) and both classes resulted in worse overall resolution than the consensus (3.0 Å for both classes and 2.8 Å for the consensus). The local resolution of the classes is also worse than the consensus structure in flexible regions. This would suggest that the particles making up the H160D dataset represent a continuous distribution of different conformations, as simply separating them into multiple bins each with fewer particles worsened the map quality of both classes. Integrating the results from steps 1–3, it is likely that the apo dataset mainly consists of A-State particles, and that the H160D mutation shifts the mean conformation of eIF2B towards a state that is I-like. Also, there is no evidence suggesting that the H160D dataset is a mixture of A- and I-State particles, but rather, particles within this dataset most likely follow a continuous distribution.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-76171-fig4-figsupp4-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig4s5" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 4—figure supplement 5.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM analysis of the conformation and dynamics of the WT decamer and the βH160D decamer – part 3.</title><p>Finally, we performed an extra test to make sure that if a dataset is made up of similar conformations, our cryo-EM analysis is indeed able to separate them into two classes.

In the WT decamer, βH160 forms a π–π stacking interaction with δ’F452, which is lost in the βH160D eIF2B decamer and leads to the retraction of the short loop bearing this residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Other interactions in WT decamer include an ionic interaction between β’R228 and δ’D450, as well as a cation-π interaction between β’R228 andδ’F452. In the βH160D decamer, β’R228 repositions itself within the network of three negative charges (βE163, βD160, and δ’D450) and one aromatic amino acid (δ’F452) to reach a new stable state locally. The loop movement caused by the mutation propagates across the entire tetramer, resulting in the rocking motion observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. This explains how the βH160D amino acid change in eIF2B remodels the dimerization interface to widen the ISRIB binding pocket and induce an I-State like conformation.</p><p>To further examine the long-range effect of this interface mutation, we looked at the critical interfaces for substrate (eIF2) binding provided by eIF2Bβ and eIF2Bδ. An overlay of the βH160D decamer structure with the eIF2B-eIF2 complex structure revealed that the substrate eIF2α binding pocket was widened by 2.9 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). As established before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schoof et al., 2021a</xref>), a similar pocket widening is observed in the I-State structure of eIF2B (2.6 Å induced by eIF2α-P binding). This widening is predicted to prevent eIF2 from properly engaging the fourth binding site on eIF2Bδ’ and hence turns the decameric eIF2B into conjoined tetramers such that only three of the four eIF2-eIF2B binding interfaces remain readily accessible to eIF2 binding. Our structural observations, therefore, explain the decrease in eIF2 binding and reduction in GEF activity of the βH160D decamer. The remaining portion of slow phase dissociation of eIF2 from βH160D decamers, though, indicates that engagement with all four interfaces, while disfavored, is not impossible as is the case with the pure tetrameric species. By contrast, the inhibitor (eIF2α-P) binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) was not changed significantly compared to the eIF2B-eIF2α-P complex structure. This observation is consistent with the similar binding affinities measured for eIF2-P towards the βH160D decamer and the WT decamer. We conclude that the βH160D mutation shifts the eIF2B decamer into a conformation closely resembling the I-State.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>eIF2B βH160D mutation leads to stress-independent ISR activation</title><p>Given that the eIF2B βH160D mutation biases eIF2B’s conformation toward an I-State like conformation, reducing its GEF activity, we predicted that expression of eIF2B βH160D in cells would lead to constitutive ISR activation. To test this notion, we introduced the βH160D mutation into the genome of HEK293FTR cells by editing the endogenous eIF2Bβ gene (<italic>EIF2B2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we obtained two such lines. One cell line yielded a homozygous clone in which all alleles were edited (line βH160D #1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). The other was a heterozygous clone containing one edited allele while the remaining alleles were knocked out through CRISPR/Cas9-induced frameshift mutations (line βH160D #2). Critically, both βH160D cell lines showed eIF2Bβ and eIF2Bε protein levels comparable to the unedited parental cells, demonstrating that the mutation does not destabilize eIF2Bβ or other complex members and that compensatory mechanisms must normalize the gene dosage imbalance in clone #2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wortham et al., 2016</xref>). We observed constitutive, low-level activation of the ISR in both clones, exemplified by elevated levels of ATF4 protein in the absence of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 5 and 9 vs lane 1). ATF4 induction was still responsive to induced stress with thapsigargin (lanes 7 and 11) but could not be alleviated by ISRIB treatment in the βH160D lines, both in the absence or presence of stressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). ATF4 is translationally upregulated during the ISR and, accordingly, ATF4 mRNA levels remained unchanged between WT and the two βH160D clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, as expected, key ATF4 transcriptional targets (such as <italic>DDIT3, ASNS, and CARS</italic>) were upregulated in βH160D cells, confirming that increased ATF4 mRNA translation leads to production of active ATF4, which in turn activates transcription of its downstream stress-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The βH160D mutation spontaneously activates the integrated stress response (ISR) in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of WT vs <italic>EIF2B2<sup>H160D</sup></italic> HEK293FTR cell lines [βH160D (#1) and βH160D (#2)] treated with and without stress [10 nM thapsigargin (Tg)] or ISRIB (200 nM) for 1 hr. eIF2B subunit levels do not differ between cell lines.

To monitor protein synthesis, we treated WT and βH160D cells with puromycin and assessed puromycin incorporation in nascent polypeptide chains by immunoblotting. Both βH160D cell lines displayed significantly reduced levels of basal protein synthesis (βH160D #1 cells: 47 ± 9.0%; βH160D #2 cells: 69 ± 7.3%, both compared to WT), again consistent with constitutive activation of the ISR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). WT and βH160D cells did not differ in eIF2α phosphorylation levels, underlining the observation that the impairment of eIF2B GEF activity caused by this mutation is sufficient to induce a constitutive ISR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A-B</xref>).</p><p>Phenotypically, the constitutive ISR activation was accompanied by slow cell growth: cell doubling time increased from 25.7 ± 3.6 h for WT cells to 38.4 ± 3.5 h for βH160D (#1) cells and could not be rescued by ISRIB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we show that a single engineered H to D mutation in eIF2Bβ alters the conformation of the eIF2B decamer, resulting in altered dissociation kinetics of substrate eIF2, a ~ three fold reduction of intrinsic enzymatic activity, and resistance to ISRIB rescue. In cells, this hypomorphic mutation culminates in a constitutively activated low-level ISR. The structural, biochemical, and cellular changes resulting from the βH160D mutation are evocative of the Inhibitor (eIF2-P) bound state of eIF2B (‘I-State’). In conjunction with our prior assessment of changes in eIF2B induced by eIF2α-P binding, these orthogonal data underscore how the conformational changes brought about by eIF2α-P binding govern ISR activation (A/I-State model) and that even the presence of eIF2α-P is dispensable as long as an I-State or I-State like conformation is maintained. eIF2B is a far more dynamic complex than we realized just a year ago. Small molecules (ISRIB and its derivatives), the natural substrate (eIF2), and viral proteins (SFSV NSs) can stabilize eIF2B in its active A-State (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kashiwagi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schoof et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schoof et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zyryanova et al., 2021</xref>). Conversely, binding of the inhibitor (eIF2-P) can compete with these molecules by shifting the decamer to the inhibited I-State (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schoof et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zyryanova et al., 2021</xref>). Although the conformational displacements induced by βH160D are in many aspects similar to those of the eIF2-P bound I-State when compared to the A-State, they are not identical. While the cryo-EM data show a comparable widening of the eIF2α binding pocket, the movement of the β-solenoid in eIF2Bε is less pronounced in βH160D decamers than in the eIF2-P bound I-State (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), likely because the rocking motion induced by βH160D originates near the ISRIB pocket, not from the eIF2-P binding site. In addition, despite extensive classification calculations, we did not recover single-particle images of the βH160D complex belonging to the A-State, arguing against the idea that the βH160D structure is a mixture of A-State and I-State structures. The βH160D decamer rather represents a continuous distribution of conformations with a more restricted range of motion compared to the WT decamer, and for which the average converges to an I-State like model. Hence, acknowledging both similarities and differences to the I-State, we refer to the conformation induced by βH160D as ‘I-State like’.</p><p>The conformational changes brought about by eIF2-P binding result in a specific enzymatic activity (quantified in the specificity constant <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>/<italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic>) that is approximately 2 orders of magnitude reduced from that of the A-State (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schoof et al., 2021a</xref>). By comparison, the βH160D mutation causes the specificity constant to drop by only ~2 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Nevertheless, despite the comparatively small change in eIF2B activity, the mutation induces constitutive ISR activation, suggesting that cells are sensitive to small fluctuations in eIF2B GEF activity. These numbers also tell us that there is still potential for more robust ISR activation. Indeed, treating βH160D cells with relatively low amounts (10 nM) of an eIF2-P inducing stressor like thapsigargin further enhances ATF4 translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The latter result also suggests that the mutation is compatible with even more potent inhibition mediated by eIF2-P binding. This conclusion is further supported by our 3D reconstructions and the SPR studies, which show that the βH160D mutation does not appreciably affect eIF2-P binding.</p><p>We demonstrate that both intrinsic enzymatic activity and substrate (eIF2) binding are affected in the I-State like βH160D decamer. It remains unclear how the conformational changes in either this structure or that in the eIF2-P bound I-State (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schoof et al., 2021a</xref>) engender a reduced <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>, especially given that βH160 is located far from the catalytic center. Non-ideal positioning of substrate molecules that still engage an I-State or I-State like decamer may explain the reduced rate of nucleotide exchange. Further speculation regarding the mechanism is limited by a lack of structural data for certain critical regions. The eIF2Bε catalytic domain is absent from all but the substrate (eIF2) bound structures. The eIF2Bε linker, a known regulatory region connecting the catalytic domain to the core of eIF2Bε, is similarly unresolved, as are the poorly understood C-terminal solenoid ‘ear domains’ of eIF2Bγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Welsh and Proud, 1993</xref>). The conformation and positioning of these and other regions may be affected during the ISR and play roles in regulation of eIF2B’s activity that warrant further examination. With the recent discovery that eIF2B can directly read out and respond to sugar phosphate levels, there may be a host of functions and mechanisms of regulation for eIF2B still to be uncovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hao et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our SPR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) demonstrate that the effects of the βH160D mutation on substrate (eIF2) binding result from changes to the relative proportion of rapidly dissociating eIF2 molecules. Substrate association, however, remains unaffected. The biphasic dissociation behavior, usually observed for multivalent ligands due to avidity effects, is not entirely unexpected. Substrate-bound structures of eIF2B decamer previously revealed four binding interfaces (IF1–IF4) between eIF2 and eIF2B. Hence, it is possible that stochastic partial binding occurs for a fraction of substrate molecules when the IF4 interface is too distant from IF3 for both to be engaged by eIF2. eIF2α-P binding (or the βH160D mutation) pulls IF4 away from IF3, increasing the probability of this partially engaged binding mode, thus reducing the substrate binding affinity. Notably, though, the biphasic dissociation is not observed for inhibitor (eIF2-P) binding, where both association and dissociation can be fit to monophasic models. This observation suggests greater conformational flexibility along the combinatorial eIF2 binding surfaces than along the eIF2-P binding surfaces.</p><p>The βH160 residue is highly conserved amongst eukaryotes. To date, no variation has been reported at this position in the human genome. However, the mechanism by which the βH160D mutation impacts eIF2B activity raises the possibility that certain VWMD mutations may likewise compromise eIF2B function through alteration of conformational state. The disease-associated βE213G mutation (ClinVar VCV000004336), for example, localized near the ISRIB pocket and far away from the catalytic center, reportedly does not affect complex association but substantially reduces GEF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2004</xref>). Understanding the precise mechanism of eIF2B inactivation in individual VWMD patients may be critical for patient stratification and proper treatment. Although ISRIB is unable to rescue the βH160D defect, it is plausible that other analogs (or molecules acting at a different site) with higher affinities than ISRIB may be able to overcome the charge repulsion and restore the A-State conformation, demonstrating the importance of continued endeavors to uncover molecules and strategies to inhibit or activate the ISR orthogonally.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Cloning <italic>eIF2B2</italic> (encoding eIF2Bβ) and <italic>eIF2B4</italic> (encoding eIF2Bδ) had previously been inserted into sites 1 and 2 of pACYCDuet-1 and then further edited to include mNeonGreen and a (GGGGS)<sub>2</sub> linker at the C-terminus of <italic>eIF2B2</italic> and mScarlet-i and a (GGGGS)<sub>2</sub> linker at the C-terminus of <italic>eIF2B4</italic> (pMS029).

Wells of AnyKd Mini-PROTEAN TGX precast protein gels (AnyKD, Bio-Rad) were loaded with equal amounts of total protein (around 10 µg), in between Precision Plus Dual Color protein ladder (BioRad). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane at 4°C, and then blocked for 2 hr at room temperature in PBS with 0.1% Tween (PBS-T) + 3% milk (blocking buffer) while rocking. Primary antibody staining was performed with gentle agitation at 4°C overnight using the conditions outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>. After washing four times in blocking buffer, secondary antibody staining was performed for 1 hr at room temperature using anti-rabbit HRP or anti-mouse HRP secondary antibodies (Promega, 1:10,000) in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed 3× in blocking buffer and then 1× in PBS-T without milk. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using SuperSignal West Dura or Femto HRP substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and membranes were imaged on a LI-COR Odyssey gel imager for 0.5–10 min depending on band intensity.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Western blot antibodies and conditions.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody target</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Host</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Dilution</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Manufacturer</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Cat. number</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Blocking conditions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">eIF2Bβ</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Rabbit</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1/1000</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">ProteinTech</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">11034–1-AP</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">PBS-T + 3% milk</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">eIF2Bε</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Mouse</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1/1000</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">sc-55558</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">PBS-T + 3% milk</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATF4</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Rabbit</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1/1000</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">11,815 S</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">PBS-T + 3% milk</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">α-tubulin</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Mouse</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1/1000</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3873T</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">PBS-T + 3% milk</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Puromycin</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Mouse</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1/10,000</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Millipore</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">MABE343</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">PBS-T + 3% milk</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">eIF2α</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">rabbit</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1/1000</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5324 S</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">PBS-T + 3% milk</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">eIF2α-P (S51)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">rabbit</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1/1000</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">9721 S</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">PBS-T + 1% BSA</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>For the phospho-retention blots, equal amounts of total protein lysates (around 10 µg) were loaded on 12.5% Supersep Phos-tag gels (Wako Chemicals) in between Wide-view III protein ladder (Wako Chemicals).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper is highly appropriate for for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> but it would benefit from some experimental additions. Reviewer #1 suggested (see below) for Figure 6 to add S51-P western, ATF4-luc reporter analysis, test ISRIB impact on mutant cell growth. Reviewer #2 made similar comments. Some additional analyses (no new experiments) to address the structural questions are raised by reviewer #2 (#3-5). The authors need to mention the related gcd- and gcn- mutations in yeast eIF2B (from Alan Hinnebusch's published work) – especially the gcn- mutation gcd7-D178Y located only three residues away from the H160D mutation studied in this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

While perhaps not required for this paper, analysis of published yeast eIF2B mutations might be insightful when considering the A/I model of eIF2B. The partial loss-of-function phenotype of the eIF2beta-H160D mutation is reminiscent of the Gcd- phenotypes described by Alan Hinnebusch for numerous mutations in all five subunits of yeast eIF5B. While the yeast eIF2B complex appears to lack the ISRIB binding site, I wonder if examination of the characterized eIF2B mutations would provide further support for the A/I state model proposed for eIF2B. Of particular note, the Hinnebusch lab has characterized different sets of mutations in the eIF2B subunits that either lead to loss of eIF2B activity (Gcd- or GCN3-constitutive) or insensitivity to inhibition by phosphorylated eIF2 (Gcn-). Intriguingly, I saw that a gcd7-D178Y mutation in yeast eIF2Bbeta that is only three residues before the H160 residue leads to a Gcn- phenotype (see Vazquez de Aldana, MCB 14:3208-3222, 1994 and Pavitt, MCB 17:1298-1313, 1998). Could this mutation uncouple the allostery between the regulatory and active sites in eIF2B? It is also noteworthy that some yeast eIF2Balpha (GCN3-constitutive) mutations can be suppressed by mutations in eIF2alpha (SUI2), perhaps providing in vivo data to support the structural models of eIF2alpha binding to the regulatory site.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 1: It would be helpful to show the quality of the purified eIF2B factors (tetramer and dimer) as a supplemental figure. Include the statistical analyses for panels E and F.</p><p>2. Figure 6: Should consider using the ATF4-luciferase reporter in the mix of measurements for constitutive partial activation of the ISR by the H160D β subunit mutant. This would reinforce the idea that ISR induction of ATF4 is predominantly by preferential translation and explain why the ATF4 mRNA was not measurably changed in basal conditions between the WT and H160D cells.</p><p>3. The mechanistic basis proposed for a change in conformation driven by charge repulsion between D160 in the β subunit and D450 in the δ subunit seems improbable based on the conformations observed in the inhibited state (6O9Z). Here the closest approach of His 160 to Asp 450 is 5 Å. This distance is also 5 Å in the activated state 6081. Given that modeling of D160 in this position would be even farther away at closest approach (at least 5.5 Å) and that H160 is about 3.2 Å from E183 within the β subunit, it is not clear how the authors have come to this model for charge repulsion. At the very least, the manuscript should provide a figure that shows β subunit H160 in the wild type structure and D450 in the δ subunit superimposed with D160 and D450 in the structure reported here.</p><p>4. The authors should provide the RCSB ID for the deposited structure and the validation information ensuring that the structure meets expected standards.</p><p>5. The manuscript states in the discussion that despite extensive classifications, they did not find any particles that correspond to the A-state of eIF2B. Did the authors use the A-state for template picking? Would one be able to distinguish the I-state from the A-state at the low resolution normally used for 2D classifications? The manuscript havs provided images only for 2D classifications from template picking.</p><p>At the very least, the manuscript should provide images obtained for 2D and 3D classifications without template picking and provide an estimate of what percentage of the particles correspond to the state assigned in the final structure. One explanation for an intermediate hinge angle of 3.5 degrees is that you have an average of two states, one corresponding to the 6 degree state found in the inhibited state relative to the activated state and the other corresponding to that found in the activated state.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76171.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

The H160D mutation is thus hypomorphic and there is room for more inhibition; phosphorylation of eIF2 through activation of the PERK kinase (as occurs with Tg treatment) further inhibits eIF2B-H160D, leading to an increase in ATF4 translation compared to the vehicle-treated cells. This is in line with our in vitro Michaelis-Menten data showing a 2-3-fold decrease in specific enzyme activity with the H160D mutation (Figure 2C and D), which is orders of magnitude less than the ~100-fold decrease caused by addition of phosphorylated eIF2 (Schoof et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2021). As we argued above, a direct inquiry of ATF4 protein levels readily answers this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Conversely, it is possible that other mutations may stabilize the complex in the A-State, which would lead to a Gcn phenotype in yeast. The gcd7-D178Y mutation could be an example of the latter as it makes yeast eIF2B insensitive to inhibition by eIF2-P (so the opposite effect of the H160D mutation). No allosteric chain could reliably be traced from the available human structures, making it tricky to predict the effect of any mutation on the coupling of regulatory and active sites without in vitro evidence.</p><p>It is interesting to note, however, that the allosteric changes observed and validated in mammalian eIF2B remain to be confirmed in yeast. Curiously, overlaying published structures of <italic>S. pombe</italic> eIF2B (apo, eIF2alpha bound or eIF2alpha-P bound) do not show the same rocking motion that we and others observe when aligning human eIF2B A vs I-State. There are other discrepancies between human and yeast eIF2B, such as cryo-EM and X-ray structures showing the binding of substrate eIF2 in the same orientation as inhibitory eIF2-P. The a subunit of eIF2B is also not essential in yeast whereas it is essential in humans and presumably other mammals. These data could point to evolutionary divergence in regulatory mechanisms, or yet-to-pinpoint differences in experimental preparation. It is therefore difficult to draw any conclusions about human eIF2B A/I state regulation from the available yeast data, and indeed, a thorough reexamination of yeast eIF2B regulation may be in order.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Figure 6: Should consider using the ATF4-luciferase reporter in the mix of measurements for constitutive partial activation of the ISR by the H160D β subunit mutant. This would reinforce the idea that ISR induction of ATF4 is predominantly by preferential translation and explain why the ATF4 mRNA was not measurably changed in basal conditions between the WT and H160D cells.</p></disp-quote><p>See our above response to reviewer #1 regarding the addition of an ATF4 reporter. We do not consider it appropriate or necessary to introduce an ATF4-luciferase reporter in different cell lines and compare the resulting lines side-by-side. Our western blots show that ATF4 protein levels, but not transcript levels, are up in two independent mutants compared with WT, which is indicative of translational regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The mechanistic basis proposed for a change in conformation driven by charge repulsion between D160 in the β subunit and D450 in the δ subunit seems improbable based on the conformations observed in the inhibited state (6O9Z). Here the closest approach of His 160 to Asp 450 is 5 Å. This distance is also 5 Å in the activated state 6081. Given that modeling of D160 in this position would be even farther away at closest approach (at least 5.5 Å) and that H160 is about 3.2 Å from E183 within the β subunit, it is not clear how the authors have come to this model for charge repulsion. At the very least, the manuscript should provide a figure that shows β subunit H160 in the wild type structure and D450 in the δ subunit superimposed with D160 and D450 in the structure reported here.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in that the single repulsion between the two aspartates is probably not the only cause of the structural changes. We note that the H160D mutation also causes the loss of a stacking interaction with a phenylalanine on the opposite side, and additionally repositions R228 to locally reach a new stable state. We have updated the main text and Figure 5, and added a new supplementary figure (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1) to reflect the local structural rearrangments caused by the H160D mutation. Please refer to the main text and figure for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors should provide the RCSB ID for the deposited structure and the validation information ensuring that the structure meets expected standards.</p></disp-quote><p>We now included the PDB ID and EMDB ID in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The manuscript states in the discussion that despite extensive classifications, they did not find any particles that correspond to the A-state of eIF2B. Did the authors use the A-state for template picking? Would one be able to distinguish the I-state from the A-state at the low resolution normally used for 2D classifications? The manuscript havs provided images only for 2D classifications from template picking.</p><p>At the very least, the manuscript should provide images obtained for 2D and 3D classifications without template picking and provide an estimate of what percentage of the particles correspond to the state assigned in the final structure. One explanation for an intermediate hinge angle of 3.5 degrees is that you have an average of two states, one corresponding to the 6 degree state found in the inhibited state relative to the activated state and the other corresponding to that found in the activated state.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not expect our picking method to bias against A-state particles, as the templates we used for particle picking are generated from the apo eIF2B structure, which assumes an A-state conformation. Regarding the reviewer’s comment on whether the H160D dataset could be an average of two states, we performed an in-depth analysis of the cryo-EM data used in this work, compared it to the data that generated the apo eIF2B structure, and reached a model for how the mutation changes the conformational distribution of the eIF2B decamers. In short, our analysis shows that the H160D structure most likely represents a continuous distribution of different conformations, rather than a mix of two discrete populations. For details, please see the new supplemental figure we made that illustrate this analysis (Figure 4 —figure supplement 3).</p></body></sub-article></article>
