overrepresentation of male subjects in biomedical research, the US National Institutes of Health implemented a policy requiring investigators to consider sex as a biological variable. In order to assess the impact of this policy, we conducted a bibliometric analysis across nine biological disciplines for papers published in 34 journals in 2019, and compared our results with those of a similar study carried out by Beery and Zucker in 2009. There was a significant increase in the proportion of studies that included both sexes across all nine disciplines, but in eight of the disciplines there was no change in the proportion studies that included data analyzed by sex. The majority of studies failed to provide rationale for single-sex studies or the lack of sex-based analyses, and those that did relied on misconceptions surrounding the hormonal variability of females. Together, these data demonstrate that while sex-inclusive research practices are more commonplace, there are still gaps in analyses and reporting of data by sex in many biological disciplines.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meta-research</kwd><kwd>sex inclusion</kwd><kwd>sex differences</kwd><kwd>sex bias</kwd><kwd>meta-analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007059</institution-id><institution>Northwestern University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Women's Health Research Institute</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woitowich</surname><given-names>Nicole C</given-names></name><name><surname>Woodruff</surname><given-names>Teresa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sex-inclusive research practices have increased in many biological disciplines over the past decade, yet critical sex-based analyses and reporting have remained stagnant in most of these disciplines.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Template</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Studies of both males and females are essential to the advancement of human health, and the influences of sex on the prevalence, presentation, and progression of many disease states is profound. Yet, within the biological sciences, it has been a common and preferential practice to utilize male research subjects in basic and pre-clinical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beery and Zucker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sugimoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yoon et al., 2014</xref>). This male bias stems from the misconception that female animals increase experimental variability due to cyclical fluctuating hormones and the historical belief that no major differences exist between the sexes outside of reproductive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Institute of Medicine, 2001</xref>). These biases are not limited to the basic sciences, but extend into clinical research as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mansukhani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prakash et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Scott et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Initial reports calling for the inclusion of females in research and which describe the limitations of sex-biased studies began in the 1990s and extended in to the early 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berkley, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Holdcroft, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mogil and Chanda, 2005</xref>). In 2009, Beery and Zucker conducted a multi-disciplinary review of primary literature which quantified the extent of sex-bias across several research areas in the biological sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beery and Zucker, 2011</xref>). Since that report, there have been numerous calls to address this issue through sex-inclusive research practices and policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mazure and Jones, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Woodruff, 2014</xref>), culminating in 2016 when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States implemented a policy requiring investigators to consider sex as a biological variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clayton and Collins, 2014</xref>). The intent of the policy is to ensure equal representation of males and females in vertebrate research studies, unless there is significant justification to support the use of a single-sex. Many lauded the policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mogil, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shansky and Woolley, 2016</xref>), yet there were still those who saw it as unnecessary and feared that it would be time consuming, costly, increase experimental variability, and require expertise in the study of sex differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Woitowich and Woodruff, 2019</xref>). Considering sex as a biological variable does not require investigators to power studies in order to determine sex differences nor does it ask investigators to analyze data by sex. Yet, these common misconceptions persist, despite clarifications and guidance surrounding sex-inclusive research practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnegard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clayton, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shansky, 2019</xref>). Recently, several studies have monitored the progress of sex-inclusive research practices following NIH policy implementation in the fields of microbiology and immunology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Potluri et al., 2017</xref>), as well as neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mamlouk et al., 2020</xref>) utilizing methodologies similar to Beery and Zucker. Here, we present a 10 year follow-up study to the initial Beery and Zucker report by conducting a systematic review to assess sex-inclusive research practices within nine of the biological disciplines and 34 of the scholarly journals originally surveyed in 2009. We provide an updated perspective on the state of sex-inclusive research within the biological sciences, and highlight areas of improvement alongside shortcomings in the decade since Beery and Zucker conducted their original study.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In 2009, Beery and Zucker conducted a bibliometric analysis of 841 articles from high-impact journals, across ten biological disciplines which quantified the extent of male-bias in research and a noted lack of sex-based analyses when males and females were both included as research subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beery and Zucker, 2011</xref>).

Behavior remained the most inclusive biological discipline with 70% and 81% of studies reporting the use of both sexes in 2009 and 2019, respectively, largely driven by sex-inclusive field studies.

Rationale for the lack of sex-based analyses included: limited sample sizes to determine statistical significance (n = 4) or an inability to determine the sex of the subject (n = 3).

At face value, this change is encouraging and suggests that the scientific community may have an increased awareness and understanding of the need for sex-inclusive research and its contribution to experimental rigor and reproducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clayton, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Miller et al., 2017</xref>). At the same time, close to one third of all research studies that utilized both male and female subjects failed to quantify their sample size by sex. Ironically, this is most prevalent in the fields which reported the greatest increases in sex-inclusive research (ex. neuroscience, immunology, and general biology) At best, this result indicates that investigators may not think it is important to provide a description of the sample size by sex in the absence of sex-based analyses. In a less ideal case, the representation of males and females is not well balanced, and this may be intentionally obscured. Single-sex studies are valid and warranted, provided there is evidence-based rationale for the case. Yet, several studies explicitly stated that they excluded both sexes as a means to prevent experimental variability, which is an erroneous belief and unsound research practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beery, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Prendergast et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Perhaps most concerning, improvements in the inclusion of both sexes over the past decade have not been accompanied by general improvement in sex-based analyses, despite repeated calls and guidelines for such analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beltz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clayton, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clayton and Collins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hankivsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Prager, 2017</xref>). Sex-based analyses may uncover sex differences for a given trait, prompting the development of sex-specific prevention strategies, drug targets, or other therapies beneficial to both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). And while it is reasonable to aggregate and analyze data from both sexes if it has been established that there are no sex-differences for a given trait or condition, out of the 720 articles reviewed here, only two conveyed this information in their methods. When this information is lacking, the reader is tasked with making the assumption that either there are no sex differences or that sex-differences have yet to be examined. In either case, this can lead to redundant research efforts requiring additional time, money, and biological resources.</p><p>The data presented here highlight a continued need for education, awareness, and advocacy surrounding sex-based research practices including the consideration of sex as a biological variable. We call upon academic publishers to require a description of sex, rationale for single-sex studies or lack of sex-based analyses in the experimental methods. In the absence of formal policies, reviewers can ask for these essential criteria. In addition, funders can also contribute to the advancement of rigorous sex-inclusive science by requiring grant proposals to include appropriate sex-based reporting and analyses and determine funding success on the evaluation of sex and other key biological variables. Lastly, we call upon universities to encourage the consideration of sex as a biological variable through institutional review boards (IRBs) and institutional animal care and use committees (IACUC) oversight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duffy et al., 2020</xref>) and by providing instruction to biomedical trainees on sex-inclusion, reporting, and analyses through established responsible conduct of research modules and within medical school curricula. Only together, through concerted, tripartite efforts at the institutional, funder, and publishing levels will the consideration of sex as a biological variable become standard practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tannenbaum et al., 2019</xref>). Together, this will allow us to improve our understanding of health and disease for both men and women and to further the reality of personalized medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A systematic sampling of journal articles from 2019 was conducted using the methodologies originally described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beery and Zucker, 2011</xref>.

These disciplines included: General Biology, Immunology, Neuroscience, Physiology, Pharmacology, Reproduction, Endocrinology, Behavioral Physiology, and Behavior. Zoology, which was studied by Beery and Zucker, was excluded here due to a limited number of mammalian studies available to survey at the time of manuscript preparation. Four journals were selected to represent each discipline, with the exception of Reproduction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For each journal, the first 20 primary research articles which met eligibility criteria were surveyed in 2019. For the two reproductive biology journals, the first 40 journal articles were surveyed for 2019. For the majority of disciplines, the first 20 research articles which met eligibility criteria were published between January and April of 2019, whereas articles from other disciplines were published between January through June (Endocrinology), August (Behavioral Physiology) and October (Behavior) of 2019.</p><p>The eligibility criteria for studies in this analysis were as follows.</p><p>Inclusion criteria (all criteria required): i) Reported use of any vertebrate mammal in some part of the experimental methods, including those which describe the generation of primary cell culture; ii) Published after January 1 st, 2019; iii) Published in the English language.</p><p>Exclusion criteria (each criterion can exclude): i) Type of article: review articles, brief communications, or viewpoints; ii) Articles published in a special or themed issue; iii) Reports utilizing fetal organisms or those restricted to immortal cell lines.</p><p>When journals were arranged by subtopics, articles were sampled evenly across several topics.

Articles which utilized both sexes were further evaluated for a description of the sample size by sex and whether data were analyzed by sex, including sex as a covariate or subgroup analyses by sex.

Features Editor (Peter Rodgers). The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Rebecca Shansky (Reviewer #2); Londa Schiebinger (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers and editors have discussed the reviews and we have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript is a 10-year check in on a seminal paper (Beery &amp; Zucker 2011) that systematically examined sex bias in biomedical animal research. Given the introduction of NIH's &quot;Considering Sex as a Biological Variable&quot; (SABV) mandate in 2016, it is important to assess whether research practices have changed over the past decade.</p><p>The authors conducted a survey of 2019 publications in ten major fields, and report that in some fields, inclusion of both sexes has increased but that for the most part this has not been accompanied by an increase in analysis of data by sex or reporting the n's of each sex used. The authors call for journals to require more detailed information about the sex of animals and justification of single sex studies. I especially appreciate the assessment of &quot;excuses&quot; for the single sex studies.</p><p>This study is a critical addition to the literature and will help biomedical scientists understand how well SABV is working and what needs to be done to make it even more successful.</p><p>This is an important article and it should be published once the following points have been addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Introduction and Discussion: It was disappointing to see that the introduction and discussion did not address/include several key historical and recently published studies. These studies include some of the first studies that attempted to raise awareness regarding the lack of sex reporting (Berkley 1992; Mogil and Chanda 2005; both published before the initial 2009 study), updates to the 2009 study that robustly analyzed key fields that were documented as problematic in the 2009 study (Potluri et al., 2017; Mamlouk et al., 2020), and recently published arguments and analyses that are advancing sex-inclusive research (Shanskey, 2019; Galea et al., 2020). There are others as well (eg, Becker et al., 2016). While I am well aware that not every relevant paper can be cited/discussed, I encourage the authors to enhance the robustness of their literature search to help place their important results within the broader context.</p><p>2) I would encourage the authors to point out that SABV explicitly states that experiments need not be powered to detect sex differences or that data be analyzed by sex. However, their calls to require reporting of sex n's are well founded and will improve rigor and reproducibility.</p><p>3) The authors call upon academic publishers to require sex reporting. They should also call upon funders to require appropriate sex reporting and analysis in grant proposals--and make funding decision on the quality of that (and other) analysis. The authors should also call upon universities (medical schools) to teach sex reporting and analysis in the curriculum. In Tannenbaum et al (Nature 575: 137-146) the present reviewer [LS] and colleagues discuss the three pillars of the science infrastructure: Funding agencies, Universities, and Peer-reviewed journals. I encourage the authors here to add funders and universities to the paragraph where they discuss academic publishers.</p><p>4) Methods: &quot;First 20 primary research articles&quot; - Since only the first 20 articles were analyzed does this mean that most of the data was collected in studies published between January-March 2019? It would be a good idea to document this in the methods in case the data from 2019 need to be compared to future analyses that select across the entire year.</p><p>5) Methods: Interrater reliability: Did more than one person analyze studies? Were intra and inter-rater reliability controls performed to ensure accurate analysis?</p><p>6) Methods: &quot;Organismal mammalian work&quot; - This label is vague and could be divergently interpreted by different readers. Does this just mean whole organism behavioral analysis? Does it include all mammals, including primates and humans, or just rodents? Beyond answering these specific questions, the entire a priori article section criteria needs to be much better documented. This documentation should include how the employed protocol may potentially skew findings.</p><p>7) Methods: &quot;Whether data were analyzed be sex.&quot; This definition is vague and requires further documentation. What analyses were considered an analysis by sex? For example, if sex was employed as a covariate, was this considered a sex analysis? What if the data or analysis/statistics were not shown? What if data were presented as disaggregated by sex but not further analyzed? Similar to the previous point, this section requires more robust documentation so that the reader can understand how this study was conducted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56344.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[We repeat the reviewers’ points here in italic, and include our replies in Roman.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Introduction and Discussion: It was disappointing to see that the introduction and discussion did not address/include several key historical and recently published studies.
