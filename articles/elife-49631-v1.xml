stimulates bone formation by osteoblasts and increases bone strength, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Osteocytes reside in bone matrix, sense changes in mechanical load, and produce signals that alter bone formation by osteoblasts. We report that the ion channel Piezo1 is required for changes in gene expression induced by fluid shear stress in cultured osteocytes and stimulation of Piezo1 by a small molecule agonist is sufficient to replicate the effects of fluid flow on osteocytes. Conditional deletion of <italic>Piezo1</italic> in osteoblasts and osteocytes notably reduced bone mass and strength in mice. Conversely, administration of a Piezo1 agonist to adult mice increased bone mass, mimicking the effects of mechanical loading. These results demonstrate that Piezo1 is a mechanosensitive ion channel by which osteoblast lineage cells sense and respond to changes in mechanical load and identify a novel target for anabolic bone therapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49631.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bone size and strength depend on physical activity. Increased forces on the skeleton, such as those that occur during exercise, trigger more bone formation and make bones stronger. Conversely, reduced forces, caused for example by the lack physical activity, cause bone loss and increase the risk of fractures.</p><p>Bones contain cells called osteocytes. These cells sense the forces exerted on bone and orchestrate bone formation in response. Calcium channels are one type of molecule that has been proposed to help osteocytes to sense forces. Calcium channels reside in the cell membrane and can change their structure to allow calcium ions to flow into the cell. Some of them allow calcium ions into the cell in direct response to physical forces, communicating to the cell that a force has been applied. These are called mechanosensitive ion channels. Until now, however, no specific calcium channels involved in force sensing had been identified in osteocytes.</p><p>Li et al. searched for calcium channels in osteocytes, and found high levels of a mechanosensitive ion channel called Piezo1. Then, Li et al. made genetically modified mice that did not have any Piezo1 in these cells. The skeleton of these mice was small and weak. Moreover, the bones of these modified mice did not respond to forces like the bones of normal mice. To demonstrate this, Li et al. applied a short bout of increased force to the leg bones of unmodified mice and to those of the Piezo1 deficient mice. After two weeks, the bones of the unmodified mice had increased in thickness, whereas the bones lacking Piezo1 had not. A separate study by Sun, Chi et al. showed similar results when Piezo1 was removed from bone cells grown in the laboratory.</p><p>Finally, Li et al. tested the impact of a chemical called Yoda1 on bones. Yoda1 makes the Piezo1 channel open, thus mimicking a physical force. These experiments showed that mice treated with Yoda1 had thicker bones than untreated mice.</p><p>The ability of human bone to become stronger in response to exercise decreases with age, which contributes to the development of osteoporosis. Conditions that require severely restricted exercise, such as disability or extended bedrest, also lead to bone loss. These experiments show that Piezo1 allows bone to respond to physical force, and suggest Piezo1 as a promising therapeutic target to help curtail bone loss in these conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osteocytes</kwd><kwd>Piezo1</kwd><kwd>bone homeostasis</kwd><kwd>mechanosensation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM125503</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nookaew</surname><given-names>Intawat</given-names></name><name><surname>Mannen</surname><given-names>Erin</given-names></name><name><surname>Almeida</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Jinhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR56679</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Almeida</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR047867</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008519</institution-id><institution>University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bone and Joint Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Jinhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mechanical stimuli activate Piezo1 in osteoblast lineage cells and thereby promote bone formation in part via Wnt1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanical signals play critical roles in bone growth and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Turner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ozcivici et al., 2010</xref>). Mechanical stimuli increase bone mass by stimulating the activity and production of bone forming osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meakin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klein-Nulend et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, loss of mechanical signals decreases bone mass by reducing bone formation and stimulating production of bone resorbing osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kondo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakamura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>). Osteocytes, which are cells buried in the bone matrix and derived from osteoblasts, are able to sense changes in mechanical load and orchestrate bone resorption and formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonewald, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein-Nulend et al., 2013</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which osteocytes sense changes in mechanical loads remain unclear.</p><p>A variety of cell surface proteins and structures, including integrins, focal adhesions, and primary cilia, have been proposed to sense mechanical signals in bone cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Litzenberger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nguyen and Jacobs, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rubin et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that ion channels are involved in the sensing of mechanical signals by osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hung et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2002</xref>). For example, calcium influx is an early event following mechanical stimulus in osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hung et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). Several calcium channels, including transient receptor potential channels (TRPV) and multimeric L-type and T-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) are expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abed et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shao et al., 2005</xref>). TRPV4 is perhaps the most studied calcium channel in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Masuyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mizoguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>). Although conditional deletion of <italic>Trpv4</italic> in the osteoblast lineage has not yet been reported, <italic>Trpv4</italic> germline knockout mice exhibit high bone mass, which is opposite of what would be expected with loss of mechanical responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Masuyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Eerden et al., 2013</xref>). Histological analysis of these mice revealed decreased osteoclast number and a normal bone formation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Masuyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Eerden et al., 2013</xref>), arguing against a role for TRPV4 as a mechanosensor in bone. Although mice with germline deletion of the L-type VSCC <italic>Cacna1d</italic> have reduced cross-sectional area in long bones, these mice respond normally to mechanical loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, heretofore, a definitive role for a specific calcium channel in the response of the skeleton to mechanical loading has not been demonstrated.</p><p>Herein we sought to identify calcium channels involved in mechanosensation in osteocytes. We found that <italic>Piezo1,</italic> a mechanosensitive ion channel, is highly expressed in osteocytes and its expression and activity were increased by fluid sheer stress. In addition, conditional deletion of <italic>Piezo1</italic> in osteoblasts and osteocytes decreased cortical thickness and cancellous bone volume. Moreover, the skeletal response to anabolic loading was significantly blunted in mice lacking <italic>Piezo1</italic> in osteoblasts and osteocytes. Importantly, administration of Yoda1, a Piezo1 agonist, increased bone mass in vivo. Overall, our results suggest that osteoblasts, osteocytes, or both, sense and respond to changes in mechanical signals in part via activation of the Piezo1 calcium channel and identify activation of Piezo1 signaling as a potential therapeutic approach for osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Piezo1 mediates mechanotransduction in an osteocyte cell line</title><p>To identify calcium channels that respond to mechanical signals in osteocytes, we compared gene expression profiles of the osteocytic cell line MLO-Y4 under static and fluid flow conditions by RNA-seq. Principal components analysis and volcano plot of transcripts indicated that a significant number of genes were differentially expressed in MLO-Y4 cells under static versus fluid shear stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). GO-enrichment analysis revealed enrichment in genes known to respond to mechanical signals, thereby validating the fluid flow experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We then identified differentially expressed genes related to calcium channels. <italic>Piezo1</italic> was the most highly expressed among 78 calcium channels detected in MLO-Y4 cells under static condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In addition, <italic>Piezo1</italic> was also highly up-regulated by fluid flow in MLO-Y4 cells as determined by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The Piezo ion channel family consists of two members, Piezo1 and Piezo2. While <italic>Piezo2</italic> is expressed predominately in neurons, <italic>Piezo1</italic> is mainly expressed in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murthy et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this previous evidence, the expression of <italic>Piezo1</italic> was approximately 200-fold higher than that of <italic>Piezo2</italic> in MLO-Y4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>Piezo1</italic> expression was also much higher than <italic>Piezo2</italic> in osteocyte-enriched cortical bone isolated from 12-week-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, we focused our remaining analysis on <italic>Piezo1</italic>. Knock-down of <italic>Piezo1</italic> mRNA in MLO-Y4 cells significantly blunted the increase in intracellular calcium induced by fluid-flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Knock-down of <italic>Piezo1</italic> also blunted fluid-flow stimulation of <italic>Ptgs2</italic> and <italic>Tnfrsf11b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), two well-known targets of fluid shear stress in osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wadhwa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of <italic>Piezo1</italic> in MLO-Y4 cells increased the expression of <italic>Ptgs2</italic> and <italic>Tnfrsf11b</italic> and enhanced their induction by fluid shear stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Treatment of MLO-Y4 cells with Yoda1, a small molecule agonist of Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Syeda et al., 2015</xref>), increased intracellular calcium concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and stimulated expression of <italic>Ptgs2</italic>, <italic>Wnt1</italic>, and <italic>Tnfrsf11b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), similar to the effect of fluid flow on these cells.

In contrast, we did not observe changes in the serum levels of CTX, a bone resorption marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Our results demonstrate that activation of Piezo1 by Yoda1 mimics the effects of fluid shear stress on osteocytes and increases bone mass in mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Loss of function studies in epithelial cells have shown that Piezo1 responds to various forms of mechanical forces, including membrane stretch, static pressure, and fluid shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gudipaty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyamoto et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, Piezo1 can be activated by mechanical perturbations of the lipid bilayer alone, demonstrating its role in mechanosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>). Here, the rapid response of MLO-Y4 cells to fluid shear stress is blunted by knocking-down Piezo1 indicating its important role in mechanosensation in bone cells. In addition, the basal skeletal phenotype of mice lacking <italic>Piezo1</italic> in osteoblasts and osteocytes suggests that they have a reduced ability to respond to mechanical stimulation. Direct testing of this idea by performing an anabolic loading regime confirmed that the bones of the conditional knockout mice were less responsive to mechanical signals than controls. This decrease cannot be attributed to intrinsic cell defect since cell survive is not affected by Piezo1 deletion. Thus, our studies demonstrate that Piezo1 plays a critical role in sensing mechanical signals and maintaining bone homeostasis. In humans, truncation mutations in <italic>Piezo1</italic> cause a recessive form of generalized lymphatic dysplasia but a musculoskeletal phenotype has not been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fotiou et al., 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, SNPs in the human <italic>Piezo1</italic> locus are associated with low bone mineral density and increased fracture risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morris et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While preparing the revision of this manuscript, Sun et, al published a similar study in which <italic>Piezo1</italic> was deleted from osteoblast lineage cells using <italic>BGLAP-Cre</italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). Similar to our studies, deletion of <italic>Piezo1</italic> in osteoblast lineage cells resulted in a low bone mass phenotype. Importantly, loss of Piezo1 in osteoblast lineage cells blunted the bone loss caused by hind-limb suspension, supporting the idea that Piezo1 contributes to the skeletal response to mechanical stimulation.</p><p>Deletion of Piezo1 from osteoblasts and osteocytes did not completely abolish the response of skeleton to mechanical stimulus. Thus Piezo1 is not the sole mechanosensor in osteoblasts and osteocytes. Other cell surface proteins and structures including integrins, focal adhesions, and primary cilia, also likely contribute to sensing mechanical signals in bone. Possible crosstalk between Piezo1 and these other sensors will need to be addressed in future studies. It is also possible that cells other than osteoblasts and osteocytes, such as osteoblast progenitors, sense changes in load and contribute to the increase in bone formation.</p><p>It is important to note that, in addition to osteoblasts and osteocytes, the <italic>Dmp1-Cre</italic> transgene used in our study also causes recombination in skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that loss of <italic>Piezo1</italic> in muscle cells also contributed to the skeletal phenotype we observed in the conditional knockout mice. However, lean body weight and muscle mass in the conditional knockout mice were unchanged, arguing against a role for muscle cells in the skeletal phenotype. In addition, the potent effects of <italic>Piezo1</italic> gain- and loss-of-function in MLO-Y4 cells suggest that its effects are at least partly due to actions in osteocytes. Nonetheless, to distinguish between the possible contributions of Piezo1 in osteoblasts versus osteocytes, further studies using a Cre driver strain that is active in osteocytes but not in osteoblasts will be required.</p><p>We identified Wnt1 as a potential downstream effector of Piezo1. Previous studies have shown that mechanical loading increases <italic>Wnt1</italic> expression in murine bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holguin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelly et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, deletion of <italic>Wnt1</italic> in osteoblasts and osteocytes using a <italic>Dmp1-Cre</italic> transgene produced a skeletal phenotype that resembles the one we observed by deletion of <italic>Piezo1</italic> using the same Cre driver strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Joeng et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that mechanical signals stimulate <italic>Wnt1</italic> expression via activation of Piezo1. The molecular pathways by which Piezo1 controls gene expression are only partially understood. Nonetheless, cell culture studies demonstrate that Piezo1 is required for YAP1 nuclear localization in neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pathak et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that Piezo1 controls nuclear translocation of YAP1 induced by fluid flow in MLO-Y4 cells. YAP1 and TAZ have been implicated as mediators of the response to mechanical signals in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hansen et al., 2015</xref>). Our finding that YAP1 and TAZ are required for stimulation of <italic>Wnt1</italic> by fluid flow or Yoda1 suggests that mechanical activation of Piezo1 stimulates <italic>Wnt1</italic> expression in osteocytes, at least in part, by activating YAP1 and TAZ. Consistent with this idea, deletion of <italic>Yap1</italic> and <italic>Taz</italic> in mature osteoblasts and osteocytes caused a skeletal phenotype that was similar to deletion of <italic>Piezo1</italic>, albeit less pronounced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>). The milder bone phenotype of <italic>Yap1/Taz</italic> conditional knockout mice suggests that YAP1 and TAZ are not the only downstream effectors of Piezo1 in osteoblast lineage cells.</p><p>Similar to unloading, deletion of <italic>Piezo1</italic> in osteoblasts and osteocytes led to not only decreases in bone formation, but also increases in RANKL expression and bone resorption. Indeed, increased RANKL expression as well as osteoclast number have been observed in hind-limb unloaded mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>). In our previous studies, we detected an increase in osteoclast number in mice that lack <italic>Yap1</italic> and <italic>Taz</italic> in osteoblasts and osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that YAP1 and TAZ are downstream effectors of Piezo1 in controlling osteoclast formation. Thus, loss of Piezo1 in osteoblasts and osteocytes mimics the overall effect of unloading on the skeleton, further supporting the idea that Piezo1 is a mechanosensor in bone.</p><p>Activation of Piezo1 using the small molecule Yoda1 mimics the effects of fluid flow in various cell types including endothelial cells, erythrocytes, platelets, and smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ilkan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rode et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, Yoda1 administration promotes lymphatic valve formation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we showed that Piezo1 activation by Yoda1 mimics the impact of mechanical stimulation in cultured osteocytic cells as well as ex vivo bone organ cultures. More importantly, administration of Yoda1 to mice increased bone mass and elevated a bone formation marker in the circulation, demonstrating that activation of Piezo1 is a potential target for anabolic bone therapy. One possible limitation of such an approach would be the functions of Piezo1 in other tissues, such as the vasculature. However, it is important to note that bone anabolism requires only transient mechanical stimulation of the skeleton in rodents or humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vlachopoulos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hinton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kato et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that selectivity for bone anabolism may be achieved by administration regimes that result in only transient activation of Piezo1 by ligands such as Yoda1.</p><p>In summary, our studies demonstrate a critical role for Piezo1 in the maintenance of bone homeostasis and suggest that this occurs via mediation of mechanosensation in osteoblasts, osteocytes, or both. Our finding that activation of Piezo1 mimics the effects of mechanical stimulation on bone cells and increases bone mass in mice sets the stage for exploration of this pathway as a therapeutic target

All of the animals were handled according to approved protocols.</p><p>To quantify cancellous bone formation, we injected mice with calcein (20 mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally 7 and 3 days before harvest. To quantify periosteal and endocortical bone formation, we injected mice with calcein (20 mg/kg body weight) and Alizarin Red (20 mg/kg body weight) 10 and 3 days before harvest. For gene expression, we injected Yoda1 into 4-month-old female C57BL/6J mice one time and harvested tibiae 4 hr later for RNA extraction. For bone mass evaluation, we injected Yoda1 into 4-month-old female C57BL/6J mice five consecutive days per week for 2 weeks (day 1–5 and day 8–12) and harvested the mice at day 15 for analysis. Yoda1 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in DMSO at 40 mM as a stock, diluted in 5% ethanol, and injected intraperitoneally at 5 µmol/kg body weight. Mice were rank-ordered by body weight and then assigned to Veh or Yoda1 groups to give identical group means. All investigators involved in data collection were blinded as to the genotype and group of the mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell line</title><p>HEK 293 T cells were authenticated by ATCC.

Fifteen dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> oscillatory fluid shear stress was applied on MLO-Y4 cells at 1 Hz for 2 hr using an IBDI pump system (IBIDI, Germany). For Yoda1 treatment, cells were cultured in the presence of 10 µM Yoda1 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or DMSO for 2 hr. Immediately after the treatments, we isolated RNA from cells using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) for qPCR or RNA-seq analysis. To silence <italic>Piezo1</italic>, we generated <italic>Piezo1</italic> shRNA expression plasmid using the following oligonucleotides in the pLKO.1-TRC cloning vector (Addgene Plasmid #10878, a gift from David Root): forward oligo: <named-content content-type="sequence">5’-CCGGTC-GGCGCTTGCTAGAACTTCACTCGAGTGAAGTTCTAGCAAGCGCCGATTTTTG-3’</named-content>; reverse oligo: <named-content content-type="sequence">5’- AATTCAAAAATCGGCGCTTGCTAGAACTTCACTCGAGTGAAGTTCTAGCAAGCGC-CGA-3’</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Yap1</italic> shRNA (TRCN0000238432) and <italic>Taz</italic> shRNA (TRCN0000095951) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). A shRNA against firefly luciferase was used as a control (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). For virus production, HEK293T cells were cultured in a 6-well culture plate and co-transfected with a total 3 μg of lentiviral shRNA vector, pMD2G (Addgene plasmid #12259, a gift from Didier Trono), and psPAX2 (Addgene plasmid # 12260, a gift from Didier Trono) at the ratio of 2:0.9:0.4 using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI). Culture media was changed 12 hr after transfection and viral supernatants were collected 48 hr after media change. Viral supernatants were filtered through a 0.45 µm filter and used immediately to transduce cells cultured in a 10 cm dish. Cells were then subjected to selection with G418 (100 µg/ml) or puromycin (25 µg/ml) for 5 days before treatment. To overexpress Piezo1 in MLO-Y4 cells, we transfected mPiezo1-IRES-eGFP (Addgene plasmid # 80925, a gift from Ardem Patapoutian) into MLO-Y4 cells using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) and then treated these cells with 15 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> oscillatory fluid shear stress at 1 Hz for 2 hr. Plasmids for expression of <italic>Cas9</italic> and sgRNAs for knocking out <italic>Piezo1</italic> in UAMS-32 cells were prepared by inserting oligonucleotides encoding the desired sgRNA sequence into the pX458 vector using the protocol recommended by the Zhang laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cong et al., 2013</xref>). Plasmids expressing <italic>Cas9</italic> and <italic>Piezo1</italic> sgRNAs were transfected into UAMS-32 cells using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI).

Femurs were dissected and both ends were removed in a culture hood. Bone marrow was then flushed out using PBS and the periosteal surface was scraped to remove periosteal cells. Femoral shafts were then cultured in a 12-well-plate with 1 ml of α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine for 24 hr. We then treated femur shafts with 10 µM Yoda1 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or DMSO for 4 hr. Femur shafts were then collected for RNA isolation and qPCR analysis.

The libraries were then pooled and sequenced using a NextSeq sequencer with 75 cycles of sequencing reaction. Data handling and processing were performed on the basis of a previous bioinformatics pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nookaew et al., 2012</xref>). The high-quality reads (phred quality score,&gt;25; length after trimming,&gt;20 bases) were obtained with the dynamic trimming algorithm in the SolexaQA++ toolkits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cox et al., 2010</xref>), and aligned with the mouse genome version GRCm38 using BWA software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). Then the alignment files (.bam) were used to generate read counts for statistical analysis. The differential gene expression analysis was performed using negative binomial based statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Love et al., 2014</xref>). The adjusted p-values were used for gene enrichment analysis based on Gene Ontology using the piano package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Väremo et al., 2013</xref>).

One hour before initiating fluid flow, the culture medium was removed and 100 µl Hank's Buffer with Hepes (HHBS) containing 4 µM Fluo-8 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was added to the culture, as described by the manufacturer. The cells were then cultured at 37°C for 30 min. After additional incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the chamber slide was placed under a confocal microscope in order to record the intensity of fluorescence of MLO-Y4 cells. Fluorescence was recorded for 3 min before starting fluid flow using HHBS and then recorded for another 10 min. The increase of intracellular concentration was calculated by subtracting the initial mean fluorescence. For measuring intracellular calcium concentration in cells with Yoda1 treatment, we cultured 4,000 MLO-Y4 cells per well in a 96-well-plate. We preloaded the cells with Fluo-8 as described by the manufacturer and read the intensity of the fluorescence using a Victor X3 multi-label plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) immediately after the treatment. We measured the fluorescence for 5 min at an interval of 20 s. The percentage of increase in intracellular calcium concentration was calculated as (F<sub>x</sub>-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Skeletal analysis</title><p>Tibial X-rays were obtained using an UltraFocus X-ray machine (Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, Arizona) and BMD of the lumbar spine and femur were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry using a PIXImus Densitometer (GE-Lunar Corp.) Three dimensional bone volume and architecture of L4 vertebra, femur, and tibia were measured by µCT (model μCT40, Scanco Medical, Wayne, PA). The femur, vertebrae (L4), or tibia, were cleaned of soft tissues and fixed in 10% Millonig’s formalin for 24 hr. Bone were then gradually dehydrated into 100% ethanol. Bone samples were loaded into a 12.3 mm diameter scanning tube and images acquired in the μCT40. The scans were integrated into 3D voxel images (1024 × 1024 pixel matrices for each individual planar stack) and a Gaussian filter (sigma = 0.8, support = 1) was used to reduce signal noise. Scanco Eval Program v.6.0 was used for measuring bone volume. A threshold of 220 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> was applied to all scans at medium resolution (E = 55 kVp, I = 145 µA, integration time = 200 ms) for trabecular bone measurements. The cortical bone and the primary spongiosa were manually excluded from the analysis. Trabecular bone measurements at the distal femur were made on 151 slices beginning 8–10 slices away from the growth plate and proceeding proximally. Trabecular bone measurements in the vertebra was determined using 100 slices (1.2 mm) of the anterior (ventral) vertebral body immediately inferior (caudal) to the superior (cranial) growth plate. All trabecular measurements were made by drawing contours every 10 to 20 slices and voxel counting was used for bone volume per tissue volume and sphere filling distance transformation indices, without pre-assumptions about the bone shape as a rod or plate for trabecular microarchitecture. Femoral cortical thickness, periosteal circumference, and endocortical circumference were measured at the mid-diaphysis. For tibial cortical thickness, we analyzed 18 slices 5 mm proximal from the distal tibiofibular junction. Vertebral cortical bone thickness was determined on the ventral cortical wall using contours of cross-sectional images, drawn to exclude trabecular bone. Cortical analysis were measured at a threshold of 260 mg/cm<sup>3</sup>. Calibration and quality control were performed weekly using five density standards and spatial resolution was verified monthly using a tungsten wire rod. We based beam-hardening correction on the calibration records. Corrections for 200 mg hydroxyapatite were made for all energies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Histology</title><p>Lumbar vertebrae were fixed for 24 hr in 10% Millonig’s formalin, dehydrated into 100% ethanol, embedded in methyl methacrylate, and then 5 μm longitudinal sections were obtained. After removal of plastic and rehydration, we stained sections for TRAP activity and counter-stained with T-blue. Quantitative histomorphometry was performed to determine osteoblast and osteoclast number using Osteomeasure system (OsteoMetrics, Decatur, GA) interfaced to an Axio image M2 (Carl Zeiss, NY). Bone formation rate was measured using unstained sections in Osteomeasure system. We used terminology recommended by the Histomorphometry Nomenclature Committee of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dempster et al., 2013</xref>). For quantification of periosteal and endocortical bone formation, femurs or tibiae were fixed in 10% Millonig’s formalin for 24 hr, dehydrated into 100% ethanol, embedded in methyl methacrylate, and then 80 μm cross sections were obtained at the femoral mid-diaphysis for femoral sections and 5 mm proximal from the distal tibiofibular junction for tibial sections. We then measured mineralizing surface and mineral apposition rate using the Osteomeasure system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Tibia axial loading</title><p>A cyclic axial load was applied to left tibia of mice to achieve +1200 µε peak strain at the tibial midshaft using an Electroforce TA 5500 (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE). To determine the required load to achieve +1200 µε peak strain for each genotype of experimental mice, axial loading was applied to harvested tibiae ex vivo. A single-element strain gauge (C2A-06-015LW-120, VPG Micro-Measurements, Wendell, NC) was attached to the antero-medial surface of the tibia located 5 mm proximal from the distal tibiofibular junction using M-Bond 200 adhesive kit (VPG Micro-Measurements). We recorded the force-strain regressions using Electroforce TA 5500 software. We then applied the same amount of load to mice in vivo according to their genotype (8.5 Newton for <italic>Piezo1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice and 7.5 Newton for <italic>Dmp1-Cre; Piezo1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice). The left tibia of each mouse was loaded for five consecutive days per week for 2 weeks (day 1–5 and day 8–12), and the load was applied in 1200 cycles with 4 Hz triangle waveform and 0.1 s rest time between each cycle, a protocol shown to be anabolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). We injected calcein (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and Alizarin Red (Sigma) intraperitoneally into mice 10 days and 3 days before euthanasia to label new bone formation. We euthanized the mice and collected tissues at day 15 for skeletal analysis. For gene expression analysis, we loaded left tibia of 4-month-old female mice with one bout of loading and harvested tibiae 5 hr after loading for RNA extraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Biomechanical testing</title><p>We performed three-point bending test on femurs at room temperature using a miniature bending apparatus with the posterior femoral surface lying on lower supports (7 mm apart) and the left support immediately proximal to the distal condyles. Load was applied to the anterior femoral surface by an actuator midway between the two supports moving at a constant rate of 3 mm/min to produce a physiological in vivo strain rate of 1% for the average murine femur. Maximum load (N) and displacement (mm) were recorded. The external measurements (length, width and thickness) of the femora were recorded with a digital caliper. We measured the moment of inertia in the midshaft of femur using µCT (model μCT40, Scanco Medical). The mechanical properties were normalized for bone size and ultimate strength and stress (N/mm<sup>2</sup>; in megapascals and MPa) was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>Organs and whole bones were harvested from animals, removed of soft tissues, and stored immediately in liquid nitrogen.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nele A Haelterman (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript describing a role for the mechano-sensitive ion channel Piezo1 in bone remodeling. The authors find that conditional deletion of Piezo1 in the osteoblast/osteocyte lineage decreases cortical thickness as well as trabecular bone volume. In addition, loss of this channel abolishes mechanical-induced bone accrual, suggesting that Piezo1 is a key factor in regulating this aspect of bone homeostasis. Finally, the authors show that Piezo1 functions through Yap/Taz, which activate Wnt1 signaling to increase bone mass. The data presented in this manuscript are compelling. Very recently, a paper by Sun et al. has similarly identified Piezo1 as a major player in bone mechanosensation. Both groups have independently come to the same conclusion, which strengthens the finding that Piezo1 plays a role in this process. The current manuscript still provides a significant advance to the field, given that the authors provide mechanistic insights into the pathways that are activated upon mechanical loading of bone. In addition, the current manuscript also answers whether Piezo1 is truly required for bone's mechanosensing ability by performing anabolic loading-experiments on conditional Piezo1 mutants.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors suggest a model in which mechanical stimulation activates Yap/Taz transcription factors to induce Wnt1 expression and hereby increase bone mass. Indeed, in conditional Piezo1 mutants Wnt1-expression is reduced. To unequivocally prove that in vivo, this pathway is indeed underlying the anabolic response to mechanical stimuli, the authors should return to the samples collected from their anabolic bone-loading experiment and: a) Show that Wnt-1 expression is increased in Piezo1f/f mice upon loading, whereas this increase is blunted in Dmp1-Cre; Piezo1f/f mice. This could be done by Q-RT PCR.</p><p>b) Show a change in the nuclear localization of Yap/Taz in Piezo1f/f mice upon loading, that is missing from Dmp1-Cre; Piezo1f/f mice.</p><p>2) The authors perform RNA-seq to determine the effects of FSS on global patterns of gene expression in MLO-Y4 cells, but then only look at a few select genes (Wnt1, Ptgs2, Opg) for most of the subsequent in vitro experiments after Piezo1 or Yap/Taz knockdown +/- Yoda1 treatment. Ideally, the authors would perform additional transcriptomic profiling in these studies to determine the overall impact of Piezo1 deficiency on global patterns of gene expression changes in response to FSS. In the absence of these data, extending their panel of RT-qPCR target genes would be helpful to better understand how important Piezo1 is for gene expression changes in response to FSS signaling in vitro.</p><p>3) In Figure 3C, D, it is very interesting that Piezo1 conditional knockout mice show clear (only slightly blunted) increases in loading-induced bone formation, yet no detectable gains in bone mass. This apparent discrepancy should be explored in more detail. What are the effects of loading on osteoclastic bone resorption in these animals? It would be sufficient to show serum CTX levels.</p><p>4) The in vitro data obtained with Yoda1 in Figure 5E-H are interesting, but appear incomplete. Overall, the effects of this treatment on bone mass are rather mild, such that a large (n=12/group) sample size was needed to observe statistically-significant effects. Given potential effects of Piezo1 on osteoclasts, it is important to measure serum CTX levels. Finally, an opportunity appears to have been missed here to determine the effects of Yoda1 on bone endpoints in Piezo1 conditional knockout mice. This would be a nice, though not an essential experiment to link the in vitro and in vivo data, and to address the specificity of Yoda1 in mice.</p><p>5) The impact of Piezo1 deficiency on Ptgs2 up-regulation in Figure 1E is quite mild. This strongly suggests that other (Piezo1-independent) pathways are needed for Ptgs2 upregulation. The authors should at least expand their discussion to consider how other signaling pathways may be contributing to gene expression changes in response to FSS.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49631.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors suggest a model in which mechanical stimulation activates Yap/Taz transcription factors to induce Wnt1 expression and hereby increase bone mass.

The tibiae from this experiment have been sectioned and used for histomorphometry analysis to measure bone formation rate. Thus, there were not samples available to perform gene expression analysis.

We agree with the reviewers that an unbiased transcriptomic analysis of cells lacking Piezo1 in response to fluid shear stress will provide more information to better understand how Piezo1 mediates the response to mechanical stimulation.

The changes occurring locally at the loaded tibia may not contribute significantly to circulating serum markers such as CTX. In addition, previous studies have shown that anabolic loading does not affect osteoclast number (Brodt and Silva, 2010) and osteoclast marker gene expression, such as Cathepsin K (Silva et al., 2012), indicating that anabolic loading as performed here does not affect bone resorption. The fact that there still was a significant increase in bone formation in loaded tibia in the conditional knockout mice indicates that Piezo1 is not the only mechanosensor in bone. Other pathways such as integrins or primary cilia may also contribute to the skeletal response to mechanical stimulation. Importantly, the bone formation induced by anabolic loading in <italic>Piezo1</italic> conditional knockout mice was not sufficient to cause a measurable increase in cortical thickness, such as occurred in control mice, demonstrating the importance of Piezo1 in mediating the skeletal response to mechanical loading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The in vitro data obtained with Yoda1 in Figure 5E-H are interesting, but appear incomplete.

We have included these data in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. We agree that administration of Yoda1 to Piezo1 conditional knockout mice would nicely address the specificity of the compound for Piezo1. Unfortunately, production of adult mice for this experiment, drug administration, and skeletal analysis would require significantly more time than the 2 months suggested for submission of revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The impact of Piezo1 deficiency on Ptgs2 up-regulation in Figure 1E is quite mild.

In addition to Piezo1, other cell surface proteins and structures, including integrins, focal adhesions, and primary cilia, may also contribute to sensing mechanical signals in bone. The crosstalk between Piezo1 and these other sensors needs to be addressed in future studies. We have discussed this issue in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
