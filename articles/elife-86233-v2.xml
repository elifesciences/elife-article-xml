Acquisition of unique morphologies at the appropriate position along the chick cochlea, the basilar papilla, requires that nascent HCs determine their tonotopic positions during development. The complex signalling within the auditory organ between a developing HC and its local niche along the cochlea is poorly understood. Using a combination of live imaging and NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, we reveal that there is a gradient in the cellular balance between glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway in developing HCs along the tonotopic axis. Perturbing this balance by inhibiting different branches of cytosolic glucose catabolism disrupts developmental morphogen signalling and abolishes the normal tonotopic gradient in HC morphology. These findings highlight a causal link between graded morphogen signalling and metabolic reprogramming in specifying the tonotopic identity of developing HCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>morphogen</kwd><kwd>hair cells</kwd><kwd>inner ear</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/V006371/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mann</surname><given-names>Zoe F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000674</institution-id><institution>Physiological Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mann</surname><given-names>Zoe F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>King’s Prize Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mann</surname><given-names>Zoe F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Distinct metabolic states coupled with differing morphogen levels regulate HC morphology along the tonotopic axis of the developing chick auditory organ.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hearing relies upon the life-long function of mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) and their associated glial-like supporting cells (SCs) within the cochlea. In both mammals and birds, different frequencies stimulate HCs located at different positions along the basal-to-apical long axis of the auditory epithelium to separate complex sounds into their spectral components. This phenomenon, known as tonotopy, underlies our ability to differentiate between the high pitch of a mosquito and the low rumbling of thunder. The specific factors regulating the development of tonotopy remain largely unclear. As high-frequency HCs show increased vulnerability to insults, including ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordon-Salant, 2005</xref>), noise damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fettiplace and Nam, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), and ototoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forge and Richardson, 1993</xref>), awareness of the mechanisms underlying the formation of frequency-specific HC properties is crucial to understanding both acquired auditory defects, HC repair and regeneration. Enhanced knowledge of the pathways that drive specification of HC phenotypes at different frequency positions could identify novel strategies to preserve and restore high-frequency hearing loss.</p><p>Metabolism, encompassing the complex network of chemical reactions that sustain life (summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), has emerged as a key regulator of cell fate and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ito and Ito, 2016</xref>). Reciprocity between metabolic networks and the epigenome has been extensively studied in models of cancer cell biology and tumourigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kinnaird et al., 2016</xref>). Here, chromatin modifying enzymes (involved in histone acetylation and methylation) that drive cell fate switches rely upon metabolic intermediates as cofactors or substrates, highlighting a link between cell metabolism and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campbell and Wellen, 2018</xref>). Reprogramming between glycolytic and oxidative pathways has also been reported in developing tissues, including migratory neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharya et al., 2020</xref>), the zebrafish otic vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kantarci et al., 2020</xref>), trophectoderm in the mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chi et al., 2020</xref>), and the presomitic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oginuma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bulusu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, a regulatory role for metabolism has not been explored in the context of cell fate and patterning in the developing inner ear epithelia. This is, in part, because the classic biochemical approaches from which our knowledge of metabolism has formed involve the destructive extraction of metabolites from a sample. Probing metabolism in this manner, although valuable, means that any spatial organisation of metabolic pathways in complex tissues is lost. As the cochlea contains multiple cell types, investigating the role of metabolism in the regulation of their development requires experimental approaches capable of interrogating metabolic pathways in live preparations with single-cell resolution.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pathways of glucose catabolism regulating cellular NADPH/NADH.</title><p>(pink mitochondrial OXPHOS) – Glucose metabolism in <italic>mitochondria</italic>. Following its conversion from glucose during glycolysis, pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Its sequential oxidation provides reducing equivalents in the form of NADH to the electron transport chain (ETC), driving ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). (yellow glycolysis) – <italic>Cytosolic</italic> glucose flux via the main branch of glycolysis. In this process, one molecule of glucose is anaerobically converted into two molecules of pyruvate to yield two molecules of ATP. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) acts to maintain the pool of NAD<sup>+</sup> necessary for glycolysis to take place by oxidising NADH upon the reduction of pyruvate to lactate. (green pentose phosphate pathway) – <italic>Cytosolic</italic> glucose flux into the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Running parallel to glycolysis, the PPP branches off at glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) generating NADPH and ribose 5-phosphate (R5P). PPP shuttles carbons back into the main glycolytic pathway at glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Different pathways of glucose flux can be targeted for pharmacological intervention.

By spatially resolving differences in the fluorescence decay of the reduced redox cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and its phosphorylated analogue NADPH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) we can extract information about the metabolic state of a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blacker et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we apply this technique to investigate a role for metabolism in specifying morphological properties of proximal (high-frequency) verses distal (low-frequency) HCs in the chick cochlea. The HC phenotypes associated with different tonotopic positions are defined using previously characterised morphometrics as read-outs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tilney et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodyear and Richardson, 1997</xref>). By applying NAD(P)H FLIM in different regions of the developing basilar papilla (BP), we identify a gradient in NADPH-linked glucose metabolism along the tonotopic axis. The NAD(P)H gradient did not originate from a tonotopic switch between glycolytic and oxidative pathways or from differences in cellular glucose uptake. We find that the metabolic gradient along the developing BP originates instead from tonotopic differences in the catabolic fate of cytosolic glucose once it has entered the cell. By modulating the flux of glucose through specific cytosolic branches, we systematically interrogated its role in specifying tonotopic properties of developing HCs. We found that the cellular balance of glucose entering the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the main branch of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) instructs tonotopic HC morphology by regulating the graded expression of Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (Bmp7) and its antagonist Chordin-like-1 (Chdl1), known determinants of tonotopic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mann et al., 2014</xref>). This work highlights a novel role for cytosolic glucose metabolism in specifying HC positional identity at the morphological level providing the first evidence of a link between metabolism and morphogen signalling in the developing inner ear.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NAD(P)H FLIM reveals differences in the cellular balance between NADPH and NADH along the tonotopic axis of the developing BP</title><p>NAD and NADP are metabolic cofactors responsible for ferrying reducing equivalents between intracellular redox reactions throughout the cellular metabolic network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The two molecules are fluorescent in their reduced (electron-carrying) forms NADH and NADPH, a feature that is lost upon oxidation to NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup>. The spectral properties of NADH and NADPH are identical, meaning that their combined signal emitted from living cells is labelled as NAD(P)H. FLIM of NAD(P)H has shown significant promise for identifying changes in the metabolic pathways active at a given location in living cells.</p><p>NAD(P)H FLIM typically resolves two fluorescence lifetime components in live cells and tissues one with a duration of around 0.4 ns coming from freely diffusing NAD(P)H (<italic>τ</italic><sub>free</sub>) and the other of 2 ns or more from the pool of NAD(P)H that is bound to enzymes and cofactors (<italic>τ</italic><sub>bound</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Skala et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu and Heikal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

NAD(P)H FLIM can therefore report changes in metabolic state in live cells during physiological processes. We used NAD(P)H FLIM to monitor metabolism along the proximal-to-distal (tonotopic) axis of the BP during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>). The gradient observed in <italic>τ</italic><sub>bound</sub> throughout BP development, specifically at E6 and E9, is consistent with our previous work, where we showed that graded morphogen signalling along the BP establishes HC positional identity between E6 and E8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thiede et al., 2014</xref>). Around E6, when cells in the BP begin acquiring their positional identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thiede et al., 2014</xref>), we observed a significant difference in <italic>τ</italic><sub>bound</sub> along the tonotopic axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–H</xref>).

We therefore tested whether the gradient in cellular NADPH/NADH reflected a progressive shift from glycolytic to mitochondrial OXPHOS, differences in cellular glucose uptake, or in the catabolic fate of glucose by conducting live imaging in BP explants using a range of metabolic indicators. To assess mitochondrial metabolism, we used the potentiometric fluorescent probe tetramethyl-rhodamine-methyl-ester (TMRM), a cell permeable dye that reports mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>mt</sub>) in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duchen et al., 2003</xref>).

TMRM fluorescence revealed no significant difference in ΔΨ<sub>mt</sub> between proximal and distal regions at any developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Analysis of TMRM fluorescence revealed a consistently higher ΔΨ<sub>mt</sub> in fully differentiated HCs compared to SCs from E14 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To rule out whether the higher TMRM fluorescence occurred due to differences in dye uptake via the HC transduction channel, explants were dual loaded with the permeant mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channel blocker FM1-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gale et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Increased proliferation is therefore unlikely to account for the higher cell density observed in the proximal region following the inhibition of glycolysis.

These data also provide further evidence indicating a causal interaction between metabolic and morphogen signalling networks during development. Ascertaining a role for cytosolic glucose metabolism in specifying proximal verses distal HC fate, specifically related to frequency tuning, would require a detailed analysis of HC physiological properties. Future work should therefore determine whether altering metabolism affects the developmental acquisition of not only HC morphology, but also the intrinsic electrophysiological properties and firing characteristics documented for HCs at different tonotopic positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuchs and Evans, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuchs et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fettiplace and Fuchs, 1999</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Generating new HCs that recapitulate the features of those in a healthy cochlea requires a detailed knowledge of the cell biology driving their formation. As high-frequency HCs are more vulnerable to insult, there is also a need to understand differences in the specific factors and signalling pathways that drive the identity of distinct HC subtypes. Over recent years, metabolism has emerged as a key driver of cell fate and function across various biological systems and cellular contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh-Choudhary et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tarazona and Pourquié, 2020</xref>). Taking both qualitative and quantitative approaches, we identify regional differences in metabolism along the frequency axis of the developing chick cochlea and explore a role for causal signalling between graded morphogens and glucose metabolism in establishing HC positional identity. We identify a tonotopic gradient in cellular NADPH, originating from differences in glucose flux between high- and low-frequency HCs. Tonotopic differences in the catabolic fate of glucose in glycolysis or the PPP modulates Bmp7 and Chdl-1 signalling along the developing BP. This study provides the first evidence supporting a role for crosstalk between metabolism and morphogen gradients in the developing auditory system, building on our current understanding of cell fate specification.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>NAD(P)H FLIM reveals a gradient in metabolism along the tonotopic axis of the developing chick cochlea</title><p>Using NAD(P)H FLIM, we uncovered a proximal-to-distal gradient in cellular NADPH resulting from tonotopic differences in the fate of cytosolic glucose.

Cell size, cell membrane composition, and metabolic rate are tightly correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hulbert and Else, 1999</xref>). PPP-derived NADPH is utilised extensively in proliferating cells during development, where it regulates cell cycle progression, differentiation, and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vizán et al., 2009</xref>). Increased glucose metabolism has been reported in regenerating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Love et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Patel et al., 2022</xref>) and developing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oginuma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bulusu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>) where it plays an important role in regulating cell fate, behaviour, and shape. However, the chosen path of glucose catabolism is context dependent and differs across processes and between tissues. PPP metabolism regulates cell division and proliferation through its ability to generate lipid and nucleotide precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stincone et al., 2015</xref>). Increased glucose flux into the PPP but not the main branch of glycolysis was also recently shown to regulate the balance between proliferation and cell death in the regenerating limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Patel et al., 2022</xref>). In the BP, HCs exit the cell cycle in three progressive waves following a centre-to-periphery progression beginning at E5. During this process, both HCs and SCs are added in apposition, to the edges of the band of post-mitotic cells that preceded them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katayama and Corwin, 1989</xref>). HC differentiation then begins in the distal portion of the BP at around E6 and extends proximally along the cochlea expanding across the width of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodyear and Richardson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cotanche and Sulik, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartolami et al., 1991</xref>). These graded differences in HC size along the organ are an essential requirement for correct auditory coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fettiplace and Fuchs, 1999</xref>). As larger cell size is correlated with increased G6PDH activity and thus more glucose flux into the PPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vizán et al., 2009</xref>), the higher activity in the proximal BP region may underlie the graded differences in HC size that arise during development. It could be argued that the smaller cell size induced following metabolic perturbation in the proximal BP is a result of impaired differentiation. However, given that distal HCs maintain their small size in the mature organ, this morphological change observed in the proximal region following treatment with 2-DOG and 6-AN is consistent with a distal-like phenotype. Without a detailed characterisation of distal and proximal cell growth from E6 through to adult stages, this puzzle is challenging to resolve.</p><p>PPP metabolism is also closely linked with de novo synthesis of lipids and cholesterol, which form an integral part of cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sykes et al., 1986</xref>). Functional interactions between ion channel complexes in the membrane and the local lipid environment have been described previously in mammalian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirono et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gianoli et al., 2017</xref>) and avian HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Purcell et al., 2011</xref>). Frequency tuning in the BP relies on the intrinsic electrical properties of the HCs themselves, where graded differences in the number and kinetics of voltage-gated calcium channels and calcium-sensitive (BK type) potassium channels underlie the ability of HCs to resonate electrically in response to sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fettiplace and Fuchs, 1999</xref>). By regulating cholesterol in the HC membrane, the graded PPP activity observed here may also regulate aspects of HC electrical tuning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A causal link between metabolism and morphogen signalling during development sets up HC positional identity</title><p>Morphogen signalling gradients have well defined roles in directing cell identity along developing axes, where cells determine their fate as a function of morphogen concentrations at different positions along them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Towers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dessaud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sagner and Briscoe, 2019</xref>). We showed previously that reciprocal gradients of Bmp7 and Chdl1 establish HC positional identity along the developing BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mann et al., 2014</xref>). The gradient of Bmp7 is established by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling emanating from ventral midline structures, including the notochord and floor plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Son et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we identify a gradient in glucose metabolism that regulates the morphology of developing HCs along the tonotopic axis through a causal interaction with the Bmp7–Chdl1 network. Disrupting this gradient using 2-DOG, SAM, or 6-AN mimics the effects on HC morphology reported previously for altered Shh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Son et al., 2015</xref>) and Bmp7 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mann et al., 2014</xref>), which induced distal-like HC phenotypes in the proximal BP. Furthermore, the effects of impaired glycolysis could be partially rescued in explants treated with 2-DOG in the presence of Chdl1. Our findings thus indicate a complex and causal interplay between Bmp7 and Chdl1 morphogen gradients and glucose metabolism in the specification of HC tonotopic identity. Metabolic gradients are also known to regulate elongation of the body axis and somite patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oginuma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>). By establishing a gradient in intracellular pH, glycolysis drives graded Wnt signalling and specifies mesodermal versus neuronal cell fate along the developing body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oginuma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bulusu et al., 2017</xref>). The specific role of the pH<sub>i</sub> gradient along the developing BP is unclear, however given the importance of the Wnt signalling pathway in both cochlear development and regeneration and repair, it will be important to investigate crosstalk between the two in the context of HC formation and tonotopic identity.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings indicate a causal link between PPP activity and graded morphogen signalling in specifying HC morphology along the tonotopic axis during development. However, a detailed physiological analysis is required to accurately confirm whether these morphological changes reflect a switch between proximal and distal HC fate. Future work should determine how altering the fate of glucose affects the morphological and functional development of the stereociliary bundle, the intrinsic electrophysiological properties and the firing characteristics of HCs at different tonotopic positions. Untangling further the interactions between the components of the Shh, Bmp7, and metabolic signalling networks will advance our understanding of how HCs acquire the unique morphologies necessary for auditory coding. From what we understand about frequency selectivity in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gleich et al., 2005</xref>), recapitulation of tonotopy will require that any gradient, and its associated signalling networks, scale correctly in different inner ear sensory patches and across species with varying head size and cochlear lengths. Understanding how the mechanical constraints associated with growth and patterning in different sense organs modulate these networks will advance our understanding of how to drive formation of specific HC phenotypes in inner ear organoid models.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Embryo care and procedures</title><p>Fertilised White Leghorn chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus domesticus</italic>) eggs (Henry Stewart &amp; Co Ltd, UK) were incubated at 37.5°C in an automatic rocking incubator (Brinsea) until use at specific developmental stages between embryonic day 6 (E6) and E16.

For each of these selected z-planes, a 100 μm × 100 μm ROI was chosen containing intact tissue in which all HCs were optimally orientated for analysis. Mean fluorescence intensity of the tissue was measured for HCs and SCs from within defined 100 μm × 100 μm ROIs at E7, E9, and E10 timepoints. At E14 and E16, HCs and SCs were manually segmented. At younger stages, when HCs and SCs were not easily identified, fluorescence intensity was measured from within the whole epithelium. HC labels were dilated by 3 μm, which provided selections which included both HCs and their surrounding SCs. By subtracting the HC segmentation from the dilated label, we were thus able to measure the fluorescence intensity of whole HCs separately from their surrounding support cells in the 2-NBDG data. A similar approach was adopted when measuring TMRM fluorescence intensity at E14 and E16. However, we noticed that signal was concentrated around the HC periphery. To ensure that the fluorescence intensity best reflected only the mitochondria and was not reduced by the low fluorescence from the centre of each HC, we measured mean fluorescence intensity only up to 2 μm from the cell membrane. Likewise, for TMRM data at E7 and E9, mitochondria were segmented using Fiji’s auto-local thresholding (Niblack) prior to intensity measurements, to avoid a biased estimate of fluorescence intensity due to empty space surrounding each mitochondrion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of HC morphology</title><p>Data were analysed offline using ImageJ software.

Strategies employed to inhibit cellular metabolism in this study could have many secondary effects that may not be related to the establishment of tonotopy. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the reported NADPH/NADH gradient in the developing BP and whether this gradient was truly affected by the experimental manipulations remain unclear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript investigated the distribution of several metabolic indicators during basilar papilla (BP) development, which included the use of FLIM and live imaging of mitochondria. The authors showed a decreasing NADPH:NADH ratio from the proximal to basal region of the BP and provided evidence this differential ratio underlies the tonotopic organization of the organ. When glycolysis or more specifically the pentose phosphate pathway was blocked in vitro (presumably resulting in the reduction of NADPH production and NADPH:NADH ratio), hair cells in the proximal region of the BP adapted distal hair cell morphologies. Bmp7 expression, which is normally low, and Chordin expression, which is normally high in the proximal region of the developing papilla were concomitantly decreased when glycolysis was inhibited with 2-DOG treatments. Since metabolism could affect many cellular pathways, it is important to discern the specificity of blocking glycolysis in affecting tonotopy. First, is NADPH:NADH ratio indeed disrupted with 2-DOG treatments? Was FLIM conducted on specimens treated with 2-DOG? Could NADPH:NADH ratio be raised in the distal region and results in proximal hair cell morphologies? Tonotopy is a graded phenomenon along the cochlear duct but the proximal and apical regions of the BP but not the middle region were primarily compared in the study. The upregulation of Bmp7 and the downregulation of Chordin as a result of 2-DOG treatment did not seem graded but the control samples also did not show a clear gradient of expression of these genes. This could be confounded by the culture conditions as the graded expression pattern of Bmp7 and chordin in the normal BP published previously are clear. Therefore, cellular analyses of the middle region of the BP will help to substantiate the hypothesis.</p><p>More specific comments are listed as follows:</p><p>1) Lines 109-112. It is a bit puzzling that the proximal-distal gradient of NADPH/NADH ratio (tbound), which was proposed to be important for establishing the tonotopic gradient, was only observed at E6 and E14 but not at E9. What could be the explanation?</p><p>2) In Figure 5, blocking glycolysis resulted in hair cells of the proximal region adapting morphology of distal hair cells is an interesting result. However, is the proximal hair cell phenotype indeed caused by the disruption of tonotopy, or the distal hair cell pattern is the default and further differentiation into proximal hair cell morphologies require more glycolysis/NADPH? There seems to be a concomitant increase in hair cell number in the proximal region after 2-DOG treatment, which suggests other cellular events could be occurring and account for the hair cell morphological phenotype.</p><p>3) There is a lot of speculation without clear referencing on the role of developmental changes that were not found to show a gradient along the P-D axis e.g. Idh3a expression pattern going from apex to base gradient at E14 but switch to base to apex at E16, and LDHA expression switched between hair cells and supporting cells. It's a bit distracting and confusing to the main story.</p><p>4) In Figure 6, blocking the pentose phosphate pathway with 6-AN seems to affect the luminal size of distal HCs as well when compared to controls. In the distal region, there seems to be an increase in the density of the HCs. Thus, results in Figure 8 suppl 1 showing the lack of change in EdU uptake in the presence of 2-DOG is important to address this concern as well as to comments listed in #3. However, the images shown in Figure 8 suppl 1 were not convincing and seem to show there was an increase in proliferation in the proximal region of the treated samples when compared to control. Results in the distal region seemed variable. Providing quantification of these results would help to strengthen the conclusion that proliferation was not involved.</p><p>5) The lack of gradient differences in the mouse data, though interesting on its own, does not add to the manuscript.</p><p>Clarifications to improve the manuscript are listed as follows:</p><p>1.

I don't think there is enough existing evidence to state that cell cycle exit in the BP progresses from distal to proximal regions. The data from Corwin's lab (cited reference) suggest a neural to the abneural spread of cell cycle exit, unlike their counterpart in the mouse inner ear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study investigated whether a proximal-to-distal gradient of glucose metabolism exists in the developing basilar papilla (BP) and whether the metabolic gradient plays a role in instructing the positional identity of auditory hair cells along the tonotopic axis. Several assays were applied to address the presence of metabolic gradient, including NAD(P)H FLIM, re-analysis of RNA-seq and microarray datasets, IDH3A immunofluorescence, and 2-NBDG/TMRM fluorescence. Using FLIM was an excellent choice as this method provides a spatial relationship between the metabolic state and tonotopic features of hair cells along the developing BP. To address the involvement of glucose metabolism in tonotopic patterning, several pharmacological interventions were applied to inhibit specific metabolic pathways, which revealed that cytosolic glycose metabolism, but not mitochondrial metabolism plays a role in tonotopic patterning. Furthermore, the signaling gradients known to direct tonotopic patterning are disrupted by inhibition of glucose metabolism. This study links morphogen gradients with metabolic states along the developing auditory organ, providing novel insights into how tonotopy patterning is regulated. However, several experimental results were inconsistent with each other in supporting the hypothesis that the NADPH/NADH gradient and glycolysis are directly involved in establishing the tonotopy in the BP. Furthermore, the mere measurement of the surface area of hair cells is not a sufficient criterion to determine tonotopy. Other features such as hair bundle height and the number of stereocilia per hair cell should be included.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) One of the major limitations of this study is that only one feature, the surface area, was used to investigate the tonotopy. Several tonotopic features of hair cell morphology have been reported, including hair cell surface area (used in this study), hair bundle height, stereocilia number, and hair cell length. It was shown that hair cell surface area is not much different between proximal and distal regions in the early stage, and as BP matures, the tonotopic differences in the surface area become obvious because the surface area in the proximal region is increased to a greater extent than the distal region (Tilney et al., 1986, Dev Biol). Thus, the smaller surface area in the proximal region of BPs treated with 2-DOG, SAM, or 6-AN compared to controls may be due to defective developmental progression induced by abnormal glucose metabolism. Therefore, tonotopic changes in hair morphology should be confirmed by analyzing other tonotopic features.</p><p>2) The author argued for an expression gradient of NADPH/NADH regulators along the tonotopic axis based on previously generated RNA-seq and microarray datasets (Nat Comm, 2014). However, while LDHA mRNA levels are ~4-fold higher in the distal region than in the proximal region in the E6.5 RNA-seq data (Figure 3B), LDHA fluorescent intensity does not differ significantly between the proximal and distal regions at E7 (Figure 4 Supplement 2B). Therefore, it is essential to validate the expression gradients of selected genes from RNA-seq and microarray datasets using more reliable quantitative methods such as qRT-PCR or Western blot.</p><p>3) Based on the 2-NBDG and TMRM fluorescence results (Figure 4), the authors concluded that the gradient of NADPH/NADH originates specifically from tonotopic differences in cytosolic metabolism (line 392). However, there is a temporal gap between the two gradients. Tonotopic differences in NADPH/NADH are already significant at E6 (Figure 1), whereas the tonotopic difference in cytosolic glucose uptake is not significant until E14 (Figure 4). This temporal discrepancy makes it difficult to conclude that NADPH/NADH gradient (E6) originates from the glucose uptake gradient (E14). Similarly, it is difficult to link a causal relationship of tonotopic differences between surface area and glucose uptake because while glucose uptake is not significantly different until E14 (Figure 4), the surface area can be changed by blocking glycolysis at E6-E8 (Figure 5). To argue that metabolic gradients play a role in tonotopic patterning, the tonotopic gradient of NADPH/NADH, its regulators, and glucose uptake should be clearly correlated spatially as well as temporally in the developing BP.</p><p>4) Changes in Bmp7 and Chdl1 gradients by 2-DOG treatment (Figure 8) provide a molecular mechanism by which glucose metabolism regulates the tonotopic patterning of BP. However, 2-DOG has been shown to influence several cellular processes other than glycolysis, such as angiogenesis and autophagy. Therefore, it is crucial to confirm that the changes in Bmp7 and Chdl1 gradients by 2-DOG are due to inhibition of glucose metabolism but not due to other cellular effects. This will be confirmed if SAM and 6-AN, but not YZ9 and UK5099, which induced surface area changes similar to 2-DOG, also cause similar changes in Bmp7 and Chdl1 gradients.</p><p>1) Specify the model system in the abstract since birds and mammals appear to have different mechanisms for tonotopic patterning.</p><p>2) Figure 1I., τbound values were consistently higher in the proximal than distal regions from E6 to E16, although statistical analysis indicates significant differences at E6 and E14 but not at E9 and E16. Non-significance at E9 and E16 may be due to the small number of n, which made statistical power not strong enough to draw statistical significance. To give the readers a better idea of how variable τbound values are during development, it is recommended that the graphs on the left are presented as a boxplot with individual data points. Also, provide error bars and statistical analysis for the graphs on the right.</p><p>3) Figure 2C and D. Similar to the point above, it is recommended to present the graphs as a box plot with individual data points. Does &quot;n = 10 biological replicates&quot; mean 10 different BP samples? If so, indicate how many hair cells and supporting cells per BP sample were used to calculate τbound values?</p><p>4) Line 323. There are several instances where the authors refer to &quot;other systems&quot;. It will be better to specify the system the authors refer to so that the readers get an idea of how the &quot;other systems&quot; are related to the auditory system. e.g., &quot;studies in other systems&quot; in lines 458, 505, and 685.</p><p>5) Figure 8.

It is difficult to conclude based on the images whether 2-DOG treatment affects proliferation in the developing BP.

The results from the mouse organ of Corti are interesting but do not appear to be relevant to the rest of the manuscript, since differences in τbound values were compared only between HCs and SCs, but not along the tonotopic axis. It is recommended to either present the τbound values between the proximal and distal regions of the organ of Corti or save them for further study.</p><p>8) Line 853. While the Shh gradient is present along the auditory organ in both birds and mammals, the Bmp7 gradient is present only in birds but not in mammals (Son et al., 2014, PNAS).</p><p>9) It is clear that inhibition of glucose metabolism by 2-DOG, SAM, and 6-AN induces the proximal BPs to become more like distal BPs, such as decreased surface area and increased Bmp7 expression in the proximal region. Is it possible to conduct the opposite experiment, i.e., activation of glucose metabolism, which may cause distal BP to become like proximal BP?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Blacker et al. examine cellular metabolism primarily in the chick auditory organ, the basilar papilla (BP). They use FLIM to visualize NAD(P)H in live tissue to study changes in glucose metabolism within the auditory epithelium over the course of development. They show that there are differences in metabolism between HCs and SCs. They also show that there are spatial differences in metabolism along the length of the BP at specific developmental time points. The authors bolster evidence for this metabolic gradient using existing RNAseq datasets that show differential expression of metabolic genes along the proximal-to-distal axis of the BP. They then use pharmacology to manipulate glucose metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and the TCA cycle). The authors show that altering glucose metabolism early in glycolysis or at the level of the pentose phosphate pathway results in a loss of tonotopy in the BP. In contrast, inhibiting glucose metabolism at the level of the TCA cycle impaired HC differentiation. Further, they show that inhibiting glycolysis alters morphogen gradients that are required for the emergence of tonotopy within the developing BP. Overall this work suggests that specific metabolic pathways may drive developmental changes in morphogen gradients and – perhaps – contribute to HC differentiation. This is an exciting advance for the hearing field, especially with respect to potential regenerative therapies.</p><p>Strengths of the paper:</p><p>1. The use of FLIM to study NAD(P)H fluorescence in living HCs and SCs across the auditory epithelium during the course of development.</p><p>2. The powerful use of pharmacology to probe the role of glucose metabolism in tonotopy in long-term cultures of BP explants.</p><p>3. Using multiple approaches for the study: live NAD(P)H imaging, RNAseq data, pharmacology, vital dyes, and immunohistochemistry.</p><p>4. Linking distinct metabolic pathways to developmental events is a novel and exciting area of research.</p><p>Weaknesses of paper:</p><p>1. The majority of the manuscript uses t-tests for comparisons. In many cases, a 2-way ANOVA is needed for comparisons. It is not clear that all the findings will hold up to more rigorous statistical analysis.</p><p>2. Substantial work is needed to enhance the clarity of the manuscript. There is a limited introduction to the different facets of glucose metabolism highlighted in this paper. Metabolism is a complex topic that a broad audience will not be intimately familiar with. In addition, the paper is rich with data. The authors discuss differences in metabolism along 3 variables (space, time, and cell type). Occasionally it is unclear what type of difference is being discussed and the trend of the difference.</p><p>3. Manipulations inhibiting glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation over extended periods of time could have many secondary effects on development related to a lack of energy supply.</p><p>Overall, this is a very interesting line of research. Currently, the manuscript needs revision prior to publication.</p><p>1. Statistics. The majority of the manuscript uses t-tests, which are not appropriate when making multiple comparisons (ie: proximal vs. distal over multiple stages of development). Currently, it is not clear that all the findings will hold up to more rigorous statistical analysis. For example, Figure 1I, 1J, 2C, 2D, 4D, 4F, 4G, 4I, 4J, all of Figure 4 Supp. 1, Figure 4 Supp. 2B, 5C, Figure 5 Supp. 1C, 6D, Figure 6 Supp. 1B, 7C, 8B, 8C, 9E, and 9F should be analyzed using two-way ANOVA. It is not statistically sound to pick only specific comparisons to make.</p><p>Additionally, in some cases, there are stars above bars with no indication of what condition is being compared to (ie. Figure 9E). Figure 3A lacks statistical analysis altogether. Finally, there are several cases where the authors say that there is a &quot;significant&quot; difference but do not show that it is statistically significant (for example, the caption of Figure 4I says there is a significant decrease between E9 and E14, but there is no indication of statistical significance in the figure). Differences that are not statistically significant can be discussed as trends, but should not be called significant. Similarly, differences that are statistically significant should not be discussed as &quot;no difference&quot; (ex. Figure 4E/F caption but Figure 4F shows a statistically significant difference; Figure 4 Supp. 2).</p><p>2. Enhance the clarity of the manuscript. The manuscript is quite well written but currently, there is limited text in the introduction outlining the relevant parts of glucose metabolism highlighted in this paper. Or how NADPH and NADH feed into these pathways. In addition, the authors discuss differences in metabolism along 3 variables (space, time, and cell type), and occasionally it is not clear what type of difference is being discussed – what is increased or decreased and where. Schematics like those in 2E are helpful to the reader.</p><p>3. Manipulations inhibiting glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation over extended periods of time could have many secondary effects on development. The authors should lighten claims of causation. At a minimum, there should be a discussion of possible secondary effects and the need for more targeted manipulations to draw a convincing causative link between cellular metabolism and the development of tonotopy within the BP.</p><p>4. The authors detect a proximal-to-distal gradient in tbound at E6 that &quot;was still present at E14&quot; and discuss this as a gradient &quot;along the tonotopic axis between E6 and E14&quot;. However, their figure does not show a significant difference between the proximal and distal regions at E9. This could be related to a lack of statistical power (the n is lower for E9), but could alternatively represent a real fluctuation in the metabolic state over time. The authors should include a discussion of their E9 data, rather than glossing over it.</p><p>5. Although it may be beyond the scope of this paper, it would be nice to come full circle back to NAD(P)H imaging. Do the alteration to the PPP pathway lead to a loss of the NADPH/NADH gradient along the proximal-distal axis in the developing BP?</p><p>6. The authors make several claims regarding differences in TMRM. They should also consider that this cationic vital dye may enter HCs via mechanotransduction channels. This form of entry may explain why labeling is stronger in older HCs compared to SCs or younger HCs.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Crosstalk between glucose metabolism and Bmp7-Chordin-like 1 signalling specifies tonotopic identity in developing hair cells.&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors provided additional results showing that Chordin like-1, which is normally expressed in the proximal region of the BP could rescue the distalizing effect of 2-DOG in the proximal region, thus strengthening the link between metabolism and tonotopy. However, in this type of rescue experiment, 2-DOG and Chordin like-1 (Chdl-1) treatments should be included as controls within the same experiment, rather than using controls with no treatment alone. While readers could extrapolate 2-DOG effects from other figures, there was no description of Chdl-1 in dosage, condition, or results in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, the statement in lines 800-802 and results in Supplementary Table 1 seem to suggest that Chdl-1 treatment alone does not affect the tonotopic gradient by itself. Is that true?

However, the graph in (B) shows that the luminal area of hair cells was dramatically reduced in the proximal but not in the distal region by YZ9 treatment, resulting in no significant difference between the proximal and distal regions. This suggests a loss of tonotopic identity of HC morphology by YZ9 treatment, similar to 2-DOG, SAM, or 6-AN. To support the authors' argument, it is important to confirm that YZ9 treatment did not induce tonotopic changes in HC morphology. Double-checking with other tonotopic parameters, such as HC nuclear area and cell number, will help to clarify this issue.</p><p>Figure 9.</p><p>(E) The Bmp7 expression domain in the control explant is peculiar in that it has a lining around the distal region, unlike the control image in Figure 9 supplement 1.

This question was crucial to support the authors' conclusion, as 2-DOG has been shown to affect several cellular processes other than glycolysis. The authors showed that blocking mitochondrial metabolism did not alter the Bmp7 gradient, but this doesn't solve the problem of the specificity of 2-DOG. It is worth investigating whether SAM and 6-AN, which induce luminal area changes similar to 2-DOG, also disrupt the same molecular pathways, such as the Bmp7 and Chld1 gradients.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript is substantially improved compared to the previous version. Thank you for all the hard work you put into responding to reviewer concerns. A revised manuscript would be welcomed by this reviewer.</p><p>– The RNAseq and microarray analyses are good for hypothesis generation, but the differential expression the authors detect often does not match the immunohistochemistry and RNA scope data they provide. It is especially confusing to say that there is no difference in LDHA and IDH3A protein expression across the BP, then suggest that differential RNA expression of these genes could drive the metabolic gradient the authors observe. Some of the variability in the data may be related to differences in animal age across experiments, but this variability makes it a bit challenging to interpret the data. In addition, not all the genes listed in Figure 3 Supp. 4A seems to reach statistical significance. The authors should consider framing Figure 3 Supp. 4A as a way to generate hypotheses that they then test with additional experiments, rather than claiming that they identified a whole set of differentially expressed genes when in fact they present contradictory data within the same manuscript. They should also clarify how they decided which metabolic RNAs to examine further.</p><p>– Although the authors used BMP7 as a positive control for RNA scope, there does not appear to be a proximal-to-distal difference in BMP7 fluorescence. In addition, the authors do not provide any negative controls to show a lack of fluorescence in the absence of gene-specific RNA scope probes. Without successful controls, the experimental data is hard to interpret. The authors should consider providing better controls.</p><p>– Line 297-298: &quot;By controlling a metabolic feedback loop that regulates the switch between glycolysis and OXPHOS…&quot; The authors previously showed data suggesting that differences in the NAD(P)H/NADH ratio are not due to changes in mitochondrial OXPHOS. Here, though, they suggest that PKM2 controls the amount of OXPHOS and is differentially expressed across the BP. How can we reconcile these two points?</p><p>– Figure 4, 5: How was the quantification in 4B-D and 5B performed? Are fluorescence values provided per HC/per SC? As HC size varies across the proximal-distal axis of the BP, it is not fair to quantify raw total fluorescence. The fluorescence should be normalized by the area occupied by each cell type.</p><p>– Figure 5: Could proximal-to-distal differences in pHrodo Red fluorescence result from the gradient of HC differentiation (i.e. more mature distal HCs, less mature proximal HCs) across the tonotopic axis at E9? In other words, do young HCs have a higher pHi that decreases as hair cells mature? This could explain the proximal-to-distal differences shown in Figure 5.</p><p>– Figure 6 Supp. 2 – To claim that there is no increased proliferation in response to 2-DOG, EdU+ cells should be quantified in control vs. 2-DOG cultures. It seems that the authors have only provided general cell counts (in C) and not EdU+ cell counts.</p><p>– Do the authors have any evidence that the various drug treatments are not simply blocking cell growth and differentiation? As mentioned by another reviewer, the distal-like phenotype could be a &quot;default&quot;; perhaps proximal HCs simply aren't maturing. It would be nice to show examples of cultures at 1DIV vs. 7 DIV to demonstrate how much cells grow during this time and how treated cultures at 7 DIV compare to immature 1 DIV cultures. (SAM treatment especially looks like it might impact hair bundle morphology in the proximal BP.)</p><p>– Figures 7 Supp. 2 and Figure 8 continue to rely on a single morphological measure of HC morphology as a readout of tonotopy. The authors should add additional quantification (cell density, nuclear area…), as has been provided for other manipulations.</p><p>– Figure 9 and Figure 9 Supp. 1: In the absence of quantification of the in situ hybridization data, please state how many examples show similar Bmp7 and Chdl1 gradients.</p><p>– To bolster the claim that 2-DOG treatment is specifically disrupting tonotopy and not just the differentiation of proximal HCs (as pointed out by Reviewer 1), the authors should quantify HC density in Figure 10. If HC density is also restored by providing Chdl-1 in the presence of 2-DOG, it will bolster the hypothesis that altered glucose metabolism has a specific effect on HC positional identity.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Crosstalk between glucose metabolism and morphogen signalling specifies tonotopic identity in developing hair cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Strategies employed to inhibit cellular metabolism in this study could have many secondary effects that may not be related to the establishment of tonotopy. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the reported NADPH/NADH gradient in the developing BP and whether this gradient was truly affected by the experimental manipulations remain unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>In attempt to further characterise a role for metabolism in tonotopic patterning, we have included additional experiments showing a rescue of tonotopic patterning when explants are treated with medium containing both 2-DOG and Chordin like-1. We believe the observed effects when treating with 2-DOG and Chordin like-1 together (new data Figure 10) support a role for metabolism specifying tonotopy in the developing BP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript investigated the distribution of several metabolic indicators during basilar papilla (BP) development, which included the use of FLIM and live imaging of mitochondria. The authors showed a decreasing NADPH:NADH ratio from the proximal to basal region of the BP and provided evidence this differential ratio underlies the tonotopic organization of the organ. When glycolysis or more specifically the pentose phosphate pathway was blocked in vitro (presumably resulting in the reduction of NADPH production and NADPH:NADH ratio), hair cells in the proximal region of the BP adapted distal hair cell morphologies. Bmp7 expression, which is normally low, and Chordin expression, which is normally high in the proximal region of the developing papilla were concomitantly decreased when glycolysis was inhibited with 2-DOG treatments. Since metabolism could affect many cellular pathways, it is important to discern the specificity of blocking glycolysis in affecting tonotopy.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we have used multiple inhibitors that target different branches of glucose flux. The same phenotype was produced in response to all inhibitors except YZ9. From a comparison of the statistical results between all inhibitor experiments (Supplementary table 1), we believe that the observed changes in cell morphology are a result of dysregulated metabolism rather than off-target effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First, is NADPH:NADH ratio indeed disrupted with 2-DOG treatments? Was FLIM conducted on specimens treated with 2-DOG?</p></disp-quote><p>For FLIM measurements, treated explants need to be transferred from culture dishes to FLIM imaging dishes. This causes additional mechanical and osmotic stress, which may impact metabolism and introduce variation to NAD(P)H FLIM measurements. In addition, there are gross morphological changes during long-term culture, and given that fluorescent markers cannot be used in combination with FLIM it is not feasible to identify proximal and distal ends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could NADPH:NADH ratio be raised in the distal region and results in proximal hair cell morphologies?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an excellent point, and whilst this would be a valuable experiment, we believe it is beyond the scope of the current study. There are no pharmacological agents available to specifically target the NADPH/NADH ratio in vitro. This could potentially be done using an in ovo electroporation approach to knock out NAD kinase in different regions of the BP. However, as it is not possible to control the region-specific uptake of constructs during in ovo electroporation, it would not be possible to target NADPH/NADH pools in proximal and distal BP regions specifically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Tonotopy is a graded phenomenon along the cochlear duct but the proximal and apical regions of the BP but not the middle region were primarily compared in the study. The upregulation of Bmp7 and the downregulation of Chordin as a result of 2-DOG treatment did not seem graded but the control samples also did not show a clear gradient of expression of these genes. This could be confounded by the culture conditions as the graded expression pattern of Bmp7 and chordin in the normal BP published previously are clear. Therefore, cellular analyses of the middle region of the BP will help to substantiate the hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>New images from repeated in situs have been added for clarity in Figure 9 were re-ran to more clearly show the change in gradient following treatment.

It is a bit puzzling that the proximal-distal gradient of NADPH/NADH ratio (tbound), which was proposed to be important for establishing the tonotopic gradient, was only observed at E6 and E14 but not at E9. What could be the explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>Additional n numbers have been added to this data set, and all data have been re-analysed for statistical significance using 2-way ANOVA testing. Following new analysis, the gradient in tbound (NADPH/NADH) is significant at E6, E9 and E14 (see revised Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 5, blocking glycolysis resulted in hair cells of the proximal region adapting morphology of distal hair cells is an interesting result. However, is the proximal hair cell phenotype indeed caused by the disruption of tonotopy, or the distal hair cell pattern is the default and further differentiation into proximal hair cell morphologies require more glycolysis/NADPH?</p></disp-quote><p>This is interesting point! The distal pattern may indeed be the default. It may also be the altered PPP metabolism interferes with normal cell cycle progression and differentiation. Cell cycle exit and cell size, growth are tightly coupled with metabolism, in particular PPP metabolism and pH (see new data added in Figure 4). Altering these gradients along the BP during development with 2-DOG, 6AN or SAM may therefore interfere with the normal patterning in cell size and number. We have included this argument as a key point in the discussion (Line 813).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There seems to be a concomitant increase in hair cell number in the proximal region after 2-DOG treatment, which suggests other cellular events could be occurring and account for the hair cell morphological phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-done the EdU experiments and quantified cell density in the proximal and distal regions in control and treated explants. Overall blocking glycolysis consistently reduces EdU staining. Cultures were set up at E8 and maintained in culture for 48h covering the active phase of mitotic cell division. The increase in cell density in the proximal but not distal region is consistent to what we saw with Bmp7 and based on new data (Figure 6 Supplement 2), does not seem to be driven by an increase in proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is a lot of speculation without clear referencing on the role of developmental changes that were not found to show a gradient along the P-D axis e.g. Idh3a expression pattern going from apex to base gradient at E14 but switch to base to apex at E16, and LDHA expression switched between hair cells and supporting cells. It's a bit distracting and confusing to the main story.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and fully agree that the previous way in which the data were presented was unclear.

Thus, results in Figure 8 suppl 1 showing the lack of change in EdU uptake in the presence of 2-DOG is important to address this concern as well as to comments listed in #3. However, the images shown in Figure 8 suppl 1 were not convincing and seem to show there was an increase in proliferation in the proximal region of the treated samples when compared to control.

Several assays were applied to address the presence of metabolic gradient, including NAD(P)H FLIM, re-analysis of RNA-seq and microarray datasets, IDH3A immunofluorescence, and 2-NBDG/TMRM fluorescence. Using FLIM was an excellent choice as this method provides a spatial relationship between the metabolic state and tonotopic features of hair cells along the developing BP. To address the involvement of glucose metabolism in tonotopic patterning, several pharmacological interventions were applied to inhibit specific metabolic pathways, which revealed that cytosolic glycose metabolism, but not mitochondrial metabolism plays a role in tonotopic patterning. Furthermore, the signaling gradients known to direct tonotopic patterning are disrupted by inhibition of glucose metabolism. This study links morphogen gradients with metabolic states along the developing auditory organ, providing novel insights into how tonotopy patterning is regulated. However, several experimental results were inconsistent with each other in supporting the hypothesis that the NADPH/NADH gradient and glycolysis are directly involved in establishing the tonotopy in the BP. Furthermore, the mere measurement of the surface area of hair cells is not a sufficient criterion to determine tonotopy. Other features such as hair bundle height and the number of stereocilia per hair cell should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>It is very challenging to quantify bundle morphology accurately in long-term explants (cultured for more than 7 days). We believe accurate bundle measurements would need to be done using an in ovo electroporation model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) One of the major limitations of this study is that only one feature, the surface area, was used to investigate the tonotopy. Several tonotopic features of hair cell morphology have been reported, including hair cell surface area (used in this study), hair bundle height, stereocilia number, and hair cell length. It was shown that hair cell surface area is not much different between proximal and distal regions in the early stage, and as BP matures, the tonotopic differences in the surface area become obvious because the surface area in the proximal region is increased to a greater extent than the distal region (Tilney et al., 1986, Dev Biol). Thus, the smaller surface area in the proximal region of BPs treated with 2-DOG, SAM, or 6-AN compared to controls may be due to defective developmental progression induced by abnormal glucose metabolism. Therefore, tonotopic changes in hair morphology should be confirmed by analyzing other tonotopic features.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional analysis of HC nuclear area and cell density in proximal and distal regions have been included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The author argued for an expression gradient of NADPH/NADH regulators along the tonotopic axis based on previously generated RNA-seq and microarray datasets (Nat Comm, 2014). However, while LDHA mRNA levels are ~4-fold higher in the distal region than in the proximal region in the E6.5 RNA-seq data (Figure 3B), LDHA fluorescent intensity does not differ significantly between the proximal and distal regions at E7 (Figure 4 Supplement 2B). Therefore, it is essential to validate the expression gradients of selected genes from RNA-seq and microarray datasets using more reliable quantitative methods such as qRT-PCR or Western blot.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. For this specific study, we chose to use RNA-scope or immunohistochemistry to look at expression of metabolic enzymes along the BP as these techniques preserve the spatial resolution needed to look at metabolism on a cell-by-cell basis. Using western blot and qPCR analysis, whilst informative, would not maintain the spatial and single cell resolution within the tissue. A further caveat is that metabolic reprograming is challenging to detect at the transcriptional level, as it is regulated at the protein level.</p><p>We have included additional analysis for GOT2, LDHB and PKM2 (see Figure 3 Supplement 4 and Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Based on the 2-NBDG and TMRM fluorescence results (Figure 4), the authors concluded that the gradient of NADPH/NADH originates specifically from tonotopic differences in cytosolic metabolism (line 392). However, there is a temporal gap between the two gradients. Tonotopic differences in NADPH/NADH are already significant at E6 (Figure 1), whereas the tonotopic difference in cytosolic glucose uptake is not significant until E14 (Figure 4). This temporal discrepancy makes it difficult to conclude that NADPH/NADH gradient (E6) originates from the glucose uptake gradient (E14). Similarly, it is difficult to link a causal relationship of tonotopic differences between surface area and glucose uptake because while glucose uptake is not significantly different until E14 (Figure 4), the surface area can be changed by blocking glycolysis at E6-E8 (Figure 5). To argue that metabolic gradients play a role in tonotopic patterning, the tonotopic gradient of NADPH/NADH, its regulators, and glucose uptake should be clearly correlated spatially as well as temporally in the developing BP.</p></disp-quote><p>The temporal gradients will not necessarily match as they report different steps of the glucose catabolism pathway. 2NBDG reports uptake of glucose into the cell via GLUT transporters. NADPH/NADH reports differences in the path of glucose catabolism once it has been phosphorylated by HK. Because 2-NBDG cannot by phosphorylated or metabolised by HK, it does not reflect the different paths by which glucose is metabolised. We hope this clarifies the reviewer’s concern and have re-written this in the Results section: see section beginning Line193 – “Live imaging of mitochondrial metabolism and glucose uptake along the tonotopic axis of the developing BP…”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>…it difficult to conclude that NADPH/NADH gradient (E6) originates from the glucose uptake gradient…</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this question and have made attempts to clarify this in the text. The gradient in NADPH reported by tbound is not a reflection of glucose uptake but of glucose flux into the PPP or NADPH production in mitochondria. We also acknowledge that tbound can of course report a mixture of these two metabolic processes. We have now included a schematic (see Figure 1) illustrating the different metabolic branches and pathways of glucose catabolism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Changes in Bmp7 and Chdl1 gradients by 2-DOG treatment (Figure 8) provide a molecular mechanism by which glucose metabolism regulates the tonotopic patterning of BP. However, 2-DOG has been shown to influence several cellular processes other than glycolysis, such as angiogenesis and autophagy. Therefore, it is crucial to confirm that the changes in Bmp7 and Chdl1 gradients by 2-DOG are due to inhibition of glucose metabolism but not due to other cellular effects.</p></disp-quote><p>In attempt to address this issue we chose to use a combination of different inhibitors. As inhibitors of glycolysis (2-DOG, SAM) and of the PPP (6-AN) elicited the same reduction in luminal SA and nuclear area, we conclude that it unlikely for all inhibitors to elicit the same off target effects on cell morphology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This will be confirmed if SAM and 6-AN, but not YZ9 and UK5099, which induced surface area changes similar to 2-DOG, also cause similar changes in Bmp7 and Chdl1 gradients.</p></disp-quote><p>In situ for Bmp7 following UK5099 treatment has been included.

They use FLIM to visualize NAD(P)H in live tissue to study changes in glucose metabolism within the auditory epithelium over the course of development. They show that there are differences in metabolism between HCs and SCs. They also show that there are spatial differences in metabolism along the length of the BP at specific developmental time points. The authors bolster evidence for this metabolic gradient using existing RNAseq datasets that show differential expression of metabolic genes along the proximal-to-distal axis of the BP. They then use pharmacology to manipulate glucose metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and the TCA cycle). The authors show that altering glucose metabolism early in glycolysis or at the level of the pentose phosphate pathway results in a loss of tonotopy in the BP. In contrast, inhibiting glucose metabolism at the level of the TCA cycle impaired HC differentiation. Further, they show that inhibiting glycolysis alters morphogen gradients that are required for the emergence of tonotopy within the developing BP. Overall this work suggests that specific metabolic pathways may drive developmental changes in morphogen gradients and – perhaps – contribute to HC differentiation. This is an exciting advance for the hearing field, especially with respect to potential regenerative therapies.</p><p>Strengths of the paper:</p><p>1.

The majority of the manuscript uses t-tests, which are not appropriate when making multiple comparisons (ie: proximal vs. distal over multiple stages of development). Currently, it is not clear that all the findings will hold up to more rigorous statistical analysis.

Figure 9E). Figure 3A lacks statistical analysis altogether. Finally, there are several cases where the authors say that there is a &quot;significant&quot; difference but do not show that it is statistically significant (for example, the caption of Figure 4I says there is a significant decrease between E9 and E14, but there is no indication of statistical significance in the figure). Differences that are not statistically significant can be discussed as trends, but should not be called significant.

However, the graph in (B) shows that the luminal area of hair cells was dramatically reduced in the proximal but not in the distal region by YZ9 treatment, resulting in no significant difference between the proximal and distal regions. This suggests a loss of tonotopic identity of HC morphology by YZ9 treatment, similar to 2-DOG, SAM, or 6-AN. To support the authors' argument, it is important to confirm that YZ9 treatment did not induce tonotopic changes in HC morphology. Double-checking with other tonotopic parameters, such as HC nuclear area and cell number, will help to clarify this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and recommendations to clarify this issue.

Understanding the precise mechanism linking cell shape with physiological function along the developing BP requires further investigation, which we feel is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 9 supplement 1.</p><p>The previous review questioned whether the changes in tonotopic identity caused by 2-DOG were due to the inhibition of glucose metabolism rather than other cellular effects. This question was crucial to support the authors' conclusion, as 2-DOG has been shown to affect several cellular processes other than glycolysis. The authors showed that blocking mitochondrial metabolism did not alter the Bmp7 gradient, but this doesn't solve the problem of the specificity of 2-DOG.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that when using pharmacological inhibitors there are likely to be offtarget effects.

Thank you for all the hard work you put into responding to reviewer concerns. A revised manuscript would be welcomed by this reviewer.</p><p>– The RNAseq and microarray analyses are good for hypothesis generation, but the differential expression the authors detect often does not match the immunohistochemistry and RNA scope data they provide. It is especially confusing to say that there is no difference in LDHA and IDH3A protein expression across the BP, then suggest that differential RNA expression of these genes could drive the metabolic gradient the authors observe.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree fully with the reviewer that the original data included in Figure 4 did not fit logically with the proposed hypotheses of the study. We have since removed these data, as the focus of the study is about differences in cytosolic glucose flux along the organ and not metabolic switching. We have included a new schematic (Figure 2 Supplement 1) to highlight to metabolic differences reported by FLIM analysis. As IDH3A and LDHA regulate switching between OXPHOs and glycolysis, we have revised the current version of the manuscript accordingly and focused more on the role and expression of PKM2, an enzyme that regulates both glucose flux into the PPP, and the NADPH/NADH ratio. We hope that this resolves the previous confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the variability in the data may be related to differences in animal age across experiments, but this variability makes it a bit challenging to interpret the data. In addition, not all the genes listed in Figure 3 Supp. 4A seems to reach statistical significance. The authors should consider framing Figure 3 Supp. 4A as a way to generate hypotheses that they then test with additional experiments, rather than claiming that they identified a whole set of differentially expressed genes when in fact they present contradictory data within the same manuscript. They should also clarify how they decided which metabolic RNAs to examine further.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer’s suggestion regarding the RNAseq and RNA scope data and have therefore conducted additional analysis and experiments investigating the role of the gate keeper enzyme PKM2 (Figure 4 Supplements 1-3, Figure 8, Figure 11 Supplement 1). PKM2 was chosen for further analysis, as it regulates glucose flux into the PPP or towards pyruvate and the NADPH/NADH ratio. This has also been clarified in the main text (see lines 157, 160 and 175).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Although the authors used BMP7 as a positive control for RNA scope, there does not appear to be a proximal-to-distal difference in BMP7 fluorescence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important observation.

Here, though, they suggest that PKM2 controls the amount of OXPHOS and is differentially expressed across the BP. How can we reconcile these two points?</p></disp-quote><p>In the current study, we propose that the dimeric form of PKM2, regulated by pH might control glucose flux into the PPP or towards pyruvate. Given the low pH, high NADPH/NADH ratio and expression of PKM2, our data suggest activity consistent with glucose flux into the PPP rather than pyruvate production. This would agree with the lack of a TMRM gradient and thus mitochondrial OXPHOS along the BP.</p><p>Please see the revised paragraph beginning line 188.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4, 5: How was the quantification in 4B-D and 5B performed? Are fluorescence values provided per HC/per SC? As HC size varies across the proximal-distal axis of the BP, it is not fair to quantify raw total fluorescence. The fluorescence should be normalized by the area occupied by each cell type.</p></disp-quote><p>IDH3A and LDHA immunofluorescence data are no longer included in the current version of the manuscript.

This could explain the proximal-to-distal differences shown in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional data investigating the pH gradient at E14 (see Figure 5 Supplement 3).</p><p>At later stages, as predicted by the reviewer, we do indeed find that the pH gradient is reversed.

As mentioned by another reviewer, the distal-like phenotype could be a &quot;default&quot;; perhaps proximal HCs simply aren't maturing. It would be nice to show examples of cultures at 1DIV vs. 7 DIV to demonstrate how much cells grow during this time and how treated cultures at 7 DIV compare to immature 1 DIV cultures.

We are confident that blocking mitochondrial OXPHOS causes developmental delay, but that perturbing glucose flux alters normal patterning.

From the diagrams in Figure 7-supplement 2B and Figure 8B, it appears that PFK and PKM2 act in the same glycolysis pathway. However, inhibition of either resulted in different phenotypes. While inhibition of PFK by YZ9 did not affect tonotopic patterning, inhibition of PKM2 by shikonin disrupted tonotopic patterning, albeit at the epithelial level. Why did two inhibitors of the same pathway have different effects on tonotopic patterning?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, and we thank the reviewer for drawing attention to it. The following explanation has been added to the main text for clarification – line 285. We would like to clarify that although YZ9 (Pfk) and shikonin (Pkm2) both inhibit parts of glycolysis, noting the two enzymes regulate different stages of the pathway with respect to glucose flux and the re-entry of PPP products. Inhibition of Pkm2 would cause build-up of both G3p and F6p, whereas inhibition of PFK would only lead to accumulation of F6P. From this it can be assumed that Pkm2 inhibition would have a greater impact on the activity of the PPP and therefore, given the gradient in NADPH, on tonotopic patterning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript is greatly improved and nearly ready for publication.</p><p>There are a few typos and points to clarify that I would recommend to the authors.

The clarity of the FLIM section is massively improved since the first version of the paper. The one link that is still hard to make is how the values of Tbound inform flux through the PPP vs. glycolysis. This figure beautifully illustrates exactly that. Also, consider adding PPP vs. glycolysis to the gradient in the Figure 2H schematic, and/or moving the sentence in line 109 to line 101 in the main text.
