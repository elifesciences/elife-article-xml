This role is specific to SerRS among all tRNA synthetases and is independent of its well-known aminoacylation function in protein synthesis. A unique nucleus-directing domain, added at the invertebrate-to-vertebrate transition, confers this novel non-translational activity of SerRS. Previous studies showed that SerRS, in some unknown way, controls VEGFA expression to prevent vascular over-expansion. Using in vitro, cell and animal experiments, we show here that SerRS intervenes by antagonizing c-Myc, the major transcription factor promoting VEGFA expression, through a tandem mechanism. First, by direct head-to-head competition, nuclear-localized SerRS blocks c-Myc from binding to the <italic>VEGFA</italic> promoter. Second, DNA-bound SerRS recruits the SIRT2 histone deacetylase to erase prior c-Myc-promoted histone acetylation. Thus, vertebrate SerRS and c-Myc is a pair of ‘Yin-Yang’ transcriptional regulator for proper development of a functional vasculature. Our results also discover an anti-angiogenic activity for SIRT2.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02349.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02349.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02349.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The network of blood vessels is one of the earliest structures to develop in a vertebrate embryo. A protein called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (or VEGFA for short) is needed to promote the growth of these blood vessels, but too much VEGFA can cause blood vessels to grow too much and to grow abnormally.</p><p>Like most of the DNA in the nucleus, the gene for VEGFA is tightly wrapped around proteins called histones and must be unwrapped before it can be expressed as a protein. For the <italic>VEGFA</italic> gene, this unwrapping process starts when a protein called c-Myc adds chemical tags to the histones.</p><p>Recent research suggested that an enzyme called seryl-tRNA synthetase (or SerRS for short) also controls the expression of VEGFA. This came as a surprise because no other tRNA synthetase has a similar role during development. And although SerRS is known to enter the cell nucleus in vertebrates, researchers did not know what SerRS did in the nucleus to control the expression of VEGFA.</p><p>Now, Shi et al. have discovered that SerRS controls blood vessel development in zebrafish embryos by counteracting the activity of c-Myc. It does this in two different ways: first, it directly blocks c-Myc from binding to and unpacking the DNA; and second, SerRS works with another enzyme to remove tags that are already on the histones. Shi et al. found that if the expression of this other enzyme (called SIRT2) was reduced in zebrafish, the fish expressed more VEGFA and their blood vessels grew too much.</p><p>Since blood vessel growth is important in the development of cancers, the findings of Shi et al. could also lead to a better understanding of how tumors develop, as well as how blood vessels develop normally.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02349.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02349.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>seryl-tRNA synthetase</kwd><kwd>c-Myc</kwd><kwd>VEGFA</kwd><kwd>SIRT2</kwd><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>vasculature</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>HHS | National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM088278, NS085092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Xiang-Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In addition to its cytoplasmic role for translation, the seryl-tRNA synthetase also antagonizes the c-Myc transcription factor in the nucleus to transcriptionally repress the growth factor VEGFA and ensure proper development of the vasculature in vertebrates.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In vertebrates from fish to humans, the vasculature is one of the most important and earliest networks to develop. Surprisingly, three independent forward genetics studies in zebrafish suggested an essential role for seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) in vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amsterdam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herzog et al., 2009</xref>). In fish embryos, disruption of <italic>sars</italic> (gene encoding SerRS), through insertional mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amsterdam et al., 2004</xref>) or ENU mutagenesis-induced point/truncation mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herzog et al., 2009</xref>), caused excessive and abnormal blood vessel growth.</p><p>As a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases family, SerRS is well-known for its essential function in aminoacylation of tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> for protein synthesis in the cytoplasm. However, the role of SerRS in vascular development is independent of its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukui et al., 2009</xref>), but dependent on its vertebrate-specific, non-catalytic, C-terminal domain UNE-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo and Schimmel, 2013</xref>). The UNE-S domain contains a robust nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence that, at least in human cells, directs a substantial amount of cellular SerRS into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo and Schimmel, 2013</xref>). Remarkably, all non-null mutations of <italic>sars</italic> linked to vasculature abnormalities in the aforementioned genetics studies either have the NLS truncated or conformationally sequestered, and thus render deficient SerRS nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, zebrafish expressing engineered catalytically active but NLS-mutated SerRS exhibited the same abnormal blood vessel phenotype as observed in the <italic>sars</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it has been clearly established that the essential role of SerRS in vascular development arises from its evolutionarily acquired nuclear presence.</p><p>Interestingly, the vascular abnormalities associated with deficient SerRS nuclear localization were found to be accompanied with a high level of <italic>vegfa</italic> (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A) transcript in the mutant fish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). This observation suggested that the nuclear function of SerRS in zebrafish is linked to attenuating the expression of Vegfa. However, the mechanism of the SerRS function has remained obscure. Because VEGFA is a key stimulator of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis for all vertebrates, and over-expression of VEGFA is not only associated with developmental vascular abnormalities, but also contributes to various diseases including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drake and Little, 1995</xref>), we were motivated to determine whether the VEGFA-regulating function of SerRS is conserved in higher vertebrates such as humans, and what is the mechanism by which nuclear SerRS controls VEGFA expression.</p><p>It is well established that c-Myc is the major transcription factor promoting <italic>VEGFA</italic> gene expression in the nucleus, and thereby has a key role in vascular development. As a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZ) protein, c-Myc functions through heterodimerization with the small bHLHZ partner MAX for binding to the Enhancer Box (E-box) DNA sequence (5′-CACGTG-3′) on its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackwood and Eisenman, 1991</xref>). DNA-bound c-Myc recruits histone acetyltransferase to acetylate histone proteins to allow chromatin expansion and activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grandori et al., 2000</xref>). c-Myc knockout mice are embryonic lethal and exhibit, among others deformities, under-developed vasculature. Importantly, these deformities can be partially rescued by transgenic VEGFA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudino et al., 2002</xref>). On the other hand, endothelial-specific c-Myc overexpression in mice also causes embryonic lethality arising from widespread edema, multiple hemorrhagic lesions and severe defects in the vascular network, accompanied by an elevated level of VEGFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kokai et al., 2009</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the role of c-Myc in vascular development and in promoting VEGFA expression has to be tightly balanced.</p><p>In the work described below, we have elucidated a novel mechanism by which this balance is achieved. We show a head-to-head competition between SerRS and c-Myc for the same <italic>VEGFA</italic> promoter binding site and, in addition, a direct recruitment of SIRT2 histone deacetylase by SerRS to erase the transcription-enhancing chromatin remodeling already instigated by c-Myc. These results and further experiments in a vertebrate model organism reveal that SerRS is a key balancing antagonist of c-Myc for regulation of VEGFA expression, as well as for proper development of a functional vasculature. In addition, our study provides the first report of an anti-angiogenic function for SIRT2, which arises at least in part through its interaction with SerRS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SerRS affects VEGFA expression and angiogenesis in human cells</title><p>To study the mechanism of how nuclear SerRS represses VEGFA expression, we started by using human cells. A short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the 3′ UTR of human SerRS mRNA was generated to knock down endogenous SerRS expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and HEK 293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). For both cell types, the level of <italic>VEGFA</italic> transcript was more than doubled in cells expressing the shRNA against SerRS (sh-SerRS) vs a control shRNA (sh-Con) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Considering that SerRS is an essential component of the translation machinery and that knockdown of SerRS would have a general effect on protein synthesis that may obscure the effect on VEGFA expression, we compensated the ‘knockout’ cells by expression of NLS-deleted SerRS (ΔNLS) that is fully active in aminoacylation but lost the ability to enter the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2012</xref>), or by expression of wild-type (WT) SerRS (as a separate control). Remarkably, compared to WT SerRS-expressing cells, cells expressing ΔNLS SerRS resulted in three and fourfold higher expression of VEGFA in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), respectively. This result supports the idea that the role of nuclear SerRS in suppressing VEGFA expression is conserved from fish to humans. In addition, as measured in an in vitro endothelial tube formation assay, and consistent with the role of VEGFA in promoting angiogenesis, HUVECs expressing ΔNLS SerRS showed a much stronger propensity (than WT SerRS-expressing cells) to form a blood vessel-like tubular network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02349.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nuclear SerRS suppresses VEGFA expression and angiogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) VEGFA mRNA levels as detected by real-time RT-qPCR in HUVECs infected with lentiviral plasmids expressing nonspecific control shRNA (sh-Con), SerRS-specific shRNA (sh-SerRS), or sh-SerRS and wild type (WT) or NLS-deleted (ΔNLS) SerRS simultaneously.

This possibility was investigated in zebrafish as a vertebrate model system. As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukui et al., 2009</xref>), knocking down SerRS by injection of an antisense morpholino (SerRS-MO) resulted in a hyper-intersegmental vessel (ISV) branching phenotype in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), and the phenotype was accompanied with an elevated level of Vefga expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Specifically, out of 130 fish embryos injected with SerRS-MO, 72 (55.4%) exhibited hyper-ISV phenotype, as oppose to 2.9% (n = 4 out of 140) of fish injected with a control morpholino (control-MO). Although a small number of fish injected with SerRS-MO exhibited the opposite vascular defect (hypo-ISV phenotype), the number is not significantly different from that in the control-MO group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Overall, without SerRS, there is an over-expansion of the vasculature.</p><p>In contrast, knocking down c-Myc by injecting an antisense morpholino against Myca (c-Myc homologue in zebrafish) showed under-developed vasculature, which is accompanied with a reduced level of Vefga expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In particular, 41.4% (n = 24 out of 58) of Myca-MO-injected morphants exhibits hypo-ISV phenotype, as opposed to 10% (n = 14 out of 140) of control-MO-injected morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Remarkably, co-injection of Myca-MO with SerRS-MO efficiently rescued both hyper-ISV (10.7%, n = 18 out of 169) and hypo-ISV (10.1%, n = 17 out of 169) defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Coincidently, co-injection of Myca-MO also partially reversed the high Vegfa expression level in SerRS-MO-injected zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, a counteracting effect between c-Myc and SerRS in vascular development was confirmed in a vertebrate system. These results highlight a ‘Yin-Yang’ regulation of SerRS and c-Myc on VEGFA expression and demonstrate that a delicate balance between them is essential for developing a functional vasculature.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SerRS directly interacts with histone deacetylase SIRT2</title><p>A large scale protein–protein interaction study indicated a potential interaction between SerRS and sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ewing et al., 2007</xref>), a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase of the sirtuin family that regulates a broad range of processes, including transcription, metabolism, neurodegeneration, and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Finkel et al., 2009</xref>). Of the seven mammalian sirtuin isoforms, relatively little is known about SIRT2. Considering that c-Myc activates gene expression by recruiting partners harboring histone acetyltransferase activity that modifies histones and leads to open chromatin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McMahon et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amati et al., 2001</xref>), we postulated that an interaction between SerRS and SIRT2 might reverse this process to attenuate VEGFA expression. If this were true, then by implementing opposing deacetylase/acetyltransferase activities, the ‘Yin-Yang’ relationship between SerRS and c-Myc would also act at the level of chromatin modification.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we firstly performed coimmunoprecipitation to confirm the interaction.

The deacetylase activities of SIRT2 were measured by using a substrate peptide with one end coupled to a fluorophore and the other end to a quencher. An internal acetylated lysine residue serves as the substrate of SIRT2, and the deacetylation allows the peptide to be cleaved by a lysylendopeptidase to release the fluorophore from the quencher to emit fluorescence. Therefore, the SIRT2 acitivity was measured by monitoring the fluororescence intensity (excitation at 490 nm and emission at 530 nm).

To address this question, we first mapped the SerRS binding site on SIRT2 by coimmunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). SIRT2 is a 389-aa protein, whose crystal structure has been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Finnin et al., 2001</xref>). The catalytic core of SIRT2 is flanked by ∼60 aa and ∼50 aa on the N- and C-terminal ends, respectively. Through a series of truncations from each end, we determined that both N- and C-terminal regions, outside the catalytic core of SIRT2, interact with SerRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Particularly, residues within the regions of G52-D60 and W337-S356 are critical, as the loss of either region abolished the interaction of SIRT2 with SerRS. Interestingly, both regions are located on the opposite side of the substrate-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that bound SerRS should not interfere with the deacetylase activity of SIRT2. To confirm the postulation, we directly assessed the effect of SerRS on the in vitro deacetylase activity of SIRT2. Remarkably, at an equal molar ratio (1:1), SerRS did not inhibit but rather promoted the deacetylase activity of SIRT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Because increasing the SerRS concentration to 1:2 ratio (SIRT2: SerRS) did not provide any additional enhancement (but rather a small decline at early time points), the enhancement effect is likely to result from the specific interaction between SerRS and SIRT2, at a location distal to the active site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>SerRS recruits SIRT2 to epigenetically silence VEGFA expression</title><p>Next, we tested whether SerRS can recruit SIRT2 to modify the histone modification on the <italic>VEGFA</italic> promoter.

There are two different aspects of this activity: first, SerRS directly binds to the <italic>VEGFA</italic> promoter; second, DNA-bound SerRS recruits the SIRT2 histone deacetylase to condense the chromatin at the <italic>VEGFA</italic> promoter, and thereby shut down the gene transcription. Importantly, in each aspect, these actions of SerRS directly compete with and thwart that of the VEGFA-promoting actions of c-Myc. While the opposing regulation of SerRS and c-Myc is applied on VEGFA expression, it is manifested at the organism level with respect to vascular development, making SerRS and c-Myc as a pair of ‘Yin-Yang’ regulators for proper development of a functional vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02349.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The ‘Yin-Yang’ relationship of SerRS and c-Myc in vascular development.</title><p>Nuclear SerRS binds to the <italic>VEGFA</italic> promoter at the identified SerRS binding site (SBS) and recruits the SIRT2 histone deacetylase to condense the local chromatin to shut down VEGFA expression.

Therefore, Mad proteins are generally considered as antagonists of c-Myc, especially with regard to the role of c-Myc in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou and Hurlin, 2001</xref>). However, the role of Mad proteins in vascular development appears to be non-essential. Disruption of members of the Mad family in mice does not exhibit any vascular phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Foley et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schreiber-Agus et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, the temporal expression pattern varies between c-Myc and the Mad family proteins, with c-Myc being expressed during development, while expression of Mad proteins is mainly induced during terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Queva et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, the Mad proteins are largely silent during the time that the vasculature is being established, which could explain their non-essential role in vascular development. In comparison, SerRS' ubiquitous expression as an essential tRNA synthetase could match better with that of c-Myc to provide the counterbalance.</p><p>From an evolutionary perspective, a closed circulatory system with vasculature network is one of the hallmarks of vertebrates. Although c-Myc plays a key role in vascular development, the gene first appeared in <italic>Drosphila</italic>, an invertebrate with a primitive ‘open’ circulatory system. The appearance of the MAX and Mad family genes is even earlier, and the genes were first identified in roundworms such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atchley and Fitch, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prendergast, 1999</xref>). In contrast, although SerRS is considered as one of the most ancient proteins, its UNE-S domain, which harbors the NLS signal to endow SerRS with its novel transcription repressor activity, only appeared in vertebrates. Thus, it seems that an ‘old’ tRNA synthetase evolved to function as a ‘new’ and essential antagonist against c-Myc for proper development of the advanced closed circulatory system of vertebrates.</p><p>A critical component of the c-Myc-antagonizing role of SerRS is the recruitment of SIRT2. In fact, a complete reversal of the inhibitory effect of SerRS on VEGFA expression was observed when SIRT2 was knocked out by RNAi or inhibited by EX527 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). This observation indicates that the transcriptional repressor role of SerRS is ultimately through SIRT2 and that the direct blocking of c-Myc from the promoter by SerRS may have lesser significance for downregulating gene expression. Thus, an overlapping DNA binding site may not be a prerequisite for SerRS to antagonize c-Myc, as long as both SerRS and c-Myc bind to the same promoter. Considering the large number of genes that are regulated by c-Myc, one would not be surprised to find additional genes to be transcriptionally repressed by SerRS, presumably also through its collaboration with SIRT2.</p><p>It is worth noting that SIRT2 has been identified as a tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hiratsuka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lennerz et al., 2005</xref>), while c-Myc is a prominent oncogene that promotes tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudino et al., 2002</xref>). We speculate that SerRS also functions as a tumor suppressor by collaborating with SIRT2 to antagonize c-Myc. Interestingly, human <italic>SARS</italic> is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 (i.e., 1p13.3), which is frequently affected by rearrangements or allelic loss in a variety of human malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morgan et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell and Santibanez-Koref, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mathew et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Munn et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nagai et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caramazza et al., 2009</xref>). The frequent disruption of this chromosomal locus in human malignancies suggests the presence of tumor suppressor genes which, when perturbed, lead to increased cancer susceptibility. Because SerRS is also essential for survival through its function in protein synthesis, if it is a factor in any of these malignancies, then its function in translation would need to be preserved. This could be achieved by disruption of the UNE-S domain, which does not affect aminoacylation, but is essential for SerRS to antagonize c-Myc.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Custom-made rabbit anti-human SerRS antibody was raised against purified human recombinant SerRS and affinity-purified.

Binding kinetics was analyzed using a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA). The DNA was immobilized through biotin–streptavidin interaction on a SA sensor chip, and the interaction reached to 300 Response Unit. A flow cell without immobilized DNA was used as a blank reference control. The immobilized DNA was stable over the course of the experiment. Baseline drift was less than 5 RU/h after the chip was washed with HBS-EP buffer (0.01 M HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.005% surfactant P-20 [vol/vol]) at 10 μl min<sup>−1</sup> for 18 hr. SerRS proteins were injected using the KINJECT procedure for 300 s at 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1600 nM concentrations in HBS-EP buffer at 30 μl min<sup>−1</sup>. Dissociation was monitored by flowing HBS-EP buffer for 480 s at 30 μl min<sup>−1</sup>. The sensor chip was regenerated by a 60-s injection of 0.1% SDS, 10 mM NaOH to restore the original resonance signal of the surface. The injections were duplicated for each ligand concentration and were performed in random orders with buffer blanks injected periodically for double referencing. The variation between the replicates was less than 1%. Corrected response data were fitted with BiaevalTM 3.1 software and the apparent kinetic constants were calculated using data from the early parts of the association and dissociation phases. The fit was satisfactory for a simple 1:1 binding model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>In vivo studies in zebrafish</title><p>Transgenic <italic>Tg</italic> (<italic>Fli1a: EGFP</italic>) fish were maintained at 28.5°C under continuous water flow and filtration with automatic control for a 14:10 hr light/dark cycle. The night before injection, male and female fish were placed in a 1-L tank containing fish mating cage with an inner mesh and divider. Zebrafish embryos were obtained from natural spawning by removing the divider and stimulating with light. The embryos were kept at 28.5°C before and after microinjection. The antisense morpholinos (MOs) targeting SerRS or other genes were injected into the yolk of 1- to 2-cell stage embryos at the dosage of 4 ∼ 5 ng per embryo. The designs of SerRS-MO (5′-AGGAGAATGTGAACAAACCTGACAC-3′) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukui et al., 2009</xref>) and of Sirt1-MO (5′- TATTTTCGCCGTCCGCCATCTTCGC-3′) have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Potente et al., 2007</xref>). The Myca-MO (5′-CATTTTGACACTTGAGGAAGGAGAT-3′) and Sirt2-MO (5′-CATCTGAGCAGAAACTCACATTTGC-3′) were designed de novo for this study. All MOs including a standard control MO (5'-CCTCTTACC TCAGTTACAATTTATA-3') were purchased from Gene Tools, LLC (Philomath, OR, USA). After injection, embryos were incubated in E3 embryo medium supplemented with 0.003% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU) at 28.5°C to prevent pigment formation. Embryos were anesthetized with 0.168 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich), mounted in 2% methylcellulose and photographed with a Nikon fluorescent microscope (AZ100) equipped with a Nikon CCD camera (Qimaging Retiga 2000R). All the experiments involving zebrafish had been conducted according to the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at The Scripps Research Institute, IACUC approval number 09-0009. Statistical analyses were performed with the software SPSS Statistics 19. The effects of different morpholinos on ISV development were analyzed with χ<sup>2</sup> test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Professor Paul Schimmel for his advice on the project.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript reports on studies of mechanisms by which seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) functions in the nucleus to regulate VEGFA expression. The major findings are 1) SerRS binds directly to the VEGF promoter at a site that overlaps with a binding site for cMyc. 2) In vivo and in vitro experiments provide evidence that SerRS can compete for cMyc for binding at these sites. 3) The authors confirm a prior proteomic result suggesting interaction of SerRS with SIRT2. Evidence is presented that is consistent with SerRS acting to recruit SIRT2 to the VEGFA promoter where it actively represses VEGFA expression via histone deacetylation. Loss of function experiments in zebrafish that focus on vascular branching are supportive of mutually antagonistic roles of cMyc and SerRS in controlling vascular development, at least in part through regulation of the expression of VEGFA.</p><p>One reviewer stated, 'Overall the findings are novel and interesting and suggest mutually antagonistic functions of SerRS and cMyc at the VEGF gene, and possibly other Myc target genes. SerRS could thus represent an alternative mechanism for negative regulation of Myc in addition to that provided by Mad repressors that form Mad/Max heterodimers'. The second reviewer stated, 'The findings are very novel, exciting, and important. The approach takes advantage of cell culture, in vitro, and zebrafish technologies, and is elegant, well-designed, and with appropriate controls.'</p><p>The reviewers also raised the following major concerns that would need to be adequately addressed for the manuscript to be accepted:</p><p>1) The evidence that SerRS binds to the VEGF promoter and antagonizes cMyc appears to be convincing. A major concern relates to the features of SerRS that enable it to bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. The authors make no mention of a conserved DNA binding domain in SerRS. Additional mapping studies are needed to define the amino acid sequences of SerRS required for sequence-specific DNA binding activity.</p><p>2) At present there does appear to be sequence specificity, but perhaps too much so, in that all point mutations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> abolished binding and the minimal binding site was rather long. Are there base pairs in the binding site that are not important for sequence specific recognition? Are there mutations that discriminate binding of cMyc and SerRS?</p><p>3) The shifted bands in the EMSA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> should be more precisely identified. For example, the band labeled as SerRS could be a “supershifted” complex containing SerRS as well as c-Myc-Max. Western blot analysis or antibody supershifts could clarify this issue. The authors should address why the Max/Max/DNA complex is not disrupted by SerRS.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> the authors show the interaction of SerRS with SIRT2 in an overexpression system only. The interaction between the endogenous proteins should be shown in cells, for example, by co-IP.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02349.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The evidence that SerRS binds to the VEGF promoter and antagonizes cMyc appears to be convincing.

To address this point, we performed additional experiments to identify DNA binding sites on SerRS through domain mapping and deletion mutagenesis. The results indicate that SerRS has an extensive DNA-binding site. All three domains of SerRS (N-terminal tRNA binding domain, catalytic domain and the C-terminal UNE-S domain) are critical, but insufficient on their own, for DNA binding. To further define the DNA binding site on SerRS, we made 4 additional deletion mutants of SerRS at strategic positions. All 4 mutants lost the DNA binding activity. These results and the results on our investigation to address the second major concern of the reviewers (DNA sequence specificity; see below) now constitute a new section of the manuscript entitled “Characterize the interaction between SerRS and DNA” and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. These results also allow us to model the SerRS-DNA interaction, which is illustrated by a new movie (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) added to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) At present there does appear to be sequence specificity, but perhaps too much so, in that all point mutations shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3A</italic></xref> <italic>abolished binding and the minimal binding site was rather long. Are there base pairs in the binding site that are not important for sequence specific recognition? Are there mutations that discriminate binding of cMyc and SerRS?</italic></p><p>The answer is ‘yes’ to both questions. We now tested a total of 11 single or double mutations in the 27 bp DNA of the SerRS binding site. Two double mutants of the E-box, including one that would completely abolish c-Myc/Max binding, did not affect the SerRS interaction; on the other hand, 5 different single mutations outside the E-box (on both the 5’ and the 3’ sides) that would not affect c-Myc/Max binding greatly weakened SerRS binding, indicating that SerRS and c-Myc/Max have distinct DNA binding specificities. These new data is now added to the manuscript and is part of the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The shifted bands in the EMSA in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref> <italic>should be more precisely identified. For example, the band labeled as SerRS could be a “supershifted” complex containing SerRS as well as c-Myc-Max. Western blot analysis or antibody supershifts could clarify this issue. The authors should address why the Max/Max/DNA complex is not disrupted by SerRS</italic>.</p><p>In parallel with the EMSA, we now performed the Western blot analysis as suggested to clarify this concern. Only SerRS was detected in the shifted band, indicating that SerRS and c-Myc/MAX cannot complex with the DNA simultaneously. This result is consistent with the result from the ChIP assay where SerRS and c-Myc were found to inhibit each other for binding to the VEGFA promoter. The result is now added to the manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>The reason for why SerRS cannot disrupt MAX/MAX-DNA complex is because that the affinity between MAX homodimer and DNA is significantly higher (Kd = 19.2∼48.7 nM) than that of the SerRS-DNA interaction (Kd = 211.5∼265 nm) and the c-Myc/MAX-DNA interaction (Kd = 90.5∼229 nM). This information is now added to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>the authors show the interaction of SerRS with SIRT2 in an overexpression system only.
