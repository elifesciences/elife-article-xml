Little is known about the de novo resistance pathway for DRV. We selected for resistance to high drug concentrations against 10 PIs and their structural precursor DRV. Mutations accumulated through two pathways (anchored by protease mutations I50V or I84V). Small changes in the inhibitor P1'-equivalent position led to preferential use of one pathway over the other. Changes in the inhibitor P2'-equivalent position determined differences in potency that were retained in the resistant viruses and that impacted the selected mutations. Viral variants from the two pathways showed differential selection of compensatory mutations in Gag cleavage sites. These results reveal the high level of selective pressure that is attainable with fifth-generation PIs and how features of the inhibitor affect both the resistance pathway and the residual potency in the face of resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Highly active antiretroviral therapy against HIV-1 with combinations of drugs effectively block viral replication and preclude the evolution of drug resistance. Three major factors interplay to define the emergence of resistance in vivo: (i) the active drug concentration relative to its inhibitory activity; (ii) the level of resistance conferred by one or more mutations; and (iii) the fitness cost of the resistance mutations. For protease inhibitors (PIs), the number of mutations selected increases with increasing drug concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Watkins et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the concentration of this drug class in vivo is an important parameter in determining the genetic barrier to resistance.</p><p>The early identification of the retroviral protease as a member of the aspartyl proteinase family and the determination of a number of cleavage site sequences led to the development of first-generation PIs (PIs) that validated the HIV-1 protease as a drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katoh et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Richards et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seelmeier et al., 1988</xref>). A second generation of PIs was quickly developed for use in humans, becoming the third drug in a three-drug regimen that achieved sustained suppression of viral load with no evolution of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gulick et al., 1997</xref>). The third generation of PIs had improved properties with regard to side effects and efficacy. These properties have been further enhanced with a fourth-generation PI, darunavir (DRV), which achieves a drug level in plasma (&gt;1 µM) that is 1000-fold greater than its inhibitory activity in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurt Yilmaz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nalam et al., 2013</xref>). The potential efficacy of a fourth-generation PI such as DRV has led to attempts to use this drug in monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antinori et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arribas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Valantin et al., 2012</xref>). Although the initial trials of monotherapy showed a modest increase in the loss of viral suppression relative to standard ART, in the cases of virological failure there was no significant resistance to DRV detected in the rebound virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antinori et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arribas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Valantin et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the observed virological failure is most easily attributed to issues of low drug exposure in specific participants. While therapy has not yet moved to single agents, potent two drug therapies are being explored. In this regard, several studies have shown that a PI can be part of a successful two drug therapy regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casado et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Cristo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hawkins et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vizcarra et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Drug resistance to DRV is incompletely understood. The appearance of DRV-resistant viruses during therapy failure has occurred in people who had previously experienced virological failure with other PIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Meyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Descamps et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pellegrin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tremblay, 2008</xref>). In these cases, the pathway to DRV resistance was likely influenced by the preexisting resistance to the previous PI. DRV resistance has been selected in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aoki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Meyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koh et al., 2010</xref>). High-level resistance was selected starting with either a mixture of highly resistant variants that were allowed to recombine or the selection was started with a single PI-resistant strain; in both cases, an I84V resistance pathway in the protease was observed. However, there are no reports of selection of high-level resistance starting with an unmutated ‘wildtype’ virus. Thus, there is little information on what a do novo pathway for resistance to DRV would be.</p><p>An important concept in HIV-1 PI design is to avoid chemical moieties that extend outside of the substrate envelope, the shared volume in the protease active site that is occupied by natural protease substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">King et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">King et al., 2002</xref>). We have previously designed a series of highly potent PIs based on DRV, UMASS-1 through -10, that still fit within the substrate envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nalam et al., 2013</xref>). The designed fifth-generation inhibitors have modified chemical moieties that relative to DRV further ﬁll the substrate envelope at the equivalent of the P1' and P2' positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). All bind tightly to the wild-type HIV-1 protease with a K<sub>i</sub> of less than 5 pM. These inhibitors retained robust binding to many multidrug-resistant protease variants and viral strains.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Darunavir (DRV) structure as a PR substrate analog.</title><p>The chemical structure of DRV is shown. Protease substrates are labeled following a convention where the scissile bond is flanked upstream by amino acids labeled P1, P2, etc., with the amino acids downstream labeled P1', P2', etc. The cleavage site can thus be written P1/P1'. The side chains of these amino acids extend into subsites in the protease with corresponding labels (i.e., the P1 side chain extends into the S1 subsite). In the UMASS series of analogs, the DRV structure at the equivalent of the P1' position (labeled R1) was modified as was the structure at the equivalent of the P2' position (labeled R2).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80328-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>In an effort to define the de novo pathway to resistance for DRV and determine the effects of these chemical changes in the inhibitors, we examined the evolutionary path used to attain high-level resistance to DRV and the UMASS-1 through -10 panel of PIs. Under continuous and escalating selective pressure, representing between 50 and 95 passages, the virus evolved to accumulate multiple mutations. In most cases, selection was carried out until the final concentration approximated that achieved by DRV in vivo. Relatively minor modifications in inhibitor structure favored selection of one of two pathways to resistance, anchored by protease mutation I50V or I84V. In addition, the P2'-equivalent chemical structure of the inhibitor affected residual potency against highly resistant strains and in some cases changed the potency of the P1'-equivalent moiety. These results reveal the extremely high genetic barrier to resistance to the fourth-generation PI DRV at inhibitor concentrations that can be achieved in vivo, and the complex evolutionary pathways required to achieve resistance. In addition, these results reveal features of fifth-generation protease inhibitor design that both affect the selected pathway of resistance and determine residual potency against resistant variants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Panel of highly potent and analogous HIV-1 PIs</title><p>HIV-1 PIs were designed by modifications to DRV to increase favorable interactions with the protease within the substrate envelope, thereby increasing potency while minimizing evolution of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nalam et al., 2013</xref>).

First, all inhibitors had a K<sub>i</sub> of less than 5 pM (limit of detection) against the wild-type enzyme, precluding a comparison of potency among them without using partially resistant mutant proteases (I84V and I50V/A71V). Second, the P1'/R1 position change to the larger 2-ethyl-n-butyl moiety (R1-2, UMASS-6) increased potency against the I84V mutant protease relative to DRV and the intermediate sized R1-1 moiety UMASS-1 (all three share the same R2-1 moiety); this enhanced potency of the R1-2 inhibitors over the R1-1 inhibitors was also apparent for UMASS-8 over UMASS-3, which share the same R2-3 structure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), while this pattern of potency was reversed (i.e., R1-1 was more potent than R1-2) for UMASS pairs -2 and -7, and -5 and -10 (with R2-2 and R2-5, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Third, four of the inhibitors with the R2 moieties R2-2 or R2-5 were significantly more potent (UMASS-2, -5, -7, -10) than with the other R2 moieties. This trend was most pronounced for activity against the I50V/A71V mutant enzyme in both the R1-1 and R1-2 backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The significant potency of the R2-2 and R2-5 containing inhibitors against the I50V/A71V mutant enzyme while maintaining good potency against the I84V enzyme indicates that both the R1 and R2 constituents contribute to potency, and to enhancing potency over DRV. This potency was also seen in inhibition of viral infectivity as the EC<sub>50</sub> values of the R2-2 and R2-5 containing inhibitors were among the lowest measured (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Selection for high-level resistance during passage in cell culture follows two pathways</title><p>To evaluate the potential of each inhibitor to select for mutations that would confer high-level resistance and to compare these mutations across the inhibitor series, we grew HIV-1 under conditions of escalating inhibitor concentration in cell culture through a lengthy period of selection (50–95 passages). The selection experiments were performed under two separate starting conditions: first when the starting virus was generated from the NL4-3 clone (this clone closely approximates the clade B consensus for the protease amino acid sequence and will be referred to as ‘wild type’), then again when the starting virus was a mixture of 26 isogenic viruses each with a single mutation associated with drug resistance in the NL4-3 background. Notably, in the latter case only about one-half of the mutations that appeared in the culture during selections were in the mixture of starting mutations, indicating that even in the selections that were seeded with the pool of single resistance mutations there was sufficient evolutionary capacity to explore mutations at positions that started as the wild-type sequence. The initial inhibitor concentration started at low nanomolar concentrations and increased by a factor of 1.5 with each subsequent viral passage (the inhibitor concentration was increased only after the virus spread efficiently through the culture). All of the selections starting with wild-type virus reached at least 5 µM of inhibitor concentration (approximating the therapeutic concentration reached by DRV in the blood and in the range of a 1000-fold increase in the starting EC<sub>50</sub>). For technical reasons, only five of the selections starting with the mixture of mutants reached an inhibitor concentration as high as 400 nM and are reported here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Resistance mutations selected in the protease coding domain during the escalating selective pressure of increasing PI concentration were examined at various timepoints using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) protocol that included Primer ID with the MiSeq platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). We first examined the sequence of the most abundant variant in each of the two selection schemes present at the highest inhibitor concentration reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For those selections that reached 5 μM, 8–14 mutations were present in the most abundant variant. Typically the next two most abundant variants in the population differed by a single amino acid, and on average the three most abundant variants in the 5 μM cultures accounted for 88% of the total viral population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Evolution of resistance followed two pathways, one based on I50V and one based on I84V. In three cultures, V2wt, V5wt, and V2mut (which reached either 4 or 5 μM final drug concentration; V2wt indicates the virus pool selected with UMASS-2 starting with wild-type virus), these two mutations, I84V and I50V, became linked on the same genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) showing they are not mutually exclusive; it is worth noting that the appearance of the linked I84V/I50V mutations occurred in the selections of the UMASS inhibitors (-2 and -5) that showed the greatest potency against the two mutant enzymes I84V and I50V/A71V (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with inhibitor potency driving the co-selection of these two primary resistance mutations together.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Features of viruses selected to high-level resistance against darunavir (DRV) and the UMASS-1 through -10 inhibitor series.</title><p>Infected cultures were put under drug selection starting with either wild-type virus or a pool of mutant viruses.

First, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the number of mutations present at 100 nM drug concentration was approximately half the number present after selection to greater than 1 μM. In comparing the number of mutations present in cultures using the I84V versus the I50V pathway, we noted that on average there were more mutations in the I50V viruses at the intermediate drug concentration compared to the I84V viruses (100 nM, p=0.03), and this trend continued at the higher drug concentration. Next we compared the EC<sub>50</sub> of five virus cultures representing the I84V or the I50V pathways (highlighted in yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and including one that had both mutations linked, testing the level of resistance to all of the UMASS-1 through -10 inhibitors after selection to 100 nM drug concentration or to 5 μM. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, resistance (measured as an increase in the EC<sub>50</sub>) was apparent after selection to the 100 nM inhibitor concentration, and in each case the EC<sub>50</sub> increased an average of 100-fold after selection to the final inhibitor concentration of 5 μM (EC<sub>50</sub> values of the final virus pool are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>We were also interested in the fitness cost of these mutations. To measure this effect, we compared the infectivity of the virus in 10 culture supernatants (five virus pools at each of two levels of selection), normalizing infectivity on a reporter cell line for a given amount of the virion p24 CA protein in the culture supernatant. This was compared to the unmutated NL4-3 parent (given a value of 100%). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, selection to 100 nM inhibitor concentration resulted in a reduction in fitness/relative infectivity by between 100- and 1000-fold. Those cultures with the biggest decrease in fitness rebounded to around 1% relative infectivity after selection to an inhibitor level of 5 μM. This suggests that these high levels of resistance are linked to maintaining a residual level of relative infectivity around 1% (as defined under these culture conditions).</p><p>We used another approach to explore the interplay between resistance and fitness; we examined the effect of resistance on catalytic efficiency of the protease by measuring K<sub>i</sub> and the catalytic efficiency (kcat/K<sub>m</sub>) for a set of mutant proteases against the entire panel of UMASS inhibitors and DRV. The average K<sub>i</sub> value of each mutant protease (sequences shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) is plotted against the catalytic efficiency (kcat/K<sub>m</sub>) for that enzyme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. As can be seen, there is a strong relationship between higher K<sub>i</sub> values (i.e., resistance) and dramatic reductions in catalytic efficiency, consistent with the loss of fitness associated with these viral populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Features of the selection process assessed by NGS of longitudinal samples</title><p>Each of the viral cultures started with wild-type virus showed an accumulation of protease mutations with increasing selective pressure.

The introduction of the I50V mutation was generally not associated with a drop in entropy, rather these populations maintained high genetic diversity even at higher drug concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We interpret these patterns as indicative of I84V conferring some level of resistance without a dramatic loss in fitness, allowing a more homogeneous culture (i.e., less entropy). In contrast, I50V may confer a higher level of resistance but at a greater fitness cost, thus supporting greater diversity in the culture either as compensatory mutations or as other combinations of mutations with lesser resistance but higher fitness. In this regard, we previously showed I50V significantly reduces the fitness of the virus relative to the fitness loss of a virus with I84V as single mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henderson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>When we examined the sequence diversity as assessed by Shannon entropy for all selections that reached at least 1 µM in inhibitor concentration, we found that cultures starting with the mixture of resistant viruses averaged a nearly twofold higher entropy value compared to the cultures where the selection started with just the virus generated from the NL4-3/wild-type clone (3.0 vs. 1.6, p&lt;0.0001 Mann–Whitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). This was unexpected as both sets of selections passed through many genetic bottlenecks. This result is most easily explained if the rates of recombination were fairly high throughout the culture period so that most sequence variants were maintained at least at a low level. However, at the end of the selection period no wild-type variants could be detected in the cultures by deep sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The chemical nature of R1 and R2 determines the resistance pathway</title><p>We next examined whether the inhibitor structure influenced the resistance pathway chosen. We found that the R1 group, that is, the (S)-2-methylbutyl (R1-1) or the 2-ethyl-n-butyl (R1-2), largely defined the resistance pathway observed; for these inhibitors, the R1 group takes the position of P1' in the protease substrate analog, occupying the S1' subsite. With the UMASS-1 through -5 series (the smaller R1-1 group), the I84V mutation appeared first in six of seven cultures. In contrast, the UMASS-6 through -10 series with the larger R1-2 group, the I50V mutation appeared first in eight of nine cultures (p=0.009, Fisher’s exact test; in this analysis, we included two cultures that did not reach at least 400 nM inhibitor concentration but did fix an initial set of mutations to increase our sample size [V3mut, V5mut], and we did not include two cultures where both I84V and I50V were initially fixed together [V2wt, V5wt]). We considered the possibility that the starting mixture of viruses in the mutant selection might skew the pathway selected, especially since the mutant pool included I84V but not I50V. However, in only one of the eight cultures with sufficient data from both selections was there a switch from the I84V pathway to the I50V pathway between the first and second selections (cultures of UMASS-6 with an R1-2 group). Thus, we conclude that the P1’-equivalent chemical structure of the inhibitor is a strong determinant of the resistance pathway selected. It is notable that one inhibitor could select for different pathways in two separate selections (also seen with DRV, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) even when both major mutations are maintained in the viral population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that either pathway can provide some level of resistance to most if not all of these inhibitors, and that the chance addition of the initial compensatory mutations may determine which pathway becomes the major resistant population.</p><p>To examine the potential for linked mutations and infer the order in which mutations accumulated in the protease gene to confer high-level resistance, the abundance data from multiple selections that ended in one or the other pathway were pooled and compared. In this analysis, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, summary data for the selections resulting in the I84V pathway point up, with I84V reaching 100% penetrance by definition. Similarly, the summary data for those selections that fixed I50V are shown pointing down, with I50V reaching 100% penetrance. Several mutations are uniquely linked or at least strongly favored in each pathway, with I84V being linked to V32I, and I50V being linked to I47V, F53L, and I13V. A number of mutations appear in both pathways, although not with equal frequency: L10F, L33F, M46I, I54L, A71V, and V82I. Finally, other mutations appear less frequently, making it difficult to assign them to one of these categories. These results show that while some mutations are largely linked to one pathway, other mutations are often shared between the two pathways. Also, the variation in frequency of appearance of shared mutations in the two pathways suggests different levels of impact on resistance and/or fitness in the I84V vs. the I50V background for these mutations (e.g., L10F, M46I and A71V). In particular, the larger impact of I50V on fitness compared to I84V mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henderson et al., 2012</xref>) is consistent with the earlier appearance and greater levels of fixation of the shared compensatory mutations L10F, L33F, M46I, and A71V in the cultures that followed the I50V pathway. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, we show a summary timeline of the ordered addition of mutations for each pathway and whether they are shared or unique to the pathway (in addition to their relative penetrance/final prevalence among the different cultures).

We did not detect any novel mutations associated with any of the R2-1 through R2-5 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, as noted earlier, the inhibitors with R2-2 and R2-5 in the smaller R1-1 background (UMASS-2 and UMASS-5) resulted in the selection of resistant virus where both of the primary resistance mutations (I84V and I50V) were present and linked. The comparable R2 inhibitors in the R1-2 background (UMASS-7 and UMASS-10) selected for just the I50V primary mutation consistent with the larger R1-2 structure. Thus, for inhibitors with three of the R2 moieties (R2-1, R2-3, R2-4) the selection of the primary resistance pathway was determined by the size of the R1 moiety. This was also true for the R2 moieties R2-2 and R2-5 with the larger R1-2 moiety, selecting for I50V; however, these same two R2 moieties are able to change the interaction of the smaller R1-1 moiety to drive selection of both primary resistance mutations demonstrating a role for R2 in influencing the resistance pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The chemical nature of R1 and R2 determines residual potency among the resistant variants</title><p>We considered several variables in examining the nature of the interaction between inhibitors and the resistant proteases: the extent to which the inhibitor structure (either R1 or R2) affected residual potency; and the extent to which the pathway (I84V or I50V) conferred the greatest resistance.

An analysis of four cultures that had I84V as the major resistance mutation showed they all had a mutation at the NC/SP2 cleavage site at position P2, with a change from the wild-type alanine amino acid to either of the larger aliphatic amino acids valine or isoleucine. In addition, three of the four I84V cultures had a mutation at the adjacent SP2/p6 cleavage site, either at P1' (leucine to phenylalanine) or P5' (proline to leucine). Conversely, all seven cultures where the I50V mutation was the major resistance mutation there was a mutation in the SP2/p6 cleavage site, but not in the NC/SP2 site. Finally, in the three cultures where the protease evolved both the I50V and I84V mutations, Gag mutations were observed only at the SP2/p6 cleavage site (the presence or absence of the NC/SP2 mutation in the I84V cultures but not in the I84V/I50V cultures has a p value of 0.03 in a Fisher’s exact test). Two of three cultures with both I84V and I50V had both the P1' (leucine to phenylalanine) and P5' (proline to leucine) mutations. In contrast, mutations at both P1' and P5' together were underrepresented in the cultures with only I50V. An examination of the modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) suggests that the NC/SP2 mutation at P2 in the presence of the I84V mutation may engage I50 to replace the lost interaction with I84V as it moves away from the P2 sidechain by shortening (I to V); this would explain the absence of this cleavage site mutation in the double protease mutant (I50V/I84V) since the shortening of both protease sidechains provides too little interaction with the longer P2 sidechain. The P1' and P5' mutations in the SP2/P6 site appear to act in a complementary way as typically only one is seen with either the I50V or the I84V mutant proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The SP2/p6 P1' and P5' mutations engage the protease by different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Özen et al., 2014</xref>) suggesting their effects are additive; thus in these selections the single mutation at P1' or P5' may be sufficient to recover an appropriate rate of cleavage with either the I84V or the I50V mutant protease, but the additive effects of the P1' and P5' mutations may be needed to rescue cleavage by the I50V/I84V mutant protease.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Protease cleavage site mutations observed after selection for high-level resistance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Culture names, final inhibitor concentration, and resistance pathway are shown.

While we were successful in selecting for resistance to DRV in cell culture, the spectrum of mutations observed largely overlap those seen in previous studies based on testing individual mutations for their effect on DRV sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Meyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">King et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rhee et al., 2003</xref>). In this work, we have explored chemical modifications to the DRV scaffold. We found that modification of the P1'/R1 chemical structure to be a larger aliphatic group favored the use of the I50V resistance pathway compared to the smaller DRV structure or an intermediate-sized structure, forcing the virus to use the more deleterious I50V mutation compared to the I84V mutation used with the smaller P1'/R1 structures. Conversely, we identified a subset of the P2'/R2 groups that contributed to residual potency even in the resistant proteases but did not select for novel resistance mutations; however, several of the R2 groups that conferred higher potency selected both major primary mutations but only with the smaller R1-1 methylbutyl group. Thus, chemical modifications at both of these inhibitor positions yielded improvements over DRV and an unexpected linkage between the R1 and R2 groups in that anchoring the R2 group to the protease backbone enhanced the potency of the intermediate-sized R1 group, at least as assessed by its selective pressure.</p><p>The potency of these inhibitors can be inferred by the high genetic barrier to high-level resistance.

An examination of the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hivdb.stanford.edu/">https://hivdb.stanford.edu/</ext-link>) shows a catalog of approximately 25,000 reported HIV-1 sequences with at least one protease resistance-associated mutation, with the majority of these linked to some level of phenotypic resistance to DRV. For sequences associated with a greater than 200-fold change in resistance to DRV, there were an average of 5.4 resistance-associated mutations (with a maximum of seven mutations). Thus, these levels approach the levels of resistance we have obtained and highlight the potential for creating an even higher genetic barrier to resistance in vivo.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>P1'/R1 modification</title><p>DRV has a relatively small butyl group at this position that most often selected for an I84V mutation.

Conversely, the longer P1'/R1-2 group is oriented into the space between I84 and I50, thus drawing in I50V as the pathway to resistance.

When we examined the interactions between protease and inhibitor, there is a clear structural explanation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–F</xref>). The less potent inhibitors interact with the protease side chains and backbone at D29 and D30 through a network of water molecules. In contrast, with the more potent R2-2 group the water molecules are replaced with direct interactions between inhibitor and protease in the S2' subsite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This direct interaction more closely mimics the interaction made by the glutamine P2' side chain in the optimized protease cleavage site at the SP1/NC boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Thus, the ability to replace the water-mediated interactions with a more rigid framework that is interacting with the protease backbone deep in the S2' pocket appears to be a unique feature of the inhibitors with R2-2. Improved potency in another series of PIs was also reported for this R2-2 P2' moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While the different R2 structures did not select for any novel resistance mutations, we did note that the two inhibitors with the greatest potency as enzymes (UMASS-2 and UMASS-5) were the only inhibitors that selected for I84V and I50V linked on the same genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This represents a third distinct outcome since in these cases the smaller methylbutyl R1-1 is also able to engage I50. As noted above, the R2-2 group is directly anchored to the protease backbone. We examined the effect this has on the R1-1 orientation. However, we did not see any difference in the placement of the R1-1 group when comparing UMASS-1 (which preferentially selects for I84V) and UMASS-2 (which selects for linked I84V/I50V). It is possible that anchoring to the backbone with R2-2 for UMASS-2 makes the R1-1 group less mobile, reducing the magnitude of the effect of the I84V mutation allowing the inhibitor to maintain some level of interaction with I50, although this inference was not tested directly.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Protease mutation networks and compensatory mutations in the resistant pathways</title><p>In most of the selections, either the I84V or the I50V mutation was largely fixed by the time the inhibitor concentration reached 10 nM in the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The viral cultures went through cyclical changes in population diversity as subsequent mutations were added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Because of the large number of selections, it was possible to pool data and see trends in the way mutations were added in these two pathways. Resistance mutations that were detected in multiple selections summed to at least 16 positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). While these mutations are well known, their relationships to each other, and as a function of selective pressure, are less well understood. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> show strong linkage between I84V and V32I, while I50V shows linkage with I47V and F53L. These linked compensatory mutations are each close to the primary resistance mutation, suggesting they interact directly with the primary resistance mutation to adjust its position within the subsite to limit interaction with the inhibitor and/or improve interaction with the substrate.</p><p>Other mutations appeared often in both pathways but could be found earlier and/or more frequently in one pathway: in the I84V pathway G16E and I54L were favored; in the I50V pathway L10F, I13V, L33F, M46I, L63P, and A71V were favored. In contrast to the linked compensatory mutations, the shared compensatory mutations are often more distant in the structure from the primary resistance mutation. Mutations distal from the active site modulate the enzymatic activity and fitness by altering the dynamic ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foulkes-Murzycki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leidner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ragland et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ragland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Whitfield et al., 2020</xref>) of the enzyme (i.e., conformations sampled). While these changes can sometimes enhance enzymatic activity, they also often significantly contribute to high levels of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matthew et al., 2021</xref>) as is observed in these selections. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, there is a strong correlation between increasing resistance (lower K<sub>i</sub>) and lost catalytic efficiency (larger kcat/K<sub>m</sub>). This suggests that compensatory mutations may attenuate fitness loss but do not restore it, or they impact resistance, or both. The role of mutations outside of the active site has been of interest for a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foulkes-Murzycki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kovalevsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Louis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ode et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shen et al., 2010</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, it can be seen that the same compensatory mutation is part of two different resistance pathways but with differing selective pressure to add the mutation, hinting at the complexity of the role of such mutations and their pathway-specific contributions.</p><p>In summary, using a number of lengthy selections for resistance to a series of structurally related PIs we have been able to identify the size of the hydrophobic chain at the P1'-equivalent position of the inhibitor as the major determinant for selection of the I84V pathway with a smaller P1'-equivalent chain, including for DRV, versus a larger P1'-eqivalent hydrophobic chain driving selection of the I50V pathway. Also, one of the P2' groups tested gave a higher level of potency even in the face of high-level resistance by creating a direct interaction with the protease backbone. This also led to coselection of I84V and I50V as linked mutations. These chemical changes in the inhibitor increase the genetic barrier for the evolution of resistance and emphasize the potential utility of what a fifth-generation HIV-1 PI could add to regimens with reduced drug complexity.</p><p>DRV has been used as the starting point for other approaches in enhancing potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matthew et al., 2021</xref>). These other studies have examined similar, but not identical, structural changes to DRV as described here. There is a cautionary note in comparing between different inhibitors that can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, where the nature of the chemical structure at one site (R2) reverses the order of potency of structures at another site (R1) in the inhibitor. Thus, comparisons between DRV derivatives where there are two or more differences may be problematic in terms of trying to infer parallels or differences. The original description of DRV included a compound with the same R2-2 that was also highly potent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Surleraux et al., 2005</xref>), and R2-2 has been tested in the context of other changes in DRV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delino et al., 2018</xref>). R2-4 has been tested on the DRV backbone (GRL-98065) that was further modified at the P1-equivalent position to give the inhibitor brecanavir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hazen et al., 2007</xref>). The R2-5 P2'-equivalent has previously been shown to have interactions with PR amino acids 29/30 in the S2' subsite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulut et al., 2020</xref>). The DRV backbone has also been used as the basis for more extensive chemical changes giving rise to a number of potent HIV-1 protease inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aoki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cihlar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghosh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghosh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghosh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghosh et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghosh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghosh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hazen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nalam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rusere et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>DRV represents a potent antiviral due in large part to its ability to achieve drug levels in the blood that are far above the EC<sub>50</sub> and the fact that high-level resistance requires many mutations (a high genetic barrier). However, we have shown that resistance usually follows the less deleterious I84V pathway. The UMASS-2 inhibitor anchors the R2-2 group to the protease backbone and allows the intermediate-sized R1-1 group to co-select both the I84V and I50V pathways, creating an even higher genetic bar. These improvements could become important if protease inhibitors are moved to dosing using a long acting depot where drug mass becomes limiting. The enhanced potency of UMASS-2 could potentially be traded for reduced maximum drug levels allowing a given mass of drug to provide antiviral coverage for a longer period of time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and viruses</title><p>CEMx174 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin.

The culture volume was then brought to 10 ml with RPMI medium. Each flask received one of the following inhibitors at escalating concentrations: UMass1, UMass2, UMass3, UMass4, UMass5, UMass6, UMass7, UMass8, UMass9, UMass10, DRV, and no drug (ND). After 48 hr and every 48 hr after, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and 10 ml of fresh medium and inhibitors were added. When the culture had undergone extensive cytopathic effect (CPE) indicative of viral replication, the supernatant medium and the cells were harvested separately and stored at –80°C. The virus-containing supernatant was used to start the next round of infection, and after several rounds at the initial concentration, the inhibitor concentration was increased 1.5-fold at each subsequent round of virus passage. The level of resistance (50% inhibitory concentration [EC<sub>50</sub>]) of the single inhibitor-selected virus pools was determined by a TZM infection assay in which the PI is added to productively infected cells and the titers of supernatant virus made in the presence of the inhibitor are determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>TZM infection assay</title><p>PI dilutions were prepared by taking 10 µM stocked and performing a fivefold serial dilution using RPMI media (final drug concentration is 100 µM).

The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dmitry Lyumkis (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>For publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, the paper needs to be revised in order to improve readability (for both experts and non-experts) and to address a number of issues brought up by the Reviewers.</p><p>1) Readability. (a) Please include in the introduction a brief &quot;guide&quot; to the P1', P2' positions. (b) Please utilize the <italic>eLife</italic> system of figures and figure supplements (see published examples) to consolidate the main figures and supplementary figures. (c) Presentation of selection data in e.g., Figures1, 3, and S4 need to be improved, for example using a mutational &quot;tree&quot; diagram that illustrates relationships between the primary and accessory mutations.</p><p>2) Discussion and data interpretation. (a) The Reviewers are all in agreement that there is more to be said about the accessory variants, how these arise, and how these could contribute to resistance, beyond describing their linkages to the primary mutations. This is key to the paper, but unfortunately, the data are presented in a way that limits comprehension, even by experts. Please determine a more effective way to illustrate (perhaps something similar to an evolutionary tree) and discuss the concepts of key pathways (I84V and I50V), their establishment during selection, and the further addition of and roles of accessory mutations. (b) Address how insights from this study explain the clinical utility and limitation of DRV. (c) Going beyond DRV, discuss design strategies for minimizing drug resistance, including limits on absolute sizes of R1 and R2. (d) Address the potential roles of cleavage site mutations in Gag.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My comment would be to provide some broader set of rules through which resistance develops, starting with the WT, beyond the 184V vs 150V variants themselves and the pathway switch mediated by modifications at the P1' region, in particular for the accessory mutations. The authors have generated an extensive amount of data from the passaging experiments, using multiple different drugs. Is it possible to devise some conglomerate ordering for resistance onset? Or place the accessory mutations into a broader context? For example, looking at the data in Figure 2, it appears that V82I and M46I somewhat consistently emerge in the initial or mid-stages of the passaging experiments, and they're almost universally present in Figure 1. I47V and M71V, which are also nearly universally present in Figure 1, appear to be more variable in Figure 2, occasionally arising toward the end of the passaging experiment. Are there any other patterns that emerge?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The authors report an extended analysis of the development of resistance mutations in HIV protease sequence variation during long-term treatment with darunavir. Long–term drug therapy may also select for mutations in cleavage sites in gag/pol where protease cleaves. Have the authors investigated the presence of cleavage site mutations in the gag sequence using single genome amplification (SGA) or the like? Are all of the changes responsible for resistance attributable to changes in protease only?</p><p>– In Figure 1A, the authors use NGS with primer ID to quantify the abundance of drug-resistant variants. These studies are well done and represent the gold standard for measuring levels of different variants. As they show, the highly resistant variants may predominate but other variants are present as well, in some cases seems like these other variants are at substantial levels, and additional discussion of these data would be useful. For instance, in studies of UMASS–2, the most abundant variant is only 37% of the total; this observation seems consistent with the data in figure 2A, where the authors find relatively high Shannon entropy for UMASS-2, reflecting considerable genetic diversity. In contrast, in studies of UMASS-8, where the most abundant variant is also low (only 55.4%), figure 2A shows a relatively low shannon entropy. Were there other closely related variants without DRMS that would explain both the relatively low abundance of resistant variants, but also explain the low entropy levels? Additionally, in these long–term experiments, were there any WT variants present after prolonged drug exposure?</p><p>Elsewhere, the authors suggest the presence of widespread recombination in these cultures – might recombination also explain some of the variations in Figure 1A? Considering several log decreases in infectivity demonstrated in Figure 1 D, is recombination contributing to ongoing transmission during drug exposure?</p><p>– Figure 2A – Regarding the Shannon entropy determinations – were parallel studies done with darunavir? if so, how do those shannon entropy profiles compare with those measured for UMASS compounds and can they be included in the figure?</p><p>– The authors have important new insights in their structural studies – can they place boundaries on the absolute sizes of R1 or R2 for future drug design?</p><p>– Previously these authors have provided useful models of genetic variation in vitro (Boucher et al., 2019), including estimating selection coefficients. Can the authors discuss their new data in light of these modeling studies and identify selection coefficients for these variants?</p><p>– Do the data from these studies provide insight to explain the clinical utility and limitations of Darunavir as an initial or simplification therapy? For instance:</p><p>a) the two–drug combination of Darunavir and Raltegravir is highly effective in suppressing HIV, but this combination is not recommended in individuals with HIV viral loads exceeding 100,000 copies/ml plasma, because of the increased risk for the development of resistance.</p><p>b) individuals with baseline protease resistance simplifying their regimens to darunavir+raltegravir did not result in increased frequency of protease resistance (Vizcarra et al., 2019).</p><p>– Can you clarify the tinting in Figure S2?</p><p>As written:</p><p>&quot;UMASS<sup>-1</sup>, -3, -6, -8 show less potency towards these variants and is shaded in a red tint matching R2 groups. Are the tints supposed to be the same for R2 groups?&quot;</p><p>But in my version:</p><p>UMASS 1 and 3 have an identical tint, but different R2 groups, and</p><p>UMASS 6, and 8 have identical tint but different R2 groups.</p><p>In table 1</p><p>UMASS<sup>-1</sup> and -6 have identical R2 groups</p><p>UMASS-3 and -8 have identical R2 groups</p><p>also</p><p>UMASS-2 and 5 have identical tint but different R2 groups</p><p>UMASS-7 and 10 have identical tint, but different R2 groups</p><p>UMSS 10 and 5 have identical R2 groups</p><p>UMASS 2 and 7 have identical R2 groups</p><p>It's not clear whether this could be an ADOBE issue or something else is meant by this text</p><p>and figure.</p><p>–Line 474 &quot;demonstrate&quot; should be &quot;demonstrated&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript is comprehensive, well–written, and informative, yet dense and with some figures that readers may not find informative. Comments are discussed below.</p><p>1. Perhaps it was just me, but I found that figure layout and organization difficult to get the necessary take–home points. In table 1, it might be helpful for the reader to have viral EC50s for the initial mutations, as shown, and the endstage predominates viral populations as well. I am aware that in some cases the final population is a viral mixture of two genotypes and this should be noted.</p><p>2. Given that a major focus of the report is mutational selections starting from wildtype from DRV and UMASS compound series to the ending of the selection. The information for the viral mutations arising over time and their respective abundance over time ( = increased drug conc.) is scattered (Figure 1, Sup Figure 4) throughout the Figures. Readers might appreciate a timeline figure documenting when the first mutations arose and their genotypic abundance over time. The primer ID strategy should allow relative quantification of sequences. This is brought up to give the interesting mutational, and somewhat distinct, population pathways in some of the compound selections. Getting at the question of the history of the mutational series is informative. Perhaps a mutational tree?</p><p>Figure 1 In the case when both I84V and I50V mutational series are present for (say UMASS–2) do the mutational series occur at the same time? The abundance is for the predominant genotype, what makes up the rest of the genotypic abundance? The data in Figure 2 (and Figure S6) helps to get to this point, but perhaps a single selection figure might be more informative.</p><p>3. The authors make the point of the differences in the fitness competency of the I84V and I50V viruses. Were the end viral products of these 2 mutational pathways compared in a head–to–head replication assay in the reported study? This should be addressed.</p><p>4.

This has also been done for Figure S4. Figures 1 (now 2) and S4 are meant to show the endpoint selection and not the intermediate time points so they are otherwise unchanged.</p><p>We have added a second panel to Figure 3 (now Figure 4B) that shows the idealized timeline of mutation addition for each pathway. We have also added a supplemental figure to show a &quot;mutation tree&quot; for one selection that used the I84V pathway and one that used the I50V pathway. We have not done this for all of the selections individually as they sometimes fix multiple mutations at one time making the trees not very informative. We would prefer to keep the terminal culture composition and the pathways as two separate discussions as each is complicated. We have reviewed the text and tried to provide small changes to give the reviewer guidance on these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Discussion and data interpretation.</p><p>(a) The Reviewers are all in agreement that there is more to be said about the accessory variants, how these arise, and how these could contribute to resistance, beyond describing their linkages to the primary mutations. This is key to the paper, but unfortunately, the data are presented in a way that limits comprehension, even by experts. Please determine a more effective way to illustrate (perhaps something similar to an evolutionary tree) and discuss the concepts of key pathways (I84V and I50V), their establishment during selection, and the further addition of and roles of accessory mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have provided a more accessible visual of when the accessory mutations are added in the new Figure 4B. This figure also separates the mutations that are linked to either I50V or I84V as opposed to those that are common. We now note that the linked mutations are close spatially to the primary mutation while the shared mutations are on average more distal.</p><p>We have also added text on this topic based on Dr. Schiffer's published work with several of the sequences identified in these selections (two paragraphs starting at line 689). However, a comprehensive discussion of accessory mutations is a job for a review article. These have been studied using modeling, molecular dynamics, biophysical, biochemical, genetic, and virologic approaches in a myriad of sequence combinations. We agree that understanding accessory mutations is of intrinsic interest in terms of protein function and important in terms of understanding mechanisms of resistance. Our work has clarified the relationship of some of the accessory mutations with the two specific pathways but to go beyond that in a way that would represent a rigorous discussion is beyond the scope of this publication. We appreciate the interest in this subject but we also hope everyone understands the complexity where each accessory protein may work by a different mechanism with common and specific accessory mutations and with larger or smaller effects even when shared between pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Address how insights from this study explain the clinical utility and limitation of DRV.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is now covered in the last paragraph of the text where we discuss issues of drug potency and the potential to trade enhanced potency for lower drug levels that could allow dosing in a depot format to allow a protease inhibitor to be used in a long acting formula.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) Going beyond DRV, discuss design strategies for minimizing drug resistance, including limits on absolute sizes of R1 and R2.</p></disp-quote><p>Our additional analysis, prompted by the instruction not to use &quot;data not shown&quot;, has led to an insight we had not appreciated that addresses this question (issues that Reviewer 3 thoughtfully raised). We did not detect new/unique mutations based on the R2 group. However, we (finally) noticed that two of the R2 groups (2 and 5) both reversed the potency associated with size in the R1 group (R1-1 was more potent than R1-2) and with the R1-1 group co-selected for both primary resistance mutations (I50V and I84V). We initially thought this co-selection was a stochastic feature of the data but now see that it is linked both to the most potent inhibitors and to the reversal of R1 potency providing strong evidence of its significance even if the number of observations is low (N=3). Thus it is not the size that appears to be significant but the anchoring of R2 to the protease backbone which enhances the potency of the intermediate-sized R1-1. These points have now been added as a major conclusion in the paper and we are a bit embarrassed we did not see this connection before the first submission but are grateful to have been prompted to do so before publication. We now see that the intermediate size of R1 (bigger than DRV and smaller than R1-2) is optimal when anchoring R2 to the protease backbone. This seems like a good place to leave the interpretation of our data without further speculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) Address the potential roles of cleavage site mutations in Gag.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added text at the end of the Results covering this topic. There is also a new figure covering both the data and the structural interpretation (Figure 7). This analysis had been done but had been cut from the submitted manuscript to save length.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My comment would be to provide some broader set of rules through which resistance develops, starting with the WT, beyond the 184V vs 150V variants themselves and the pathway switch mediated by modifications at the P1' region, in particular for the accessory mutations. The authors have generated an extensive amount of data from the passaging experiments, using multiple different drugs. Is it possible to devise some conglomerate ordering for resistance onset? Or place the accessory mutations into a broader context? For example, looking at the data in Figure 2, it appears that V82I and M46I somewhat consistently emerge in the initial or mid-stages of the passaging experiments, and they're almost universally present in Figure 1. I47V and M71V, which are also nearly universally present in Figure 1, appear to be more variable in Figure 2, occasionally arising toward the end of the passaging experiment. Are there any other patterns that emerge?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has raised an important point and one we want very much to convey. Since we apparently did not do a good job of that we are thankful to the reviewer for raising this issue. We had designed Figure 3 (now Figure 4A) to show this point since it shows both the timing of appearance and the frequency with which each mutation appears when normalized by drug concentration across the different selections; clearly this was not an effective way to convey this information. We have retained this figure since it represents the interpretation of the primary data but we now reproduce this information in two ways. First, there is now a Figure 4B where we present this same information as a timeline with the mutations shown as sequentially entering with arrows, with the size of the arrow representing the frequency with which this happens among the different selections. Also, the figure is drawn to easily distinguish the common versus the unique mutations in the two pathways. Second, in the new supplemental figure linked to Figure 4 we show a phylogenetic tree following the accumulations of mutations in a culture that followed each pathway. While we don't feel this is the most accessible way to present the data we have included it since this is an analytical approach that is familiar to most readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The authors report an extended analysis of the development of resistance mutations in HIV protease sequence variation during long-term treatment with darunavir. Long–term drug therapy may also select for mutations in cleavage sites in gag/pol where protease cleaves. Have the authors investigated the presence of cleavage site mutations in the gag sequence using single genome amplification (SGA) or the like? Are all of the changes responsible for resistance attributable to changes in protease only?</p></disp-quote><p>We had minimized our data on this point in the initial submission given the length requirements. We now present our data on cleavage sites at the end of the Results (Figure 7). Because we did so many selections we have robust genetic data on this point and are able to link protease mutations to cleavage site mutations with models of structures to interpret the results. In addition, we recently &quot;decoded&quot; the sequence preferences of protease cleavage sites and can also interpret both the wild type and mutant sequences in that context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 1A, the authors use NGS with primer ID to quantify the abundance of drug-resistant variants. These studies are well done and represent the gold standard for measuring levels of different variants. As they show, the highly resistant variants may predominate but other variants are present as well, in some cases seems like these other variants are at substantial levels, and additional discussion of these data would be useful. For instance, in studies of UMASS–2, the most abundant variant is only 37% of the total; this observation seems consistent with the data in figure 2A, where the authors find relatively high Shannon entropy for UMASS-2, reflecting considerable genetic diversity. In contrast, in studies of UMASS-8, where the most abundant variant is also low (only 55.4%), figure 2A shows a relatively low shannon entropy. Were there other closely related variants without DRMS that would explain both the relatively low abundance of resistant variants, but also explain the low entropy levels? Additionally, in these long–term experiments, were there any WT variants present after prolonged drug exposure?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewer delved into the large amount of data associated with these selections to bring out this point. First, we did not detect any wild type sequence at the end of the selections. Second, there is no simple &quot;this is it&quot; answer to questions about all specific details of the selections. Each selection is different with what are probably some stochastic bottlenecks that are carried forward. In terms of the differences in Shannon Entropy that likely resides in the fact that the top two variants in the UMASS-2 selection (starting with wild type) add to only 71% of the population while for the UMASS-8 selection (starting with wild type) the top two variants account for 97% of the population. It is possible that some of the variability at the end could have been further reduced by several more passages at the highest inhibitor concentration. We assume that the presence of several variants at significant levels represent variants with similar fitness and resistance levels such that longer passage in the presence of drug is needed to allow one of the otherwise similar variants to outgrow the other. The minor variants always have the core mutations that define the pathway and differ by minor mutations that are probably present for a variety of reasons. While some of these minor mutations can sometimes also be present as fixed mutations (such as I13V), other mutations may be deleterious such as the R87K mutation within the highly conserved GRN α helix motif; this mutation likely occurs through APOBEC3G mutagenesis and is carried in the population at a very low level but contributes to low level variability. It is difficult to discuss the data at this level within the text so we are happy that an especially interested reader will be able to read about these points in the published review/response format.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Elsewhere, the authors suggest the presence of widespread recombination in these cultures – might recombination also explain some of the variations in Figure 1A? Considering several log decreases in infectivity demonstrated in Figure 1 D, is recombination contributing to ongoing transmission during drug exposure?</p></disp-quote><p>We are unclear as to what the reviewer is asking with this question. We assume recombination is always available to the virus under our culture conditions where all cells are ultimately killed, giving the opportunity for dual infection and packaging of heterodimeric RNA (the precursor to recombination during the subsequent infection). Although we have not measured recombination, we assume it is one of the mechanisms at work in generating genetic diversity on which the drug selective pressure is working.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2A – Regarding the Shannon entropy determinations – were parallel studies done with darunavir? if so, how do those shannon entropy profiles compare with those measured for UMASS compounds and can they be included in the figure?</p></disp-quote><p>The same deep sequencing was done for the DRV selections so the same information on Shannon entropy is available. This information is now included a supplemental figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors have important new insights in their structural studies – can they place boundaries on the absolute sizes of R1 or R2 for future drug design?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment as it caused us to look again at our data with an eye toward &quot;what's next.&quot; However, in doing this we noted that two of the R2 groups reversed the order of potency of the R1 groups and changed the selection pathway to co-select both primary resistance mutations. Thus the anchoring of the R2 group to the protease backbone appears to create an optimal intermediate-sized R1 group. Thus size is not the issue but specific interactions. Since R1-1 and R2-2 appear to interact in an unexpected way it is hard to speculate on how to further improve this outcome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Previously these authors have provided useful models of genetic variation in vitro (Boucher et al., 2019), including estimating selection coefficients. Can the authors discuss their new data in light of these modeling studies and identify selection coefficients for these variants?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer challenging us to think more broadly about this question. However, in trying to think through this specific example it seems problematic. In Boucher et al., the metric of fitness was always relative to wild type. In our studies we are continuously changing target fitness sequence with increasing drug concentration. Furthermore, it is likely that we could passage virus forever at 100 nM drug concentration and the virus would settle in a pattern of sequence changes that would be different (i.e. fewer mutations) than present in virus taken to 1 uM. We capture the root of this idea in a qualitative way in the new Figure 4B but the approach that we used in virus passage and the variable way we raised drug concentrations in the many different cultures precludes a meaningful mathematical analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Do the data from these studies provide insight to explain the clinical utility and limitations of Darunavir as an initial or simplification therapy? For instance:</p><p>a) the two–drug combination of Darunavir and Raltegravir is highly effective in suppressing HIV, but this combination is not recommended in individuals with HIV viral loads exceeding 100,000 copies/ml plasma, because of the increased risk for the development of resistance.</p><p>b) individuals with baseline protease resistance simplifying their regimens to darunavir+raltegravir did not result in increased frequency of protease resistance (Vizcarra et al., 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>Our work does not speak directly to these points. There has long been an unexplained relationship between reduced drug efficacy and high viral load. It seems likely that this has to do with the population size of the virus in a person, with the larger populations having a higher probability of generating resistance. Therapy failure without resistance is a complex issue. Often this is the result of poor adherence. However, resistance to one of the drugs in a regimen may allow breakthrough replication in the face of the other drug without resistance (at least initially). Our poor understanding of these issues is an obstacle in interpreting data from drug simplification clinical studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Can you clarify the tinting in Figure S2?</p><p>As written:</p><p>&quot;UMASS<sup>-1</sup>, -3, -6, -8 show less potency towards these variants and is shaded in a red tint matching R2 groups.

The red tinted data points/inhibitors behave differently from the green tinted ones.

Comments are discussed below.</p><p>1. Perhaps it was just me, but I found that figure layout and organization difficult to get the necessary take–home points. In table 1, it might be helpful for the reader to have viral EC50s for the initial mutations, as shown, and the endstage predominates viral populations as well. I am aware that in some cases the final population is a viral mixture of two genotypes and this should be noted.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the endpoint EC50s to Table 1 for those virus pools where it was tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Given that a major focus of the report is mutational selections starting from wildtype from DRV and UMASS compound series to the ending of the selection. The information for the viral mutations arising over time and their respective abundance over time ( = increased drug conc.) is scattered (Figure 1, Sup Figure 4) throughout the Figures. Readers might appreciate a timeline figure documenting when the first mutations arose and their genotypic abundance over time. The primer ID strategy should allow relative quantification of sequences. This is brought up to give the interesting mutational, and somewhat distinct, population pathways in some of the compound selections. Getting at the question of the history of the mutational series is informative. Perhaps a mutational tree?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above we have now presented this information in two ways:</p><p>As an idealized selection timeline in Figure 3b (which we feel is more accessible) and as a &quot;mutational tree&quot; in a supplemental figure for a typical selection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 In the case when both I84V and I50V mutational series are present for (say UMASS–2) do the mutational series occur at the same time? The abundance is for the predominant genotype, what makes up the rest of the genotypic abundance? The data in Figure 2 (and Figure S6) helps to get to this point, but perhaps a single selection figure might be more informative.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer gets at an interesting point although the sample size for making conclusions is getting too small to speak with a lot of confidence. In the entropy figure (now Figure 3) it appears there are two answers to this question. When we started the culture with many mutants then I84V/V32I come in early and I50V comes in late (UMASS-2). However, when we start with wild type then I84V and I50V come in first together with I47V coming in before V32I, suggesting the I50V is driving the selection for the linked mutation (UMASS-2 and -5). While this is an interesting nuance in the data (and it is present for someone patient enough to go look for it), we feel it is based on too few selections to be able to make a strong conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors make the point of the differences in the fitness competency of the I84V and I50V viruses. Were the end viral products of these 2 mutational pathways compared in a head–to–head replication assay in the reported study? This should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not done a head-to-head comparison. As noted, we have virus pools, not clones. While these pools are sufficient for getting an EC50 in short term replication, assessing fitness requires multiple rounds of replication and should be done with a clone. Realistically, this is another study to tear apart these pathways for the effect of individual mutations and differences in the pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors discuss the potential importance of accessory mutations in the I84V and I50V mutational pathway series. Perhaps I missed it, did the authors directly address the contributions of the accessory mutations to resistance, enzymatic function, and improved replication? This should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have noted that to the extent there are mutations that are just present for &quot;fitness&quot; they do not restore fitness but rather attenuate the loss of fitness due to resistance (as seen in now Figure 2E). There is a large body of literature on accessory/compensatory mutations, not all of which is consistent and that has been generated using a number of not easily compared experimental approaches. As shown in Figure 4B we can now start to order their appearance and linkage. Dr. Schiffer has started to look at these mutations in biochemical, structural, and molecular dynamics studies and we now more clearly reference that work. However, it is beyond the scope of this study to add further clarity into the roles of these extra mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors point out that given the reported viral fitness loss with the I50V mutation, vs I84V mutation, mutational selection should be skewed towards I50V. Based on the authors' findings UMASS compounds 3, 6–10 appear to favor I50V mutation over I84V, and the I50V accessory series selection. Yet, UMASS 2, 5, 7, and 10 appear the most potent (Table 1 and Figure S2) with resistant viruses. (1). How efficient are the accessory mutations in the I50V mutation series in restoring replication? UMASS compounds 2 and 5 have both I50V and I84V (and accessory mutations) populations, yet the compounds remain potent. Please discuss in the context of next–generation inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly identifies a feature of our data we had not adequately considered. We have added extensive discussion of this point as we believe UMASS-2 and -5 are more potent due to their R2 group and even reversing the size advantage of R1-2 over R1-1.
