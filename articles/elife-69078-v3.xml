In this study, we characterized the cardiac and circulatory lipid profiles in late gestation E18.5 fetuses of diet-induced obese pregnant mice and established the changes in lipid abundance and fetal cardiac transcriptomics. We used untargeted and targeted lipidomics and transcriptomics to define changes in the serum and cardiac lipid composition and fatty acid metabolism in male and female fetuses. From these analyses we observed: (1) maternal obesity affects the maternal and fetal serum lipidome distinctly; (2) female fetal heart lipidomes are more sensitive to maternal obesity than males; (3) changes in lipid supply might contribute to early expression of lipolytic genes in mouse hearts exposed to maternal obesity. These results highlight the existence of sexually dimorphic responses of the fetal heart to the same in utero obesogenic environment and identify lipids species that might mediate programming of cardiovascular health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>maternal obesity</kwd><kwd>fetal heart</kwd><kwd>heart metabolism</kwd><kwd>lipidomics</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG/17/12/33167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ozanne</surname><given-names>Susan E</given-names></name><name><surname>Fernandez-Twinn</surname><given-names>Denise S</given-names></name><name><surname>Pantaleão</surname><given-names>Lucas C</given-names></name><name><surname>Blackmore</surname><given-names>Heather L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ashmore</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC_MC_UU_00014/4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ozanne</surname><given-names>Susan E</given-names></name><name><surname>Fernandez-Twinn</surname><given-names>Denise S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>208363/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ozanne</surname><given-names>Susan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS/12/64/30001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loche</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS/18/56/35177</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inzani</surname><given-names>Isabella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M027252/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furse</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Koulman</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name><name><surname>Jenkins</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Maternal obesity alters the fetal cardiac and serum lipidome, promoting early fetal cardiac metabolic maturation, with evidence that the female heart lipidome is more responsive to an in utero obesogenic environment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian heart development and maturation involve a complex array of processes that are only completed postnatally, when increased systemic demands and changes in substrate and oxygen availability promote major cardiac remodelling (Reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Piquereau and Ventura-Clapier, 2018</xref>). Appropriate and regulated flow of hormones, nutrients, metabolites and absorbed gases into fetal tissues is required to ensure that intrauterine development is achieved in an appropriate time-sensitive manner. Therefore, adverse gestational conditions – such as maternal obesity – can disrupt maternal/fetal molecule interchange, leading to impaired fetal development, which can have long-term impacts on cardio-metabolic health postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zambrano and Nathanielsz, 2013</xref>). Such a causal link between maternal metabolic status and lifelong offspring health and disease is encompassed in what has been termed the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Maternal obesity during gestation is one condition that has been shown to raise the risk of non-communicable diseases in the expectant mother and her children. Numerous studies in humans and animal models suggest that obesity during pregnancy has immediate and long-term detrimental effects including increased risk of congenital heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helle and Priest, 2020</xref>), and increased susceptibility of the offspring to cardiometabolic abnormalities postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guénard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loche et al., 2018</xref>). This is of particular importance, as recent data indicates that around 50% of pregnant women in developed countries are currently either overweight or obese, and cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">NMPA Project Team, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">GBD 2017 Causes of Death Collaborators, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Mild hypoxia, high maternal insulin and leptin levels, as well as changes in nutrient and metabolite availability have been implicated as causal factors, mediating the effects of maternal obesity on the fetus and its long-term health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Howell and Powell, 2017</xref>). However, there is limited data in relation to the molecular consequences of such exposure on the fetal heart. Although a small number of studies have provided some evidence that maternal obesity affects the fetal cardiac transcriptome and protein profile, these studies do not explain the whole complexity of changes in the cardiac phenotype. In addition, there is very limited data on the contribution of the maternal and fetal lipidome to programming mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catalano and Shankar, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Lipids are a complex group of structural, energy and signaling molecules involved in a variety of physiological, metabolic, and pathological processes. Changes in the murine heart lipidome have been shown to initiate and promote inflammatory reactions after infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halade et al., 2018</xref>), and cellular lipid composition has been associated with the distinction between physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy and with prognosis of cardiac disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, recent studies explored the association of the cardiac lipidome with life stage progression, showing how changes in intracellular lipids contribute to heart maturation at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Walejko et al., 2018</xref>) and the impact of ageing on the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eum et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Despite the growing interest in lipid profiling in health and disease, the study of fetal cardiac lipids in the context of maternal obesity models remains largely unexplored. The aim of the current study was therefore to use lipidomics and cardiac transcriptomics to identify lipid pathways that may be associated with developmental phenotypes that lead to chronic diseases later in life. In addition, given the growing evidence for sex-specific differences in the programming field, a further aim was to establish if any of the responses were sexually dimorphic. As circulating lipids are often used as biomarkers of cardiovascular health, we also sought to investigate associations between maternal and fetal serum lipidomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Maternal obesity affects mouse offspring heart morphology</title><p>A well-established diet-induced maternal obesity model in which the female mouse develops obesity and gestational diabetes was used to investigate the effects of maternal obesity on the offspring heart.

We report for the first time unique patterns in the lipidome of the fetal heart as a consequence of maternal obesity which, despite exposure to the same in utero environment and similar serum lipid profiles, differed between male and female fetuses and occurred in the absence of sexually dimorphic changes in cardiac structure. The findings were consistent with changes in substrate availability that may affect fetal cardiac gene expression which is known to change in late gestation in preparation for birth.</p><p>Using direct infusion lipidomics, we observed unique responses to a maternal obesogenic diet between dams and offspring. This is consistent with the suggestion that the mouse placenta selectively transports lipids to the fetus, adjusting placental transfer to changes in maternal status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miranda et al., 2018</xref>). In this process, maternal lipoproteins are hydrolysed at the placenta and non-esterified fatty acids are released into the fetal circulation bound to alpha-fetoproteins. Fatty acids are then taken up by the fetal liver and incorporated into lipoproteins, which are released into the fetal circulation (Reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herrera and Desoye, 2016</xref>). Thus, a combination of selective fatty acid transport by the placenta and differences in fetal metabolism can explain the difference between maternal and fetal serum lipid profiles in obese pregnancies.</p><p>The analysis of both male and female fetal hearts and serum is a major novelty and strength of this study, allowing for investigation of any sex-specific differences in response to maternal obesity. There is growing evidence to suggest that there are sex-specific differences in response to a suboptimal in utero environment or at least in the timing of the development of the phenotype, with the male fetus being generally more vulnerable to the long-term detrimental consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nicholas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dearden et al., 2018</xref>). In the current study, a greater number of significant differences between control and obese cardiac lipidomes were observed in female fetuses than were seen in males. This difference between the sexes is particularly striking, given that fetuses of both sexes are exposed to the same maternal metabolic milieu. It is not clear if these sexually dimorphic responses early in life could represent an ability of females to adapt to the environment and to protect against longer term detrimental effects. Furthermore, although several individual lipid species displayed sex-dependent regulation, a similar overall impact of maternal obesity was observed in the serum lipidomes of both male and female offspring. Therefore, there were tissue specific effects of maternal obesity on the fetal serum and cardiac lipidomes. In the serum, triglycerides were more abundant, and several phosphatidylcholines/odd chain phosphatidylethanolamines were less abundant as a consequence of maternal obesity.</p><p>The observed increase in fetal serum triglyceride and decrease in phosphatidylcholine/odd chain phosphatidylethanolamines abundances is suggestive of a change in lipoprotein composition. Previous studies showed that hyperlipidaemic human serum samples have a differential increase in the concentration of lipid species, with triglycerides increasing several fold, whereas phosphatidylcholine only increased modestly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuklenyik et al., 2018</xref>). Although lipoprotein monolayers consist primarily of phosphatidylcholines enclosing a hydrophobic core containing triglycerides and cholesterol (Reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van der Veen et al., 2017</xref>), we do not necessarily expect a positive correlation between these two lipid classes. Lipoproteins are not always spherical and thus the relationship between particle surface area and volume is not uniform. Furthermore, high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) comprise mainly phosphatidylcholines and very little triglyceride and, as the primary lipoprotein particles produced by the fetal liver are HDLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herrera and Desoye, 2016</xref>), a decrease in phosphatidylcholines without a corresponding decrease in triglyceride abundance may indicate a relative decrease in fetal HDL levels. A relative increase in triglyceride abundance in the absence of a relative increase in phosphatidylcholine may also indicate an increase in lipoprotein particle size with a smaller surface/core volume ratio in obese offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuklenyik et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of the precise mechanisms involved, the fetal serum signature indicates that maternal obesity causes deep changes to the lipids in the circulation of fetuses and thus those available to be taken up by fetal tissues. We observed that DPA – a 22:5 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid – from phospholipids was consistently lower in obese dams and in the serum and cardiac tissues of fetuses of both sexes. DPA is highly abundant in fish oils but can also be synthesised endogenously through eicosapentaenoic acid and arachidonic acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burdge et al., 2002</xref>). Lower serum levels of this fatty acid have recently been associated with increased markers of insulin resistance and with increased cardiovascular risk in pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). However, as far as we are aware, a direct relationship between this fatty acid and fetal health has not yet been drawn, and we believe we are the first to identify a relative reduction of phospholipid-derived DPA levels in multiple fetal compartments. Moreover, similar changes in serum and cardiac fatty acid composition of lipids might also indicate that the fetal myocardium exposed to maternal-obesity-induced stress maintains its ability to uptake circulating fatty acids.</p><p>We observed changes in the fetal cardiac transcriptome that were induced by maternal obesity, including changes in regulation of genes associated with sterol, fatty acid and carnitine metabolism, that would indicate an early shift towards fatty acid oxidation. The fetal heart relies predominantly on glycolytic metabolism, however, at birth there is a switch to lipid oxidative metabolism. Increasing oxygen levels and high lipid availability in the maternal milk both play a crucial role in activating pathways that will ultimately lead to metabolic, physiological, and morphological changes, resulting in postnatal heart maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Piquereau and Ventura-Clapier, 2018</xref>). This has been recently revisited in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sim et al., 2021</xref>, which reported that cardiomyocyte maturation in humans is accompanied by cell specific changes in the transcriptome that are marked by the activation of oxidative metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and respiratory electron transport chain in a sex-independent fashion.</p><p>A limitation of the current study was that we investigated the cardiac transcriptome in males only (though confirming differences in the regulation of key lipid metabolism genes also identified in the males in the females). We will therefore have missed any differences that were only present in females. Although sex differences in fetal cardiomyocytes transcriptomes exist, previous reports suggest most of the sexual dimorphism observed in transcriptional networks are identified later postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sim et al., 2021</xref>). In the context of nutritional programming of cardiac function, it has been established that maternal obesity causes profound changes in the adult male cardiac transcriptome, associated with activated inflammatory and fibrotic networks and decreased muscle contraction and insulin response pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2021</xref>). However, data related to the female cardiac transcriptome was not reported in this study. These results highlight the importance of future research studying potential sexually dimorphic transcriptional changes caused by maternal obesity later in the adult heart transcriptome.</p><p>Our current observations suggest that fatty acid availability drives a premature switch in metabolism from glucose to fatty acid oxidation in the fetal heart through PPAR-alpha activation by ligands, such as docosahexaenoic acid (22:6). This indicates early metabolic, though not morphological, cardiomyocyte maturation due to a change in the availability of nutrients to fetal tissues from obese pregnancies, which could have a long-term impact on cardiac function. Changes in lipid metabolism appear to be a common consequence of exposure to an in utero obesogenic environment in different tissues, with transcriptomic analysis of livers from late gestation fetal baboons showing that maternal obesity results in altered fetal liver metabolism and lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Puppala et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that maternal obesity results in placental hypoxia and a reduction in the availability of oxygen to other fetal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wallace et al., 2019</xref>). Consistently, we previously observed increased HIF1A protein in the obese placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fernandez-Twinn et al., 2017</xref>), indicating lower oxygen diffusion to the fetal tissues which would be expected to impair fatty acid oxidation. Indeed, despite the increased expression of <italic>Cpt</italic> genes, we observed cardiac accumulation of total hydroxy acyl-carnitine, an intermediate of beta-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ventura et al., 1998</xref>). CPT proteins are required for fatty acid mitochondrial import and oxidation through addition and removal of carnitine from acyl groups, allowing their transport through the intermembrane space. Accumulation of total hydroxy acyl-carnitine is also observed in diabetic hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Su et al., 2005</xref>), and may indicate impaired mitochondrial capacity to completely metabolise the surplus of fatty-acids in the matrix. Therefore, the expression of lipolytic genes alone may not be sufficient to compensate for the surplus in fatty acids and to increase the energy production and contractile potential of the fetal heart in a hypoxic environment. This may contribute to the reduced ventricular volume, as observed in the fetal hearts from obese mothers. Nevertheless, further studies are required to define the fatty acid oxidation rates and energy balance in the fetal heart.</p><p>In conclusion, we have carried out a comprehensive study of how obesity during pregnancy influences lipid availability to the fetus and consequently affects the fetal heart lipidome. From our findings, three main principles emerge: (1) There is a discrepancy between how the maternal metabolic status affects the maternal and fetal serum lipidome, an outcome likely related both to the placental actions as a selective barrier and to changes in fetal metabolism; (2) Despite being exposed to the same maternal metabolic milieu, male and female fetal hearts show distinct responses to maternal obesity, mainly at the level of fatty acid residues and individual lipid isoforms. Female heart lipidomes were generally more sensitive and exhibited greater changes than males; (3) Changes in lipid supply resulting from maternal obesity might contribute to early expression of lipolytic genes in mouse hearts, possibly contributing to the previously observed changes in heart function in adult life. The precise mechanisms by which these alterations impact on long term cardiovascular health across the life course remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Briefly, frozen whole fetal hearts were homogenised in a stock solution of guanidine and thiourea (6 M/1·5 M; 20× <italic>w/v</italic>) using mechanical agitation. The dispersions were freeze-thawed once before being centrifuged (12,000× <italic>g</italic>, 10 min). The supernatant was collected and frozen (–80 °C) immediately. The thawed dispersion (60 µL) and serum aliquots (20 µL) were injected into wells (96 w plate, Esslab Plate+, 2·4 mL/well, glass-coated) followed by internal standards (150 µL, mixture of Internal Standards in methanol), water (500 µL) and DMT (500 µL, dichloromethane, methanol and triethylammonium chloride, 3:1:0·005). The mixture was agitated (96-channel pipette) before being centrifuged (3·2× g, 2 min). A portion of the organic solution (20 µL) was transferred to an analytical plate (96 w, glass coated, Esslab Plate+) before being dried under Nitrogen gas. The dried films were re-dissolved (TBME, 30 µL/well) and diluted with a stock mixture of alcohols and ammonium acetate (100 µL/well; propan-2-ol: methanol, 2:1; CH3COO.NH4, 7·5 mM). The analytical plate was heat-sealed and run immediately.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Untargeted lipidomics – direct infusion mass spectrometry</title><p>Samples were directly infused into an Exactive Orbitrap (Thermo, Hemel Hampstead, UK), using a TriVersa NanoMate (Advion, Ithaca, US) for Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harshfield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Furse et al., 2020</xref>). A three-part analytical method was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Furse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Furse and Koulman, 2019</xref>) in which samples were ionised in positive, negative, and then negative-with collision-induced-ionisation modes. The NanoMate infusion mandrel was used to pierce the seal of each well before an aliquot of the solution (15 μL) was collected with an air gap (1·5 μL). The tip was pressed against a fresh nozzle and the sample was dispensed using 0·2 psi (N<sub>2 (g)</sub>). Ionisation was achieved at a 1·2 kV. The Exactive was set to start acquiring data 20 s after sample aspiration began. The data were collected with a scan rate of 1 Hz (resulting in a mass resolution of 65,000 full width at half-maximum (fwhm) at 400 <italic>m/z</italic>). After 72 s of acquisition in positive mode the NanoMate and the Exactive switched to negative mode, decreasing the voltage to −1·5 kV. The spray was maintained for another 66 s, after which Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID) commenced, with a mass window of 50–1000 Da, and was stopped after another 66 s. The analysis was then stopped, and the tip discarded before the analysis of the next sample began. The sample plate was kept at 10 °C throughout the data acquisition. Samples were run in row order.</p><p>Raw high-resolution mass-spectrometry data were processed using XCMS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioconductor.org">https://www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>) and Peakpicker v 2.0 (an in-house R script, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harshfield et al., 2019</xref>). Theoretical lists of known species (by m/z) were used for both positive ion and negative ion mode (~8·5 k species including different adducts and fragmentations). Variables whose mass deviated by more than nine ppm from the expected value, had a signal-to-noise ratio of &lt;3 and had signals for fewer than 20% of samples were discarded. The correlation of signal intensity to concentration of lipid variables found in pooled mouse heart homogenate, pooled mouse liver homogenate, and pooled human serum samples (0·25, 0·5, 1·0×) was used to identify the lipid signals the strength of which was linearly proportional to abundance (<italic>r</italic> &gt; 0·75) in samples.</p><p>For the detection of fatty acids of phospholipids only, a deviations threshold of 12·5ppm was used for processing of the negative mode with CID, on a list of fatty acids of chain length 14–36 with up to six double bonds and/or one hydroxyl group. All signals greater than noise were carried forward. In this method the lipidome is not separated chromatographically but measured only by mass-to-charge ratio and therefore cannot distinguish lipids that are isobaric (identical molecular mass) in a given ionisation mode. In this study, the identification of the lipids was based on their accurate mass in positive ionisation mode according to Lipid Maps structure database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sud et al., 2007</xref>). In case of multiple isobars per lipid signal, the likely identification was predicted according to the biological likelihood, full list of possible annotations can be found in the supplementary information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>). Signals consistent with fatty acids were found in 3/3 samples checked manually. Relative abundance was calculated by dividing each signal by the sum of signals for that sample, expressed per mille (‰). Zero values were interpreted as not measured and for the remaining non-assigned values, we used a known single component projection based on nonlinear iterative partial least squares algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nelson et al., 1996</xref>) to impute values and populate the dataset. Data was normalised using quantile Cyclic Loess method and statistical calculations were done on these finalised values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Acyl-carnitine analysis – preparation of samples</title><p>All solvents and additives were of HPLC grade or higher and purchased from Sigma Aldrich unless otherwise stated.</p><p>The protein precipitation liquid extraction protocol was as follows: the tissue samples were weighed (between 1.4–11.0 mg) and transferred into a 2 mL screw cap Eppendorf plastic tubes (Eppendorf, Stevenage, UK) along with a single 5 mm stainless steel ball bearing. Immediately, 400 µL of chloroform and methanol (2:1, respectively) solution was added to each sample, followed by thorough mixing. The samples were then homogenised in the chloroform and methanol (2:1, respectively) using a Bioprep 24–1004 homogenizer (Allsheng, Hangzhou City, China) run at speed; 4.5 m/s, time; 30 seconds for two cycles. Then, 400 µL of chloroform, 100 µL of methanol, and 100 µL of the stable isotope labelled acyl-carnitine internal standard; containing butyryl-d7-L-carnitine (order number: D-7761, QMX Laboratories Ltd. (QMX Laboratories Ltd, Essex, United Kingdom)) and hexadecanoylLcarnitine-d3 (order number: D-6646, QMX Laboratories Ltd.) at 5 µM in methanol was added to each sample. The samples were homogenised again using a Bioprep 24–1004 homogenizer run at speed; 4.5 m/s, time; 30 seconds for two cycles. To ensure fibrous material was diminished, the samples were sonicated for 30 minutes in a water bath sonicator at room temperature (Advantage-Lab, Menen, Belgium). Then, 400 µL of acetone was added to each sample. The samples were thoroughly mixed and centrifuged for 10 minutes at ~20,000 g to pellet any insoluble material at the bottom of the vial. The single-layer supernatant was pipetted into separate 2-mL screw cap amber-glass autosampler vials (Agilent Technologies, Cheadle, United Kingdom); being careful not to break up the solid pellet at the bottom of the tube. The organic extracts (chloroform, methanol, acetone composition; ~ 7:3:4, ~ 1.4 mL) were dried down to dryness using a Concentrator Plus system (Eppendorf, Stevenage, UK) run for 60 min at 60°C. The samples were reconstituted in 100 µL of water and acetonitrile (95:5, respectively) then thoroughly mixed. The reconstituted sample was transferred into a 250 μL low-volume vial insert inside a 2-mL amber glass auto-sample vial ready for liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS) analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Acyl-carnitine analysis – liquid chromatography mass spectrometry</title><p>Full chromatographic separation of acyl-carnitines was achieved using Shimadzu HPLC System (Shimadzu UK Ltd., Milton Keynes, United Kingdom) with the injection of 10 µL onto a Hichrom ACE Excel 2 C18-PFP column (Hichrom Ltd., Berkshire, United Kingdom); 2.0 µm, I.D. 2.1 mm X 150 mm, maintained at 55 °C. Mobile phase A was water with 0.1% formic acid. Mobile phase B was acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The flow was maintained at 500 µL/min through the following gradient: 0 minutes_5% mobile phase B, at 0.5 minutes_100% mobile phase B, at 5.5 minutes_100% mobile phase B, at 5.51 minutes_5% mobiles phase B, at 7 minutes_5% mobile phase B. The sample injection needle was washed using acetonitrile and water mix (1:1, respectively). The mass spectrometer used was the Thermo Scientific Exactive Orbitrap with a heated electrospray ionisation source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK). The mass spectrometer was calibrated immediately before sample analysis using positive and negative ionisation calibration solution (recommended by Thermo Scientific). Additionally, the heated electrospray ionisation source was optimised to ensure the best sensitivity and spray stability capillary temperature; 300°C, source heater temperature; 420°C, sheath gas flow; 40 (arbitrary), auxiliary gas flow; 15 (arbitrary), spare gas; 3 (arbitrary), source voltage; 4 kV. The mass spectrometer scan rate set at 2 Hz, giving a resolution of 50,000 (at 200 m/z) with a full-scan range of m/z 150–800 in positive mode.</p><p>Thermo Xcalibur Quan Browser data processing involved the integration of the internal standard extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) peaks at the expected retention times: butyryl-d7-L-carnitine ([M + H]+, m/z 239.19827 at 1.20 min) and hexadecanoyl-L-carnitine-d3 ([M + H]+, m/z 403.36097 at 4.20 min). The data processing also involved the integration of the targeted individual acyl-carnitine species (m/z was [M + H]+) at their expected retention time allowing for a maximum of ±0.1 min of retention time drift: any retention time drift greater than ±0.1 min resulted in the exclusion of the analyte leading to a ‘Not Found’ result (i.e. zero concentration). Through the Thermo Xcalibur Quan Browser software the responses of the analytes were normalised to the relevant internal standard response (producing area ratios), these area ratios corrected the intensity for any extraction and instrument variations. The area ratios were then blank corrected where intensities less than three times the blank samples were set to a ‘Not Found’ result (i.e. zero concentration). The accepted area ratios were then multiplied by the concentration of the internal standard (5 µM) to give the analyte concentrations. For tissue samples, the calculated concentrations (µM) of the analytes were then divided by the amount of tissue (in mg) used in the extraction protocol to give the final results in µM per mg of tissue extracted (µM/mg).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Fatty acid oxidation assay</title><p>A fatty acid oxidation assay was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huynh et al., 2014</xref>.

We then concluded that a sample size greater than six would be necessary to show any significant changes in our study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Biometric markers, fatty acid oxidation, and qPCR – statistical analysis</title><p>Details of statistical analysis (statistical tests used, number of animals, identification of outliers and precision measures) can be found in the figure legends and in the figure source data. Simple Student t-test was employed to identify statistically significant differences in biometric, stereological, fatty acid oxidation and qPCR analyses, comparing control and obese groups in a sex-dependent manner. Cell size statistical analysis was conducted using linear mixed-effects model followed by Tukey’s <italic>post-hoc</italic> test. Factorial ANOVA was employed to test offspring sex and maternal status influence on individual mRNA levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>RNASeq – statistical analysis</title><p>Reads per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (RPKM) were produced from RNA Sequencing raw output and statistically analysed through likelihood ratio test using edgeR version 3.36.0. Core analysis in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis application (IPA – Qiagen) was used in data interpretation and pathway enrichment. A p-value cut-off of 0.01 was used to determine genes to be mapped to IPA networks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Untargeted and targeted lipidomics – statistical analysis</title><p>Uni- and multivariate statistical models were created using R version 3.6.3. Multiple Shapiro-Wilk tests were carried out to identify if individual variables were normally distributed. Multiple t-tests were used to identify significant regulation of individual lipid species, and multiple t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests were used to identify individual lipid classes differences between groups when individual variables were normally or non-normally distributed. A multivariate partial-least square discriminatory analysis (PLS-DA) was also employed to identify Variable Importance in the Projection (VIP) and determine individual lipids that maximise the model classification ability. For individual lipid species, variables were deemed significantly regulated and relevant when p-value &lt; 0.05 and vip score &gt;1. Individual lipid classes, acyl-carnitines and fatty acids were significantly regulated when p&lt; 0.05. Factorial ANOVA was also used to test offspring sex and maternal status influence over individual lipid classes, and pools of fatty acids and acyl-carnitines. Prior to statistical analysis, outlier samples were identified through a combination of frequency distribution analysis, lipid classes frequency investigation, PCA and hierarchical clustering analysis. Samples with lower than 66.7% of lipid signals detected or deemed as outliers in all the aforementioned analyses failed the quality control for mass spectrometry and were excluded from the datasets and from further statistical tests. Lipid ontology enrichment analysis was carried out using LION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Molenaar et al., 2019</xref>). Lipid traffic analysis was conducted following previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Furse et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This research was regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations 2012 following ethical review by the University of Cambridge Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB).

This reviewer understands why these five were chosen but the reader would obviously like to know if there were or were not changes in other gene pathways such as glucocorticoid steroidogenesis, for example, in light of the fact that the authors state that cardiac cell maturation may have been accelerated. These studies are very difficult to conduct so the maximum available relevant information to the model should be provided. I suggest that a table of all the significantly affected gene pathways be included. Providing this information would give the paper more reference value for other investigators in relation to fetal programming by maternal obesity. For example knowing whether there were or were not changes in mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation is very important in relation to maternal obesity and the development of the heart. Another example is the proteasome which affects cardiac function and longevity. Changes in the liver transcriptome have been published in the fetuses of obese baboons at a very equivalent stage of gestation In this paper all significantly affected pathways were listed PMID: 29516496. A cross reference would be useful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69078.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1.

We agree that the observation of implied smaller cardiomyocytes was based on results from an indirect assessment so in the revised version of the manuscript we have added new data generated by direct assessment of cell size. We collected fresh fetal (E18.5) hearts and isolated and stained cardiomyocytes using a cardiomyocyte marker and DAPI (nuclear marker). We then used High Content Microscopy (HCM) to quantify individual cell area and number of nuclei per cell (methods section lines 422-439). We found no differences in cell size between groups (Figure 1I of the revised manuscript). A representative image of the HCM analysis is also included in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. To assess potential changes in cell proliferation on gestational day 18.5, we analysed nuclear PCNA levels in mid-cardiac sections using immunohistochemistry (methods section lines 441-453). We observed no changes in nuclear PCNA levels in the heart of obese offspring (Figure 1J). To further explore if maternal obesity causes morphological changes in the fetal heart, we have performed stereological analysis of the cardiac ventricular wall volumes of 18.5-day fetuses (methods section lines 455-466). We found a significant reduction in the absolute left ventricle wall volume in both males and females (Figure 1E), of a similar magnitude to the reduction in body weight, hence left ventricle wall volumes relative to body weight were unchanged (Figure 1G, 1H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2—figure supplement 1.

As suggested by the referee we have generated a unified PCA plot with the orthogonal linear transformation of both male and female data. No differences in male and female serum were identified. In both components PC1 and PC2, the separation between fetuses from control and obese dams is clearer (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2.

We have now run statistical analysis using the merged male and female data (new Figure 2B), which increased the statistical power in the analysis of lipid classes. This reveals upregulation of the PG and PA lipid classes in the serum of fetuses from obese dams (Figure 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors state that &quot;Although ceramides were more abundant at the class level in obese dam serum, no ceramide isoform was statistically significantly different between groups (Figure 2E, 2F).&quot; This is not clear, e.g., are changes at the individual level small in magnitude?

We apologise for any confusion that may have arisen from the abbreviations used. Our figures use the abbreviation CE to refer to cholesteryl esters (not ceramides). We have now defined CE and Cer in the figure legends for increased clarity. We observed individual changes in cholesterol esters, as shown in Figure 2 and mentioned in the text (lines 117-119), including CE 18:2 and 22:6. In contrast we do not see any differences in individual ceramide isoform levels in the maternal serum (as shown in Figure 2D in the manuscript), abbreviated to Cer in figures.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have performed a Fisher's exact test to address directionality of regulation of individual ceramides in the blood of obese dams.

This apparent discrepancy should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment and are happy to clarify. The previous figures showed the regulation of the lipids in the cardiac tissue of fetuses from obese pregnancies using a logarithmic scale, which made it difficult to visualise the sex differences. We’ve now transformed this data back to a linear scale to make the differences more visible. A further point to note is that the lipids shown in figure 3 - figure supplement 1 were the most abundant esterified lipids identified by direct infusion mass spectrometry in the fetal hearts. Therefore, even small changes in their expression represent a large change in the cardiac lipid balance. The revised presentation of the figures now hopefully highlights that in females, 9 out of the 16 species selected were more strongly downregulated (PC O−32:0 and PE O−35:0, PC 32:1 and PE 35:1, PC 34:1 and PE 37:1 and PE 36:4 and PC 33:4) or upregulated (PC 38:4 and PE 41:4, PC 38:6 and PE 41:6, PC 40:6 and PE 43:6, PE 38:6 and PC 35:6 and SM 34:1;O2); and that the regulation of one lipid species (PC 30:0 and PE 33:0) was stronger in males.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 5. More information about the overall results of the RNAseq should be provided.

We have added a volcano plot to Figure 5A which graphically shows that 785 genes were regulated in the hearts of the obese offspring with a p&lt;0.05. We have also updated the Results section and included a table containing statistical analysis data, based on multiple generalized linear models with quasi-likelihood tests (Figure 5–source data 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The reason for analyzing male fetal hearts is not clear given that levels of several individual lipid species were more strongly affected in female hearts.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment, and we agree that RNAseq data from the female hearts would be informative. Unfortunately, the RNASeq analysis was performed in parallel with the lipidomic analysis, so we did not know the results of the lipidomic analysis when we carried out the RNAseq. We only had capacity to run the RNAseq analysis on one sex with validations carried out in both sexes. We made the decision to use male hearts based on previous literature which suggests greater programming effects are observed in male offspring compared to females. We have indicated in the discussion that this is a limitation of the current study (lines 324-327).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors confirm deregulation of key metabolic regulators in hearts. Showing corresponding changes in protein levels would help raising potential functional involvement.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We agree that identifying changes in proteins is a step closer to a functional readout (though again not perfect). Our approach to carry out a pathway analysis of RNASeq data allowed us to identify pathway deregulation as a cumulative effect of small changes across a large number of genes. It is unfortunately not possible to adopt the same approach at the protein level given the limited size of the fetal heart (a fetal mouse heart only weights approximately 5-7 mg) combined with the reduced sensitivity and semi-quantitative nature of western blotting. We attempted to carry out western blotting analysis of PPARA (one of the key metabolic regulators identified). Unfortunately, despite trialling and attempting to optimise the use of several different antibodies against PPARA from different suppliers, none were of sufficient quality to enable us to carry out any form of quantitative blotting analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Regarding the RNAseq analysis, it would be interesting to place the results presented within the context of recently published analyses of global gene expression in male and female hearts, and in response to obesity during pregnancy.

It is noteworthy that Sim <italic>et al.</italic>, suggest that expression and increased activity of sex hormone receptors mediate maturation in human cardiomyocytes, but not in mice. The authors report that androgen receptor mRNA is barely detectable, and that progesterone receptor is undetectable in mouse cardiomyocytes, and that in <italic>Pgr</italic> KO mice cardiomyocyte development is not affected.</p><p>We agree that the analysis of cardiomyocyte lipid metabolism would contribute to the establishment of the functional consequences of in utero exposure to maternal obesity. Indeed, we have carried out an experiment to investigate fatty acid oxidation through assessing <sup>14</sup>C-oleate complete oxidation by isolated cardiomyocytes in 3 hours. This revealed that maternal obesity increased fatty acid oxidation in female cardiomyocytes but not males (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We also analysed the levels of hydroxylated acyl-carnitine species as markers of fatty acid metabolism in cardiac tissue and this suggested increased fatty acid metabolism in hearts of fetuses from obese dams (Figure 6B of revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The title should state that the study is on the fetal cardiac tissue lipidome and also the species and stage of development at which the fetuses are studied.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment.

As mentioned in response to question 1, we have performed High Content Microscopy (HCM) analysis on isolated fetal cardiomyocytes stained with DAPI. Although performing an extensive visual inspection of thousands of cardiomyocytes per sample, we did not observe any notable number of binucleated cells in any group. This is an expected result as in developing mice, cardiomyocyte binucleation does not usually appear until at least postnatal day 3, and only grows in prevalence during early postnatal life.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Line 139 should make it clear which OB serum, maternal or fetal, is being discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the lack of clarity.

We would like to clarify that the pathways shown in Figure 5B are the top 5 pathways regulated by maternal obesity in the fetal heart, according to IPA’s algorithm (p&lt;0.001), hence why we decided to focus on lipid metabolism when discussing the results from our transcriptomics data. Following the reviewer’s suggestion and for greater clarity, we have now included two supplementary tables (Figure 5–source data 2 and Figure 5–source data 3) listing all canonical pathways and upstream regulators recorded in the IPA analysis, including those significantly altered.</p><p>Regarding glucocorticoid signalling and steroidogenesis pathways, our IPA analysis tested but did not detect significant changes (based on a threshold of p &lt; 0.05) in either “Glucocorticoid Receptor Signalling” or HSD11B1 activity.</p><p>Regarding mitochondrial oxidation, the IPA algorithm listed “Mitochondrial dysfunction” as a significantly affected pathway (p=0.040), but it failed to provide us with a z-score for this analysis. This might indicate that there are not enough changes in the expression of genes mapped to this pathway, or that the expected direction of regulation for each gene is not accurate for the algorithm to confidently predict activation directionality.</p><p>Regarding changes in the proteasome activity, there were no significant changes in related pathways.</p><p>Thank you for the suggested reference, which has been incorporated into our discussion of the transcriptomics data (lines 341-344).</p></body></sub-article></article>
