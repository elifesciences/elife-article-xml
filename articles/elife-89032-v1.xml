mechanisms. However, the process of partitioning different epigenetic information into daughter cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell rather than the apoptotic one during ACDs in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. The absence of NuRD triggers apoptosis via the EGL-1-CED-9-CED-4-CED-3 pathway, while an ectopic gain of NuRD enables apoptotic daughter cells to survive. We identify the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>–adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) complex as a crucial regulator of NuRD’s asymmetric segregation. V-ATPase interacts with NuRD and is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell. Inhibition of V-ATPase disrupts cytosolic pH asymmetry and NuRD asymmetry. We suggest that asymmetric segregation of V-ATPase may cause distinct acidification levels in the two daughter cells, enabling asymmetric epigenetic inheritance that specifies their respective life-versus-death fates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ACDs</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>fate

in both development and tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Royall and Jessberger, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sunchu and Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref

Both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms determine distinct daughter cell fates after ACD. While extrinsic mechanisms, such as exposure to signaling cues from the local niche, have been extensively studied and are known to define stem cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>), the intrinsic mechanisms are more complex and largely unresolved, despite several proteins, RNA molecules, and organelles having been implicated in the regulation of some types of ACD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sunchu and Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zion et al., 2020</xref>). Epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in guiding the two daughter cells toward establishing differential gene expression profiles, ultimately defining their unique cell identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allis and Jenuwein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escobar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stewart-Morgan et al., 2020</xref>). During the ACD of <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline stem cells (GSCs), pre-existing and newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 are asymmetrically segregated toward the stem daughter cell and the differentiating daughter cell, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wooten et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, the extent to which epigenetic information is asymmetrically inherited through ACD in other organisms and the mechanism by which this process occurs remains elusive.</p><p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> represents a valuable model for investigating ACD, given its invariant cell lineage and conserved mechanisms of ACD. During hermaphrodite development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, 131 somatic cells undergo programmed cell death, with the majority produced through ACD that create a large cell programmed for survival and a small cell programmed to die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>) The opposing cell fates of daughter cells, that is, to live or die, offer a compelling experimental system for investigating how epigenetic inheritance determines life-versus-death decisions during ACD. It is noteworthy that 105 of the 131 apoptotic cells arise from neuronal lineages, of which the Q neuroblast represents a tractable system for studying ACD and apoptosis at single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ellis and Horvitz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hedgecock et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</xref>). During the first larval stage, Q neuroblasts on the left (QL) and right (QR) undergo three rounds of asymmetric divisions, which produce three different neurons and two apoptotic cells (Q.aa and Q.pp), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Asymmetric segregation of nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) during asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) of <italic>C.</italic> <italic>elegans</italic> Q neuroblast.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the Q neuroblast lineages.

Specifically, we have provided evidence that the reduced level of NuRD in the apoptotic daughter cell leads to an increased level of H3K27ac, an epigenetic modification known to be associated with active gene expression, at the <italic>egl-1</italic> locus, resulting in the upregulation of <italic>egl-1</italic> expression and subsequent induction of apoptosis. Based on our results, we propose a dual-function model of V-ATPase in NuRD asymmetric segregation: (i) V-ATPase interacts with NuRD, both of which are asymmetrically segregated into the surviving cell; (ii) the asymmetrical activity of V-ATPase generates a more acidic cytoplasmic environment in the future apoptotic cell portion compared to the surviving portion, which might contribute to the asymmetric segregation of V-ATPase and NuRD. This model sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the regulation of apoptosis during ACD and opens up new avenues for further investigation into the intricate interplay between V-ATPase, NuRD, and epigenetic modifications in the context of cell fate decisions.</p><p>The transcript asymmetry detected by scRNA-seq may not correspond to the protein asymmetry detected by microscopic imaging. Our scRNA-seq data shows that 6487 out of 8624 genes were not detected in <italic>egl-1</italic>-positive cells, the putative apoptotic cells. Cells that are <italic>egl-1</italic> positive may be undergoing apoptosis, rendering the asymmetry of NuRD complex transcripts insignificant in inferring protein asymmetry. Thus, the observed transcript asymmetry of the NuRD subunits between live and dead cells may be coincidental with NuRD protein asymmetry during asymmetric neuroblast division, rather than serving as a regulatory mechanism.</p><p>The intrinsic mechanisms governing binary cell fate decisions involve asymmetric cortical localization of cell fate determinants, polarized partitioning of RNA species, unequal segregation of organelles, and biased distribution of damaged proteins or protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sunchu and Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Venkei and Yamashita, 2018</xref>). Despite this, little is known about the asymmetric segregation of epigenetic modification enzymes during ACDs, nor the functions of polarized V-ATPase distribution and cytoplasmic proton asymmetry during this process. Our findings provide new insights into the asymmetric segregation of cell-intrinsic factors and the previously unrecognized roles of V-ATPase and cytosolic acidification in this process. We cannot rule out the possibility that NuRD asymmetric segregation results from daughter cell size asymmetry. According to this perspective, the nucleus in the larger daughter cell could possess more NuRD, potentially influencing the fate of the daughter cells. However, it is important to note that the nuclear protein histone or the MYST family histone acetyltransferase is equally segregated in daughter cells of different sizes.</p><p>Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the V-ATPase-dependent asymmetric segregation of NuRD. Firstly, a polarized intracellular transportation system could selectively deliver NuRD-V-ATPase-containing organelles to the surviving daughter cell. Although V-ATPase is primarily known for its localization and function in the late endosome and lysosome, recent evidence suggests that V-ATPase subunits are synthesized and assembled on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that V-ATPase colocalizes with the ER marker during ACDs, suggesting that NuRD-V-ATPase may be delivered as cargo on the ER or ER-derived vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). As reported in previous studies, a polarized microtubule transportation system, governed by specific motor proteins and the microtubule tracks, is responsible for the asymmetric segregation of signaling endosomes during ACDs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory organ precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derivery et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that a similar biased transportation system plays a role in the asymmetric segregation of NuRD-V-ATPase-containing organelles.</p><p>Secondly, the surviving daughter cell chromatids may have a greater ability to recruit NuRD than their apoptotic sister. This could be due to a higher number of yet unknown NuRD recruiting factors on chromatids or specific post-translational modifications of chromosomal proteins that enhance the chromosomal recruitment of NuRD. Despite having an identical DNA sequence, sister chromatids can be distinguished by chromosomal proteins or modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ranjan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tran et al., 2012</xref>), which likely provides the specific molecular cues for asymmetric NuRD recruitment. The NuRD asymmetry on chromosomes (1.5–1.8-fold between QR.ap and QR.aa nuclei) is greater than that between the two daughter cells (approximately 1.3-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>), suggesting that polarized NuRD-V-ATPase transportation and distinct NuRD affinity from sister chromatids may act in concert to establish NuRD asymmetry.</p><p>The observation of asymmetric segregation of the NuRD complex during cell divisions suggests that the mother cell may play a role in initiating the fate specification of its daughter cells. This notion is supported by studies conducted on <italic>Drosophila</italic> male GSCs, which demonstrated that the old and new histone H3-H4 or unequal amounts of histone H3 variant CENP-A were incorporated into sister chromatids prior to cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ranjan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tran et al., 2012</xref>). Although these patterns were not observed in cell types other than GSCs, asymmetric NuRD segregation was found to be common in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In 395 tracked embryonic cell divisions that generated two surviving daughter cells, NuRD was equally distributed in 390 cases, but in 5 cases, significant differences in HDA-1 and LIN-53 levels were observed between siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This observation suggests that biased NuRD segregation may contribute to binary cell fate decisions beyond apoptosis. In the embryonic cerebral cortex of mammals, approximately 30% of newborn cells undergo programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Voiculescu et al., 2000</xref>), which is a significantly higher rate than that observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> where only 12% of somatically born cells undergo apoptosis (131 apoptotic cells among 1090 somatically born cells). Thus, it is worth exploring whether brain stem cell divisions employ asymmetric NuRD segregation to specify daughter cell fates. Further studies on polarity establishment hold promise in elucidating the mechanisms underlying the asymmetric inheritance of epigenetic information.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains and culture</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> were maintained as described in the standard protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedland et al., 2013</xref>). We used the CRISPR design tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources">https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources</ext-link>) to select the target sites. The sgRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) were inserted into the pDD162 vector (Addgene #47549) by linearizing the vector with 15 base pairs (bp) overlapped primers using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Cat# MO531L). PCR products were digested using Dpn I (Takara, Cat# 1235A) for 2 hr at 37°C and transformed into Trans5α bacterial chemically competent cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.beian.miit.gov.cn/">TransGen Biotech</ext-link>, Cat# CD201-01). The linearized PCR products with 15 bp overlapping ends were cyclized to generate plasmids by spontaneous recombination in bacteria. Homology recombination (HR) templates were constructed by cloning the 1.5 kb upstream and downstream homology arms into the pPD95.77 plasmid using the In-Fusion Advantage PCR cloning kit (Clontech, Cat# 639621). Fluorescence tags were inserted into the constructs with a flexible linker before the stop codons. Synonymous mutations were introduced to Cas9 target sites to avoid the cleavage of the homologous repair template by Cas9.

L1 larvae or young-adult worms were anesthetized with 0.1 mmol/l levamisole in M9 buffer, mounted on 3% (wt/vol) agarose pads maintained at 20°C. Our imaging system includes an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) equipped with a Zeiss 100×/1.46 numerical aperture (NA) objective, an Andor iXon+EM-CCD camera, and 488 and 561 nm lines of a Sapphire CW CDRH USB Laser System attached to a spinning disk confocal scan head (Yokogawa CSU-X1 Spinning Disk Unit). Images were acquired using μManager (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.micro-manager.org">https://www.micro-manager.org</ext-link>). Time‐lapse images of Q cell divisions were acquired with an exposure time of 200 ms every 1 min. Recent advancements in optical and camera technologies permit the acquisition of Z-stacks without perturbing Q cell division or overall animal development. Z-stack images were acquired over a range of –1.6 to +1.6 μm from the focal plane, at intervals of 0.8 μm. The field of view spanned 160 μm × 160 μm, and the laser power, as measured at the optical fiber, was approximately 1 mW. ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) was used to perform image analysis and measurement. Image stacks were z-projected using the average projection for quantification and using the maximum projection for visual display. To follow the cell fate of QR.aa in WT, BafA1- or BafA1 and IAA-treated worms, time-lapse images were acquired with 300 ms for 561 nm and 100 ms for 488 nm exposure time at 5 min intervals.

Animals were collected and washed with M9 buffer three times. For each replicate, the lysate was made from 1–2 ml packed worms with 3–4 ml of 0.5-mm-diameter glass beads using FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals) in lysis buffer (pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 1× cocktail of protease inhibitors from Roche [cOmplete, EDTA free], 40 mM NaF, 5 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>).

For anti-GFP immunoprecipitation (IP), the supernatant was incubated with GFP-Trap A beads (ChromoTek, GTA20) for 1 hr. Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. To detect the interaction between the V-ATPase subunit and HDA-1, beads are boiled with 1× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer for SDS-PAGE and western blot. Otherwise, proteins were eluted from beads with 300 μl 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). Add 15 μl 1.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) to the eluted protein, followed by precipitation using 100 μl trichloroacetic acid and re-dissolution in 60 μl 8 M urea, 100 mM Tris- HCl (pH 8.5) for MS. MS samples were then reduced in 5 mM TCEP, alkylated by 10 mM iodoacetamide, and diluted fourfold with 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The 0.2 μg trypsin was used to digest 10 μg protein in 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 20 mM methylamine overnight at 37°C. The resultant peptides were desalted by ZipTip pipette tips (Merck Millipore). For liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, peptides were separated by an EASY-nLCII integrated nano-HPLC system (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) directly interfaced to a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded on an analytical fused-silica capillary column (150 mm in length, 75 mm in internal diameter; Upchurch) packed with 5 mm, 300 Å C-18 resin (Varian). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid, while mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid and 100% acetonitrile. The Q Exactive mass spectrometer was operated through Xcalibur 2.1.2 software in data-dependent acquisition mode. A single full-scan mass spectrum was used in the orbitrap (400–1800 m/z in mass range, 60,000 in resolution) followed by 10 data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry scans at 27% normalized collision energy (HCD).

If proven, the proposed model of the V-ATPase-NuRD-EGL-1-Apoptosis cascade would shed light onto the mechanisms underlying the regulation of apoptosis fate during asymmetric cell division, and stimulate further investigation into the intricate interplay between V-ATPase, NuRD, and epigenetic modifications.

One issue is with statistics (either insufficient information or inadequate use of statistics), and second is the concern that the asymmetry observed may be caused by one cell dying (resulting in protein degradation, RNA degradation etc). We recommend that the authors address these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We extend our sincere thanks to the Editors and Reviewers for their insightful comments on this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major #1:</p><p>There are still many misleading statements/conclusions that are not rigorously tested or that are logically flawed. These issues must be thoroughly addressed for this manuscript to be solid.</p><p>(1) Asymmetry detected by scRNA seq vs. imaging may not represent the same phenomenon, thus should not be discussed as two supporting pieces of evidence for the authors' model, and importantly each method has its own flaw. First, for scRNA seq, when cells become already egl-1 positive, those cells may be already dying, and thus NuRD complex's transcripts' asymmetry may not have any significance. The data presented in FigS1D, E show that there are lots of genes (6487 out of 8624) that are decreased in dying cells. Thus, it is not convincing to claim that NuRD asymmetry is regulated by differential RNA amount.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer's comment. Indeed, scRNA-seq reveals phenomena different from those observed in protein imaging, and NuRD asymmetry may not be regulated by differential RNA levels. Seven years ago, when we started this project, NuRD asymmetry during asymmetric neuroblast division was unknown. We first found NuRD mRNA asymmetry using scRNA-seq and then NuRD protein asymmetry using fluorescence imaging. We have documented the whole process of discovering NuRD asymmetry, although the asymmetry of NuRD complex transcripts does not necessarily imply protein asymmetry. We have revised statements related to &quot;NuRD asymmetry being regulated by differential RNA amounts&quot; and discussed this issue in the revised manuscript on page 14, line 2:</p><p>&quot; The transcript asymmetry detected by scRNA-seq may not correspond to the protein asymmetry detected by microscopic imaging. Our scRNA-seq data shows that 6487 out of 8624 genes were not detected in egl-1-positive cells, the putative apoptotic cells. Cells that are egl-1 positive may be undergoing apoptosis, rendering the asymmetry of NuRD complex transcripts insignificant in inferring protein asymmetry. Thus, the observed transcript asymmetry of the NuRD subunits between live and dead cells may be coincidental with NuRD protein asymmetry during asymmetric neuroblast division, rather than serving as a regulatory mechanism.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Regarding NuRD protein's asymmetry, there are still multiple issues. Most likely explanation of their asymmetry is purely daughter size asymmetry. Because one cell is much bigger than the other (3 times larger), NuRD components, which are not chromatin associated, would be inherited to the bigger cell 3 times more than the smaller daughter. Then, upon nuclear envelope reformation, NuRD components will enter the nucleus, and there will be 3 times more NuRD components in the bigger daughter cell. It is possible that this is actually the underling mechanism to regulate gene expression differentially, but this possibility is not properly acknowledged. Currently, the authors use chromatin associated protein (Mys-1) as 'symmetric control', but this is not necessarily a fair comparison. For NuRD asymmetry to be meaningful, an example of protein is needed that is non-chromatin associated in mitosis, distributed to daughter cells proportional to daughter cell size, and re-enter nucleus after nuclear envelope formation to show symmetric distribution. And if daughter size asymmetry is the cause of NuRD asymmetry, other lineages that do not undergo apoptosis but exhibit daughter size asymmetry would also show NuRD asymmetry. The authors should comment on this (if such examples exist, it is fine in that in those cell types, NuRD asymmetry may be used for differential gene expression, not necessarily to induce cell death, but such comparison provides the explanation for NuRD asymmetry, and puts the authors finding in a better context).</p></disp-quote><p>For more than one decade, we have meticulously explored the relationship between protein asymmetry and cell size asymmetry during ACDs of Q cells. A notable example of even protein distribution is the cytokinetic kinesin ZEN-4, as documented in our 2012 publication in the Journal of Cell Biology (Chai et al., JCB, 2012). This study, primarily focusing on the fate of the midbody post-cell division, also showcased the dynamics of GFP-tagged ZEN-4 during ACDs of QR.a cells in movie S1. Intriguingly, beyond its role in the cytokinetic ring, we observed a uniform dispersal of ZEN-4 throughout the cytoplasm. Remarkably, following cell division, ZEN-4 transitions evenly into the nuclei of the daughter cells, a phenomenon with implications yet to be fully understood. One hypothesis is that ZEN-4's nuclear localization may prevent the formation of ectopic microtubule bundles in the cytosol during interphase. Below, we present a snapshot from our original movie, clearly showing the symmetrical distribution of ZEN-4 into the nuclei of the two daughter cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) For the analysis of protein asymmetry between two daughters in Fig S4C, the method of calibration is unclear, making it difficult to interpret the results.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure S4C, we quantified the relative total fluorescence of the Q cell, with the quantification method illustrated in Figure S4A. To further clarify our quantification approach, we have updated Figure S4A and the &quot;Live-Cell Imaging and Quantification&quot; section in the Materials and Methods:</p><p>“…To determine the ratios of fluorescence intensities in the posterior to anterior half (P/A) of Q.a lineages or A/P of Q.p lineages, the cell in the mean intensity projection was divided into posterior and anterior halves. ImageJ software was used to measure the mean fluorescence intensities of two halves with background subtraction. The slide background's mean fluorescence intensity was measured in a region devoid of worm bodies. The background-subtracted mean fluorescence intensities of the two halves were divided to calculate the ratio. The same procedure was used to determine the fluorescence intensity ratios between two daughter cells. Total fluorescence intensity was the sum of the posterior and anterior fluorescence intensities or the sum of fluorescence intensities from two daughter cells (Figure S4A). …”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) As for pHluorin experiments, the authors were asked to test the changes in fluorescence observed are due to changes in pH or changes in the amount of pHluorin protein. They need to add a ratio-metric method in this manuscript. A brief mention to Page 12 line 12 is insufficient to clarify this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concerns about potential changes in pH or pHluorin protein levels. While we cannot completely dismiss the impact of changes in the amount of pHluorin protein, it appears improbable that the asymmetry of pHluorin fluorescence is attributed to an asymmetric amount of pHluorin protein. This inference is supported by the observation that other fluorescent proteins, such as GFP or mCherry, did not exhibit any asymmetry during ACDs of Q cells. An example of GFP alone during the ACD of QL.p is illustrated in figure 5A from Ou and Vale, JCB, 2009. The fluorescence intensities in the large QL.pa cell and the small QL.aa are indistinguishable.</p><p>Major #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some issues surrounding statistics must be resolved.</p><p>(1) Fig. 1FG, 2D, 3BDEG, 5BD and 6B used either one-sample t-test or unpaired two-tailed parametric t-test for statistical comparison.
