They allow for temporal segmentation of spikes and support distinct behaviors. To establish how multiple oscillatory components co-vary simultaneously and influence neuronal firing during sleep and wakefulness in mice, we describe a multivariate analytical framework for constructing the state space of hippocampal oscillations. Examining the co-occurrence patterns of oscillations on the state space, across species, uncovered the presence of network constraints and distinct set of cross-frequency interactions during wakefulness compared to sleep. We demonstrated how the state space can be used as a canvas to map the neural firing and found that distinct neurons during navigation were tuned to different sets of simultaneously occurring oscillations during sleep. This multivariate analytical framework provides a window to move beyond classical bivariate pipelines for investigating oscillations and neuronal firing, thereby allowing to factor-in the complexity of oscillation–population interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oscillations</kwd><kwd>coupling</kwd><kwd>state space</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>syncrhonization</kwd><kwd>state dependent</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program MGATE</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>765549</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Battaglia</surname><given-names>Francesco P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>840704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stella</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>ERC Advanced Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>833964</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Battaglia</surname><given-names>Francesco P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Telethon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GGP16083</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cherubini</surname><given-names>Enrico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Del Monte Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cherubini</surname><given-names>Enrico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO short term fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>8464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Modi</surname><given-names>Brijesh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondo Ordinario Enti (A collaboration agreement between the Italian National Research Council and EBRI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOE D.M 865/2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cherubini</surname><given-names>Enrico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel analytical framework for investigation of simultaneously occurring brain oscillations (from either single or multiple brain areas) and how it modulates the underlying neuronal population during sleep and wakefulness (or other behavioral tasks).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oscillations, generated by large neuronal ensembles, are a hallmark of the mammalian brain. They are well preserved during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004</xref>) and have been suggested to play a key role in high cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Uhlhaas and Singer, 2010</xref>). They enable the synchronization of neural activity within and across brain regions, thus promoting the precise temporal coordination of neural processes underlying memory, perception, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colgin and Moser, 2010</xref>). Their disruption leads to cognitive and sensorimotor deficits associated with several neuropsychiatric diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Uhlhaas et al., 2011</xref>). Oscillations occurring at different frequency bands (from 0.5 to 200 Hz), interact with each other through hierarchical cross-frequency coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">González et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jensen and Colgin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tort et al., 2008</xref>). Such interactions are linked to different computational operations or different phases in a computational operation and are thought to characterize distinct brain states supporting various aspects of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McCormick et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In the hippocampus, theta cycles are often nested with bouts of faster oscillations in the gamma frequency and are thought to be related to different stages of memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lopes-Dos-Santos et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, during wakefulness, the CA1 region is characterized by cross-frequency coupling between theta and distinct gamma oscillations, which exhibit their peak power at distinct phases of ongoing slow oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Csicsvari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamamoto et al., 2014</xref>). The slow, medium, and fast gamma oscillations, emerging from <italic>stratum radiatum (SR), stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM</italic>), and <italic>stratum pyramidale (SP</italic>), respectively, are linked to network activity in entorhinal cortex, CA3 and CA1 region, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guardamagna et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>). During sleep, theta and medium gamma oscillations dominate the rapid eye movement REM sleep, whereas delta, beta frequency band, and ripples or fast gamma (100–200 Hz), linked to memory consolidation processes, dominate the non-REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Battaglia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Genzel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Roumis and Frank, 2015</xref>). The composition of hippocampal states by distinct set of slow and fast oscillations reflects synchrony among different brain areas and corresponds to distinct functional states of the hippocampal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colgin, 2015</xref>). However, despite extensive research on simultaneously occurring oscillations, very little is known about the dynamic variations in the composition of hippocampal network state with time and behavior.</p><p>Oscillations are generated by neuronal population, and they in turn are known to modulate the firing activity of individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hulse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>). Classically, neuronal firing has been characterized in the context of a single-frequency band during distinct brain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fox et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henze et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hafting et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van Wingerden et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>). However, the classical analytical methods, due to their bivariate nature, are limited to examining the firing activity of neurons in relation to power or phase or frequency of a specific oscillation only, thus neglecting how multiple oscillations, occurring simultaneously in a given region, modulate the neuronal firing in a combinatorial manner.</p><p>Here, a novel analytical approach has been described to investigate how simultaneously occurring network oscillations dynamically contribute to the composition of hippocampal states and how they influence the neuronal firing. To this aim, multisite local field potentials (LFPs), recorded from the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus of freely moving mice, were used to construct the network state space during wakefulness and sleep. This method has allowed to create a compact representation of the state of multiple oscillatory processes, distinct in frequency and anatomical localization. We used this compact representation for studying various oscillations, their intrinsic organization, their temporal progression, and their simultaneous influence on distinct neuronal ensembles and behavior. In addition, the state space provided a window for observing the hippocampal population in the context of the network in which they are embedded. This allowed us to examine how cells fire as a function of the network state and how multiple oscillations simultaneously modulate cell firing. As a proof of concept, this approach has been applied to datasets recorded, in similar experimental conditions, from another animal species (rats), in Dr. Gyorgy Buzsaki’s lab at NYU (<italic>hc-11 dataset,</italic> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crncs.org/">crncs.org</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grosmark et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grosmark and Buzsáki, 2016</xref>). Lastly, the network state space framework has been applied to study alterations in the organization of hippocampal oscillations in mice lacking neuroligin 3 (NLG3 KO; neuroligin-3 knock out), an animal model of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baudouin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental paradigm and construction of the network state space</title><p>On a single day, we recorded brain activity in freely moving mice (n = 4) during four consecutive trials: (1) Sleep1, (2) Novel Arena-1 Exploration, (3) Novel Arena-2 Exploration, and (4) Sleep2, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Layer-resolved LFP were extracted from the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus using multisite silicon probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guardamagna et al., 2022</xref>). LFPs from SP, SR, and SLM layers were used to extract signals in the following frequency bands: delta (1–5 Hz), theta (6–10 Hz), beta (10–20 Hz), slow gamma (20–45 Hz), medium gamma (60–90 Hz), and fast gamma (100–200 Hz). Each of these 18 frequency bands (six from each layer, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) were used to compute median power in nonoverlapping bins of 200 milliseconds and then smoothed using Gaussian kernel. The resulting 18 power time series across all four trials combined (divided into, say, N bins of 200 ms each) form a cloud of N points in 18D space, which we refer to as the network state space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Each point in the cloud represents the state of the network (i.e., the power configuration of the 18 frequency bands from three layers) at a given time. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McInnes et al., 2020</xref>) was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the network state space from 18D to 2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>).

The observed restriction on the state space was further compared against a surrogate data generated by randomly shuffling the binned power in all frequency bands (see ‘Methods’). We found that the observed difference in occupancy between sleep and awake trials was significantly different from those computed in surrogate data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To assess whether the observed restricted occupancy was due to smaller trial duration of awake trails (20 min) compared to sleep (60 min), we performed control analysis by computing occupancy on the state space obtained by randomly selecting equal number of network states from awake and sleep trials. We observed similar restrictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that the restricted occupancy during wakefulness is independent of trial duration. Next, we assessed whether the observed restrictions on the state space are driven by large fluctuations in low-frequency bands, which may weigh preponderantly in the UMAP. We computed the state space with normalized features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) as well as obtained the state space projection using an alternative dimensionality reduction approach (principal component analysis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similar patterns of restrictions on the network state space, during wakefulness, across all different projections were observed. To further validate our findings, we computed the network state space and occupancy for the datasets recorded from freely moving rats in similar experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) and observed remarkable similarities in restrictions on the state space, suggesting that functional organization of network oscillations during sleep and wakefulness is conserved across species. In addition, we observed that the network occupies the same set of states when animals explore distinct arenas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

While classical analytical approaches employ bivariate methods by evaluating each oscillation individually across sleep and awake trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the network state space employs multivariate approach and highlights how fluctuations in power for one oscillation link to the general oscillatory state of the network. This allows visualizing how the power of one oscillation varies in the context of all other oscillations. In addition, it underscores the regime of operation for different oscillations during sleep and wakefulness. For instance, the restricted subspace of the state space occupied during wakefulness corresponds to states with low delta power, moderate beta power, and moderate to high gamma power. However, during sleep, network oscillations exhibit broader range of operations since the power of each oscillation varies from its minima to its maxima as evident in the overlay maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This characteristic distribution during sleep was further used to determine the localization of REM, non-REM, and intermediate sleep states on the network state space.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Characterization of restrictions on the network state space during wakefulness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of power on state space for six oscillations of layer <italic>stratum pyramidale</italic>: delta (1–5 Hz), theta (6–10 Hz), beta (10–20 Hz), slow gamma (20–45 Hz), medium gamma (60–90 Hz), and fast gamma (100–200 Hz).

It is measured in the units: <italic>number of state visits/bin/second</italic>. Density on the state space computed during awake trials measures the normalized occurrence of corresponding behaviors during exploration whereas density computed during sleep trials measures the time spent by the network in various sleep states (REM, non-REM). Mirroring the smaller occupied state space region, the median density of awake trials was significantly higher than that detected during sleep (0.13 ± 0.009 versus 0.03 ± 0.0005). We next investigated the density across sleep trials (Sleep1 and Sleep2) by comparing the median density of REM and non-REM states between the two sleep trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We observed an increase in the median density of non-REM states during post-exploration sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>: center; Sleep1: 0.039 ± 0.001versus Sleep2: 0.048 ± 0.002) while the density of REM sleep remained identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left; Sleep1: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mn>0.0076</mml:mn><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> versus Sleep2: 0.0075 ± 0.001). In particular, non-REM states in Sleep2 tended to concentrate in a region of increased power in the delta and beta bands, which could be the results of increased interactions with cortical activity modulated in the same range. It is also likely that such effect was induced by the exposure to relevant behavioral experience. In fact, changes in density of individual oscillations after learning have been reported using traditional analytical methods and are thought to support memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eschenko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eschenko et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, while traditional methods provide information about individual components, the novel approach used here provides additional information about the combinatorial shift in the dynamics of network oscillations after learning or exploration. Thus, it provides the basis for identifying how coordinated activity among different oscillations supports memory consolidation processes as those occurring during non-REM sleep after exploration, which cannot be elucidated using traditional analytical methods.</p><p>In this study, although REM and non-REM sleep states were identified using classical methods, the state space allowed quantifying changes in density of all other oscillations such as theta, slow, medium, and fast gamma that occur simultaneously with delta and beta bands (from power distribution maps [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>] and REM and non-REM maps [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>]). Thus, identification of sleep states on state space provides additional information about oscillation-specific changes across sleep trials. However, whether other oscillations may be statistically related to delta and beta during non-REM states of sleep and whether such correlation depends on the state of the network remain to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>State and layer-dependent coupling of hippocampal oscillations</title><p>To investigate state-dependent coupling among various oscillatory processes, we computed pairwise correlation matrix using binned power in all 18 frequency bands (see ‘Methods’). Each correlation matrix represents how various bands are coupled during sleep and awake trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We observed distinct configuration of frequency band’s correlations during sleep and awake trails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We further investigated how coupling of bands varies on the state space by binning the state space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and computed correlation matrix in each bin. We classified the bins into one of the following states: awake, REM, non-REM, and intermediate sleep (see ‘Methods’). We employed UMAP to visualize the variability across correlation matrices. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and observed distinct coupling configurations for awake, REM, and non-REM states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). During REM, we found increased coupling (positive correlation) among beta and slow gamma oscillations as well as among medium and fast gamma bands accompanied by decoupling (negative correlation) with delta. This organization among oscillations was altered during non-REM sleep as all oscillations except delta were coupled. Gamma segregation and delta decoupling offer a picture of hippocampal REM sleep as being more akin to awake locomotion (with the major difference of a stronger medium gamma presence) while also suggesting a substantial independence from cortical slow oscillations. On the other hand, the across-scale coherence of non-REM sleep is consistent with this sleep stage being dominated by brain-wide collective fluctuations engaging oscillations at every range. Distinct cross-frequency coupling among various individual pairs of oscillations such as theta-gamma, delta-gamma, etc., have been already reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandarabadi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clemens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hammer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scheffzük et al., 2011</xref>). However, computing cross-frequency coupling on the state space provides the additional information on how multiple oscillations, obtained from distinct CA1 hippocampal layers (<italic>stratum pyramidale, stratum radiatum, and stratum lacunosum moleculare</italic>), are coupled with each other during distinct states of sleep and wakefulness. Furthermore, projecting the correlation matrices on 2D plane provides a compact tool that allows to visualize the cross-frequency interactions among various hippocampal oscillations.

We computed AACP specifically for transition from REM/non-REM/intermediate sleep state to REM/non-REM/intermediate state. We found that transitions occurring from REM-to-REM sleep and non-REM-to-non-REM sleep (intra-state transitions) are more vulnerable to plasticity after exploration as compared to inter-state transitions (such as non-REM to REM, REM-to-intermediate, etc.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). These changes in intra-state transitions were observed to be beyond randomness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>), indicating a specificity in plastic changes in state transitions after exploration. In particular, while the average REM period duration is unaltered after exploration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), REM temporal structure is reorganized. In fact, increased probability of REM to REM transitions indicates a significant prolongation of REM bout duration. Similarly, the increase in non-REM to non-REM transition probability reflects an increased duration of non-REM bouts. Therefore, environment exploration was accompanied by an increased separation between REM and non-REM periods, possibly as a response to increased computational demands. More in general, the network state space allows to characterize the state transitions in hippocampus and how they are affected by novel experience or learning. By observing the state transition patterns, this analytical framework allows to detect and identify state-specific changes in the hippocampal oscillatory dynamics, beyond the possibilities offered by more traditional univariate and bivariate methods. We next investigated how fast the network flows on the state space and assessed whether the speed is uniform or whether it exhibits specific region-dependent characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Stabilization on state space during transition to REM</title><p>Coverage speed determines how fast the network sweeps the area of the state space. To calculate the coverage speed, we binned the state space as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref> and computed the number of bins the network covers in each time window (see ‘Methods’). Thus, the resultant time series provides information about how network’s flow varies over time. When speed is closer to its minimum value (i.e., 1 bin/s), the network stabilizes to a set of states that are closer to each other, whereas when speed approaches its theoretical maximum value, the network covers wider range of area, thus more potential fluctuations in the power of oscillations. We observed a reduction in median coverage speed during awake compared to sleep trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). During awake trials, due to subspace occupancy and behavioral constraints (such as walking, running, stopping, exploring walls, etc.) on state space, the network operates in constrained space compared to sleep. Thus, the network is more likely to fall on states closer to each other, reducing its coverage speed compared to sleep trials. We further explored the coverage speed during sleep, wondering how coverage speed varies during network transitions to REM sleep. We addressed this issue by taking a closer look at network trajectories and coverage speed when the network makes the transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We observed a sharp dip in coverage speed associated with state transition to REM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, S10A).

This allowed to visualize how speed of coverage varies with median power in all oscillatory bands. By definition of REM, we observed an increase in theta and a reduction in delta power during the transition. However, this transition was also associated with a significant reduction of power in beta frequency band and with an increase of medium and fast gamma power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). While slow gamma remained mostly unchanged during the REM epoch, we measured a significant average increase in its power in a window preceding the onset of REM sleep and extending for few tens of seconds.

We hypothesized that distinct activation signatures on state space may correspond to distinct firing rate maps during exploration.

We refer to this projected space as <italic>signature space</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) as each point on signature space represents a cell’s activation signature during sleep trials.

Specifically, we observed that sparse firing cells during exploration exhibit preferential firing to non-REM states (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8F</xref>) and are therefore simultaneously modulated by high power in delta, theta, beta oscillations, as well as moderate power in slow and fast gamma oscillations (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Each trial consisted of 3 min of LFP recordings while the animal was awake and at rest on a platform in a head-fixed condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>).

This framework is established by constructing a state space of multiple network variables: in our case, the power of 18 hippocampal frequency bands from three layers of the CA1 region. While we used predefined frequency bands to filter oscillations from LFPs, alternatively, unsupervised methods (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lopes-Dos-Santos et al., 2018</xref>) can be employed to extract oscillations in an unbiased manner and construct the state space of network oscillations. We applied this framework to characterize various static and dynamic properties of the network state space during wakefulness and sleep and demonstrated multiple applications of the framework.</p><p>Traditional approaches usually consist of analyzing spectral features of individual oscillations (univariate methods) or the power and phase relationship between two oscillations (bivariate methods). This multivariate analytical approach provides a unique window to assess the combinatorial effect of more than two oscillations on the state of the network, the neuronal population and the behavior. This provides a formal framework to uncover the potential combinations of neural signals underlying various cognitive functions during sleep and wakefulness. By constructing the state space of power in various frequency bands from distinct layers of a brain region, our analysis allows to characterize the network landscape and how various oscillatory processes co-vary as a function of the overall state of the network. Additionally, we demonstrated that the state space can be used as a canvas to map the activity of individual cells, thus allowing to study how various oscillations can simultaneously influence the firing of neuronal ensembles. Although the scope of this study was limited to demonstrate the state space approach for power of network oscillations, the general idea can be extended to create a state space with additional attributes of oscillations such as instantaneous frequency, phase, etc. The resulting state space may provide additional insights about the organization of network oscillations. For instance, characterization of the state space constructed with instantaneous phase of the oscillations may provide novel information on how cell spiking is phase-locked to multiple oscillations simultaneously and how those phase-locking properties vary with time and behavioral state of an animal.</p><p>We first used the network state space to visualize the restricted nature of access to the state space during wakefulness compared to sleep. We then characterized that restriction by overlaying the power of individual oscillations on the state space. This helped us to visualize how oscillations are intrinsically organized and co-vary simultaneously on the state space during wakefulness and sleep. Compared to sleep, in our experimental settings, during awake trials, the delta power is low, and the network is more dominated by theta and gamma supporting the ongoing navigational needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buzsáki and Moser, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colgin and Moser, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, it was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Furtunato et al., 2020</xref>) that a specific increase in delta power accompanied by a decrease in theta and gamma power in rats trained to execute 35 successive short-term treadmill run at the same speed. These results suggest, compared to our experiments, exploration of a larger subspace, at least in part related to changes in internal physiological states during performance of running exercise. We also applied the analysis to the datasets obtained from rat’s hippocampus and observed remarkable similarity across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that restrictions on network state space during wakefulness are conserved across species. These findings are in agreement with previous reports characterizing multiregion state space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gervasoni et al., 2004</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that, during wakefulness, the hippocampal network occupies a fraction of subspace, independently of task and behavioral needs.</p><p>We next identified REM and non-REM states on the network state space. Alternatively, they can also be identified using oscillations from multiple brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagur et al., 2018</xref>). We observed increased non-REM density during post-exploration sleep trials. This finding complements a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eschenko et al., 2008</xref>) of sustained increased in sharp wave ripples activity during slow wave sleep after learning. In our case, the animal explores two novel environments during exploration trials, subsequently in the post-exploration sleep, the network spends more time on the non-REM states, possibly supporting the occurrence of sharp wave ripples and memory consolidation. Along with increase in the occurrence of high delta and high beta power states (definition of non-REM), we have also observed simultaneous increase in the occurrence of other network oscillations such as theta, slow, and fast gamma in post-exploration sleep trial (Sleep2). The slow and fast gamma oscillations are linked to inputs from CA3 and medial entorhinal cortex, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>), thus an enhanced density of states characterized by medium and fast gamma suggests an increased hippocampal-entorhinal and CA1-CA3 communication during non-REM sleep after exploration or learning. This modulation of active oscillatory states across sleep stages is also consistent with observed reorganization of cellular excitation between REM and non-REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grosmark et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miyawaki and Diba, 2016</xref>), which might mirror the differential inputs impinging on the network. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms and functional role(s) of such increased inter-areal communication after exploration or learning remain to be determined.</p><p>Further, we characterized the coupling of various frequency bands during awake and sleep trials and across distinct network states. We reported state-dependent coupling of distinct hippocampal oscillations, suggesting that their sources change their functional link during distinct states on state space. For instance, during REM sleep, we observed beta-frequency range oscillations coupled with slow gamma power and medium gamma coupled with fast gamma. We also observed delta decoupled from medium and fast gamma. These observations are in agreement with a general understanding of REM sleep as corresponding to a state of low coherence across the cortex and between the cortex and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</xref>) while arguing for the existence of frequency-specific channels of communication. In fact, this configuration alters during other network states such as non-REM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Besides the modulation of power of individual oscillations, the observed variations in coupling across frequency bands amplitudes might indicate a wider spectrum of combinations available to the network to dynamically regulate the activity of hippocampal population. Furthermore, such coupling states could mirror a similarly complex processing of specific inputs from up or downstream regions during distinct states of sleep and wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colgin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dvorak et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated the state transitions on the network state space. We quantified trajectories on state space and observed that state transition probabilities vary between two sleep trials and two awake trials. During exploration trials, the flow of the hippocampal network state is strongly affected by ongoing spatial navigation. The incoming and outgoing state space trajectories are in fact bounded by the details of the exploration activity statistics (such as speed). Changes in transition probabilities thus reflect alterations in behavioral sequences exhibited by the animal during exploration. During sleep trials, the state of the hippocampal network flows without any interference from environmental inputs. The incoming and outgoing trajectories bounds are instead characteristics of specific sleep states. Thus, changes in transition probabilities across sleep trials represent modifications in the probable paths on the network state space. These changes might be due to learning and/or experience acquired during awake exploration trials. The experience of running on a track or in an arena may change the state of the circuit in many ways: (1) by changing the neuromodulatory state due to arousal, physical exertion; (2) by changing brain temperature, which is known to modify brain potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moser et al., 1993</xref>); and (3) by imprinting a trace of the experience by synaptic plasticity. Our methods enable to capture theses changes in terms of the coordinated modifications in oscillatory phenomena. Further experiments will be needed to disentangle possible causes of these changes and unveil how these dynamical changes correlate with modifications in information processing in the hippocampus.</p><p>We then characterized the speed of coverage on the network state space and reported the stabilization of network during transitions to REM sleep. We also described how frequency bands are reorganized during the transition. We observed specific increase in power of medium and fast gamma, but not slow gamma, during the transition to REM. State-dependent cross-frequency coupling between theta and gamma was also reported during REM sleep in EEG recordings from mouse parietal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scheffzük et al., 2011</xref>). These results suggest the presence of common organizing principles across cortical and subcortical areas. It is worth mentioning that the slow gamma activity, which is not affected by the transition to REM, originates not only in the CA3 region of the hippocampus but also in the CA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Middleton and McHugh, 2016</xref>). CA2 shows distinct anatomical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>) and functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dudek et al., 2016</xref>) properties that may differently affect REM sleep-dependent information processing.</p><p>Further, we demonstrated two applications of this analytical method. Firstly, rather than using individual oscillations to study the firing properties of hippocampal neurons, we overlaid the firing of hippocampal neurons on state space and used those sleep signatures to distinguish cells in CA1. We reported a gradient in the sleep state space signatures of cells, differentiating cells with sparse activation in the arena, from more active ones. This suggests that the sparse firing cells in the hippocampus are modulated differently by network oscillations occurring simultaneously during sleep.</p><p>Secondly, this method was applied to study the organization of hippocampal network state space in mice lacking NLG3, animal models of autism, which exhibit social deficits reminiscent of those found in autistic children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bariselli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Modi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Radyushkin et al., 2009</xref>). In line with data obtained from animal models of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hammer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Modi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Paterno et al., 2021</xref>) or from the EEG/MEG of autistic children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cornew et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Larrain-Valenzuela et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ortiz-Mantilla et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rojas and Wilson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), we observed a significant reduction in delta, theta, beta, medium, and fast gamma activity in NLG3 KO mice. These data are similar to those reported in the CA2 region of the hippocampus of NLG3 KO anaesthetized animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Modi et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that alterations in network activity in CA2 may influence the downstream CA1 network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>). However, the reduction in slow gamma power detected in CA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Modi et al., 2019</xref>) was not associated to a similar decrease in CA1 reported here, suggesting slow gamma oscillations in CA1 can emerge from sources other than CA2, possibly CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Oscillatory activities, and in particular the gamma ones, depend on the synchronous firing of large neuronal ensembles of excitatory cells within and across brain regions, which are paced by GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gonzalez-Burgos and Lewis, 2008</xref>). Therefore, the observed alterations in power may be due to a reduced GABA release from GABAergic interneurons such as those containing parvalbumin (PV+) and cholecystokinin (CCK+) known to contribute to generate theta and gamma rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Klausberger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tukker et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, in a previous study from NLG3 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Földy et al., 2013</xref>), a clear increase in GABA release from CCK+GABAergic interneurons into CA1 principal cells was detected due to the impairment of tonic endocannabinoid signaling. Additionally, an impairment of GABAergic currents was also reported in CA2 region of NLG3 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Modi et al., 2019</xref>), an upstream region to CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the reduced oscillatory activity reported here is probably mediated by the loss of GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated neurotransmission in both CA1 and CA2 hippocampal regions. This would cause an enhancement of network excitability with consequent excitatory/inhibitory unbalance, critical for controlling spike rate and information processing.</p><p>Lastly, we highlight some other potential applications of the network state space framework:</p><p><italic>(i) Assessment of inter-areal communication</italic>. The state space approach can be applied to study oscillations from multiple brain regions simultaneously and how one set of oscillations from one region influence the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gervasoni et al., 2004</xref>). (<italic>ii) Analysis of EEG datasets</italic>. Various oscillations can be extracted from EEG recorded from multiple brain areas and used to assess how they are organized during various behavioral tasks during wakefulness (i.e., decision-making, navigation, imagination, mental calculation) or during sleep. Additionally, this analytical framework can be applied to study alterations in the organization of brain-wide network oscillations as signatures or biomarkers in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. (<italic>iii) Network assessment of novel therapeutics</italic>. Newly developed drugs are required to be extensively tested for their harmful side effects. Using network state space method will allow assessing how multiple brain regions, and their oscillations are simultaneously affected under pharmacological treatment.

Seven male mice (four WT and three NLG3 KO) aged 3–5 mo were implanted with stainless steel head bar (Luigs &amp; Neuman, Germany). Mice were individually housed after implantation and were allowed to recover for 1 wk. Mice were progressively habituated to head-fixation on a horizontal platform until they no longer attempt to escape (3–4 wk). For craniotomy, they were anesthetized with i.p. injection of a mixture of tiletamine/zolazepam (Zoletil; 80 mg/kg) and xylazine (Rompun, 10 mg/kg), a day before the recording. A glass electrode (Hingelberg, Malsfeld, Germany) with the resistance of 1–2 MΩ, filled with standard Ringer’s solution containing (in mM) 35 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 5 HEPES, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, was lowered to target CA1 pyramidal layer using micromanipulator (Scientifica, UK).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Antonio Fernandez-Ruiz as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. All reviewers found the method as an interesting novel approach with the potential to provide new insights into multivariate oscillatory coupling dynamics. However, they agree that the present manuscript fails to clearly illustrate what kinds of information this method can provide that cannot be derived from more traditional analysis and what is the physiological significance of the observations made from the state space model. This may require both performing a new analysis of the existing data and a more profound characterization and interpretation of the present results. The results presented need to be interpreted in physiological terms and, in several cases, additional quantifications are needed in addition to the qualitative descriptions provided.</p><p>2. The method relies on filtering LFPs in discrete frequency bands. The terminology needs to be clarified not to confound power in a certain frequency band with specific oscillatory events (e.g. spindles). The limitations of using power time series on predefined frequency bands rather than physiologically defined events (like. spindles or ripples) need to be discussed.</p><p>3. Analysis of single-cell spiking dynamics is not well documented which makes it difficult to properly interpret them. Were pyramidal cells and interneurons classified? Can this approach be useful to uncover more 'subtle' physiological differences that those existing between pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons; or between REM and non-REM sleep stages in previous analysis? These questions can be addressed with additional descriptions and further analysis.</p><p>4. Several aspects of the analysis are not well justified or explained including the shuffling procedure for state occupancy, the choice of the number of states in Figure 6, how changes in oscillatory coupling between states were quantified, what is the relation of the state space with behavioral variables such as animal speed. In general, some parts of the result remain rather qualitative and descriptive. For those, additional quantifications and interpretations of their physiological significance need to be provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. One important limitation of this method, that is not mentioned in the text, is its reliance on filtering LFPs in pre-defined frequency bands. While this is a common approach in the field, there is also numerous evidence that some oscillations, such as 'γ', do not occur in a restricted narrow band. Another approach would be to first extract oscillatory components in an unbiased manner and then construct the state space. These caveats and alternative possibilities should be discussed.</p><p>2. On several occasions throughout the text causal language is used without proper justification (for example line 344). Such sentences need to be reworded carefully to distinguish what are mere correlations from actual causality.</p><p>3. Although several analyses were conducted to illustrate potential applications of the method, in most cases is not clear what type of new information can be obtained that is also not possible to obtain with more traditional approaches. An example of this can be found in the last paragraph of page 8. Quantifying the power (and other features) of different oscillations across brain states is something that has been done multiple times employing traditional approaches. The authors need to do a better job in trying to illustrate which specific type of analysis can be done or what type of information can be extracted with his method beyond what traditional ones offer. The analysis in Figures 5 to 7 are good steps in that direction, that could be further elaborated at the expense of reducing the first, more descriptive, part of the results.</p><p>4. Related to the previous point, a comparison that could be more interesting than REM vs non-REM is the same sleep state before and after the novel experience. While spectral changes between REM and non-REM are so obvious that can be shown with simpler analytical approaches, one could expect more subtle changes from pre to post-sleep for the same state. This could be an opportunity to showcase the power of this approach.</p><p>5. Results regarding Figure 5 are interesting but its description is merely qualitative. For example, in lines 223-226 some statements regarding the variable coupling of oscillations are made without any quantification/ statistics to back them up. Those should be provided either in the main text or figure legend.</p><p>6. The language describing Figure 6 is too vague and makes it difficult to understand what the author means exactly with expressions such as &quot;that transitions of the network from one region of the state space to another are plastic in nature&quot;.</p><p>7. In a similar way, some statements about results throughout the paper are made without statistical justification. As an example of this, an important demonstration of the robustness of the method would be to compare how similar is the state space across subjects. Such data is provided in Figure S4 and mentioned in the first section of the results but without any qualifications or statistics. These need to be provided. Are high and low firing rate cells mentioned as two subclasses of pyramidal cells or like the former includes fast-spiking interneurons? Both cell classes should not be merged.</p><p>8. I could not find anywhere a proper description of the single unit analysis. Even basic information such as if pyramidal cells and interneurons were separated is missing.</p><p>9. In the last section of the results Figure S12 is referred to as Figure 12 in most places.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80263.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

We have used this direction to modify the results of the figures 4,5 and 6 have been modified to clearly describe the advantages and new information that this method provides over the traditional ones.</p><p>Additions in results of Figure 4: In particular, non-REM states in sleep2 tended to concentrate in a region of increased power in the δ and β bands, which could be the results of increased interactions with cortical activity modulated in the same range. It is also likely that such effect was induced by the exposure to relevant behavioral experience. In fact, changes in density of individual oscillations after learning have been reported using traditional analytical methods and are thought to support memory consolidation (Bakker et al., 2015; Eschenko et al., 2008, 2006). Nevertheless, while traditional methods provide information about individual components, the novel approach used here provides additional information about the combinatorial shift in the dynamics of network oscillations after learning or exploration. Thus, it provides the basis for identifying how coordinated activity among different oscillations supports memory consolidation processes, as those occurring during non-REM sleep after exploration, which cannot be elucidated using traditional analytical methods.</p><p>Additions in results of Figure 5: Γ segregation and δ decoupling offer a picture of hippocampal REM sleep as being more akin to awake locomotion (with the major difference of a stronger medium γ presence) while also suggesting a substantial independence from cortical slow oscillations. On the other hand, the across-scale coherence of non-REM sleep is consistent with this sleep stage being dominated by brain-wide collective fluctuations engaging oscillations at every range. Distinct cross frequency coupling among various individual pairs of oscillations such as theta-γ, δ-γ etc., have been already reported (Bandarabadi et al., 2019; Clemens et al., 2009; Hammer et al., 2021; Scheffzük et al., 2011). However, computing cross frequency coupling on the state space provides the additional information on how multiple oscillations, obtained from distinct CA1 hippocampal layers (stratum pyramidale, stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum moleculare), are coupled with each other during distinct states of sleep and wakefulness. Furthermore, projecting the correlation matrices on 2D plane, provides a compact tool that allows to visualize the cross-frequency interactions among various hippocampal oscillations. Altogether, this approach reveals the complex nature of coupling dynamics occurring in hippocampus during distinct behavioral states.</p><p>Modifications in results of Figure 6: To investigate how learning during exploration affects the consequent sleep, we characterized state transition patterns during Sleep1 and Sleep2. By plotting outgoing trajectories on the network state space (Figure 6A), we visualized state transitions during sleep. We quantified the probability of state transitions among various sleep states (REM, non-REM etc.) in a transition matrix (Figure 6B). We calculated changes in transition probabilities across sleep trials by measuring average absolute change in probability (AACP, see methods). This allowed to quantify the amount of sleep state transitions altered after exploration/learning. To assess whether these changes in transition probabilities of sleep states are random or not, we generated 1000 pairs of sleep and awake trials by randomly shuffling state transitions from sleep data and computed transition matrices, difference matrix and their corresponding AACP. The AACP value of real data was then compared to the distribution of randomly shuffled trials. We observed that the AACP value of real data was beyond the 95th percentile of the distribution of shuffled data (Figure 6D), Altogether, this data highlights the specific alterations in general sleep architecture and hippocampal oscillatory landscape following learning/novel exploration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The ‘same’ states have identical spectral power and are thus overlapping on the state space. Alternatively, to assess the state specific alteration across sleep trials, we computed transition probabilities emerging from a given state across sleep trial. This provides an avenue to assess subtle changes in oscillatory state transition patterns after learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

To this regard, the language has been modified to indicate altered sleep state transitions after exploration/ learning.</p><p>Modifications in results describing Figure 6:</p><p>Alterations in Sleep State Transitions after Exploration / Learning</p><p>To investigate how learning during exploration affects the consequent sleep, we characterized state transition patterns during Sleep1 and Sleep2. By plotting outgoing trajectories on the network state space (Figure 6A), we visualized state transitions during sleep. We quantified the probability of state transitions among various sleep states (REM, non-REM etc.) in a transition matrix (Figure 6B). We calculated changes in transition probabilities across sleep trials by measuring average absolute change in probability (AACP, see methods).

We observed that the AACP value of real data was beyond the 95th percentile of the distribution of shuffled data (Figure 6D), Altogether, this data highlights the specific alterations in general sleep architecture and hippocampal oscillatory landscape following learning/novel exploration.</p><p>Intra-state sleep transitions are more plastic than Inter-state Transitions</p><p>We further examined which transitions on the state space are significantly altered across sleep trials. We computed AACP specifically for transition from REM/non-REM/intermediate sleep state to REM/non-REM/intermediate state. We found that transitions occurring from REM-to-REM sleep and non-REM-to-non-REM sleep (intra-state transitions) are more vulnerable to plasticity after exploration as compared to inter-state transitions (such as non-REM to REM, REM-to-intermediate etc.) (Figure 6E, F). These changes in intra-state transitions were observed to be beyond randomness (Figure S9 E, F) indicating a specificity in plastic changes in state transitions after exploration. In particular, while the average REM period duration is unaltered after exploration (Figure 4G), REM temporal structure is reorganized. In fact, increased probability of REM to REM transitions indicates a significant prolongation of REM bout duration. Similarly, the increase in non-REM to non-REM transition probability reflects an increased duration of non-REM bouts. Therefore, environment exploration was accompanied by an increased separation between REM and non-REM periods, possibly as a response to increased computational demands. More in general, the network state space allows to characterize the state transitions in hippocampus and how they are affected by novel experience or learning. By observing the state transition patterns, this analytical framework allows to detect and identify state-specific changes in the hippocampal oscillatory dynamics, beyond the possibilities offered by more traditional univariate and bivariate methods. We next investigated how fast the network flows on the state space and assessed whether the speed is uniform, or it exhibits specific region-dependent characteristics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
