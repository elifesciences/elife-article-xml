population of obese people that remain insulin sensitive. Similarly, recent work suggests that mice fed high carbohydrate diets can become obese without apparent glucose intolerance. To investigate this phenomenon further, we fed mice either a high fat (Hi-F) or high starch (Hi-ST) diet and measured adiposity, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and tissue lipids compared to control mice fed a standard laboratory chow. Both Hi-ST and Hi-F mice accumulated a similar amount of fat and tissue triglyceride compared to chow-fed mice. However, while Hi-F diet mice developed glucose intolerance as well as liver and muscle insulin resistance (assessed via euglycaemic/hyperinsulinaemic clamp), obese Hi-ST mice maintained glucose tolerance and insulin action similar to lean, chow-fed controls. This preservation of insulin action despite obesity in Hi-ST mice was associated with differences in de novo lipogenesis and levels of C22:0 ceramide in liver and C18:0 ceramide in muscle. This indicates that dietary manipulation can influence insulin action independently of the level of adiposity and that the presence of specific ceramide species correlates with these differences.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>insulin sensitivity</kwd><kwd>ceramide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship 1003313</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooney</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program grant 535921</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooney</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008713</institution-id><institution>Diabetes Australia Research Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooney</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mice made obese by feeding a high starch diet do not develop insulin resistance like mice made similarly obese by a high fat diet and this is associated with differences in specific bioactive ceramide species in liver and muscle tissue.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of dysregulated glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin and Li, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muoio and Newgard, 2006</xref>). However, the degree of insulin resistance does not always correlate with the extent of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gan et al., 2003</xref>) and there exists a population of individuals who are obese yet exhibit no difference in insulin action compared to groups of lean individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tonks et al., 2016</xref>), and lean individuals who are metabolically unhealthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stefan et al., 2017</xref>). These reports of obese individuals with preserved insulin action have led to the recognition of a population described as metabolically healthy obese (MHO) but the mechanisms behind the different metabolic profiles in equally obese individuals remain unclear. It has been suggested that MHO individuals are simply on a different trajectory to more overt metabolic dysfunction but there is also the possibility that genetic background, body fat distribution, or diet and exercise history might influence the relationship between obesity and insulin action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vilela et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gómez-Zorita et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Animal models used to investigate the mechanistic relationship between obesity and metabolic dysfunction normally employ a Hi-F diet regime (45–60% of total calories) to produce obesity and insulin resistance (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Small et al., 2018</xref>). As with humans, the level of insulin resistance observed in animal models does not necessarily correlate with the accumulation of fat in diet-induced obesity. It has been observed in mice and rats that insulin action measured by hyperinsulinaemic/euglycaemic clamp or glucose tolerance tests is decreased after 2 or 3 weeks of feeding a Hi-F diet but does not significantly worsen over the subsequent 10–20 weeks even though the animals continue to accumulate fat and become obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Turner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burchfield et al., 2018</xref>). There are also data showing that some strains of mice can become obese eating a Hi-F diet without deleterious effects on glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Montgomery et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stöckli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Appiakannan et al., 2020</xref>). Clearly genetic makeup can impact the relationship between obesity and glucoregulation, but less is known about the relative importance of diet composition and total fat mass in the regulation of insulin action at the whole body and tissue level. In a study assessing the impact of diet composition on longevity and metabolic health in mice, animals fed diets lower in protein and fat and higher in carbohydrate had the greatest median lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Solon-Biet et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, mice on these lower protein, higher carbohydrate diets also exhibited better measures of glucose tolerance despite accumulating similar amounts of adipose tissue to mice on Hi-F diets that exhibited poor glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Solon-Biet et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To further explore the relationship between diet composition, obesity, and insulin action in mice, we have examined body fat, glucose tolerance, and insulin action by hyperinsulinaemic/euglycaemic clamp in animals fed diets high in carbohydrate (starch) or high in fat (lard) and compared outcomes to mice fed standard laboratory chow. The results show that high-starch (Hi-ST) and Hi-F fed mice become equally obese compared to chow fed mice, but that only fat fed mice develop a significant degree of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. These findings suggest that, at least in mice, the composition of the current diet is a greater determinant of glucose homeostasis than the degree of adiposity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Body weight, composition, and whole body calorimetry</title><p>Mice fed a Hi-ST diet had a similar body weight trajectory to that of mice fed a Hi-F diet and by the end of the feeding period, both these groups were heavier than the chow controls and there was no significant difference in body weight between Hi-ST and Hi-F fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Body composition measured at 4, 6, and 12 weeks showed that this increase in body weight was due to an increase in fat mass as lean mass was similar between the three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

Hi-F fed mice displayed a lower respiratory quotient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>), indicating a higher ratio of lipid to carbohydrate oxidation, while Hi-ST mice showed an intermediate respiratory quotient between Hi-F mice and chow control mice possibly due to a higher dietary fat content of the Hi-ST diet compared to chow (calorically 21% vs. 6%, respectively).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>High starch (Hi-ST) and high fat (Hi-F) similarly increase body weight, fat mass, and food intake without changes in lean mass or energy expenditure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Body weight, n=18–20, (<bold>B</bold>) lean mass, (<bold>C</bold>) fat mass, n=8–10, (<bold>D</bold>) food intake, n=4 (averaged within cages), (<bold>E</bold>) energy expenditure, (<bold>F</bold>) 24 hr average of energy expenditure, (<bold>G</bold>) relationship between energy expenditure and body weight, (<bold>H</bold>) ambulatory activity, (<bold>I</bold>) respiratory exchange ratio (RER), (<bold>J</bold>) 24 hr average of RER, n=8–10.

The glucose excursions showed a similar pattern to that seen previously, with Hi-ST mice having improved glucose tolerance compared to the Hi-F mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). While the plasma 6,6-<sup>2</sup>H-glucose enrichment curves were similar in all three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), there was a significant and consistent difference in the exogenous glucose concentration curves, with Hi-F being higher than chow and Hi-ST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), thus indicating that Hi-ST mice had improved whole body glucose disposal during the oGTT when compared to Hi-F. When endogenous glucose levels were expressed as a change from baseline, there were only small changes evident between Hi-ST and Hi-F at 15 and 30 min post glucose load, suggesting that Hi-ST mice may have also had a brief period of enhanced endogenous glucose production (EGP) suppression during the early period (0–30 min) of the OGTT compared to Hi-F mice.</p><p>Since both the Hi-F and the Hi-ST animals exhibited higher insulin levels during the oGTT, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was investigated in isolated islets from the different dietary groups to see if there were any differences. The amount of insulin released from isolated islets in response to 16.7 mM glucose was similar in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), however there was an increase in insulin content that was only significant in the Hi-F group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>).

All three groups had similar basal NEFA (chow 0.73±0.07; Hi-ST 0.78±0.08; Hi-F 0.67±0.09 mM) and were able to suppress NEFA levels to a similar extent (chow 0.18±0.03; Hi-ST 0.22±0.03; Hi-F 0.29±0.05 mM). The glucose infusion rate (GIR) needed to maintain euglycaemia was lower in the Hi-F animals compared to both the chow and Hi-ST, indicating a reduced whole body insulin action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>; p&gt;0.05), while there was no significant difference in GIR between the obese Hi-ST and lean chow control mice. Insulin infusion increased glucose disposal in all three groups and while the insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in Hi-F mice was lower than chow or Hi-ST mice, the difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.079). Although there was no difference in the basal hepatic glucose production, the ability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose output (HGO) was impaired in the Hi-F animals when compared to both the chow and Hi-ST groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Tissue glucose uptake data clearly demonstrated that there was preservation of skeletal and heart muscle insulin action in the Hi-ST mice, while the Hi-F showed reduced insulin action indicative of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). White adipose tissue (WAT) however was insulin resistant in both the Hi-ST and Hi-F groups compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). On the other hand, brown adipose tissue (BAT) glucose uptake was fully preserved in the Hi-ST group while being significantly reduced in the Hi-F fed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). The differences in insulin sensitivity of liver or quadriceps muscle were not associated with significant differences in the phosphorylation status of Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and K</xref>, respectively).

However, there have now been several reports of individuals with significant obesity but little, or no, difference in metabolic parameters such as insulin resistance when compared to a lean healthy group of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tonks et al., 2016</xref>). What makes these obese individuals apparently protected from metabolic disease remains unclear and although there are some mouse models that exhibit a similar obese, insulin-sensitive phenotype these have been produced by genetic manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hotamisligil et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Animal models used to investigate the relationship between obesity and insulin action often use a diet high in fat and high in simple carbohydrates (sucrose, fructose) to cause fat gain, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malik et al., 2010</xref>). Dietary manipulation models in mice may have more relevance to humans than monogenic models of obesity as overconsumption of calories invariably leads to an increase in fat mass in both mice and humans. The current study reports on a dietary intervention that produces significant obesity but maintains normal insulin action in mice providing some mechanistic understanding of the phenomenon of obesity with preserved insulin sensitivity.</p><p>Mice fed a Hi-ST diet were found to have a similar (but not identical) glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared to lean chow controls, even though they accumulated the same amount of fat mass as mice fed a Hi-F diet. As mentioned above, an increased amount of adipose tissue is usually associated with poor glucose tolerance, decreased insulin action, and detrimental metabolic outcomes. Thus the differential glucose homeostasis and insulin action but similar increased fat mass of the Hi-ST and Hi-F mice provides a useful dichotomy to investigate any mechanistic relationship between diet, fat mass, and insulin action. Our results suggest that adipocytes are unlikely to mediate the maintenance of whole body sensitivity in Hi-ST mice as absolute mass, adipocyte size (i.e. cross-sectional area), and adipose tissue depot insulin sensitivity were similar between Hi-ST and Hi-F fed mice. Therefore, the tissues responsible for the bulk of whole body glucose metabolism, liver and muscle, were more likely to exhibit differences that contribute to our understanding of the maintenance of clamp insulin sensitivity in the presence of obesity in Hi-ST fed mice. Glucose tolerance was also similar in chow and Hi-ST fed mice despite the obesity in Hi-ST mice. However, there were differences in basal insulinaemia and insulin response during the glucose tolerance test that indicate that there were metabolic differences between chow and Hi-ST mice even though measures of glucose tolerance and clamp insulin sensitivity were similar. Interestingly, despite the preservation of clamp insulin sensitivity in Hi-ST mice, both liver and muscle of these mice had equivalent amounts of triglyceride storage as observed in Hi-F mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, differences in ectopic triglyceride levels in liver and muscle cannot explain the divergent insulin action in Hi-ST and Hi-F mice. Further investigations into the source of the greater fat deposition in Hi-ST and Hi-F mice showed that Hi-ST animals had an increased rate of DNL in liver and increased levels of enzymes involved in the DNL pathway, while in the Hi-F group, levels of these enzymes were decreased compared to chow and Hi-ST fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that upregulation of pathways converting carbohydrate to lipid could underpin the ability of Hi-ST mice to clear glucose and maintain insulin sensitivity. This data indicates that synthesising fat for storage from dietary carbohydrate is less detrimental to insulin action and glucose homeostasis than metabolising and storing fat from the diet. It seems mechanistically plausible that an animal consuming mainly carbohydrate would maintain or increase capacity for utilising this nutrient even if the end result is storage of triglyceride, while an animal consuming mainly fat would increase capacity for utilising fat and downregulate carbohydrate metabolic pathways.</p><p>Since triglycerides are thought to be a metabolically benign form of lipid, we performed targeted lipidomic analysis on muscle and liver of the clamped mice to investigate changes in other lipid species. Differences in lipid species were detected between Hi-F and Hi-ST, particularly in ceramides, that have been shown previously to correlate with insulin sensitivity/resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tonks et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turpin-Nolan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergman et al., 2016</xref>). In skeletal muscle, Cer18:0 was increased in the Hi-F group compared to chow and Hi-ST animals. This is similar to the observation in humans where obese, insulin-sensitive individuals have similar levels of Cer18:0 to lean individuals, while obese, insulin-resistant individuals had increased levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tonks et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies have also shown Cer18:0 content in muscle to be increased in mice fed a Hi-F diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turpin-Nolan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frangioudakis et al., 2010</xref>) while reductions of Cer18:0, through deletion of ceramide synthase 1, has been associated with improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turpin-Nolan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Błachnio-Zabielska et al., 2022</xref>). Our data also showed a negative correlation between skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity (insulin-stimulated glucose uptake) and muscle Cer18:0 levels. A similar relationship has previously been demonstrated in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Perreault et al., 2018</xref>). However, this relationship has not always been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Turner et al., 2018</xref>). DAGs are postulated to be mediators of insulin resistance, providing a link between increased lipid and reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birkenfeld and Shulman, 2014</xref>). DAG content was increased in the Hi-F and the Hi-ST muscle to a similar extent and therefore cannot explain the differential insulin action observed between Hi-ST and Hi-F mice. Taken together, our data suggests that increased Cer18:0 is more closely linked to the development of (Hi-F) skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Mechanistically, it has been suggested that changes in ceramide levels reduce insulin action by altering insulin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Summers et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, we observed no difference in insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt in all three dietary groups suggesting that the mechanism relating changes in ceramide to reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle are not well defined and require further investigation. Another point to consider is that it has been suggested that the cellular distribution of DAGs, and ceramides, is more relevant to changes in insulin action than the total levels in tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Perreault et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Szendroedi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2017</xref>), but this was not investigated in our study.</p><p>In the liver, DAGs were increased in both the Hi-F and Hi-ST to a similar degree when compared to the chow controls and therefore the differences in insulin sensitivity observed in liver of Hi-ST and Hi-F mice are unlikely to be directly linked to differences in total DAG levels or differences in specific species (although the caveat of DAG cellular distribution still remains). However, ceramide species were different, particularly Cer22:0, which was one of the most abundant species. This particular species was increased in the Hi-F animals and was increased to a lesser extent in the Hi-ST, reflecting the intermediate protection against insulin resistance observed in the livers of the Hi-ST mice. Cer22:0 was also negatively correlated with the suppression of HGO, indicating that it may be involved in the development of insulin resistance. Previous studies have shown Cer22:0 to be increased in livers of people with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Razak Hady et al., 2019</xref>) and Hi-F fed rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Montgomery et al., 2016</xref>). Some studies investigating the role of ceramides in liver insulin resistance have implicated Cer16:0 as an important species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Raichur et al., 2019</xref>). In our study, this species was higher in the Hi-F animals but did not reach statistical significance. Our study clearly indicates that Hi-F diet-induced insulin resistance in muscle and liver is associated with increased DAG and ceramide levels, but that only lower levels of specific ceramides species correlate with the maintenance of insulin sensitivity, despite significant obesity and accumulation of tissue TAG in Hi-ST mice.</p><p>There has been some debate in recent times about the exact nature of the relationship between obesity and dysregulated glucose metabolism. While the majority of obese people exhibit some level of insulin resistance, there are obese individuals of both genders who have metabolic profiles indistinguishable from lean individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Samocha-Bonet et al., 2012</xref>). Whether these obese, insulin-sensitive people are on a trajectory to inevitable metabolic disease or have a genetic background or lifestyle that protects against metabolic disease, despite obesity, remains an area of current research interest. One recent systematic review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vilela et al., 2021</xref>) suggests that healthy eating patterns can influence the metabolic profile of otherwise obese individuals while other reviews suggest the variation in criteria used to classify obese metabolically healthy people make it difficult to draw conclusions about mechanisms for metabolic differences in similarly obese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gómez-Zorita et al., 2021</xref>). As reflected in our results in mice, it remains a possibility that the current diet may have a significant impact on insulin sensitivity irrespective of the obesity status of an individual. It is well documented that the availability of specific types of nutrients can alter glucose homeostasis in animals and humans. Acute infusion of lipids lowers insulin sensitivity within a few hours in humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoy et al., 2009</xref>) and people undergoing routine screening with an oGTT are advised to consume largely carbohydrate foods for 24–48 hr before testing because of the effects of consuming fatty foods on subsequent glucose clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaneko et al., 1998</xref>). Together, this data suggests that a proportion of insulin action is adaptive and may be modulated by changing the diet over a relatively short period. This mechanism would enable organisms to conserve glucose for tissues unable to utilise fatty acids, such as the brain and central nervous system, during periods of carbohydrate scarcity.</p><p>Overall, our findings that mice fed a Hi-ST diet remain glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive despite having excess adipose tissue demonstrates that recent nutritional intake is an important factor in determining glucose homeostasis. Although the Hi-ST fed mice were not identical to lean control mice (they exhibited basal hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia), this dietary rodent model of insulin-sensitive obesity may be useful for investigating mechanisms involved in obesity-related insulin resistance. The differences in lipid composition in skeletal muscle and liver between Hi-ST and Hi-F mice also support the idea that individual lipid species may be more important determinants of insulin resistance than total lipid levels and therapeutic approaches that alter these specific lipids could have beneficial metabolic effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All experimental procedures performed were approved by the Garvan Institute/St Vincent’s Hospital Animal Ethics Committee and were in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia’s guidelines on animal experimentation (protocol number 14_07).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male C57BL/6J<sub>Arc</sub> mice (8 weeks of age) were sourced from Animal Resource Centre (Perth, Australia) and after a 1 week acclimatisation period, mice were randomly assigned to receive either a standard chow diet (6% fat, 23% protein, and 71% carbohydrate, by calories; Gordon Specialty feeds, Sydney, Australia; energy density 13.0 kJ/g), a Hi-ST diet (22% protein, 57% carbohydrate, 21% fat, by calories), or a lard-based, Hi-F diet (22% protein, 21% carbohydrate, 57% fat, by calories), made in house and were available ad libitum.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Will L Holland (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to address issues regarding body weight and composition, raised by Reviewer #1.</p><p>2) The authors need to address issues regarding adipose signaling and lipolysis, raised by Reviewer #2.</p><p>The reviewing editor and referees have agreed that addressing other issues would make the paper stronger, but is not essential for the publication of this work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>These studies tested whether obesity is always necessarily associated with insulin resistance or whether there are instances in which obesity does not promote insulin resistance. To this end, the authors fed mice either a low-fat chow diet, a high-fat diet HFD, or a high-starch diet (HSD). Although HFD and HSD-fed mice became equally obese, only HFD-fed mice displayed overt insulin resistance. HSD-fed mice displayed markers of increased de novo lipogenesis and carbohydrate handling, suggesting an improved ability to dispose of carbohydrates. Overall, these are important studies that add nuance to the common connection between obesity and insulin resistance.</p><p>Some issues that should be addressed are as follows:</p><p>1. Looking at the body weight and body composition data in Figure 1, there appears to be a significant discrepancy between the measurements of lean mass and fat mass, and total mass. Although body composition excluded total body water, there appears to be a ~5g difference between total body weight and the sum of fat and lean mass in the obese mice (both HFD and HSD). The authors should explain this difference and whether it can be accounted for by body water.</p><p>2. The following statement on page 11, lines 212-214 could use some modification: &quot;Additionally, this data suggests that in diet-induced obese mice, hepatic insulin resistance seems to be the largest contributing factor to GIR during a clamp&quot;. This may be true, but the data can only support this statement only under the conditions used in these studies. Based on the description of the clamp in the methods, insulin infusion rates were calculated based on a 30g mouse. Although the rationale for this is clear and justified, this may lead to an unintended consequence that impacts the interpretation of the data. The insulin levels achieved for the chow-fed mice will be adequate, but 30g is significantly smaller than the body weight in HFD and HSD-fed mice. Thus, these mice were exposed to lower insulin levels relative to their body weight. Since the liver is more sensitive to insulin than are non-hepatic tissues, lower relative insulin levels are likely to result in a bias towards hepatic phenotypes. It is possible that if insulin infusions had been calculated based on body weight, differences in glucose disappearance may have been observed. This should be taken into consideration for the statement above.</p><p>3. It would be interesting to determine whether insulin clearance and levels of incretin hormones are different between HFD and HSD-fed mice if the authors still have sufficient plasma samples from the oGTTs to measure C-peptide and GLP-1 levels.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This was a nicely performed study that will be important in the field. Too commonly, mouse models of obesity are used without the complete characterization of their effects on insulin sensitivity with the assumption that obesity always leads to insulin resistance.</p><p>Given the well-published connection between adipose tissue insulin resistance and lipolysis to HGP, the authors should add additional experiments from the clamp studies to solids the effects of insulin action on white fat. Circulating levels of glycerol and FFAs should be reported. Additionally, canonical insulin signaling via AKT in white adipose tissue should be reported. These studies will help define the underlying mechanisms driving the increase in HGP following the HFD diet and would be important to add to the body of literature suggesting lipolysis is a key determinant of liver insulin sensitivity. Moreover, it would be important to know if insulin signaling in white adipose is also unaffected like liver and muscle or if white fat behaves differently. Understanding this would also allow for proper interpretation of Figure 4, which documents increased adipose tissue weight and size despite decreased glucose uptake (Figure 3).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79250.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Some issues that should be addressed are as follows:</p><p>1.

Looking at the animals that were both weighed and had their body composition assessed, the fat mass and lean mass accounts for approximately 90% of the body mass and total free body water could account for the rest. Body water was excluded from the body composition analysis as described in the methods (line 472) because it significantly increases the time required for analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Insulin action in all tissues will be determined by the circulating availability of insulin and not by the plasma level relative to body weight. We achieved this (Figure 3B) by infusing a standard dose of insulin as basal levels of insulin were already elevated in the Hi-F and Hi-ST groups which we knew from the GTT data and from previous experiments clamping obese mice/rats. We agree with the reviewer that clamps are not physiological conditions and the circulating level of insulin achieved in the clamp setting (~150uU/ml) was higher than seen in any of the groups in the oGTT (~80uU/ml in the Hi-F and Hi-ST), which is likely to be a more physiological response. This is why we believe that our statement is correct as we very specifically say that hepatic insulin resistance seems to be the largest contributing factor to GIR during a clamp and not in the physiological setting. However, we have modified this sentence so that it now reads:</p><p>“Additionally, this data suggests that in diet-induced obese mice, hepatic insulin resistance seems to be the largest contributing factor to the lower GIR during a clamp, while during a GTT, hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance seem to make similar contributions to the relative glucose intolerance observed in Hi-F mice (Figure 2 I,J).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We are ethically limited in the volume and number of blood samples we can take during an oGTT and insulin was considered a priority. We will keep this in mind for future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This was a nicely performed study that will be important in the field.

Unfortunately, we do not have any basal plasma samples left to do the glycerol determination.</p><p>Due to the similar NEFA suppression, similar adipocyte hypertrophy as well as similar insulin resistance seen in adipose depots of both dietary intervention groups, we believe the differences in metabolism of white adipose tissue is not playing a particular role in the differences in whole-body, muscle or hepatic insulin resistance observed in the different diet groups. This is the reason why we did not pursue additional biochemical or signalling measurements in white adipose. However, in line with the reviewers request, we have inserted Akt phosphorylation for the eWAT and sWAT into figure 3 which also shows no difference in signalling between the groups (Figure 3L and M).</p></body></sub-article></article>
