Hyperactivation of KRAS in almost all tumours drives RAC1 activation, conferring enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is well understood as a nutrient scavenging mechanism, but little is known about its functions in trafficking of signalling receptors. We find that CYRI-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of <italic>Cyrib</italic> (the gene encoding CYRI-B protein) accelerates tumourigenesis, leading to enhanced ERK and JNK-induced proliferation in precancerous lesions, indicating a potential role as a buffer of RAC1 hyperactivation in early stages. However, as disease progresses, loss of CYRI-B inhibits metastasis. CYRI-B depleted tumour cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumour spread, due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1. Overall, we implicate CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signalling in pancreatic cancer, providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease with limited treatment options. It is also associated with high rates of metastasis – meaning it spreads to other areas of the body. Environmental pressures, such as a lack of the nutrients metastatic cancer cells need to grow and divide, can change how the cells behave. Understanding the changes that allow cancer cells to respond to these pressures could reveal new treatment options for pancreatic cancer.</p><p>When nutrients are scarce, metastatic cancer cells can gather molecules and nutrients by capturing large amounts of the fluid that surrounds them using a mechanism called macropinocytosis. They can also migrate to areas of the body with higher nutrient levels, through a process called chemotaxis. This involves cells moving towards areas with higher levels of certain molecules. For example, cancer cells migrate towards high levels of a lipid called lysophosphatidic acid, which promotes their growth and survival.</p><p>A newly discovered protein known as CYRI-B has recently been shown to regulate how cells migrate and take up nutrients. It also interacts with proteins known to be involved in pancreatic cancer progression. Therefore, Nikolaou et al. set out to investigate whether CYRI-B also plays a role in metastatic pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Experiments in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer showed that CYRI-B levels were high in pancreatic tumour cells. And when the gene for CYRI-B was removed from the tumour cells, they did not metastasise. Further analysis revealed that CYRI-B controls uptake and processing of nutrients and other signalling molecules through macropinocytosis. In particular, it ensures uptake of the receptor for lysophosphatidic acid, allowing the metastatic cancer cells to migrate.</p><p>The findings of Nikolaou et al. reveal that CYRI-B is involved in metastasis of cancer cells in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. This new insight into how metastasis is controlled could help to identify future targets for treatments that aim to prevent pancreatic cancer cells spreading to distant sites.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macropinocytosis</kwd><kwd>actin cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A24452</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Machesky</surname><given-names>Laura M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A17196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Juin</surname><given-names>Amelie</given-names></name><name><surname>Whitelaw</surname><given-names>Jamie A</given-names></name><name><surname>Paul</surname><given-names>Nikki R</given-names></name><name><surname>Fort</surname><given-names>Loic</given-names></name><name><surname>Nixon</surname><given-names>Colin</given-names></name><name><surname>Spence</surname><given-names>Heather J</given-names></name><name><surname>Bryson</surname><given-names>Sheila</given-names></name><name><surname>Machesky</surname><given-names>Laura M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A31287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Juin</surname><given-names>Amelie</given-names></name><name><surname>Whitelaw</surname><given-names>Jamie A</given-names></name><name><surname>Paul</surname><given-names>Nikki R</given-names></name><name><surname>Fort</surname><given-names>Loic</given-names></name><name><surname>Nixon</surname><given-names>Colin</given-names></name><name><surname>Spence</surname><given-names>Heather J</given-names></name><name><surname>Bryson</surname><given-names>Sheila</given-names></name><name><surname>Machesky</surname><given-names>Laura M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>EPSRC UKRI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/T00213/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Machesky</surname><given-names>Laura M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRCPG100017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Machesky</surname><given-names>Laura M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Macropinocytosis of the signalling receptor LPAR1, by an actin and CYRI-B-dependent mechanism, impacts on progression and spread of pancreatic cancer in a mouse model.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly metastatic with low survival rates and few treatment options. PDAC is thought to arise from precancerous non-invasive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanINs) classified as PanIN1–3 depending on the molecular and histological characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hruban et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hruban et al., 2007</xref>). PanINs arise from acinar cells that undergo acinar to ductal metaplasia changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) and as mutations accrue, PanINs progress to full PDAC in which angiogenesis, infiltration of stromal cells, and invasion of the basement membrane occur as tumours progress. Metastasis is a complex process and the current gold standard mouse model of metastatic PDAC - the KPC (KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, p53<sup>R172H</sup>, Pdx-1-Cre) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hingorani et al., 2005</xref>) recapitulates multiple features of the human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hwang et al., 2016</xref>). Cytoskeletal and migration-associated proteins have been associated with aggression and metastasis in PDAC both in human patient transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>) and in the KPC mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting avenues to pursue against metastatic spread.</p><p>Downstream of active KRAS, hyperactivation of the small GTPase RAC1 drives proliferation and cytoskeletal remodelling in PDAC and other cancers. Deletion of RAC1 in a KRAS-driven mouse model of PDAC delayed tumour onset, reduced PanIN lesions, and improved survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). This led to the conclusion that dysregulation of RAC1 control of epithelial polarity by active KRAS drives acinar to ductal metaplasia and accelerates tumourigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heid et al., 2011</xref>). RAC1 regulates polarity and migration via Scar/WAVE-Arp2/3 control of actin dynamics at cell-cell contacts and at the cell leading edge. Additionally, coordinated RAC1 activation and deactivation are important in macropinocytosis, an actin-driven process whereby cells engulf extracellular substances via large cup-shaped protrusions of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Egami et al., 2014</xref>). Extracellular stimulation of cell surface receptors, such as tyrosine kinase or G-protein-coupled receptors, can trigger macropinocytosis via RAC1 and the Scar/WAVE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckley and King, 2017</xref>). Tumours are frequently starved for amino acids and other nutrients and macropinocytosis is a major way for PDAC tumours to take up proteins, lipids, and cell debris from their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Commisso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hobbs and Der, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamphorst et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Puccini et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yao et al., 2019</xref>). Macropinocytosis also provides cells with a mechanism for internalisation of signalling receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clayton and Cousin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stow et al., 2020</xref>), but whether this has consequences for tumour progression is unknown.</p><p>Metastasis is a complex process, involving cells breaching through tissue barriers, migrating and settling in distant sites in the body such as the liver, lungs, and peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nikolaou and Machesky, 2020</xref>). Chemotaxis is thought to be a key driver of metastasis and pancreatic cancer cells migrate towards lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) both in vitro and in vivo, contributing to metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papalazarou et al., 2020</xref>). LPA is a serum-derived chemotactic factor and was previously found to be consumed by melanoma and PDAC cells creating self-generated gradients contributing to metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muinonen-Martin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the CYRI-B protein (<bold><underline>Cy</underline></bold>fip-related <bold><underline>R</underline></bold>AC1-<bold><underline>i</underline></bold>nteracting protein B, formerly known as Fam49-B) was discovered to interact with RAC1 and enhance leading edge actin dynamics by negatively regulating activation of the Scar/WAVE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fort et al., 2018</xref>). Scar/WAVE is a pentameric complex that interacts with both RAC1 and Arp2/3 complex and triggers actin assembly in lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Insall and Machesky, 2009</xref>). Depletion of CYRI-B in cultured cells enhanced lamellipodia stability, but did not impair migration speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fort et al., 2018</xref>). CYRI proteins also play an important role in macropinocytosis, via the RAC1-Scar/WAVE pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le et al., 2021</xref>). These roles, along with the previous implication of RAC1 signalling in early and later stages of PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), suggested potential involvement of CYRI in invasion and metastasis. Here, we demonstrate that CYRI-B is highly expressed in PDAC and can contribute to PDAC development, progression, and metastasis. We discover a role for CYRI-B in signalling that drives proliferation in early lesions. Later, during metastasis, we find that CYRI-B is required for chemotaxis towards LPA, implicating macropinocytic uptake of LPAR1 in PDAC metastasis. Our study highlights CYRI-B as a potentially interesting new target in PDAC progression and metastasis and further elucidates the molecular mechanisms underpinning metastatic spread.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CYRI-B expression increases in precancerous lesions and PDAC</title><p>The <italic>Cyrib</italic> gene resides on human chromosome 8q24, near c-Myc, and is frequently amplified in many types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nikolaou and Machesky, 2020</xref>). High expression of CYRI-B correlates with poor outcome in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2022a</xref>), including in human pancreatic cancer. To further investigate a potential role for <italic>Cyrib</italic> in pancreatic cancer, we first assessed the expression of CYRI-B in the KPC mouse model of metastatic PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hingorani et al., 2005</xref>). In this model, PanIN develops by around 10 weeks and progresses to later stages towards 15 weeks, with full-blown PDAC appearing at this stage and mice reaching end-point with a half time of median 150–200 days. As we do not currently have a reliable antibody to detect CYRI-B protein in tissue samples, tissue samples from 6-, 10-, 15-week-old KPC mice were processed for RNA in situ hybridisation (ISH). At 6 weeks, before appearance of PanIN, <italic>Cyrib</italic> was not detected in the pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>Cyrib</italic> expression was detectable by 10 weeks, especially around PanIN lesions, which remained stable until 15 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

RAC1 can drive cell proliferation through activation of both JNK and ERK downstream signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bagrodia et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coso et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rul et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we probed histological sections of pancreatic tissues from 15-week-old KPC and CKPC mice for pJNK and pERK. Consistent with enhanced RAC1 signalling, we observed a significant increase in the percentage pERK area and pJNK area from pancreata of CKPC mice vs KPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>). We next investigated proliferation using BrdU injections at 15 weeks and found increased BrdU positive nuclei in the CKPC tissues in comparison with the KPC, suggesting enhanced proliferation in the abnormal ductal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref>). Indeed, CKPC mice presented with increased pancreatic weight to body mass ratio at 15 weeks, in agreement with increased proliferation of preneoplastic and neoplastic cells, whereas at 10 weeks of age there was no difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Thus, loss of <italic>Cyrib</italic> in the KPC model accelerates PanIN formation and progression, likely due to loss of CYRI-B’s capacity to buffer RAC1 activation downstream of active KRAS leading to abnormal architecture, combined with hyperactivation of ERK and JNK to drive proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CYRI-B regulates metastatic potential</title><p>The KPC mouse model is characterised by high metastatic rates to clinically relevant organs such as liver, diaphragm, and bowel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hingorani et al., 2005</xref>).

In summary, CYRI-B is required for efficient metastatic seeding of KPC cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CYRI-B deletion reduces chemotactic potential</title><p>Since we found that CYRI-B can influence the metastatic seeding of KPC cells, we sought to investigate whether CYRI-B can affect their chemotactic potential. Chemotaxis is a major driver of metastasis away from the primary tumour and towards sites rich in attractants, such as blood vessels. It was previously shown that the signalling lipid, LPA, which is found in blood serum, is an important chemoattractant driving melanoma and PDAC metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muinonen-Martin et al., 2010</xref>). LPA drives chemotaxis of KPC cells and can be sensed by the LPA receptor 1 (LPAR1), present at the plasma membrane of PDAC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juin et al., 2019</xref>). We generated an independent CKPC cell line, CKPC-1, derived directly from CKPC tumours and rescued with CYRI-B-p17-GFP or GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To confirm the phenotype, CKPC-1 GFP or rescued cells were seeded on fibronectin-coated glass and stained for ArpC2 to assess the localisation of the Arp2/3 complex at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). CKPC-1 GFP cells presented with more lamellipodia, larger area, and increased ArpC2 recruitment to the leading edge in comparison with the rescued cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>) in line with previous results for other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fort et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Using Insall chemotaxis chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muinonen-Martin et al., 2010</xref>), we investigated whether CKPC-1 cells can migrate up fetal bovine serum (FBS) gradients, which are a rich source of LPA. Both spider plots and rose plots showing the paths of individual cells and the mean resultant vector of migration, respectively, revealed that CKPC-1 cells (expressing GFP as a control) have dramatically reduced chemotactic potential towards FBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>). On the contrary, re-expressing GFP-tagged CYRI-B in CKPC-1 cells fully restored chemotaxis and directed migration towards FBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>). CKPC-1 rescued with GFP-tagged CYRI-B were also treated with LPA antagonist KI16425 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohta et al., 2003</xref>) showing that inhibition of LPAR1 and -3 by KI16425 abolished chemotactic steering, consistent with LPA being the major attractant in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>). We have focussed on LPAR1 because we previously found that LPAR1 and not LPAR3 was the major chemotactic receptor expressed in PDAC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juin et al., 2019</xref>). To further confirm that CYRI-B affects the chemotactic potential of PDAC cells, KPC control and <italic>Cyrib</italic> CRISPR cells were also assessed for their chemotactic ability towards serum (10% FBS) using Insall chambers. Deletion of <italic>Cyrib</italic> (Ex3 and Ex4) did not change the proliferation rate of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), but reduced chemotactic migration in comparison with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, CYRI-B is required for chemotactic migration towards serum LPA in PDAC cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>CYRI-B localises on macropinocytic cups and vesicles</title><p>Having shown that CYRI-B can influence the metastatic seeding of KPC tumours in vivo by regulating chemotactic migration, we further probed the role CYRI-B in chemotaxis. We first examined dynamic localisation of CYRI-B, using GFP-labelled CYRI-B (CYRI-B-p17-GFP) and live-cell imaging of both COS-7 cells and CKPC cells. Interestingly, CYRI-B was present on internal vesicles and tubules that connect with the vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>).

Chemotaxis towards LPA requires the fine coordination of multiple proteins at the cell leading edge in order to sense LPA, internalise the LPAR1 receptor, and recycle it back to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muinonen-Martin et al., 2010</xref>).

Indeed, upon CYRI-B internalisation, LPAR1 is also internalised with a lifetime of ~58 s, consistent with LPAR-1 trafficking via CYRI-B positive macropinocytic events in PDAC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video2">Figure 8—video 2</xref>). AsPC-1 cells transiently transfected with CYRI-B-GFP and LPAR1-mCherry also showed a co-localisation of CYRI-B-GFP and LPAR1 on macropinosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, LPAR1 is at least partially internalised via CYRI-B-mediated macropinocytosis. While it would be desirable to demonstrate the presence of endogenous LPAR-1 in macropinocytic cups, we are at present unable to localise endogenous LPAR1 with any available antibodies (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juin et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>CYRI-B controls chemotactic migration via macropinocytic LPAR-1 internalisation and membrane localisation</title><p>Having found that CYRI-B co-localises with LPAR1 and deletion of CYRI-B affects the chemotactic ability of PDAC cells to migrate in vitro and in vivo, we investigated whether CYRI-B could influence the trafficking of LPAR-1. Initial work showed that CKPC-1 cells expressing either GFP or CYRI-B-p17-GFP following stable transfection did not alter mRNA levels of LPAR1 or LPAR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that changes in the chemotactic ability of the cells is not likely due to alterations in the expression level of the LPARs. Since CYRI-B alters the shape of CKPC cells, we also checked whether the localisation of LPAR is changed. CKPC-1 cells (with stable expression of GFP or CYRI-B-p17-GFP) were transfected with HA-LPAR1 and fixed for immunofluorescence. Cells displayed localisation of HA-LPAR1 at the plasma membrane and internal vesicles, as expected from previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juin et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Cyrib</italic> knockout cells (expressing GFP-only) showed high levels of leading edge membrane localisation of LPAR1 in comparison with the CYRI-B-p17-GFP rescued cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).</p><p>The combined evidence of the role of CYRI-B on macropinocytic uptake, the co-internalisation of CYRI-B with LPAR1, as well as the increase in peripherally accumulated LPAR1 led us to ask whether CYRI-B can affect the internalisation of LPAR1. We performed an image-based internalisation assay, using CKPC-1 stable GFP and CYRI-B-p17-GFP cells that were transfected with LPAR-1-mCherry and serum-starved overnight. Cells were stimulated with 10% FBS for 15 min and fixed to measure the internalisation of LPAR1. Previous reports suggested that stimulation of cells with serum should cause an increase in the internalisation of GPCRs including LPAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2014</xref>). CYRI-B rescued cells showed a serum-stimulated enhancement of LPAR1 internalisation, while CYRI-B depleted cells showed minimal stimulation of LPAR1 uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>). While LPAR1 may be internalised by multiple endocytic pathways, the dependence on CYRI-B suggests that LPAR-1 is one cargo of CYRI-B-dependent macropinocytosis, perhaps together with integrin and other receptors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le et al., 2021</xref>), regulating surface levels and chemotactic migration.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Loss of CYRI-B reduces LPAR1 internalisation upon serum stimulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence images of CKPC-1 stable cells transfected with GFP or CYRI-B-p17-GFP.

Our previous cell biology studies highlighted a role for CYRI-B as a buffer of RAC1-mediated actin assembly in lamellipodia and macropinocytic cups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fort et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le et al., 2021</xref>), but did not address the potential role that CYRI-B could play in tumourigenesis and metastasis, given its central role as a regulator of motility.</p><p>We noticed that CYRI-B was highly expressed in human pancreatic cancers and correlated with poorer survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nikolaou and Machesky, 2020</xref>). Increased expression of CYRI-B in mice with PDAC suggested that this model could help to reveal the role of CYRI-B in human PDAC. We might predict, based on amplified expression of CYRI-B, that RAC1 activity might be dampened down at least during some stages of tumourigenesis. Having a buffer for RAC1 activity could provide advantages for tumours, where mutations in KRAS will drive high activation of RAC1, which might be detrimental to cell survival due to enhanced reactive oxygen species production and enhanced downstream signalling. While we were not able to measure RAC1 activity in tumours directly, it would be desirable to do this in the future, using such tools as a RAC1 FRET biosensor mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Floerchinger et al., 2021</xref>). It would also be interesting to determine whether CYRI-A is involved in pancreatic cancer progression, as we previously implicated this protein in RAC1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yelland et al., 2021</xref>) and macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le et al., 2021</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a correlation between CYRI-A expression and prognosis in human pancreatic tumours (e.g. Human Protein Atlas <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000197872-CYRIA/pathology">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000197872-CYRIA/pathology</ext-link>). In contrast, CYRI-A appears to have prognostic potential in both renal and urothelial cancers, suggesting a possible tissue specificity (see Human Protein Atlas <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000197872-CYRIA/pathology">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000197872-CYRIA/pathology</ext-link>).</p><p>Deletion of <italic>Cyrib</italic> in the pancreas, in concert with expression of KRAS <sup>G12D</sup> and p53 <sup>R172H</sup>, led to acceleration of PanIN formation and an increase in the area of pancreas showing lesions with high phospho-ERK and phospho-JNK, two crucial downstream targets of KRAS and RAC1 that drive proliferation and expansion. These results support the idea that CYRI-B could buffer RAC1 activity in early tumourigenesis, but there are other possible explanations for its role. Another study implicated CYRI-B in mitochondrial superoxide production, which could fuel early tumour progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chattaragada et al., 2018</xref>). However, more studies are needed, as this is consistent with CYRI buffering RAC1, as RAC1 is a well-known regulator of superoxide production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Another possible mechanism by which loss of CYRI-B could enhance early cancer progression would be via its role in maintenance of epithelial apico-basolateral polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fort et al., 2018</xref>). We previously found that depletion of CYRI-B in MDCK cell spheroids disrupted lumen formation in a similar way to hyperactivation of RAC1. Likewise, RAC1 and PI3-kinase are important for apicobasal polarity in the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Löf-Öhlin et al., 2017</xref>) and RAC1 has a known role in acinar to ductal metaplasia and in polarity and cell identity during early PDAC progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heid et al., 2011</xref>). PI3-kinase plays an important role in polarity maintenance and CYRI-B has been implicated in PI3-kinase signalling in gallbladder cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Loss of CYRI-B could therefore lead to hyperactivation or inappropriate spatial control of RAC1 activation causing a loss of normal cell polarity and therefore enhancing preneoplasia and cancer progression. Polarity maintenance could be disrupted by a lack of proper control of Scar/WAVE complex localisation leading to aberrant actin regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fort et al., 2018</xref>), or due to aberrant membrane trafficking of receptors such as integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le et al., 2021</xref>) or LPAR1 (this study).</p><p>Other recent studies implicated CYRI-B as a potential biomarker for early cancer. CYRI-B autoantibodies were detected as a potential biomarker for early stage breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo et al., 2022</xref>), a gene found in patient serum on extrachromosomal circular DNA overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2022b</xref>) and a potential saliva marker of oral cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawahara et al., 2016</xref>). CYRI-B was also highlighted as a target of the zinc finger RNA-binding protein Zfrbp, leading to accelerated tumour development when overexpressed in colorectal and liver cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Long et al., 2019</xref>). Multiple studies also suggest that CYRI-B may be enriched in extracellular vesicles associated with cancer and other diseases (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peng et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, CYRI-B may have potential as a biomarker and driver of early cancer and play a role in the progression or conversion from precancerous to cancerous lesions, but more studies are needed.</p><p>Involvement of CYRI-B in chemotactic migration suggested a mechanism for the reduced metastasis that we observed in both the KPC model and the intraperitoneal transplant model of PDAC metastasis. It is unclear why diaphragm and bowel metastasis were not significantly affected by CYRI-B deletion, but this might be due to the proximity of the tumours to these sites. In particular, pancreatic tumours appear to directly invade into the wall of the bowel due to the close proximity of these two organs and in human patients, duodenal invasion has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sopha et al., 2013</xref>). We previously found that loss of N-WASP in the KPC model caused a reduction in metastasis and that the role of N-WASP in recycling the LPA receptor LPAR1 was crucial in mediating this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juin et al., 2019</xref>). While N-WASP localises to SNX9-positive membrane tubules that are involved in trafficking of LPAR1 back to the plasma membrane after internalisation, we find that CYRI-B is required for efficient internalisation of LPAR1 after stimulation. Thus, CYRI-B and N-WASP control two different aspects of a similar pathway, whereby LPAR1 is stimulated, internalised, and then either sorted into tubules for rapid recycling or targeted towards lysosomes for slow recycling or degradation.</p><p>It may seem paradoxical that tumours overexpress CYRI-B, but are highly metastatic, as CYRI-B opposes RAC1 activity. However, we previously showed that CYRI-B is important for protrusion dynamics and that dynamics, e.g., assembly and rapid disassembly, is essential for chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fort et al., 2018</xref>). Cells with too much RAC1 activity and delocalised RAC1 activity do not chemotax effectively. They rather require a balance of activation and inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pankov et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, with macropinocytosis, RAC1 needs to be transiently activated to allow actin assembly and cup formation, but then RAC1 is dampened and actin needs to be disassembled to allow closure and uptake of macropinosomes or phagocytic vesicles into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schlam et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>One limitation of our study was the lack of any antibodies to recognise endogenous CYRI-B or LPAR-1 in cells using immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. We acknowledge that this would be a major step forward, but so far, we have not found reliable antibodies for either of these targets.</p><p>Interestingly, a major mechanism for internalisation of LPAR1 appears to be via macropinocytosis, as we observed LPAR1 on the membrane surface of both nascent and internalised macropinocytic structures co-localising with CYRI-B. We also found a significant retardation of LPAR1 internalisation in CYRI-B depleted cells, indicating that LPAR1 is significantly internalised via CYRI-B-dependent macropinocytosis in PDAC cells. This suggests that macropinocytosis, which has recently attracted substantial interest as a regulator of nutrient uptake by PDAC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canton, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Commisso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michalopoulou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Puccini et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yao et al., 2019</xref>), is also a key mechanism by which cells control surface receptor trafficking. Although involvement of macropinocytosis in receptor trafficking has been previously observed (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stow et al., 2020</xref>), studies are primarily in immune cells, which perform high levels of constitutive uptake. Macropinocytosis as a way for cancer cells to control signalling and adhesion is perhaps under-appreciated and warrants further study in this capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The tumours were washed three times with 5% penicillin/streptomycin (#15140122; Life Technologies) in PBS and cut into small pieces (&lt;3 mm). The tumour pieces were then washed with PBS, centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm, and transferred to 10 cm plates using full DMEM media supplemented with primocin (1:1000). The plates were left overnight in humidified incubator at 37°C supplied with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until confluent.

Following the manufacturer’s instructions, 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells were transfected with 5 µg of a combination of the following plasmids: Rab5a-mCherry or mScarlet-Lck. For KPC-1 and CKPC-1 cell lines, the AMAXA-V kit (VCA-1003, Lonza) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. About 2×10<sup>6</sup> cells were electroporated using P-031 program from the AMAXA electroporator.

First, about 2×10<sup>6</sup> HEK293T cells per 10 cm dish were seeded and let overnight to grow. Next day the transfection master mix which contained 10 µg of CRISPR construct containing sgRNA targeting the gene of interest (or empty lentiCRISPRv1-puro, #49535, Addgene), 7.5 µg of pSPAX2 (#12260, Addgene), and 4 µg of pVSVG packaging plasmid (#8454, Addgene) was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The following day the medium was removed and replaced with the same medium composition (DMEM) with 20% FBS, for virus production. The cells were left overnight and in the meantime recipient cells were prepared for virus infection by seeding 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells per plate. The next day the medium from the HEK293T cells was removed and mixed with 2.5 μl hexadimethrine bromide (10 mg/ml) (#H9268, Sigma), filtered using a 0.45 μm pore membrane to remove any cell debris.

About 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded on coverslips. Following attachment, the medium was replaced with SFM DMEM to starve the cells and left overnight. Next day the ‘Insall’ chemotaxis chambers were prepared. In the middle chamber, serum starvation medium was added. The coverslip was then carefully placed cell-side down onto the chamber. To create a chemoattractant gradient, full DMEM medium with 10% FBS was added on the sides of the Insall chambers (about 120 μl). The bridges containing the cells were then visualised every 15 min using a Nikon Ti long-term time-lapse microscope at 37°C with a ×10 objective for 48 hr. For LPAR1/3 inhibitor treatment with KI16425 antagonist (Cayman Chemicals, #10012659), cells were incubated for 1 hr in serum-free medium in 1:1000 dilution prior preparation and assembly of the ‘Insall’ chambers. DMSO (#15572393, Fisher Chemical) was used as a vehicle control. The cells were manually tracked using the mTrackJ plugin of Fiji software. From each condition, at least two random bridges where selected and at least 25 cells from each bridge were manually tracked. Only cells present at the first frame of the video were counted in the tracking, whereas when the cells were moving outside the bridge the tracking was stopped. The Excel spreadsheets with all the cell tracks from each bridge were extracted in order to create rose plots, individual cell-track graphs, and cosθ data using an algorithm in R software which was previously designed and published in our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fort et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Protein extraction from cultured cells was performed using ice-cold RIPA (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS buffer) supplemented with 1× phosphatase and 1× protease inhibitors (#78427, #78438; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. Protein was quantified using the Precision Red (#ADV02; Cytoskeleton) advanced protein assay and 10–20 μg was used. The lysates were mixed with 1× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (#NP0007, Invitrogen) and 1× NuPAGE reducing agent (#NP0004, Invitrogen), boiled for 5 min at 100°C and loaded on Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris acrylamide pre-cast gels (#NP0321; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 170 V for about 1 hr. The proteins were transferred onto a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose blotting membrane (#10600002; GE Healthcare) using wet electrotransfer for 1 hr at 110 V. The membranes were blocked with 5% (wt/vol) BSA diluted in 1× TBS-T (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween-20) for 30 min at room temperature on a shaker. Primary antibodies were incubated in buffer with 5% (wt/vol) BSA and 1× TBS-T overnight at 4°C on a roller.

The membranes were then washed three times and visualised using the Li-Cor Odyssey CLx scanner with the auto intensity scanning mode.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunofluorescence assay</title><p>CKPC cells were plated onto sterile 13 mm glass coverslips that had been previously coated with 1 mg/ml fibronectin (#F1141; Sigma-Aldrich). Coverslips were fixed using 4% PFA (#15710, Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The coverslips were then washed three times with PBS and permeabilised with permeabilisation buffer for 5 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed again three times with PBS and blocked with blocking buffer for about 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer in the appropriate dilution and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times with blocking buffer and secondary antibodies were then added in the appropriate dilution in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Finally, the coverslips were washed three times with PBS and mounted on microscopy slides using Fluoromount-G solution containing DAPI (Southern Biotech; 0100-01). Slides were imaged using a Zeiss 880 LSM with Airyscan microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Macropinocytosis assays</title><p>Cells were seeded on fibronectin-coated coverslips and incubated for 2–4 hr. The culture medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM and left overnight in a 37°C in a humidified incubator perfused with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The next day 10% FBS was added to the existing media and 0.2 mg/ml fluorescein-labelled dextran (70 kDa, D1822; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added. The cells were either imaged live or incubated for 30 min, washed once with ice-cold PBS and immediately fixed with 4% PFA and stained for 30 min with DAPI. The coverslips were then washed thrice with PBS and mounted on microscopy slides.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Live-cell imaging</title><p>For live-cell imaging cells were seeded on glass-bottom plates which were previously coated with either 1 mg/ml fibronectin (CKPC cells) or 10 μg/ml laminin (COS-7 cells, #L2020, Sigma). The cells were imaged using a Zeiss 880 LSM with Airyscan microscope which has a 37°C humidified incubator and perfused with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Image-based LPAR1 internalisation assay</title><p>CKPC-1 stable cell lines were first transfected with LPAR1-mCherry construct. The cells were then seeded on fibronectin-coated coverslips and once adhered the media was replaced with serum-free DMEM overnight. The following day 10% FBS was added to the pre-existing medium and incubated for 15 min for the internalisation to occur. The media was aspirated and immediately fixed using 4% PFA. The cells were then mounted on microscopy slides and visualised using a Zeiss 880 LSM with Airyscan microscope (×63, oil, 1.4NA objective). Images were analysed by thresholding the LPAR1-mCherry channel and analysing the objects which were 0.1 μm or above in Fiji software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction</title><p>RNA was first isolated from the cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (#74104, QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA was then synthesised using the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase protocol and measured using NanoDrop2000c. 1 μg of cDNA was mixed along with a primer master mix previously made. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the DyNAmo HS SYBR Green qPCR kit (#F410L; Thermo Fisher Scientific) reaction was set up as follows using the C1000 Thermal Cycler (CFX96 Real time system, Bio-Rad): 3 min at 95°C, 20 s at 95°C, 30 s at 57°C, 30 s at 72°C, repeat steps 2–4 for 40 cycles and 5 min at 72°C. Each condition had three technical replicates and GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene (Fw - <named-content content-type="sequence">CATGGCCTACATGGCCTCCA</named-content>, Rv - <named-content content-type="sequence">TGGGATAGGGCCTCTCTTGC</named-content>, Thermo Fisher). The mRNA fold change was calculated using the ΔΔC<sub>t</sub> method. The LPAR1 and LPAR3 Quantitec primers were purchased from QIAGEN (#QT00264320, #QT00107709).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>In vivo transplantation assay</title><p>For the in vivo transplantation assay KPC-1 CYRI-B CRISPR cell lines were used. The cells were grown in full media as normal until 24 hr before transplant, when fresh media was added without any antibiotics. About 2×10<sup>6</sup> cells per mouse were used for the experiment. Cells were injected into the intraperitoneal cavity of 10-week-old female CD-1 mice (Charles Rivers). Once injected, the mice were monitored every day and at day 14 mice were sacrificed. The weight of the mice and pancreata were taken at end-point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridisation detection (RNAScope) assays, and quantification</title><p>Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and next day transferred to 70% ethanol. The tissues were then embedded into paraffin blocks. For immunohistochemistry, the staining was performed on 4 µm sections which had previously been ovened at 60°C for 2 hr, using standard protocols. The detection for mouse <italic>Cyrib</italic> mRNA was performed using RNAScope 2.5 LS (Brown) detection kit (#322100; Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA, USA) on a Leica Bond Rx autostainer strictly according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Slides were imaged using the Leica SCN 400f scanner.</p><p>To quantify the histology slides, the HALO software was used. About eight different areas (&gt;350,000 µm<sup>2</sup> each area) within the pancreatic tumours were used to quantify the different stains. Necrotic areas were quantified manually from the whole pancreatic tumour using haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining. Areas with fragmented nuclei were considered as positive for necrosis. For tissues from 15-week-old mice, both neoplastic lesions and tumour areas were quantified (pJNK, pERK, BrdU stains). For the RNAScope experiments, the algorithm was set up to recognise the individual dots. PanIN lesion quantification was performed manually according to the following website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/medical-professionals/duct-lesions">https://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/medical-professionals/duct-lesions</ext-link> using H&amp;E slides.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data and statistics were analysed using the Prism software. All of the cell biology experiments, unless otherwise stated in the figure legends, were performed three times on separate occasions with separate cell passages. For all the mouse experiments and histology quantifications for end-point mice between KPC and CKPC mouse models, similar ages of mice were chosen. Unless otherwise stated, all the cell biology experiments were plotted as super plots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lord et al., 2020</xref>) and each biological replicate was coloured differently.

an interactor of the small GTPase Rac1, in controlling pancreatic cancer progression towards a higher proliferative and metastatic stage. The authors demonstrate that CYRI-B reduces the typical hyperactivation of Rac1 in early stages of tumor progression; subsequently, CYRI-B mediates internalization of lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) uptake through macropinocytosis, thus regulating chemotactic migration of cancer cells towards lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). This work, based on convincing evidence, will be of broad interest to cell biologists and the signalling research communities.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83712.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Golemis</surname><given-names>Erica A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0567t7073</institution-id><institution>Fox Chase Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Braga</surname><given-names>Vania MM</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/041kmwe10</institution-id><institution>Imperial College London</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Linder</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01zgy1s35</institution-id><institution>University Medical Center Eppendorf</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.11.23.517689">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.23.517689">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Erica Golemis as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Vania MM Braga (Reviewer #2); Stefan Linder (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below. Besides these comments, a number of suggestions have been made by the reviewers, which appear following the public reviews; the authors are encouraged to address as many of these as possible:</p><p>1. The authors argue that CYRI-B could act as a buffer for Rac1 hyperactivation. This is likely based on earlier work of the authors using MDCK cells. However, no data on Rac1 activation and its regulation by CYRI-B in PDAC are shown. Please include respective data or discuss the possible, also alternative, molecular roles for CYRI-B in PDAC progression in more detail.</p><p>2. It is not clear why the authors use COS cells for showing the role of CYRI-B in macropinocytosis, as also some data using CKPC cells are shown, which should be more relevant. For example, Figure 7B is the only figure showing CYRI-B-GFP and LPAR-1-mCherry on macropinosomes. However, this gallery does not show the beginning of the process. It would be important to show in CKPC cells that both proteins are already present at nascent macropinocytic cups that then lead to fully formed macropinosomes that are also positive for Rab5. So far, these results are a mosaic of data from COS and CKPC cells.</p><p>3. Related to the previous point: it would also be important to detect endogenous CYRI-B and LPAR1 in PDAC cells and to show their localization at macropinocytic cups and macropinosomes.</p><p>Compiled Recommendations for the authors from the three Reviewers:</p><p>1. This paper would benefit from the inclusion of some evidence confirming the role of CYRI-B in human PDAC cells, as well as the inclusion of 3D invasion assays.</p><p>2. It would be good to discuss the distribution of CYRI-B in the tumours. The Lox-Cre system used is epithelial-specific, however, from the staining, it looks like CYRI-B is also expressed in the stroma. Is there anything known about the potential roles of CYRI-B in the stroma, as this plays a key role in PDAC progression?</p><p>3. Figure 1 shows levels of CYRI-B mRNA during PDAC progression. It would be good to also show stainings/quantifications of the protein itself.</p><p>4. The authors correctly use 70kDa dextran to visualize macropinocytosis. The results would be further strengthened by inhibiting micropinocytosis, possibly by depletion of the G protein-coupled receptor CaSR (Canton, Frontiers Immunol, 2018).</p><p>5. The authors use an inhibitor against LPAR1 and -3, but focus on LPAR1. This is based on their earlier results (Juin et al., 2019), where they showed that depletion of LPAR1, but not of LPAR3 reduces chemotaxis. This should be mentioned explicitly for a better understanding of the rationale.</p><p>6. The hypothesis is that depletion of CYRI-B would promote localized Rac1 activation at the membrane. However, the authors show that CYRI-B is found overexpressed in PDAC, consistent with other papers where its high expression correlates with poor outcome of many cancers. The prediction is that Rac1 functions modulated by CYRI-B would be inhibited in those tumours where CYRI-B is overexpressed. Is this the case and has it been formally demonstrated?</p><p>7. Most experiments use the depletion of CYRI-B to probe its function. It would be useful to readers and important to elaborate on how the specific CYRI-B functions shown upon depletion would fit with the in vivo observation of CYRI-B overexpressed in tumours. For example, loss of CYRI-B reduces chemotaxis potential. How can this result be reconciled with the predicted increase in Rac1 activation in the absence of CYRI-B? Conversely, a prediction of CYRI-B overexpression in human tumours would imply the inactivation of Rac1 whereas chemotaxis is promoted. The discussion could be improved with the addition of the authors' views and further explanations in this context.</p><p>8. Similarly, it is confusing to extrapolate a proposed increase in LPAR1 internalization by macropinocytosis with CYRI-B overexpression in PDAC. It is predicted that Rac1 would be locally inhibited in this scenario, and thus micropinocytosis would be compromised. It will be good to spell out what the authors envisage happens. For example, uptake could be switched to another receptor uptake process that would not involve CYRI-B sequestration of Rac1. Discussion of the potential alternatives will strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>9. &quot;...LPAR1 is a cargo of CYRI-B dependent macropinocytosis&quot; (page 21). This statement reads as an overinterpretation of the specificity of the process. It may suggest that there is a cargo selectivity by CYRI-B, which has not been formally demonstrated or is well accepted. Macropinocytosis is thought to occur as a bulk engulfment of the membrane and thus any receptor at the cell surface would be internalised non-specifically. The demonstrated reduction in LPAR1 uptake could be proportional to the interference with micropinocytosis rate by CYRI-B depletion for example.</p><p>10. Readers would benefit from more clear explanations of the differences and similarities between CYRI-A and CYRI-B. It will be important to clarify the specificity of the proposed functions of each protein. Both localize at the macropinosomes, modulate engulfment and regulate integrin a5b1 trafficking. It will be informative to specify if CYRI-A is also upregulated in human tumours, has a similar outcome as CYRI-B in vivo and also regulates LPAR1 uptake.</p><p>11. Upon depletion of CYRI-B in pancreatic tumour cells in vivo, the presence of similar levels of jaundice is confusing. Less metastasis is detected in the mesentery. Are liver metastasis affected in the absence of CYRI-B?</p><p>12. It would be helpful to improve further discussion of the data in the context of human tumours that contain CYRI-B overexpression and refine the interpretation of the results as described in the public review. The addition of alternative explanations for the cargo specificity of macropinocytosis and Rac1-independent alternatives as outlined above will go a long way to strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>13. It is important to demonstrate that an irrelevant surface receptor is not affected by CYRI-B depletion or the rate of reduced macropinocytosis. Revise or tone down the conclusion of specificity accordingly.</p><p>14. LPAR1 should be spelt out in the abstract.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83712.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below.

We have also discussed the RAC1-FRET reporter mouse, which would be an interesting model to measure RAC1 activity in tumours with CYRI-B knockout. However, this would require a very large amount of mouse breeding and might take more than a year, so we feel that this experiment is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We have, however, tried to perform all of the essential experiments as much as possible in PDAC cells. We have repeated more of the experiments now in PDAC cells, as requested, so we hope that the reviewers will agree that the major points are supported better now with PDAC cell experiments. Please refer to the new Figure S6 and Video S5, where we have now shown CYRI-B localisation to macropinocytic structures and co-localisation with Rab5a in human pancreatic cancer AsPC-1 cells. Please see also the new Figure 7A and Video S6-S7, with additional data showing CYRI-B and Rab5a recruitment to macropinocytic structures in human pancreatic cancer AsPC-1 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Because we have knockout cells, we can verify whether the antibodies work to a higher standard than previous studies, and we do not find any antibodies, including commercially available antibodies, that give convincing results for these experiments yet. This is definitely something that we agree we must do, but it awaits better reagents. This is also why we used in situ RNA-scope for our tumour study. We now mention this in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Compiled Recommendations for the authors from the three Reviewers:</p><p>1.

We acknowledge that it is desirable to perform as many of the experiments as possible with human PDAC cells, but as these cells are a lot more difficult to transfect and work with, we have also supplemented these experiments with some mechanistic experiments in COS-7. We hope that the reviewer will agree that we now provide good evidence for the most crucial experiments in human PDAC cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In Figure 1B, we show CYRI-B expression in KPC tumours at the RNA level. Then in the CKPC, there is not much positive staining left after knockout in the epithelia- also panel B. So we think it is preliminary to discuss this, although we agree it is a very interesting point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 1 shows levels of CYRI-B mRNA during PDAC progression.

We think of it as a tug of war, where active KRAS drives RAC1 levels above what is healthy for the cells and CYRI-B may compensate and normalise RAC1.

It will be informative to specify if CYRI-A is also upregulated in human tumours, has a similar outcome as CYRI-B in vivo and also regulates LPAR1 uptake.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added some discussion of CYRI-A. There is no evidence that CYRI-A is involved in human pancreatic tumours, but may be involved in renal and urothelial cancers, which we now clarify on page 23.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Upon depletion of CYRI-B in pancreatic tumour cells in vivo, the presence of similar levels of jaundice is confusing. Less metastasis is detected in the mesentery. Are liver metastasis affected in the absence of CYRI-B?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these are interesting questions. Probably the jaundice is caused when the bile duct gets blocked and this might be a stochastic process depending on where the metastatic nodules grow. We didn’t have enough mice that displayed liver metastasis in the transplant model to quantify this, but for the KPC model, we did show a reduction in liver metastasis. It would be interesting to check in a spleen to liver model, but we don’t feel that this use of more mice is currently justified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. It would be helpful to improve further discussion of the data in the context of human tumours that contain CYRI-B overexpression and refine the interpretation of the results as described in the public review. The addition of alternative explanations for the cargo specificity of macropinocytosis and Rac1-independent alternatives as outlined above will go a long way to strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have substantially revised the discussion and we hope that it is clearer now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. It is important to demonstrate that an irrelevant surface receptor is not affected by CYRI-B depletion or the rate of reduced macropinocytosis. Revise or tone down the conclusion of specificity accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added statements to tone this down. We did not mean to imply that the macropinocytosis was specific for LPAR1- see also comment above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. LPAR1 should be spelt out in the abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p></body></sub-article></article>
