signaling could benefit this population. Mediator-associated kinases CDK8 and CDK19 drive inflammatory responses through incompletely understood mechanisms. Using sibling-matched cell lines with/without T21, we investigated Mediator kinase function in the context of hyperactive IFN in DS over a 75 min to 24 hr timeframe. Activation of IFN-response genes was suppressed in cells treated with the CDK8/CDK19 inhibitor cortistatin A (CA), via rapid suppression of IFN-responsive transcription factor (TF) activity. We also discovered that CDK8/CDK19 affect splicing, a novel means by which Mediator kinases control gene expression. To further probe Mediator kinase function, we completed cytokine screens and metabolomics experiments. Cytokines are master regulators of inflammatory responses; by screening 105 different cytokine proteins, we show that Mediator kinases help drive IFN-dependent cytokine responses at least in part through transcriptional regulation of cytokine genes and receptors. Metabolomics revealed that Mediator kinase inhibition altered core metabolic pathways in cell type-specific ways, and broad upregulation of anti-inflammatory lipid mediators occurred specifically in kinase-inhibited cells during hyperactive IFNŒ≥ signaling. A subset of these lipids (e.g. oleamide, desmosterol) serve as ligands for nuclear receptors PPAR and LXR, and activation of these receptors occurred specifically during hyperactive IFN signaling in CA-treated cells, revealing mechanistic links between Mediator kinases, lipid metabolism, and nuclear receptor function. Collectively, our results establish CDK8/CDK19 as context-specific metabolic regulators, and reveal that these kinases control gene expression not only via TFs, but also through metabolic changes and splicing. Moreover, we establish that Mediator kinase inhibition antagonizes IFN signaling through transcriptional, metabolic, and cytokine responses, with implications for DS and other chronic inflammatory conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>cytokine</kwd><kwd>interferons</kwd><kwd>Down syndrome</kwd><kwd>gene

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Down syndrome (DS) is relatively common in the human population (ca. 1 in 700 live births) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Graaf et al., 2017</xref>) and results from trisomy of chromosome 21 (T21). T21 manifests in myriad ways, including an increased propensity for autoimmune and neurological disorders, as well as elevated incidence of leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hasle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antonarakis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antonarakis et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, T21 also results in chronic immune dysregulation associated with hyperactivation of interferon (IFN) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sullivan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Araya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Waugh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The chronic, hyperactive IFN response in DS can be attributed, at least in part, to the fact that four IFN receptors are encoded on chromosome 21: IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 for Type I IFNs (e.g. IFNŒ≤, IFNŒ≥), IFNGR2 for IFNŒ≥, and the Type III subunit IL10RB for IFNŒª, which also serves as a subunit of the IL10 receptor. Numerous pathologies associated with DS, including autoimmune-related disorders, are considered direct consequences of chronic IFN pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Madan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">M√•rild et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Araya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Waugh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bush et al., 2021</xref>). For these reasons, hyperactive IFN signaling lies at the heart of DS pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Waugh et al., 2023</xref>), and therapeutic strategies to dampen IFN responses are being tested in clinical trials (NCT04246372, NCT05662228).</p><p>We recently demonstrated that the Mediator kinases (CDK8 and its paralog CDK19) are drivers of inflammatory responses to the universal cytokine IFNŒ≥ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Steinparzer et al., 2019</xref>). This discovery has implications for DS, because hyperactive IFN signaling underlies many DS symptoms and because Mediator kinases are promising targets for molecular therapeutics, in part due to low toxicity of a selective inhibitor in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pelish et al., 2015</xref>). Many studies have linked Mediator kinase activity to immune system function and inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bancerek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johannessen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamamoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Steinparzer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hofmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freitas et al., 2022</xref>), and CDK8/CDK19 inhibition can suppress autoimmune disease in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akamatsu et al., 2019</xref>). Mediator kinases target the STAT transcription factor (TF) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bancerek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Poss et al., 2016</xref>) and activation of JAK/STAT pathway TFs (e.g. STAT1, IRF1) is blocked upon Mediator kinase inhibition in IFNŒ≥-stimulated human or mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Steinparzer et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that Mediator kinase inhibition could mitigate chronic, hyperactive IFN signaling in T21.</p><p>Mediator is a 26-subunit complex that regulates RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Richter et al., 2022</xref>). Mediator is recruited to specific genomic loci through interactions with sequence-specific, DNA-binding TFs, and Mediator interacts with the RNAPII enzyme at transcription start sites. Through these distinct interactions, Mediator enables TF-dependent control of RNAPII function. CDK8 or CDK19 can reversibly associate with Mediator as part of a 4-subunit ‚ÄòMediator kinase module‚Äô that contains additional subunits MED12, MED13, and CCNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luyties and Taatjes, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Mediator kinases have not been studied in the context of DS, and a goal of this project was to define their roles in the context of IFNŒ≥ signaling, using donor-derived cell lines. We also sought to address fundamental questions regarding Mediator kinase function that remained largely unexplored. For instance, it is not known whether Mediator kinases impact pre-mRNA splicing that is coupled to RNAPII transcription, despite evidence that CDK8 and/or CDK19 phosphorylate splicing regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Poss et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, metabolic changes are at least as important as transcriptional changes in driving biological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rinschen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhu and Thompson, 2019</xref>), but how Mediator kinases impact metabolism in human cells remains incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galbraith et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, cytokines serve as key drivers of IFNŒ≥ responses, and despite links between CDK8/CDK19 function and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Steinparzer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freitas et al., 2022</xref>), it is largely unknown whether Mediator kinases impact cytokine levels.</p><p>Using a combination of approaches, we have identified novel and diverse mechanisms by which Mediator kinases control IFNŒ≥ responses under both basal and IFNŒ≥-stimulated conditions. Beyond effects on the RNAPII transcriptome, our results indicate that Mediator kinases act by governing TF activation and suggest that they selectively control gene expression through pre-mRNA splicing; furthermore, regulation of cytokine and metabolite levels contributes to CDK8/CDK19-dependent control of inflammatory signaling, including downstream activation of nuclear receptors through context-specific, kinase-dependent changes in lipid metabolites. Taken together, our findings identify Mediator kinases as therapeutic targets that could mitigate immune system dysregulation in individuals with DS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental overview: transcriptomics, metabolomics, and cytokine screens</title><p>The goals of this project were to compare and contrast transcriptional and metabolic changes in the following experimental contexts: (1) T21 vs. D21, (2) ¬±IFNŒ≥ stimulation, (3) ¬±Mediator kinase inhibition, and (4) IFNŒ≥ stimulation + Mediator kinase inhibition. For T21 vs. D21 comparisons, we selected lymphoblastoid cells from the Nexus Biobank that were derived from siblings matched in age (3- or 5-year old) and sex (male).

CA is the most potent and selective Mediator kinase inhibitor available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clopper and Taatjes, 2022</xref>); for example, kinome-wide screens showed no off-target kinase inhibition even at 1 ¬µM, a concentration 5000 times greater than its measured <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 0.2 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pelish et al., 2015</xref>).

Collectively, these results implicate lipid metabolites as key ‚Äòdownstream‚Äô regulators of the transcriptional response to Mediator kinase inhibition.

Similar results were obtained in T21 cells; however, CA treatment reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in T21 cells that were not reduced in D21 (e.g. IL32, IL33, IL34), although CXCL10 and GMCSF were exceptions.

To maintain focus on Mediator kinase activity, we avoided knockdown or knockout experiments, in part because CDK8/CDK19 proteins serve additional functions that are not kinase-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Poss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Audetat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sooraj et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Collectively, our results expand upon established concepts for CDK8 and CDK19 (e.g. regulation of IFNŒ≥ signaling) and reveal new insights about their impact on TF activation, metabolic and cytokine responses, as well as their effect on pre-mRNA splicing. Our results also establish Mediator kinases as potential therapeutic targets to suppress hyperactive IFN signaling in DS.</p><p>We acknowledge that individual-to-individual genetic variation could contribute to the differences we observe in our T21 vs. D21 comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sullivan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hwang et al., 2021</xref>). We chose cell lines from sibling donors (both males of similar age) to minimize this possibility. Moreover, cross-referencing our results with data collected from large cohorts of individuals of varying age and sex (with/without T21) showed broadly similar trends in transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Waugh et al., 2023</xref>), metabolite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Powers et al., 2019</xref>), and cytokine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Malle et al., 2023</xref>) in the T21/D21 comparisons. Although our multi-omics T21/D21 comparisons yielded new insights, Mediator kinases were a focus of this study, and the T21/D21 comparisons primarily served as benchmarks to assess CDK8/CDK19 function in the context of DS and IFNŒ≥ signaling. A limitation of this study was that only two donor-derived T21 cell lines were evaluated, with one sibling-matched D21 line. Furthermore, the transcriptomic, metabolomic, and cytokine data were collected at select time points, such that some temporal trends in IFNŒ≥ responses can only be inferred (see below).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>CDK8 and CDK19 kinase activity impacts core metabolic pathways</title><p>Metabolomics has been described as the most direct readout of cell state, yielding a ‚Äòfront line‚Äô assessment of the biochemicals that drive all cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rinschen et al., 2019</xref>). The role of Mediator kinases in human cell metabolism is poorly understood. As a whole, our metabolomics data revealed the most striking CDK8/CDK19 effects on nucleotide biosynthesis (especially in D21) and lipid homeostasis. Nucleotide levels (purines and pyrimidines) and their intermediates were broadly reduced in CA-treated cells whereas different classes of lipids were generally elevated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2‚Äîsource data 2</xref>).</p><p>The gene expression changes (RNA-seq, 4.5 or 24 hr) triggered by Mediator kinase inhibition tracked with these ‚Äòdownstream‚Äô (24 hr) metabolic changes (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 1E</xref>). For example, nucleotide biosynthesis mRNAs were downregulated whereas lipid metabolism mRNAs were upregulated in CA-treated cells; this was reflected in the GSEA Hallmarks, with positive enrichment for pathways such as cholesterol homeostasis, bile acid metabolism, and FA metabolism and negative enrichment for DNA repair pathways, which contains many nucleotide biosynthesis genes. The differential timing of the transcriptomics and metabolomics experiments helps link CA-dependent metabolic changes to gene expression changes; however, we cannot exclude other factors and pathways. For example, reduced levels of nucleotides can trigger cellular compensation through upregulation of FA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schoors et al., 2015</xref>). Consequently, elevated levels of FA and other lipids may result, in part, from compensatory mechanisms triggered by CA-dependent reductions in nucleotide levels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Pathway-specific regulation of splicing by Mediator kinases</title><p>Despite widespread study of Mediator kinases as regulators of RNAPII transcription, their potential function in splicing has not been addressed.

Our analysis revealed that exon skipping was dependent upon the kinase function of CDK8 and/or CDK19; increased inclusion or skipping of hundreds of alternative exons was observed in CA-treated cells (D21 or T21), and this was observed under both basal and IFNŒ≥-stimulated conditions (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>).</p><p>Pathway analysis of the CA-dependent alternative splicing events identified gene sets associated with signaling pathways known to be regulated by Mediator kinases, such as TGFŒ≤ and IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, CA-dependent alternative splicing of IFN-related gene sets occurred specifically in T21 cells (not D21); moreover, other pathways were selectively affected by Mediator kinase inhibition in cell type and context-specific ways. For instance, mTOR pathway genes in CA-treated D21 cells and pyrimidine metabolism genes in T21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F, G</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that Mediator kinases regulate pre-mRNA splicing, which adds to the mechanisms by which CDK8 and CDK19 can influence gene expression.

Metabolic changes are generally not considered when evaluating the biological function of transcription-associated kinases such as CDK8 and CDK19.

We acknowledge that metabolites and cytokines can have variable, dynamic, and context-specific effects on inflammatory signaling. For example, sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maceyka and Spiegel, 2014</xref>) and bile acids may serve pro- or anti-inflammatory roles depending upon cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chiang and Ferrell, 2019</xref>), and cytokine responses are complex, in part because cytokines regulate each other (e.g. MIP3Œ±/CCL20 is downregulated by IL10). For this study, a more straightforward metric for an anti-inflammatory change was whether CA treatment countered the effect of IFNŒ≥ stimulation alone. This was observed in a large number of cases across all experiments.</p><p>CDK8 and CDK19 are established regulators of RNAPII transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luyties and Taatjes, 2022</xref>).

The staggered timing of our PRO-seq (75 min), RNA-seq (4.5 or 24 hr), metabolomics (24 hr), and cytokine screen experiments (24 hr) allowed inference of direct vs. indirect effects of Mediator kinase inhibition. As expected, we observed changes in anti-inflammatory transcriptional responses over time, which likely reflects compensatory responses to Mediator kinase inhibition.</p><p>Taken as a whole, our results suggest that under conditions of IFN pathway stimulation, CDK8/CDK19 inhibition initiates a cascade of events that mediate anti-inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). At short timeframes (75 min), Mediator kinase inhibition suppressed activation of IFN-responsive, pro-inflammatory TFs in T21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Consistent with these results, mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes were subsequently reduced in CA-treated T21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 5C, D</xref>), as were protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

TFEA also identified p53 as rapidly suppressed in CA-treated T21 cells (<italic>t</italic> = 75 min); p53 blocks SREBP activation and this contributes partially or completely to p53-dependent suppression of cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis (e.g. to suppress growth) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moon et al., 2019</xref>). CA-dependent suppression of p53 function in T21 cells could therefore activate SREBP to elevate cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis. In agreement, RNA-seq data (<italic>t</italic> = 4.5 or 24 hr) identified SREBP (IPA upstream regulators), cholesterol homeostasis and fatty acid metabolism (GSEA Hallmarks) as activated upon Mediator kinase inhibition. SREBP TFs activate cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis pathways, and metabolomics data revealed elevated levels of anti-inflammatory lipids in CA-treated cells during IFNŒ≥ signaling (e.g. D21 cells +IFNŒ≥; T21 cells at basal conditions). Among these elevated lipids, oleamide, desmosterol, and PUFAs are nuclear receptor agonists that activate PPAR and LXR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sun and Bennett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Spann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roy et al., 2016</xref>); PPAR and LXR, in turn, broadly control fatty acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schultz et al., 2000</xref>), including PUFAs such as DPA, DHA, and EPA, whose levels were consistently elevated in CA-treated cells.

Paired-end libraries (151 bp √ó 151 bp) were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 6000 platform (Firmware version 1.26.1, RTA version: v3.4.4, Instrument ID: A00405).</p><p>For the non-sibling T21 and sibling T21 <italic>t</italic> = 24 hr RNA-seq experiments, cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO or 100 nM CA for 4.5 hr (non-sibling T21) or 24 hr (sibling T21). After treatment, total RNA was isolated using TRizol (Invitrogen, 15596026) as specified by the manufacturer and quantified with a Qubit 3.0 using the RNA High Sensitivity (HS) kit (Invitrogen, Q32855). 200 ng of total RNA with an RIN number of ‚â•8 was used for RNA-seq library prep. Libraries were constructed using the Zymo-Seq RiboFree Total RNA Library Kit (Zymo Research). Paired-end sequencing reads of 150 nucleotides were generated on a NovaSeq X (RTA v4.6.7, Serial Number LH00407, Firmware v1.2.0.28691) and de-multiplexed using bcl2fastq.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA-seq computational analysis</title><p>For differential gene expression analysis, the workflow was as follows: adaptor sequences were trimmed from the RNA-seq raw fastq files using BBDuk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/</ext-link>) and mapped using HISAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Gene counts were generated using featureCounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liao et al., 2014</xref>), and differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>). When there were multiple transcripts per gene, those with the highest FPKM were kept for analysis. For inter-genotype (T21 vs. D21) comparisons, expression of genes on chromosome 21 was normalized to ploidy. While ERCC RNA Spike-In Mix (Invitrogen, 4456740) was added to isolated RNA samples prior to sequencing, ERCC gene counts were variable across vehicle-treated samples even after accounting for read depth, and when using multiple normalization methods and a linear regression. As such, the median of ratios method native to DESeq2 was used to generate size factors and normalize samples. QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) version 90348151 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kr√§mer et al., 2014</xref>), GSEA 4.2.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>), and Gene Ontology analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>) were used for identification of activated and inhibited pathways. For IPA analysis, a total of 27,647 out of 28,265 genes could be mapped using Entrez Gene Symbols. For cross-genotype (i.e. T21 vs. D21) pathway analysis, only genes with a fold-change &gt; |1.25| and adjusted p-value &lt;0.1 were used. For within-genotype (i.e. treatment effects) pathway analysis, only genes with an adjusted p-value &lt;0.1 were used.</p><p>For analysis of RNA-seq data collected from sibling T21 cell line at 24 hr ¬±CA, and non-sibling T21 at 4.5 hr ¬±CA, batch correction was applied to gene counts using Surrogate Variable Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leek et al., 2019</xref>) as initial principal component analysis revealed inter-replicate variability as a stronger source of variation than kinase inhibition. However, differential expression analysis demonstrated that the same pathways were predicted to be up- or downregulated regardless of whether batch correction was performed. GSEA was performed by generating a list of genes with differential expression across treatments/genotypes, ranked by the negative log10 adjusted p-value and the sign (positive or negative) of log2(fold-change). Ranked gene lists were loaded onto GSEA (v4.2.3) and GSEAPreranked was run with the following settings ‚Äì Number of permutations: 1000, Collapse/Remap: No_collapse, Enrichment statistic: weighted, Max size: 500, Min size: 15.</p><p>For splicing analysis, the workflow was as follows: duplicates were removed and adaptors trimmed using the bbTools function (v39.01), trimmed reads were mapped uniquely against the hg38 genome using HISAT2 (v2.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2019</xref>), mapped reads were processed with rMATS (v4.0.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shen et al., 2014</xref>), and results were filtered based on FDR &lt;0.05, absolute(IncLevelDifference) &lt;0.2, and ‚â•2 reads/replicate. Sashimi plots were generated from rMATS results using a modified script based on ggsashimi.py.</p><p>The IFN score was calculated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Galbraith et al., 2023</xref>) using normalized gene counts from DESeq2. The score is calculated with 18 genes: BPGM, CCL5, IFI27, GMPR, IRF7, CMKLR1, IFITM3, GZMA, FCGR1A, USP18, PLSCR1, CXCL9, IFI44, CD274, CXCL10, ISG15, IFI44L, and RSAD2. For each gene, the mean and standard deviation of the D21 replicates was calculated. Then the measured level of each sample was subtracted by the mean of the D21 replicates and divided by the standard deviation of the D21 replicates to create a standardized gene value. For each sample, the sum of the standardized values was taken to get the IFN score.</p><p>The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI‚Äôs Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE220652 or GSE263239.

Numerous pathologies associated with DS are considered direct consequences of chronic IFN pathway activation, and thus hyperactive IFN signaling lies at the heart of pathophysiology. The collective interrogation of transcriptomics, metabolomics, and cytokine screens in sibling-matched cell lines (T21 vs D21) allows the authors to conclude that Mediator kinase inhibition could mitigate chronic, hyperactive IFN signaling in T21. To probe the functional outcomes of Mediator kinase inhibition, the authors performed cytokine screens, transcriptomic, and untargeted metabolomics. This collective approach revealed that Mediator kinases establish IFN-dependent cytokine responses at least in part through transcriptional regulation of cytokine genes and receptors. Mediator kinase inhibition suppresses cell responses during hyperactive IFN signaling through inhibition of pro-inflammatory transcription factor activity (anti-inflammatory effect) and alteration of core metabolic pathways, including upregulation of anti-inflammatory lipid mediators, which served as ligands for specific nuclear receptors and downstream phenotypic outcomes (e.g., oxygen consumption). These data provided a mechanistic link between Mediator kinase activity and nuclear receptor function. Finally, the authors also disclosed that Mediator kinase inhibition alters splicing outcomes.</p><p>Overall, this study reveals a mechanism by which Mediator kinases regulate gene expression and establish that its inhibition antagonizes chronic IFN signaling through collective transcriptional, metabolic, and cytokine responses.

following is the authors‚Äô response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The main conclusion of this manuscript is that the mediator kinases supporting the IFN response in Downs syndrome cell lines represent an important addition to understanding the pathology of this affliction.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Mediator kinase stimulates cytokine production. Both RNAseq and metabolomics clearly demonstrate a stimulatory role for CDK8/CDK19 in the IFN response.

The previous identification of splicing factors as substrates of CDK8/CDK19 is also intriguing. However, additional studies seem to be necessary in order to attach this new function to the CKM. As the authors point out, the changes in splicing patterns are relatively modest compared to other regulators. In addition, some indication that the proteins encoded by these genes exhibit reduced levels or activities would support their RNAseq findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new splicing data for the version of record. Specifically, we have added splicing data analysis for the &quot;non-sibling&quot; T21 cell line (¬±cortistatin A, t=4.5h) and for the sibling T21 line (¬±cortistatin A) at t=24h. The results are summarized in new Figure 5 ‚Äì figure supplement 2. The data are in agreement with our prior data from the sibling T21 line ¬±CA at t=4.5h. In particular, (i) similar numbers of genes were impacted by splicing changes (alternative exon inclusion or alternative exon skipping) in CA-treated cells in the &quot;non-sibling&quot; T21 line compared with the sibling T21 line; (ii) upon completion of a pathway analysis of these alternatively spliced genes, similar pathways were affected by CA in each case (non-sibling T21 vs. sibling T21), in particular those related to IFN signaling; (iii) regarding the new t=24h timepoint for the sibling T21 line, similar numbers of genes were alternatively spliced (alternative exon inclusion or alternative exon skipping) in CA-treated cells compared with the 4.5h timepoint, and (iv) the IPA results with the alternately spliced genes identified inflammatory signaling, mRNA processing, and lipid metabolism among other pathways, which broadly reflect the cytokine screen and metabolomics data in CA-treated cells (t=24h).</p><p>Additional evidence for CDK8/CDK19 regulation of splicing comes from our t=24h RNA-seq data in T21 cells ¬±CA. GSEA results revealed down-regulation of many pathways related to RNA processing and splicing, suggesting that the splicing changes caused by Mediator kinase inhibition result from reduced expression of splicing regulators, at least at this longer timeframe. These results are summarized in new Figure 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 2E. Collectively, the data shown in this article reveal a previously unidentified role for Mediator kinases as splicing regulators. We emphasize in the article, however, that the splicing effects of Mediator kinase inhibition appear modest, at least within the cell lines and timeframes of our experiments, especially when compared with CDK7 inhibition [Rimel et al. Genes Dev 2020 1452].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Seahorse analysis is normally calculated with specific units for oxygen consumption, ATP production, etc. It would be of interest to see the actual values of OCR between the D21 and T21 cell lines rather than standardizing the results. This will address the specific question about relative mitochondrial function between these cells. Reduced mitochondrial function has been associated with DS patients. Therefore, it would be important to know whether mitochondrial function is reduced in the T21 cells vs. the D21 control. Importantly for the authors' goal of investigating the use of CDK8/19 inhibitors in DS patients, does CA treatment reduce mitochondrial function to pathological levels?</p></disp-quote><p>These are good points. We have addressed as follows.</p><p>(1) We have added a comparative analysis of Seahorse data for the sibling-matched T21 and D21 lines. As shown in new Figure 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 4A-C, the T21 line shows higher basal levels of OCR and ECAR compared with D21. Although reviewer 1 states that &quot;reduced mitochondrial function has been associated with DS patients&quot; we are unaware of the study from which this conclusion was made. Our results are consistent with a Down syndrome mouse model study published last year [Sarver et al. eLife 2023 e86023]. We acknowledge that in this study, T21/D21 OCR levels varied in different tissues, but the majority of tissue types showed elevated OCR in T21, similar to our results in the human B-cells used here.</p><p>(2) Interestingly, CA treatment reduced OCR and ECAR in T21 cells (and D21), suggesting that Mediator kinase inhibition might normalize mitochondrial function (and ECAR) toward D21 levels. We show this comparison in new Figure 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 4D-F. Indeed, CA treatment appears to normalize T21 mitochondrial function and ECAR toward D21 levels. Although this may suggest a therapeutic benefit, we emphasize that more experiments would be needed to make such claims with confidence.</p><p>(3) We include a breakdown of mitochondrial parameters from Seahorse data in the bar plots shown in Figure 2‚Äìfigure supplement 3. This includes ATP production, which shows reduced ATP levels in CA-treated T21 cells specifically.</p><p>(4) We have added Seahorse data for ECAR (extracellular acidification rate) in the siblingmatched D21 and T21 cells, ¬±CA. These results are shown in new Figure 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 3D, and indicate that CA treatment reduces ECAR in both D21 and T21 cells. This result is consistent with a prior report that analyzed ECAR in CDK8 analog-sensitive HCT116 cells [Galbraith et al. Cell Rep 2017 1495].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Cozzolino et al. demonstrate that inhibition of the Mediator kinase CDK8 and its paralog CDK19 suppresses hyperactive interferon (IFN) signaling in Down syndrome (DS), which results from trisomy of chromosome 21 (T21).

(4) Another major strength of this study is the significance of the work to DS and its potential impact on other chronic inflammatory conditions.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>(1) Genetic evidence linking the mentioned nuclear receptors to activation of an anti-inflammatory program upon Mediator kinase inhibition could improve the definition of the mechanism and overall impact of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>Existing data from other studies, some of which are cited in the article, have linked PPAR and LXR to lipid biosynthesis and anti-inflammatory signaling cascades. We assume that reviewer 2 is suggesting knockdown and/or degron depletion of specific nuclear receptors, to compare/contrast the effect of CA on IFN responses in T21 and D21 cells. Such experiments would help de-couple the NR-specific contributions from other CA-dependent effects. We consider these experiments important next steps for this project, but beyond the scope of this study. That said, we anticipate that data from such experiments might be challenging to interpret, given the complex and inter-connected cascade of transcriptional and metabolic changes that would result from PPAR or LXR depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Page 5 states that &quot;Mediator kinases broadly regulate cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis and this was further confirmed by the metabolomics data&quot;, but a clear mechanistic explanation was lacking. Likewise, the data suggest but do not prove, that altered lipid metabolites influence the function of nuclear receptors to regulate an anti-inflammatory program in response to Mediator kinase inhibition (p. 6), despite the fact the gene expression changes elicited by Mediator kinase inhibition tracked with downstream metabolic changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the text on page 5 to address this comment. Specifically, we note that CA treatment increases expression of FA metabolism and cholesterol metabolism genes in T21 cells under basal conditions, and the genes affected are shown in Figure 2‚Äìfigure supplement 1E. Thus, the mechanistic explanation is that Mediator kinases cause elevated levels of FA and cholesterol metabolites via changes in expression of FA and cholesterol biosynthesis genes (at least in part). We further address the mechanism with the PRO-seq data and TFEA results in Figure 6; in particular, p53 activity is rapidly suppressed in CA-treated T21 cells (t=75min), and this alone is sufficient to activate SREBP [Moon et al. Cell 2019 564]. CA-dependent activation of SREBP target genes is a dominant feature in the T21 RNA-seq data (t=4.5h).</p><p>We agree with the second point raised by reviewer 2, that our data suggest but do not prove nuclear receptor function is altered by CA treatment. We do cite papers that have provided good evidence that the metabolites elevated in CA-treated cells are NR ligands and activate their target genes. Additional experiments to address this question might involve targeted depletion of select metabolites via inhibition of key biosynthetic enzymes. We consider these experiments beyond the scope of this already expansive article. That said, it will be challenging to conclusively demonstrate clear cause-effect relationships (e.g. to demonstrate whether select metabolites altered by CA treatment directly alter PPARA function), given (i) the myriad transcriptional and metabolic changes caused by CA treatment, coupled with the fact that (ii) the CA-dependent lipid metabolite changes are spread out across chemically distinct NR agonists (e.g. endocannabinoids, oleamide, or cholesterol metabolites such as desmosterol), and (iii) NR activation can occur via multiple different metabolites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The figures are outstanding but dense.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have done our best to represent the results clearly and within the publication guidelines. There was an enormous amount of data to summarize for this article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 6 (PRO-Seq). The authors refer to pro-inflammatory TFs (e.g. NF-kB/RelA). It is not clear whether the authors have specifically examined TF binding at enhancers or more broadly at every region occupied by the interrogated TFs?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. Our analysis (TFEA) only identified the TFs whose activity was changing in CA-treated cells. It did not distinguish where these TFs were bound (enhancers vs. promoters). We completed a modified TFEA by separating enhancer TFs vs. promoter TFs. The results showed a preference for CA-dependent suppression of enhancer-bound TFs. This result is consistent with the general observation that stimulus-response transcription is controlled by enhancer-bound TFs (e.g. Kim et al. Nature 2010 182; Azofeifa et al. Genome Res 2018 334; Jones et al. bioRxiv 2024 585303). However, our TFEA enhancer/promoter analysis is preliminary and more work would be needed to address this comment in a rigorous way. Therefore, we did not include this analysis in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewing Editor Comments:</bold></p><p>Main suggestions for improvement:</p><p>(1) Provide additional information about the mechanistic basis for the changes in lipid levels observed on kinase inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the text to better emphasize that the mechanistic basis involves (i) gene expression changes resulting from Mediator kinase inhibition (e.g. Fig 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 1D, E, Fig 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 2B, Fig 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 4B-D); (ii) activation of SREBP and PPAR and LXR, based upon IPA results with RNA-seq data (e.g. Fig 2B, Fig 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 1F, Fig 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 2D, Fig 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 4E; Fig 3E), and (iii) rapid CAdependent suppression of p53 function (Fig 6A), which will activate SREBP (Moon et al. Cell 2019 564).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Provide direct genetic evidence that the nuclear receptors are activated by the lipid changes to mediate an anti-inflammatory program in response to Mediator kinase inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent question but we consider it beyond the scope of this already expansive study. That said, we cite several papers in the article that demonstrate that the lipids we observe elevated in CA-treated cells (i) directly bind PPAR or LXR and (ii) activate their TF function. We also note that the anti-inflammatory impacts of Mediator kinase inhibition are broad, affecting distinct gene sets through transcriptional changes, metabolites, and cytokines. Any NR-specific contributions could be challenging to de-couple from CA-dependent effects using knockdown or depletion methods, given the compensatory responses that would result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Improve/expand the evidence that Mediator kinase inhibition confers reduced mitochondrial function.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new Seahorse data for sibling-matched D21 and T21 cells (¬±CA) for the version of record. Our prior results showed reduced mitochondrial function and OCR in CA-treated T21 cells. We have added data that compares D21 and T21 mitochondrial function. As shown in new Figure 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 4A-C, the T21 line shows higher basal levels of OCR and ECAR compared with D21. These results are consistent with a Down syndrome mouse model study published last year [Sarver et al. eLife 2023 e86023]. When we compare CA-treated T21 with D21 cells, mitochondrial respiration and OCR are similar, suggesting that Mediator kinase inhibition might normalize mitochondrial function (and ECAR) toward D21 levels. We show this comparison in new Figure 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 4D-F. Although this may suggest a therapeutic benefit, we emphasize that more experiments would be needed to make such claims with confidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Determine whether mitochondrial function is reduced in the T21 cells vs. the D21 controls and whether kinase inhibition with the inhibitor reduces mitochondrial function to pathological levels.</p></disp-quote><p>For the version of record, we have added a direct comparison of mitochondrial parameters and OCR in the sibling-matched D21/T21 lines. The data show that T21 cells have higher OCR compared with D21. These results are consistent with a Down syndrome mouse model study published last year [Sarver et al. eLife 2023 e86023]. Our results also indicate that CA treatment brings OCR and other &quot;mitochondrial parameters&quot; in T21 cells toward D21 levels, as noted above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Consider whether the CDK8/19 inhibitor has off-target effects that would lessen its therapeutic value.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose cortistatin A (CA) for this project because it is the most potent and selective inhibitor available for targeting CDK8/CDK19. Initial published reports suggested off-target effects (Cee et al. Angew Chem IEE 2009), but these experiments used binding assays against the kinase protein alone, and did not measure binding or inhibition with biologically relevant, active kinase complexes. Kinome-wide screens involving native, active kinase complexes showed no evidence of off-target effects for cortistatin A, even at concentrations 5000-times the measured KD (Pelish et al. Nature 2015). See Author response image 1.</p><p>Related to CA therapeutic value, that is an important issue but beyond the scope of this study. We consider CA a valuable chemical probe, to use as a means to define CDK8/CDK19-dependent functions in cell line models. As a chemical probe, we consider CA the &quot;best-in-class&quot; Mediator kinase inhibitor, based upon all available data (Clopper &amp; Taatjes Curr Opin Chem Biol 2022 102186).</p><p>That said, we understand the concern about off-target effects, which can never be ruled out with a chemical inhibitor. We include quantitative western data (Fig 1 ‚Äì figure supplement 1A) that compares CA with a structurally distinct CDK8/CDK19 inhibitor, CCT251545. The data show that, as expected, CA (100nM) and CCT251545 (250nM) similarly inhibit STAT1 S727 phosphorylation in IFN-stimulated cells. The samples were pre-treated with inhibitor for 30 minutes prior to IFNg and collected 45 minutes after IFNg treatment.</p><p>We did not complete any experiments with knockouts or kinasedead alleles primarily because knockouts or kinase-dead alleles are not reliable comparisons for chemical inhibition because of the different time frames involved. For example, there will be genetic compensation in edited cell lines (Rossi/Stanier Nature 2015 230) and we and others have shown that there are major differences between kinase protein loss through knockdown or knockout methods vs. rapid inhibition with small molecules (e.g. Poss et al. Cell Rep 2016 436; Sooraj et al. Mol Cell 2022 123).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Information about cortistatin A.</title><p>(A) KiNativ kinome screen from HEK293 lysates.

Specifically, we have added splicing data analysis for the &quot;non-sibling&quot; T21 cell line (¬±cortistatin A, t=4.5h) and for the sibling T21 line (¬±cortistatin A) at t=24h. The results are summarized in new Figure 5 ‚Äì figure supplement 2. The data are in agreement with our prior results from the sibling T21 line ¬±CA at t=4.5h. In particular, (i) similar numbers of genes were impacted by splicing changes (alternative exon inclusion or alternative exon skipping) in CA-treated cells in the &quot;non-sibling&quot; T21 line compared with the sibling T21 line; (ii) upon completion of a pathway analysis of these alternatively spliced genes, similar pathways, including IFN signaling pathways, were affected by CA in each case (non-sibling T21 vs. sibling T21); (iii) regarding the new t=24h timepoint for the sibling T21 line, similar numbers of genes were alternatively spliced (alternative exon inclusion or alternative exon skipping) in CA-treated cells compared with the 4.5h timepoint, and (iv) the IPA results with the alternately spliced genes identified inflammatory signaling, mRNA processing, nucleotide and lipid metabolism among other pathways, which broadly reflect the cytokine screen and metabolomics data in CA-treated cells (t=24h).</p><p>Additional evidence for CDK8/CDK19 regulation of splicing comes from our t=24h RNA-seq data in T21 cells ¬±CA. GSEA results from sibling T21 cells ¬±CA revealed down-regulation of many pathways related to RNA processing and splicing (RNA-seq data, t=24h), suggesting that the splicing changes caused by Mediator kinase inhibition result from reduced expression of splicing regulators, at least at longer timeframes. These results are summarized in new Figure 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 2E.</p><p>Related to how splicing alterations may be contributing to the CA-dependent effects and their potential therapeutic implications, this is an interesting question but open-ended. It will not be straightforward to link specific splicing changes to possible therapeutic outcomes, especially given that there are hundreds of genes affected and because the effects are modest (i.e. not all-ornothing).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The findings that CA treatment leads to upregulation of as many genes are downregulated is consistent with previous studies of a 50:50 role for the CKM. However, most previous studies utilized knockout alleles or knockdown approaches. As the authors demonstrated in a previous study, CA inhibits kinase activity without changing CDK8 levels. Does this indicate that the kinase activity of Cdk8/19 is required for transcriptional repression? Previous in vitro studies suggested that Cdk8/19-dependent repression was independent of their kinase activity. The authors should comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a challenging question to address, because the answer will depend on the timing of the experiment and the experimental context. The short answer is that the kinase activity of CDK8/19 will activate some genes and reduce expression of others, at least in part because CDK8/19 phosphorylate TFs, which drive global gene expression programs. TF phosphorylation by CDK8/19 appears to activate some genes and repress others (e.g. STAT1 S727A example from Steinparzer et al. Mol Cell 2019 485), at least based upon RNA-seq data, but this doesn't measure the immediate effects on the transcriptome. It is true that kinase activity isn't required to block pol II incorporation into the PIC (Knuesel et al. Genes Dev 2009 439). This is a kinase-independent function of the module; MKM-Mediator binding will block Mediator-pol II interaction and therefore block PIC assembly and pol II initiation (Knuesel 2009; Ebmeier &amp; Taatjes PNAS 2010 11283). The kinase-independent functions of CDK8/19 were not a focus of the work described here. We only focus on Mediator kinase activity. We also do not focus on potential effects on RNAPII initiation or PIC assembly, although these are important peripheral topics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Descriptors are less useful as the reader must go back to reconstruct the experiment: &quot;Although metabolites were measured 24h after CA treatment, these data suggest that altered lipid metabolites influence LXR and PPAR function&quot;. Does &quot;altered&quot; mean the lipid concentrations were up or down? Similarly, lipids that &quot;influenced&quot; LXR function - were they stimulatory or inhibitory?</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. Where possible, we used more accurate language when describing CAdependent changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I found many sections in the text confusing. For example: Figure 3. Mediator kinase inhibition antagonizes IFNŒ≥ transcriptional responses in T21 and D21. It takes a while to unpack this figure title. Instead of the double negative, the authors could simply state that &quot;Mediator kinase is required for IFN-dependent transcriptional activation&quot;. Describing the protein activity, versus the drug-induced phenotype, can often clarify complicated scenarios.</p></disp-quote><p>Good idea. We have edited the text to eliminate some but not all of these double negatives. In some cases we prefer to describe the consequence of kinase inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The splicing data analysis is compelling, but not well integrated into the overall story and it cuts the storytelling logic in the Abstract. The authors could consider better integrating the large amount of data generated and better explaining how it relates to the various aspects of the proposed model (transcriptional, metabolism) to help improve potential cause-and-effect outcomes. -</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. The large amount of data, combined with the different experimental approaches, makes it a challenge to summarize the data in a concise way. We have done our best to organize the results in a logical and clear manner. To address this comment, we have gone through the text and re-organized where possible, and we have edited the abstract. We have added new splicing data and the splicing results are now better integrated (in our opinion) in part because of the pathway results from the t=24h ¬±CA RNA-seq data, which show major reductions in gene sets related to splicing and RNA processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The manuscript could improve its readability by providing specific details throughout. Examples include (i) explaining why and what 29 cytokines were chosen for the screen (p. 3, p. 4) (ii) providing major data analysis conclusions to the cytokine screen part (p. 3) (iii) expanding the conclusions to the metabolic pathway analysis (p. 4) (iv) being more precise when referring to T21-specific changes (up or down?) (p 4), and &quot;significantly altered&quot; by CA treatment in T21 cells (up or down?) (p. 5).</p></disp-quote><p>Good points. We have edited the text to address these comments. Please note that the 29 cytokines refers to a different study (Malle et al. Nature 2023) and we had no role in selecting the cytokines. Our screen involved 105 cytokines that were arrayed as part of a commercially available panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The figures are outstanding but dense (e.g., Figure 1b, can any simplification and/or highlighting be done to underscore important features?). Some panels are illegible (e.g. Figure 1- supplement Figure 2a and b). The authors could improve data presentation. For example, the Venn diagrams (e.g., Figure 2f) are hard to quickly digest. Can the authors find a better way to highlight important data (e.g., hard to distinguish the meaning of font bolding from italics)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions. Regarding Figure 1B, we simplified the metabolic pathways to emphasize the biochemicals that specifically relate to this study. We decided against highlighting specific metabolites beyond this simplification, because in our opinion it causes as many problems as it solves. Where possible, we have enlarged the panels with hard-to-read text; thank you for the suggestion. For the Venn diagrams, they convey a large amount of information in a single panel: increased or decreased gene expression in T21 or D21, cytokine genes or cytokine receptors, and gene expression convergence or divergence compared with protein levels from cytokine screens. There is a different way to display the results, but it would involve generating more data panels to parse out the results. This could be considered better, but we opted for something that is more information-rich that requires only a single data panel. Given the large amount of data already shown, we hope the reviewer can understand this choice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
