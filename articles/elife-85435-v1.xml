For these epidemics to develop, populations need to be mobile. However, the role of population-level mobility in the development of generalized HIV epidemics has not been studied. Here we do so by studying historical migration data from Botswana, which has one of the most severe generalized HIV epidemics worldwide; HIV prevalence was 21% in 2021. The country reported its first AIDS case in 1985 when it began to rapidly urbanize. We hypothesize that, during the development of Botswana’s epidemic, the population was extremely mobile and the country was highly connected by substantial migratory flows. We test this mobility hypothesis by conducting a network analysis using a historical time series (1981–2011) of micro-census data from Botswana. Our results support our hypothesis. We found complex migration networks with very high rates of rural-to-urban, and urban-to-rural, migration: 10% of the population moved annually. Mining towns (where AIDS cases were first reported, and risk behavior was high) were important in-flow and out-flow migration hubs, suggesting that they functioned as ‘core groups’ for HIV transmission and dissemination. Migration networks could have dispersed HIV throughout Botswana and generated the current hyperendemic epidemic.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Over 25 million people in sub-Saharan Africa live with HIV.

All of the HIV epidemics in this continent are generalized: in these types of epidemics, the epidemic is dispersed throughout the country. Therefore, a population needs to be highly mobile in order for a generalized epidemic to have developed. However, although the epidemiology of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa has been widely studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Farley et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Read et al., 2022</xref>), the role of population-level mobility patterns in the development of generalized HIV epidemics has not been assessed for any country on the continent. Botswana has one of the most severe HIV epidemics worldwide and reported its first AIDS case in the early 1980s. Since then, the epidemic has become generalized and hyperendemic: in 2021, HIV prevalence in adults (15–64) was 21% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mine et al., 2022</xref>). Simultaneous to the development of its generalized HIV epidemic, Botswana has undergone rapid urbanization. It was predominantly rural in 1981, but had become predominantly urban by 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Statistics Botswana, 2014</xref>); by that time Botswana’s HIV epidemic had stabilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">CSO Botswana, 2009</xref>). We hypothesize that – during the development of Botswana’s epidemic – the population was extremely mobile and highly connected by substantial urban-to-rural and rural-to-urban migratory flows. We test this mobility hypothesis by conducting a network analysis using a historical time series of micro-census data collected in Botswana. These data contain information both on migration and urbanization. The time series covers the time period from when the epidemic was first apparent to when it stabilized in 2011. We use these data to (i) estimate the annual incidence (at the national level) of internal migration over three decades (1981–2011), (ii) characterize migrants on the basis of gender and age, (iii) reconstruct internal migration networks (in order to identify large-scale population movements and connectivity patterns), (iv) identify migration hubs, (v) understand and visualize the role of migration networks in urbanization, and (vi) determine the extent to which internal migration led to a substantial geographic redistribution of the population. The Government of Botswana defines internal migration as residents changing their place of permanent residence within their home country. Finally, we discuss how the historical migration networks – that we identify in our analyses – had the potential to disperse HIV throughout Botswana and generate a hyperendemic epidemic.</p><p>After 80 y of colonial rule, Botswana gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1966 and has since been Africa’s longest uninterrupted democracy. One of the poorest countries in the world at the time of independence, Botswana has since undergone rapid urbanization and economic expansion; the diamond mining industry is the economic foundation of Botswana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett et al., 2002</xref>). Rich diamond deposits were discovered immediately after independence; the first diamond mine (Orapa) became fully operational in July 1971, the second mine (Jwaneng) in August 1982. These two mines are now amongst the world’s richest diamond mines. Today, Botswana is an upper-middle-income country with a high demographic growth rate: the population approximately doubled from 1 to 2 million, from 1981 and 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Statistics Botswana, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In 1981, the vast majority of the population lived in small rural villages. Only ~18% of the population were living in urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Statistics Botswana, 2014</xref>): either in one of the two cities (Gaborone, the capital, or Francistown) or in one of the four towns (Lobatse, Selebi Phikwe, Orapa, and Jwaneng). Lobatse is an administrative center, and the other three are mining towns. Selebi Phikwe is based on copper and nickel mining, and was founded in the early 1970s. By 2011, only ~36% of the population were living in rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Statistics Botswana, 2014</xref>). The remaining population were living in one of the three types of urban centers: a city (there were still only two cities), a town (there were now five towns following the 1991 addition of Sowa, a mining town for soda ash), or an urban village. In Botswana, an urban village is defined as a settlement with at least 5,000 individuals and 75% of the workforce engaged in non-agricultural economic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Statistics Botswana, 2014</xref>). The urban villages developed by in situ urbanization, which is defined as rural settlements transforming into urban areas by expanding their non-agricultural activities and increasing economic linkages with neighboring areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moriconi-Ebrard et al., 2020</xref>). Botswana now consists of 28 administrative districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Okano et al., 2021</xref>). Each city and town are separate administrative districts, and the remaining 21 districts each contain at least one urban village and many rural villages.</p><p>A great deal is known about the epidemiology of HIV in Botswana in terms of the temporal increase, and geographic variation, in prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Magosi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Novitsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Novitsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Okano et al., 2021</xref>). HIV prevalence rose quickly and spread fairly widely. The first case of AIDS was reported in 1985 from the mining town of Selebi Phikwe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">African Natural Resources Center, 2016</xref>) in the late 1980s; additional cases were reported from the two diamond mining towns (Jwaneng and Orapa) and the city, Francistown. In 1990, the first HIV Sentinel Surveillance Survey of antenatal clinic (ANC) attendees (15–49years old) was conducted in Gaborone and in one rural district (Boteti): HIV prevalence was found to be 6% and 4%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">UNAIDS and World Health Organization, 2004</xref>). In 1992, a national sentinel surveillance survey began and was conducted annually to 2011. National prevalence in pregnant women was found to have already reached a very high level (18%) by 1992 and continued to increase for the next 8 y: 23% by 1993, 32% by 1995, and 39% by 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">UNAIDS and World Health Organization, 2004</xref>). Based on the ANC data, HIV prevalence in the cities and the mines was the highest. In Francistown, prevalence was 8% in 1991, 24% by 1992, and 44% by 2000. In Gaborone, prevalence rose from 15% in 1992 to 36% by 2000. In the mining town of Selebi Phikwe, prevalence rose from 27% in 1994 to 50% by 2000. By the late 1990s, a high AIDS morbidity and mortality rate in miners led the diamond mining company Debswana to conduct an HIV prevalence survey of its (male) employees. The survey took place in 1999: 29% of miners were found to be infected with HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett et al., 2002</xref>). The first population-level survey in Botswana to test participants for HIV (BAIS II, the Botswana AIDS Impact Survey) was conducted in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">NACA and CSO Botswana, 2005</xref>). It found, at that time, that HIV prevalence in the general population was 29% in women and 20% in men, aged 15–49 years old. Gender-stratified prevalence was the same in 2008, when BAIS III was conducted; the considerable geographic variation in HIV prevalence amongst districts that existed at that time is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Notably, phylogenetic studies have shown that viral lineages have dispersed widely throughout Botswana, suggesting that large-scale population-level movements have occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Magosi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Novitsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Novitsky et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HIV prevalence at the district-level.</title><p>HIV prevalence estimated using BAIS III data (2008) for adults ages 15–69.

The CMI represents the overall incidence, or level of internal migration, per hundred residents over a specified time interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell et al., 2002</xref>); it is an indicator of the propensity of the population to move and is a measure of migration both between districts and within districts. The CMI remained markedly high and constant: 9.04 per hundred persons between 1980 and 1981, 10.45 per hundred persons between 1990 and 1991, 10.73 per hundred persons between 2000 and 2001, and 10.32 per hundred persons between 2010 and 2011. We found that migrants were more likely to move between districts than to move within districts; this propensity, calculated as a ratio (the number of migrants moving between districts relative to the number of migrants moving within districts), increased over time from 1.25 (1981) to 2.40 (2001 and 2011).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Age profiles of migrants</title><p>Gender-stratified age profiles of migrants are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

There were very high turnover rates in 1981, with the highest occurring in the mining town, Jwaneng, where turnover was ~45 per hundred residents.</p><p>More than half of the districts also had a fairly high within district migration intensity (WDMI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>): for example, in Central Bobonong, ~7% of residents moved from one rural village to another between 1980 and 1981. The cities and towns have very low levels of within-district movement due to their small geographic size. In general, levels of WDMI were higher on the west side of the country, lower in the southeast, and fairly stable over time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Reconstructed internal migration networks</title><p>The chord diagrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) show the reconstructed internal migration networks, based on the micro-census data, between 1980–1981 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), 1990–1991 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), 2000–2001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and 2010–2011 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Notably, in all four networks, many of the flows and counter-flows are similar in magnitude.

The MEI, which ranges from 0 to 100, quantifies the balance between the migratory flows and counter-flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shryock et al., 1975</xref>). Low values of the MEI indicate that the migratory flows and counter-flows are fairly balanced; the higher the value of the MEI, the greater the asymmetry between flows and counter-flows. The ANMR measures the impact of internal migration on geographically redistributing the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell et al., 2002</xref>): it identifies the net shift of population between districts per hundred residents per year. The ANMR is determined by both the intensity of migration (as specified by the CMI) and the balance between the migratory flows and counter-flows (as specified by the MEI).</p><p>We estimated that the MEI was 7.30 between 1980 and 1981, 7.18 between 1990 and 1991, 5.19 between 2000 and 2001, and 7.77 between 2010 and 2011. These values indicate that the migratory flows and counter-flows in Botswana were fairly symmetric (therefore, internal migration networks were not very effective in geographically redistributing the population) and were not substantially different between each census. We estimated that the ANMR was 0.66 between 1980 and 1981, 0.75 between 1990 and 1991, 0.56 between 2000 and 2001, and 0.80 between 2010 and 2011. Therefore, the overall impact of migration on geographically redistributing the population was very low: the net shift of the population between districts was less than one individual per hundred residents in the 12 mo prior to each census.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results support our mobility hypothesis that – during the development of Botswana’s generalized HIV epidemic (i.e., between 1981 and 2011) – the population was extremely mobile and the country was highly connected by urban-to-rural migratory flows and rural-to-urban counter-flows. Using our time series of historical data, we found ~10% of the population moved their residency in the 12 mo before each census in 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011. The constancy of this value at each census suggests that the annual migration rate in Botswana was stable at ~10% for each year between 1981 and 2011. Notably, the type of migrants also remained constant over this time period: evenly split by gender, with younger people more likely to migrate. We found that migration occurred within districts, as well as between districts, but that migration between districts was more common. Even in 1981, at the beginning of the period of rapid urbanization, the migration network was highly connected and therefore large-scale population movements linked almost all of the districts in the country. Notably, we found at each census, that although the number of urbanized districts increased (as did their population size) the vast majority of migratory flows between the rural and developing urban districts were balanced by counter-flows.</p><p>Our results on migration networks show how a generalized epidemic had the potential to develop: HIV could have diffused, via the migration networks, throughout Botswana. The first cases of AIDS in Botswana were reported in the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">African Natural Resources Center, 2016</xref>); this suggests that HIV may have been circulating in Botswana in the 1970s, as HIV has an incubation period of 10–12 y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hendriks et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Muñoz et al., 1989</xref>). One phylogenetic study indicates that HIV was introduced into Botswana in the 1960s, but exponential growth did not begin until the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wilkinson et al., 2015</xref>). Another study suggests that HIV spread southward from Kinshasa (the epicenter of the HIV epidemic) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo via travelers on the railroad that was built in the 1800s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faria et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, this railroad goes through Francistown, which is one of Botswana’s two cities, and where HIV prevalence quickly rose to high levels in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">UNAIDS and World Health Organization, 2004</xref>). It is possible that HIV was introduced into the mining towns of Botswana from overseas or South Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, many young men from Botswana went to work in the mines in South Africa, returning as the mining industry became established in their home country. Our results show that, by 1981, the migration networks (for women and men) linked almost every district in Botswana. This indicates that HIV-infected migrants from Francistown and/or the mining towns (where AIDS cases were first reported and HIV prevalence quickly rose to high levels) could have seeded HIV sub-epidemics in multiple rural districts throughout the country. HIV could then have spread widely within these districts due to the high rates of within-district migration that we have found. Due to the high and continuous migration rates, the sub-epidemics in rural districts were likely to have been seeded numerous times by HIV-infected migrants. When HIV was first introduced into rural districts, the sub-epidemics in these districts may have been maintained by source-sink dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Okano et al., 2020</xref>): districts where transmission was high enough to be self-sustaining (e.g., mining towns) could have maintained sub-epidemics in rural districts where transmission was too low to be self-sustaining. Our results suggest that migratory flows, and counter-flows, between high and low prevalence areas (e.g., between the mining towns and rural areas, or between Botswana’s two cities and rural areas) are likely to have existed, at least from the early 1980s onward. These flows would have functioned as ‘transmission corridors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Okano et al., 2021</xref>), and created high-risk flows that crossed the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Valdano et al., 2021</xref>), that is, HIV-infected people migrating from high-prevalence to lower-prevalence areas, and uninfected people migrating from low-prevalence areas to higher-prevalence areas. Taken together, our results show that the highly connected migration networks, with high migratory flows and counter-flows, could have contributed to the development of Botswana’s generalized epidemic by distributing HIV throughout the country in the general population.</p><p>Our results on migration networks potentially explain how Botswana’s HIV epidemic became hyperendemic. Migrants have been shown to be at high risk of acquiring HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camlin and Charlebois, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dobra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Olawore et al., 2018</xref>); our results suggest that, due to migration alone, each year ~10% of the population of Botswana was at high risk. The migrants in Botswana were young women and men, a group generally at the highest risk of HIV infection through sexual transmission. Mining towns and cities would have been transmission hot-spots (for both women and men) due to high levels of risky sexual behavior (as evidenced by high HIV prevalence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">UNAIDS and World Health Organization, 2004</xref>) and a high probability of encountering an HIV-infected individual as a sex partner. Due to the high prevalence of HIV, high turnover rates, and a high level of connectivity to other districts, the mining towns and cities could have functioned as geographically defined core groups for sexual transmission (for both women and men). Some individuals could have been part of a high-risk core group when they were living in the cities and mining towns, and decreased their risky behavior when they returned to the rural districts. For example, FSWs in Botswana can have an extremely high number of sex partners in mining towns and urban areas (~7 per week) and remain as FSWs for ~4 y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ministry of Health Botswana, 2013</xref>). Notably we found that the mining towns and cities were both migration in-flow hubs and migration out-flow hubs. The fact that they were migration in-flow hubs would have led to a high in-flow of uninfected individuals from rural districts where prevalence was low; the fact that they were migration out-flow hubs (and had a very high prevalence of HIV) would have led to a high out-flow of HIV-infected individuals that could have seeded, and reseeded, sub-epidemics in rural districts. Therefore, rural-to-urban migration coupled with urban-to-rural migration could have been a very important driver in the Botswana epidemic becoming hyperendemic. Without it, prevalence could have reached very high levels in the mining towns and cities, but remained fairly low in rural districts.</p><p>We have discussed the potential impact of mobility on Botswana’s HIV epidemic, and focused on migration, that is, one directional movement in terms of a permanent relocation of residency. This type of migration, by changing an individual’s sexual network and social environment, has been shown to increase the risk of acquiring HIV for both women and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anglewicz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camlin and Charlebois, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dzomba et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Low et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Olawore et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thorp et al., 2023</xref>). Short-term mobility (e.g., short-term circular migration, where the trip can range in duration from overnight to an entire season) can also affect HIV transmission dynamics. Circular migrants have been shown to both have an increased risk of acquiring HIV, and of transmitting HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camlin and Charlebois, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Palk and Blower, 2015</xref>). The greater the number of trips and/or the duration of the trip, the greater the risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Palk and Blower, 2015</xref>). We note that both migration and short-term mobility are important, and their relative importance to each other is likely to evolve over time as a generalized HIV epidemic diffuses through the population. Their relative importance is also likely to vary amongst countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Our results also provide insights into the role of Botswana’s internal migration network during a period of rapid urbanization. The urbanization process was first studied quantitatively by Ravenstein, who analyzed the 1871 and 1881 censuses of Great Britain and Ireland, and calculated the flows of lifetime migrants to urban centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ravenstein, 1885</xref>). He showed that internal migration from rural areas was essential to the growth of industrial cities and towns. Additionally, he demonstrated that migration was extremely important in changing settlement patterns and geographically redistributing the population in both Great Britain and Ireland. In contrast, we found at each census, that generally the majority of rural-to-urban migratory flows were balanced by counter-flows from urban areas to rural villages. Consequently, even though there was a very high migration rate, we found that migration did not drive urbanization, and also had relatively little impact on geographically redistributing Botswana’s population. Differences between Botswana and high-income countries, in the role of internal migration on urbanization, were due to in situ urbanization occurring in Botswana (rather than the rapid growth of cities and towns as in high-income countries) and high rural-to-urban migratory flows being balanced by high urban-to-rural counter-flows. During the 30-year time period that we have analyzed (1981–2011), population growth in Botswana was high: the population doubled. Notably, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development recently reported that since 1990, in situ urbanization and high population growth rates have driven Africa’s rapid growth in urbanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moriconi-Ebrard et al., 2020</xref>). Countries are at different stages of urbanization, but urbanization is occurring in essentially all African countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, &amp; Population Division, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our results on the role of migration on urbanization have significant implications for predicting migratory flows in Africa. Africa has high migration rates and is one of the least urbanized places in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, &amp; Population Division, 2019</xref>): the number of urban residents on the continent approximately doubled between 1995 and 2015, and is projected to double again by 2040 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lall et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, it is important to be able to predict migration patterns and flows in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Okano et al., 2021</xref>); for example, for urban planning and developing efficient resource allocation strategies. The mathematical models currently being used to predict migratory flows in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciavarella and Ferguson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Marshall et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Meredith et al., 2021</xref>) have been developed based on migratory processes that have been observed, and census data that have been collected, in high-income countries. The two most commonly used predictive models, the gravity model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stewart, 1948</xref>) and the radiation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Simini et al., 2012</xref>), make the central assumption that individuals are attracted to move to a new location based on the population size at the destination relative to the size at the origin, moving from the smaller to the larger population. Under this assumption, it is expected that we would have found asymmetry in migration flows between rural-to-urban and urban-to-rural areas, and a migration-induced geographic redistribution of the population. However, we found almost symmetric migratory counter-flows occurring throughout the country, and that migration had almost no impact on changing the geographic distribution of the population. Therefore, our results suggest that new mathematical models are needed to predict migration in Botswana, and – potentially – in other rapidly urbanizing countries in Africa where in situ urbanization is occurring.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, we have examined only internal migration (i.e., migration that takes place within a country) and have not included international migration. However, for the three-decade time period that we have investigated, the number of international migrants to Botswana was much smaller than the number of internal migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Statistics Botswana, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Statistics Botswana, 2015</xref>). Second, all of our analyses are focused on Botswana in order to analyze the impact of migration networks on the development of a generalized hyperendemic epidemic; we have not evaluated migration networks in other African countries. We recommend that studies, such as we have conducted here, are conducted in these other countries by analyzing a time series of historical micro-census data, especially in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa that have generalized hyperendemic HIV epidemics, such as Eswatini and Lesotho. Third, a potential limitation is that the IPUMS-International (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series-International) data that we used are samples rather than the complete censuses; we used this approach as it is generally not possible to obtain complete census data due to privacy reasons. Fourth, while we have gained insights into understanding the development of the generalized hyperendemic HIV epidemic in Botswana, we have not conducted an analysis of the transmission dynamics of the epidemic in order to explore these insights quantitatively. This is the focus of current research in which we are analyzing a geospatial mathematical model of the epidemiological evolution of the HIV epidemic in Botswana. Finally, we have examined only one process (internal migration) that has affected the evolution of Botswana’s epidemic; other factors could also have been important.</p><p>All HIV epidemics in SSA are generalized; HIV can only diffuse through a population by the movement of people. To our knowledge, our study is the first to study population-level mobility patterns and rates in any country in sub-Saharan Africa. Taken together, our results identify particular characteristics of migration networks in Botswana that could explain why HIV prevalence rose to very high levels in many districts throughout the country. Migration networks in other countries with generalized HIV epidemics may be very different. If mining towns and/or cities in these countries were not migratory in-flow and out-flow hubs with high turnover of their populations, as in Botswana, they would not have served as major sources of infection for dispersing HIV throughout the general population. Botswana has recently achieved the 95-95-95 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mine et al., 2022</xref>) that UNAIDS specified needed to be reached by 2030 in order to eliminate HIV: 95% of people living with HIV need to be diagnosed, 95% of the diagnosed need to be on treatment, and 95% of those on treatment need to be virally suppressed. However, transmission is continuing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Magosi et al., 2022</xref>), as is urbanization and large-scale population movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Okano et al., 2021</xref>). The same processes that we have identified that may have contributed to the development of the generalized hyperendemic HIV epidemic in Botswana may prevent the elimination of HIV.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data</title><p>To conduct our analyses, we used representative samples of micro-census data extracted from the IPUMS-International database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Minnesota Population, 2020</xref>): these data are anonymized individual-level data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ruggles et al., 2015</xref>).

The framework consists of five classes that are defined (at any point in time) based on the degree of urbanization of the district at the time of the most recent census: (i) predominantly rural (&lt;40% of the population live in urban areas), (ii) partially urban (40–60% of the population live in urban areas), (iii) predominantly urban (&gt;60% of the population live in urban areas), (iv) town (100% of the population live in urban areas), or (v) city (100% of the population live in urban areas). Classes (i)–(iii) only include urban areas that develop by in situ urbanization, that is, rural villages transforming into urban villages. There are migratory flows between the five classes, and flows within each of the five classes: therefore, 25 migratory flows are possible.</p><p>The migration-urbanization framework can be visualized in two formats: (i) a schematic figure showing the five classes, the number of residents in each class, and migratory flows (and counter-flows) amongst and within the classes; and (ii) Sankey diagrams showing the number of migrants who move within, and between, the five classes.</p><p>We used the micro-census data to parameterize the framework for Botswana. Specifically, we estimated – at the time of each census – the population size of each district and determined how many individuals lived in rural and urban areas. We used these estimates to classify all districts into one of the five classes. We then calculated the migratory flows and counter-flows between, and within, districts in the 12 mo prior to each survey. These parameter estimates are given for the 1981 census (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>), the 1991 census (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>), the 2001 census (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>), and the 2011 census (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>).

Preliminary data indicated migration patterns could have supported HIV diffusion, this can be a starting point for more in-depth analyses.

We have also included an additional Figure (Figure 1): this is a district-level map of Botswana that shows the countrywide geographic variation in HIV prevalence (the map is based on population-level HIV-testing data that were collected in 2008).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Is there any additional information about economic growth, or political events for example, that could clarify or add context to these migration flows? As it stands now, these analyses are quite basic and don't take into account underlying demographic, economic, or political trends that compel people to move.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this concern we have expanded the text in the introduction to provide more context regarding political, demographic and economic factors (Introduction: lines 66-75). We have also expanded our discussion of the implications of our results (and of additional results that we have included: lines 263-283) for understanding the role of internal migration on urbanization in Botswana (Discussion: lines 379-420); urbanization occurred simultaneously to the development of Botswana’s generalized hyperendemic HIV epidemic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

To some degree, this is self-evident, but it would be useful if there are any other countries/periods to compare against.

We agree with the Reviewer that it is self-evident that the rates of migration that we find are high. Unfortunately – to the best of our knowledge – there do not appear to be any similar analyses of historical migration data, over the same time period and at the similar administrative level, in other countries that we can compare our migration rates with. Calculating comparable rates is a complex problem because: (i) very few censuses collect data on short-term population movement, and (ii) there is substantial heterogeneity in the geographic size of administrative units (which is necessary in order to make meaningful comparisons). For instance, of countries near Botswana, only Namibia also had a census that tracked one-year movements. While the rate of movement is smaller (2% in 2006) than Botswana’s, this may be in part due to Namibia’s regions being geographically larger (and hence requiring more travel to traverse) than Botswana’s districts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It would be useful to include some text discussing why migratory mobility might be more relevant for HIV than short-term trips, or more discussion of short-term trips in general. For example, the FSM average stay-time being 4 years seems like a compelling reason to think about migration (it happens frequently enough that it could be a significant contributor to new cases elsewhere).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the paragraph (given below) to the revised text (Discussion: lines 364-377). In the text, we have included citations for the paragraph.</p><p>“We have discussed the potential impact of mobility on Botswana’s HIV epidemic, and focused on migration, i.e., one directional movement in terms of a permanent re-location of residency. This type of migration, by changing an individual’s sexual network and social environment, has been shown to increase the risk of acquiring HIV for both women and men. Short-term mobility (e.g., short-term circular migration, where the trip can range in duration from overnight to an entire season) can also affect HIV transmission dynamics. Circular migrants have been shown to both have an increased risk of acquiring HIV, and of transmitting HIV. The greater the number of trips and/or the duration of the trip, the greater the risk. We note that both migration and short-term mobility are important, and their relative importance to each other is likely to evolve over time as a generalized HIV epidemic diffuses through the population. Their relative importance is also likely to vary amongst countries in sub-Saharan Africa.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In general, overlaying HIV risk with some of the outcomes would be interesting. Are there data on the age distribution of HIV cases during 1980-2000? It would be interesting to see that overlaid on the figure showing the demographics of migrants over time. (Figure 1)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that overlaying HIV risk with some of the other outcomes would be interesting. However, unfortunately, there are not any data on the age distribution of HIV cases during 1980-2000. Such data were not collected in Botswana for the earliest AIDS cases in the interest of maintaining anonymity due to concerns regarding stigma.</p><p>However, we have added to the revised manuscript (Introduction: lines 97-99) that the first reported AIDS cases were young men who were miners. We have added a citation to support this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Maps would help visualize some of the other results.

The total number of internal migrants, <italic>M</italic>, can be calculated as either (i) the total number of in-flow migrants into all of the districts, or (ii) the total number of out-flow migrants from all of the districts. These quantities are equivalent. This relationship has to hold as the out-flow of migrants from any district is the in-flow of migrants into one or more other districts.

Is 10 persons per 100 a lot compared to other countries?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to point 2 in “Essential revisions” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be useful to include some text discussing why migratory mobility might be more relevant for HIV than short-term trips, or more discussion of short-term trips in general. For example, the FSM average stay-time being 4 years seems like a compelling reason to think about migration (it happens frequently enough that it could be a significant contributor to new cases elsewhere).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to point 3 in “Essential revisions” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In general, overlaying HIV risk with some of the outcomes would be interesting. Are there data on the age distribution of HIV cases during 1980-2000? It would be interesting to see that overlaid on the figure showing the demographics of migrants over time. (Figure 1)</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to point 4 in “Essential revisions” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Maps would help visualize some of the other results. For example, it would be interesting to see some of the Turnover/WDMI metrics by district on a map instead of in a table. It would also reduce the number of tables--I think right now Tables 1 – 4 feel more appropriate for SI than 4 separate tables in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer, and have now included maps of Net flow (Figure 3), Turnover (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and WDMI (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) over time. As suggested, we have now included Tables 1 – 4 as supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Turnover in particular would be nice to see on a map/slightly more emphasized. A lot of the metrics are fairly similar in both directions (as the authors point out in the discussion), but it would be additionally useful to see the net flow for some of the metrics.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included maps of Turnover (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) over time, as well as net flow (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5 might be better served with population flow reflected as arrow size rather than color. Right now it's hard to tell if there are any obvious trends.</p></disp-quote><p>To increase the clarity of this figure, we now use both arrow size and color – this is now Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1 – This would be a nice place to add HIV context if there is information on the age structure of HIV cases.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to point 4 in “Essential revisions” section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
