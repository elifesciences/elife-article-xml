extracellular matrix and are functional ligands for the inhibitory immune receptor leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor (LAIR)-1. LAIR-2 is a secreted protein that can act as a decoy receptor by binding collagen with higher affinity than LAIR-1. We propose that collagens promote immune evasion by interacting with LAIR-1 expressed on immune cells, and that LAIR-2 releases LAIR-1-mediated immune suppression. Analysis of public human datasets shows that collagens, LAIR-1 and LAIR-2 have unique and overlapping associations with survival in certain tumors. We designed a dimeric LAIR-2 with a functional IgG1 Fc tail, NC410, and showed that NC410 increases human T cell expansion and effector function in vivo in a mouse xenogeneic-graft versus-host disease model. In humanized mouse tumor models, NC410 reduces tumor growth that is dependent on T cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of human tumors shows that NC410 binds to collagen-rich areas where LAIR-1<sup>+</sup> immune cells are localized. Our findings show that NC410 might be a novel strategy for cancer immunotherapy for immune-excluded tumors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tumor</kwd><kwd>collagen</kwd><kwd>LAIR1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dutch Research Council (NWO)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vici 918.15.608</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyaard</surname><given-names>Linde</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NC410, a LAIR-2 Fc protein blocking LAIR-collagen interaction, might be a powerful new strategy for cancer immunotherapy for collagen-rich immune-excluded tumors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The introduction of immune checkpoint blockade therapies in the clinic has increased cancer treatment options for a wide range of tumors, leading to unprecedented and long-lasting clinical responses. However, not all patients show the same degree of response and not all tumors respond to these therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibney et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darvin et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, identifying novel checkpoints and developing ideal combinations of immunotherapies is essential to optimize and enhance the efficacy of treatment for these tumors, achieving durable anti-tumor effects with reduced side effects.</p><p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a major structural component in all tissues. It comprises a non-cellular meshwork of proteins, glycoproteins, proteoglycans and polysaccharides with collagens as the most abundant proteins. Ongoing ECM remodeling ensures tissue integrity and function, with specific collagens being synthesized and degraded in a highly regulated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnans et al., 2014</xref>). At least 28 different collagens comprising at least 43 genes have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2004</xref>). The ECM functions not only as a scaffold for tissue organization but also provides critical biochemical and biomechanical cues that instruct cell growth, survival, differentiation and migration and regulate vascular development and immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hynes, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Several epithelial tumors including breast, pancreatic, colorectal, ovarian and lung cancer are characterized by a dense ECM where high collagen content correlates with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, ECM or ‘Matrisome’ signatures associated with tumor type and stage of disease have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levental et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Naba et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naba et al., 2014a</xref>). Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalluri, 2016</xref>), macrophages and tumor cells themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Naba et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Januchowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naba et al., 2014a</xref>) all contribute to increased collagen production and remodeling during cancer progression.</p><p>Most tumors overexpress a diverse set of collagens in an abnormal fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nissen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Overexpression of collagens has been associated with poor overall survival in several tumor types, such as lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iizasa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ke et al., 2014</xref>), colorectal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Naba et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2018</xref>) and ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). The capacity of tumors to induce remodeling of collagens in the tumor microenvironment (TME) was primarily thought to create a suitable microenvironment for tumor cell growth. We now consider abnormal collagen production, composition and organization in the TME as a cause of immune dysfunction, conveying a chronic-active wound-healing response instead of anti-tumor immune responses necessary for immune surveillance and the eradication of the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosowski and Huttenlocher, 2015</xref>). The abnormal ECM also builds physical fibrotic barriers to exclude immune cells and therapeutic agents from access to tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henke et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>TME-expressed collagen can interact directly with the inhibitory collagen receptor leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rygiel et al., 2011</xref>). LAIR-1 is an immune checkpoint broadly expressed on the cell surface of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meyaard et al., 1997</xref>) that binds to collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebbink et al., 2006</xref>) and molecules with collagen-like domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Son et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olde Nordkamp et al., 2014b</xref>). LAIR-1<sup>+</sup> cells strongly adhere to collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebbink et al., 2006</xref>). Upon triggering, LAIR-1 inhibits NK cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meyaard et al., 1997</xref>), T cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maasho et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2020</xref>), B cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van der Vuurst de Vries et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Merlo et al., 2005</xref>), monocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Son and Diamond, 2015</xref>) and DC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poggi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Son et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, besides formation of an ECM-rich and fibrotic tumor niche, TME-expressed collagens can function to promote immune evasion through their direct interaction with LAIR-1.</p><p>LAIR-2 is a natural soluble homolog of LAIR-1 that is present in humans and non-human primates, but not other animals. LAIR-2 shares 83% identity with the LAIR-1 extracellular region, binds to collagens with higher affinity than LAIR-1 and functions as a natural antagonist to block cell membrane LAIR-1 inhibitory signaling (Lebbink, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lebbink et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olde Nordkamp et al., 2011</xref>). We developed a dimeric LAIR-2 Fc fusion protein, NC410, as a novel immunomedicine to both target tumor ECM and promote T cell function through blockade of LAIR-1-mediated inhibition. Hereby, we sought to restore anti-tumor immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The collagen:LAIR-1 axis is an immune regulatory pathway to target for cancer immunotherapy</title><p>First, we performed a TCGA meta-analysis combining all 28 collagens as a group across 21 TCGA tumor subtypes. When we examined the mRNA expression of all 43 collagen genes combined, 10 out of 21 tumors had reduced overall survival with high (quantile) overall levels of collagens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>). Likewise, the LAIR-1 expression was significantly upregulated in 11 of 21 tumors when evaluated by TCGA data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode2">Source code 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode3">3</xref>). LAIR-1 expression is observed in all tumor types and largely restricted to immune cells. By stratifying patients for high- and low-quantile LAIR-1 mRNA expression, we observed that patients with high LAIR-1 mRNA expression had lower survival probability in four tumor types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode4">Source code 4</xref>). We further stratified the patients in the TCGA database to include high or low expression of all collagens combined with high or low LAIR-1 for overall survival analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode5">Source code 5</xref>). A unique set of tumor types emerged that overlapped with those with significant increased LAIR-1 expression, but only partially with the tumor types in that of the total collagen overall survival analysis. These analyses highlighted the complexity of the TME and also supported targeting the collagen:LAIR-1 axis for cancer immunotherapy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>High expression of total collagens and LAIR-1 is associated with reduced overall survival.</title><p>The expression of 43 collagen genes, LAIR-1 and LAIR-2 in normal (gray) and tumor tissue (red) were queried using TCGA database.

We posited that LAIR-2 may correlate with increased overall survival in some tumors. TCGA evaluation demonstrated that six tumor types had improved overall survival with high (quantile) expression of LAIR-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This was despite relatively low expression levels of LAIR-2 in most tumors in comparison to LAIR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode3">Source code 3</xref>). These data supported supplemental LAIR-2 as a therapeutic intervention that might inhibit LAIR-1 inhibitory interaction with collagen in the TME of solid tumors. Taking advantage of LAIR-2 as a natural decoy system that would both target tumors and reverse immune inhibition, we generated a LAIR-2 human IgG1 Fc fusion protein for therapeutic use named NC410 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This fusion protein exists as a dimeric protein due to the cysteine bonding in the Fc portion of the protein. NC410 bound to human collagen I and III with high avidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). While LAIR-2 is not present in rodents, it is cross-reactive to rat and mouse collagens due to the highly conserved nature of collagens across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). NC410 completely blocked human LAIR-1 binding to collagen I since LAIR-2 binds with higher affinity to collagens than human LAIR-1, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lebbink et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olde Nordkamp et al., 2011</xref>), supporting its potential role as a LAIR-1 antagonist therapeutic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

NC410 binding was highest in PDAC in agreement with a collagen-rich TME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), and HNSC had the highest number of LAIR-1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Importantly, LAIR-1<sup>+</sup> cells were enriched in NC410-positive areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), suggesting that LAIR-1<sup>+</sup> cells were entrapped in the collagen matrix. Most human solid tumors exhibit distinct immunological phenotypes being divided into immune-inflamed, immune-excluded and immune-desert tumors on the basis of immune cell infiltrate and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Mellman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binnewies et al., 2018</xref>). By characterizing our cohort according to these immunological phenotypes, we observed that NC410 binding was particularly increased in immune-excluded tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, in immune-excluded tumors, LAIR-1<sup>+</sup> cells may be sequestered in collagen-rich areas where NC410 can bind and disrupt LAIR-1-mediated inhibition and adhesion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Immunohistochemical characterization of LAIR-1<sup>+</sup> cells and LAIR-2 Fc binding in primary human tumors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the immunohistochemical stainings performed.

Tumor progression is accompanied by extensive remodeling of the ECM, leading to the formation of a tumor-specific ECM, which is often more collagen-rich and of increased stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox and Erler, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pickup et al., 2014</xref>). Collagen expression and density have been shown to be associated with a worse prognosis either by directly promoting tumor growth or by preventing immune cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, developing therapeutics that have the capability of targeting collagen-rich tumors is an attractive concept.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that collagens can directly modulate T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Salmon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuczek et al., 2019</xref>), for instance, through the inhibitory collagen receptor LAIR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rygiel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2020</xref>). We hypothesized that alterations in expression and remodeling of collagen in the TME regulate the threshold of T cell activation through LAIR-1 and are employed by tumor cells to escape immune surveillance. We showed by RNA analysis that high expression of total collagens, LAIR-1, and combined high total collagen and high LAIR-1 are associated with a worse prognosis in multiple tumor types, supporting the notion of disrupting LAIR-1-collagen interactions as a novel immunotherapeutic strategy.</p><p>We then hypothesized that LAIR-2 could be utilized as a therapeutic in humans to dually target tumoral collagens and reverse immune suppression. LAIR-2 can be found in vivo in the urine from pregnant women and in fluids such as synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) patients and the circulation of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lebbink et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olde Nordkamp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Simone et al., 2013</xref>). The amount of LAIR-2 protein seems to be related to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olde Nordkamp et al., 2011</xref>). In vitro stimulation of sorted peripheral blood cells revealed that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are the main producers of LAIR-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olde Nordkamp et al., 2011</xref>). However, this does not exclude that other cell types might produce LAIR-2 in vivo. Additional studies are required to identify which cells are the main LAIR-2 producers in vivo and the factors that drive its production and secretion. In this study, we showed that targeting and disrupting collagen interactions with LAIR-1 by means of a dimeric LAIR-2 hIgG1 Fc fusion protein, NC410, promoted in vivo T cell activity and had a therapeutic effect in tumor models, which was dependent on T cells. It is interesting to note that we observed peak activity of NC410 at different doses in the P815 (1 mg/kg) vs. HT-29 (10 mg/kg) tumor model. This may be due to the use of different donor PBMCs in these models, use of murine (P815) vs. human (HT-29) tumor cell lines in NSG mice or different mechanisms of action in the two models.</p><p>Because many tumors can produce collagens, it is possible that NC410 with an IgG1 Fc could induce ADCC. This was examined in the HT-29 model, which expresses abundant collagens. We did not see enhanced NC410-mediated ADCC in vitro. We also demonstrated the requirement of T cells for anti-tumor activity in our HT-29 model. However, to further address the question of what the Fc portion of NC410 does, we show that LAIR-2 IgG1 protein with a ‘silenced’ Fc (FES mutation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oganesyan et al., 2008</xref>) loses anti-tumor activity. A recent independently published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2020</xref>) also demonstrates anti-tumor activity with an engineered LAIR-2 Fc protein. In this study, the authors engineered an IgG1 with an N297A to prevent binding to Fc receptors, but further mutated it to include T250Q/M428L mutations to increase binding to neonatal FcR (FcRn), which enhances in vivo bioavailability of the protein. It is possible that the lack of activity from LAIR-2-FES in our study is due to decreased in vivo bioavailability. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that ADCC plays a role in NC410-mediated anti-tumor immunity in some tumor models.</p><p>NC410 may also have additional LAIR-1-independent mechanisms of action since we have previously shown that LAIR-2 Fc can efficiently inhibit complement activation via classical and lectin pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Olde Nordkamp et al., 2014a</xref>). Therefore, we cannot exclude that NC410 blocks other receptors or impacts other cells than T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sivori et al., 2020</xref>) or has additional functions besides outcompeting LAIR-1. These functions of NC410 will be examined as part of ongoing clinical trials, as well as with additional preclinical models.</p><p>Humanized mice (Hu-PBMC-NSG) provide an important platform for investigating the modulation of the human immune-mediated anti-tumor responses. While our study demonstrated that the anti-tumor effect promoted by NC410 required T cells, a limitation of the humanized model with adoptive transfer of PBMCs is the absence of human myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it remains possible that NC410 impacts LAIR-1<sup>+</sup> myeloid function.</p><p>Another limitation of our studies is the use of subcutaneous tumor models. Orthotopic models would provide a better comprehensive understanding of how organ-specific ECM, architecture and immune composition would impact response to treatment. Since humanized orthotopic models were not available for this study, we utilized Matrigel as a mimic for ECM.</p><p>During ECM turnover, proteolytically cleaved matrix degradation fragments are released into the systemic circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnans et al., 2014</xref>). Serum levels of collagen degradation fragments are elevated in cancer patients compared to healthy controls, and checkpoint blockade alters serum CDP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jensen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jensen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). NC410 treatment increased specific fragments generated by degradation of collagen VI by MMP-2 (C6M) and collagen IV by granzyme B (C4G). This coincided with a reduction of tumor volume, suggesting that these fragments might be generated by increased infiltration and/or activation of T cells in the TME. Indeed, granzyme B promotes cytotoxic lymphocyte transmigration via basement membrane remodeling of type IV collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prakash et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore hypothesize that specific granzyme B degraded type IV collagen fragments and other fragments are released to the circulation when T cells infiltrate tumors and may have potential as a clinical pharmacodynamic biomarker. Interestingly, granzyme B-degraded type IV collagen fragments (C4G) associate with favorable anti-CTLA-4 treatment response in metastatic melanoma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jensen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jensen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">St-Pierre and Potworowski, 2000</xref>). The potential of C6M and C4G collagen fragments as biomarkers of clinical response will be further investigated in a recently initiated NC410 first-in-human clinical trial (NCT04408599).</p><p>NC410 showed decreased tumor growth as a monotherapy, but it might even show better clinical efficacy when used in combination with currently used checkpoint receptor inhibitors such as CTLA4 and/or PD-1. In accordance, it was recently shown that abrogating LAIR-1 immunosuppression through LAIR-2 overexpression or SHP-1 inhibition sensitizes resistant lung tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peng et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Circulating LAIR-2 protein concentration is low or undetectable in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lebbink et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olde Nordkamp et al., 2011</xref>). In the presence of limited endogenous LAIR-2, LAIR-1 can bind collagens, thereby allowing the inhibitory receptor to signal and prevent or reduce T cell activity and/or retain LAIR-1<sup>+</sup> cells in collagen-rich areas. In the TME, increased levels of collagens will therefore promote tumor immune escape in the absence of increased LAIR-2. Our analysis of TCGA data indeed revealed that enhanced expression of endogenous LAIR-2 in some tumors associated with better prognosis, suggesting that further increasing LAIR-2 in vivo could have a therapeutic advantage. NC410 has a higher avidity to collagen than endogenous LAIR-2 due to its dimeric structure since in vivo LAIR-2 is expressed as a monomer, enhancing its potential to block the inhibitory capacity of membrane-bound LAIR-1. NC410 binds both healthy and tumoral collagen and theoretically could be sequestered before reaching the tumor site. We hypothesize that the avidity of NC410 towards tumoral collagen is higher than to healthy collagen, therefore resulting in a therapeutic effect, but this needs additional study. Other LAIR-1 ligands, such as C1q, have been shown to be increased in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulla et al., 2016</xref>) and may also provide a local inhibitory effect that could be potentially reversed by NC410.</p><p>Understanding LAIR-1 and collagen expression in the context of tumor structure and co-localization could help to identify indications that may best benefit from targeting this axis. Our IHC analyses demonstrated that LAIR-1<sup>+</sup> cells were present within NC410-binding collagen-rich areas. This indicated that an abundance of collagen may trap immune cells in the tumor stroma, possibly by binding to LAIR-1. This was most notable in immune-excluded tumors. The immune-excluded phenotype is characterized by the presence of immune cells that cannot penetrate the parenchyma of the tumors but instead are located in the stroma that surrounds the tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Mellman, 2017</xref>). These are indications that currently fare poorly with PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>), and thus NC410 could benefit an entirely new class of cancer patients when used as either a monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Our data support NC410 as a novel immunomedicine for targeting immune-excluded collagen-rich tumors and enabling normalization of the tumor-immune microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Evaluation of stained tissue slides was performed using QuPath (version 0.2.0) software. The percentage of tumor tissue binding NC410 was calculated by annotation of the tumor in the tissue slide and quantifying the percentage of DAB-stained tissue by using the Pixel Classifier.</p><p>Scoring of the immune phenotype was based on the presence and distribution of CD3-positive lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Mellman, 2017</xref>). Tumors with CD3<sup>+</sup> cells in the tumor fields were scored ‘inflamed’; tumors with CD3<sup>+</sup> cells in their stroma but without or with a relatively low amount of CD3<sup>+</sup> in the tumor fields were scored ‘immune-excluded’; tumors with a lack of CD3<sup>+</sup> cells in their stroma as well as in their tumor fields were scored ‘immune-desert’.</p><p>For quantification of the immune cell counts, regions of interest (ROIs) were annotated on the tissue slides by drawing circles with a diameter of 600 µm at five random spots within the NC410 binding part of the tumor. Positive cells were quantified using the Positive Cell Detection tool. For each staining, stain vectors and DAB cutoffs were determined based on a representative slide; the settings were kept the same for all slides. Tumor area within the circles that was lost during staining procedure or that was negative for NC410 binding was excluded from the analysis.</p><p>The percentage of NC410 binding to tissue within a tumor was calculated by dividing the stained area by the total tumor area. The immune cell counts for each tumor were calculated by dividing the total number of positive cells within the five ROIs by the total surface in mm<sup>2</sup> of these ROIs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were graphed and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad software).

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

The authors have identified a high-affinity inhibitory collagen receptor LAIR-1 and a soluble decoy receptor LAIR-2 (with even higher binding affinity to collagen), which can be therapeutically targeted to block tumor progression. They have generated a dimeric LAIR-2 human IgG1 Fc fusion protein NC410 for therapeutic use. With humanized mouse models engrafted with functional human immune systems (PBMC), they have explored the anti-cancer efficacy of NC410 and revealed its impact on modulating immune responses. Furthermore, they extended this study to identify biomarkers of predictive value for NC410-based anti-cancer therapy. This study is interesting, but mechanistic exploration and in-depth immune characterization should be largely improved to support their conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Figure 1 is quite confusing for readers. These correlative analyses don't seem to support the major conclusions of this study. Although the expression level of collagen, LAIR1 and LAIR2 in multiple cancer tissues significantly differ from that in matched normal tissues (Figure 1A), these parameters didn't exhibit consistent prognostic values for the same type of cancer (Figure 1B). High expression of LAIR-1 is associated with lower survival, but this only holds true in 4 of 21 cancers. Conversely, high LAIR-2 mRNA expression was correlated with increased survival in 6 of 30 cancers. There was no overlap in these cancer types. It would be much more helpful if the authors can show that in the same cohorts of cancer patients, high expression of Collagen, high expression of LAIR1, and/or low expression of LAIR2 correlate with poor outcomes. If analyses of this potential biomarker panel in Figure 1 can be linked with the pathologic analyses performed in Figure 6, it will largely strengthen the importance of this study.</p><p>2. Similarly, for the TCGA analyses in Figure 1, it will be very helpful to explore the correlations of the collagens, LAIR-1 and LAIR-2 with immune phenotypes as defined by mRNA signatures. This would better define if the collagen/LAIR-1 pathway is more important in inflamed, but immunosuppressed tumors, or in cold tumors.</p><p>3. NC410 exhibited anti-tumor effects in two humanized mouse model. A more robust immune profiling of the tumor microenvironment would be necessary, particularly for the myeloid compartment (such as MDSCs, tumor-associated macrophages and their effector molecules) and T cells in depth (memory, effector, exhaustion markers). It remains unknown whether elevated frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup>T and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, increased secretion of IFN-g and TNF-a by T cells, augmented expression of cytokines, chemokines did account for delayed tumor progression. Functional validation of these altered immune cell subsets and corresponding effector molecules will substantially improve the quality of this study.</p><p>4. The authors claimed that LAIR2 is responsible for collagen-induced immunosuppression. Which immunosuppressive cell populations can be induced/activated/expanded by collagen? Does NC410 reverse these changes?</p><p>5. There are multiple receptors for collagens. Is LAIR1 the dominant immunosuppressive receptor for collagen? Does NC410 specifically block LAIR1-mediated immunosuppression?</p><p>6. Does NC410 influence the synthesis of collagen? Is dimeric LAIR-2 more stable than the monomer form? What is the function of IgG1 Fc tail? It is possible that Fc containing NC410 cause the ADCC effect on collagen-producing cells (including tumor cells) in vivo. HT29 cell and PBMC coculture experiments didn't rule out the possibility of NC410-induced ADCC in vivo.</p><p>7. Does repeated use of NC410 cause detrimental side-effects on healthy collagen-enriched tissues? Do the authors have any toxicity data on the in vivo use of this new Fc-fusion protein? It would be very helpful at their first description for potential clinical development.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cancer immunotherapy by NC410, a LAIR-2 Fc protein blocking human LAIR-collagen interaction&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Figure 1). To support targeting the collagen:LAIR-1 pathway in cancer, we looked at the overall survival of total collagens (Figure 1A) and LAIR-1 individually (Figure 1B). We also analyzed total collagens combined with LAIR-1 for overall survival (Figure 1C). The expression of collagens, LAIR-1 and LAIR-2 in healthy and tumor tissue was moved to Figure 1-Sup figure 1. Overall survival analysis of LAIR-2 high expression associated with improved overall survival was moved to Figure 2 for organizational clarity.</p><p>These analyses have the restriction that it is limited to mRNA expression and not protein. However, we utilized these data to support targeting the LAIR-collagen axis for cancer. Whereas most other studies evaluate specific collagens, we uniquely evaluated all 43 collagen chains together for overall survival to assess the “net effect” of collagens in relation to overall survival.</p><p>The overall survival analysis based on LAIR-1 RNA expression does not overlap with total collagens, other than low grade glioma, but led to a worse prognosis in 4 of 21 cancers. This may suggest additional factors influence outcome. Therefore, we combined total collagens and LAIR-1 for analysis of overall survival. We found that 10 of 21 cancers had decreased survival when both collagen and LAIR-1 were highly expressed (upper quantile). Interestingly, cancer types in the LAIR-1 only analysis, but not collagen only analysis, overlapped with the combined collagen+ LAIR-1 analysis. A few new tumor types also emerged that were not present when evaluated individually. Again, this analysis was performed in order to support targeting the LAIR-1 pathway in cancer, not necessarily to select specific cancer indications for clinical trials.</p><p>Next, our hypothesis is that LAIR-2, a natural soluble decoy capable of blocking membrane LAIR-1 mediated immune inhibition could be used as a “supplemental” checkpoint blockade therapy. Therefore, we analysed if increased LAIR-2 was associated with improved survival in any cancer. Despite the generally low expression of LAIR-2 in comparison to LAIR-1 in cancer, we did observe improved survival in 6 of 21 cancer types. Once again there was relatively little overlap with total collagen. However, this finding did support our hypothesis.</p><p>Together, while overall survival analyses based on RNA expression did not overlap to a large extent, the purpose was to support targetability of the collagen:LAIR pathway, and potentially serve as a guide in selection of cancer types for further evaluation by IHC. To this end, emphasis was placed on cancer types in which high LAIR-2 expression associated with improved survival (HNSCC, STAD and SKCM). In addition, we selected LUSC, PDAC and HGSC to be evaluated by IHC. In figure 6, we show that LAIR-1<sup>+</sup> cells are located in collagen-rich areas where NC410 can bind suggesting that the location of these molecules and cells, rather than overall RNA levels, may be more important for patient selection.</p><p>Text was added to the manuscript to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Similarly, for the TCGA analyses in Figure 1, it will be very helpful to explore the correlations of the collagens, LAIR-1 and LAIR-2 with immune phenotypes as defined by mRNA signatures. This would better define if the collagen/LAIR-1 pathway is more important in inflamed, but immunosuppressed tumors, or in cold tumors.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in the question 1 response, we analyzed total collagens combined with LAIR-1 for overall survival to determine if there is overlap or unique indications in comparison to collagens or LAIR-1 alone. We found that high expression of total collagens with LAIR-1 resulted in poor reduced overall survival that overlapped with LAIR-1 analysis, but also that additional indications were identified by collagens alone or LAIR-1 alone.</p><p>The reviewers’ question on immune phenotypes we address in Figure 6, where we concluded that patients presenting immune excluded tumors would benefit the most from LAIR targeting since LAIR-1<sup>+</sup> cells seem to be enriched in collagen dense areas surrounding the tumor islets where NC410 binds. By analysing mRNA signatures rather that spatial context we would not be able to show this.</p><p>Text was added to the Discussion section to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. NC410 exhibited anti-tumor effects in two humanized mouse model. A more robust immune profiling of the tumor microenvironment would be necessary, particularly for the myeloid compartment (such as MDSCs, tumor-associated macrophages and their effector molecules) and T cells in depth (memory, effector, exhaustion markers). It remains unknown whether elevated frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup>T and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, increased secretion of IFN-g and TNF-a by T cells, augmented expression of cytokines, chemokines did account for delayed tumor progression. Functional validation of these altered immune cell subsets and corresponding effector molecules will substantially improve the quality of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed extra studies and added additional data to address these points.</p><p>This manuscript focuses on the role of NC410 in the context of T cells. Therefore, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) humanized mice (Hu-PBMC-NSG) provide a useful platform for investigating the modulation of the human T cell responses and antitumor responses. As previously reported (Ali et al., PLoS ONE, 2012), human T cells but not myeloid cells expand in this model and almost all the human CD45<sup>+</sup> cells engrafted are T cells. Nevertheless, the role of NC410 on myeloid and other TME associated immune cell subsets is of great interest to us and will be the focus of a follow-up study.</p><p>We revised figure 3 to address the role of NC410 on CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in both non-tumor (xeno-GVHD) and tumor models in hu-PBMC-NSG mice. In figure 3A and B, we show that most T cells (80-100%) in the hu-PBMC-NSG model acquire effector memory phenotype in the spleen as early as 6 days after PBMC injection in NSG mice. This is similar to previous reports (Ali et al., PLoS ONE, 2012). The percentage of effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells does not change between doses of NC410 vs vehicle control. However, as shown in Figure 3C and E, NC410 dose-dependently increase the absolute cell counts of CD4<sup>+</sup> Effector memory (EM) and CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells in the spleen on day 6. Unfortunately, we did not assess cytokine levels in this experiment, but this was evaluated in Figure 5.</p><p>We also added additional data in a new Figure 4 for the P815 tumor model in which the mouse tumor cell line P815 (xeno tumor) is subcutaneously injected into the flank of NSG mice with adoptive transfer of human PBMCs. A titration of NC410 shows that NC410 promotes the expansion of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but that the expansion follows different kinetics dependent on the dose: 10 mg/kg induces more rapid expansion, while 1 mg/kg induces sustained expansion. Interestingly, the anti-tumor activity observed in this model corresponds to the 1 mg/kg dose in which sustained T cell expansion is observed. This supports the role of T cells in mediating anti-tumor immunity.</p><p>Importantly, to address the requirement of T cells for the anti-tumor effect observed in the presence of NC410, we performed an additional HT-29 tumor model in NSG mice similar to the experiments shown in Figure 5 (Figure 3-Sup. Figure 3). However, in this experiment, we adoptively transferred total PBMCs or T cell depleted PBMCs. In this experiment we show that NC410 required T cells for anti-tumor activity, as shown by tumor growth measurements and pictures of tumors at endpoint (day 53). This experiment demonstrates that NC410 anti-tumor immunity in the HT-29 tumor model is mediated through T cell enhancement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors claimed that LAIR2 is responsible for collagen-induced immunosuppression. Which immunosuppressive cell populations can be induced/activated/expanded by collagen? Does NC410 reverse these changes?</p></disp-quote><p>The authors believe there may be a typo on this question. LAIR-2 is not responsible for collagen-induced immunosuppression. Rather, LAIR-2 is the basis of our immunotherapy strategy to block and reverse LAIR-1 mediated immunosuppression by tumor collagens.</p><p>We propose that LAIR-1 induced immune suppression is due to decrease of T cell activity and/or migration. Collagen has been previously shown to have a direct impact on T cell activation via LAIR-1 by inhibiting T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling (Meyers L, et al; JBC, 2020) and collagen has been shown to inhibit T cell migration (Kuczek et al., J Immunother Cancer, 2019), however this has not been specifically attributed to LAIR-1 signaling. Our in vitro studies (Figure 2) demonstrate that collagen binding to LAIR-1 induced LAIR-1 signaling in a reporter cell line can be blocked by NC410. Our in vivo studies demonstrate increased T cell expansion and effector activity in the presence of NC410. However, at this time we cannot prove that the NC410 mediated effect is dependent solely on blockade of LAIR-1:Collagen interactions. Interestingly, a similar molecule to NC410 (Xu L, et al; OncoImmunology, 2020) has been shown to revert collagen induced LAIR-1 suppression of IFN-γ and TNF-α cytokine production in an in vitro system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There are multiple receptors for collagens. Is LAIR1 the dominant immunosuppressive receptor for collagen? Does NC410 specifically block LAIR1-mediated immunosuppression?</p></disp-quote><p>Diverse families of receptors, including integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases, and immunoglobulin-like receptors have been shown to bind collagens as their cognate ligands. We cannot exclude that NC410 blocks other receptors or has additional functions besides outcompeting LAIR-1. In fact, our group has previously shown that LAIR-2 Fc can efficiently inhibit complement activation via classical and lectin pathways (Olde Nordkamp, et al; J Innate Immun. 2014). Therefore, it is likely that NC410 has additional mechanisms of action that may be LAIR-1 independent. This is a major topic of ongoing research for future studies due to the importance of mechanistic understanding and biomarker identification as part of NextCure’s ongoing clinical trial.</p><p>We addressed this point in the discussion of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Does NC410 influence the synthesis of collagen? Is dimeric LAIR-2 more stable than the monomer form? What is the function of IgG1 Fc tail? It is possible that Fc containing NC410 cause the ADCC effect on collagen-producing cells (including tumor cells) in vivo. HT29 cell and PBMC coculture experiments didn't rule out the possibility of NC410-induced ADCC in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>Our current study results have identified an effect of NC410 leading to changes in specific collagen degradative products, which may be an important pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker for clinical trials. We are currently studying the biological relevance of NC410 on collagen production, degradation and organization with collaborators. This data will be part of a follow up study.</p><p>NC410 is very stable based on production and manufacturing of material for the ongoing clinical trial with NC410 (Phase 1 clinical trial was initiated with NC410 on June 10, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04408599). Pharmacokinetics will be assessed as part of Ph1 trial. Stability of NC410 has not been compared to monomeric LAIR-2. We previously reported that dimeric LAIR-2 is a better competitor for LAIR-1-collagen interaction than monomeric LAIR-2 (Olde Nordkamp et al., Arthritis Rheum, 2011)</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that HT-29 cell and PBMC co-culture experiments do not completely rule out the possibility of NC410-induced ADCC in vivo. However, several additional lines of evidence support the function of NC410 to be independent of ADCC, but dependent on an active, functional Fc (human IgG1).</p><p>First, P815 tumor cells for not express transmembrane collagen and thus in the P815 tumor model (Figure 4), NC410 does not bind to this tumor by flow cytometry analysis (Figure 4A and B), and therefore ADCC is unlikely to be a mechanism of action.</p><p>Secondly, in Figure 3-Sup figure 3, we tested NC410 in the absence of T cells and found that T cells are required for anti-tumor effect mediated by NC410, as discussed above, which indicated that ADCC is not a primary mechanism of action in vivo.</p><p>Therefore, we conclude that ADCC is not a primary mechanism of action of NC410, although we cannot rule out that ADCC may play a role in in vivo tumor killing for collagen expressing tumors.</p><p>We added this discussion to the revised manuscript.</p><p>To further address the question of what the Fc portion of NC410 does, we show in a new Figure 3- Sup. Figure 3 that LAIR-2 IgG1 protein with a “silenced” Fc (FES mutation) (Oganesyan et al., Biol Crystallogr. 2008) loses anti-tumor activity. This is in apparent contrast with a recently published study (Xu et al., Oncoimmunology, 2020) in which an engineered LAIR-2 Fc protein with an N297A to prevent binding to Fc receptors does have anti-tumor efficacy, However, this protein was further mutated to include T250Q/M428L mutations to increase binding to neonatal FcR (FcRn), which enhances in vivo availability of the protein. We cannot exclude that the lack of efficiency of the LAIR-2-FES we used is due to decreased in vivo availability of the protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
