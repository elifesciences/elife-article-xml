that nocturnal bull ants use the exceedingly dim polarisation pattern produced by the moon for overnight navigation. The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position; however, they can often be obstructed by clouds, canopy, or the horizon. Despite being hidden, these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect. Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere, and solar polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals. Moonlight produces an analogous pattern, albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight. Here, we show evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate. Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. We demonstrate that these bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night, by rotating the overhead polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Finally, we show the long-term incorporation of this moonlight pattern into the ants’ path integration system throughout the night for homing, as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Light travels through space as waves, normally oscillating in various orientations. When light waves enter the earth’s atmosphere, they become polarised, meaning the waves oscillate along a single plane. Polarised light creates a predictable pattern that is imperceptible to humans but visible to many animals. This pattern provides animals a reliable ‘sky compass’ based on the sun’s position during the day, which is particularly useful because it is visible even when the sun is obscured.</p><p>However, many nocturnal animals can successfully navigate well after sunset when this solar sky compass is absent. The moon, reflecting sunlight, creates a similar polarisation pattern in the sky. However, moonlight is about a million times dimmer than sunlight, so nocturnal animals need highly specialised visual systems to detect these lunar cues.</p><p>One of these nocturnal animals is the large-eyed bull ant (<italic>Mymecia midas</italic>). These ants rely on solar polarised light to navigate during twilight, when they climb into the canopy of trees surrounding their nest. However, these ants often return home overnight, suggesting they can use other celestial cues when navigating, such as the moon or stars. However, it remains unknown which cues bull ants use at night.</p><p>To determine whether bull ants can detect polarised moonlight to orient themselves, Freas et al. used polarisation filters to rotate the polarisation pattern in the night sky above two bull ant nests. The researchers found that when the polarisation pattern was rotated, the forager bull ants altered their direction in line with the change in the polarised pattern, showing that they were using this pattern to navigate. Interestingly, the ants could detect the lunar polarisation pattern even when the moon was below the horizon, or when only a sliver of the moon was reflecting sunlight, indicating extremely high visual sensitivity in these animals.</p><p>Freas et al. show for the first time an instance of animals using polarised moonlight patterns to navigate. This type of investigation can be used to develop navigational systems for robotics. The results suggest that a polarisation sensor with sufficient sensitivity can be used to create a sky compass to navigate both at night and during the day.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>insect</kwd><kwd>hymenoptera</kwd><kwd>ant</kwd><kwd>bull ant</kwd><kwd>Myrmecia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001230</institution-id><institution>Macquarie University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MQRF0001094</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freas</surname><given-names>Cody A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP200102337</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Narenda</surname><given-names>Ajay</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Ken</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Large eyed bull ants are able to use the exceedingly dim lunar polarised light pattern in the overhead sky to navigate back to the nest at night.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many, navigating animals use the position of the sun or moon to guide their movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jander, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klotz and Reid, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perez et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dacke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Warrant and Dacke, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freas and Cheng, 2022</xref>). Yet these celestial bodies are not always directly visible, often obscured by clouds, the canopy, or after passing below the horizon, resulting in gaps for navigation relying solely upon direct visual detection. Animals hence rely on the pattern of polarised skylight, which is accessible even when the celestial bodies are occluded to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horváth et al., 2014</xref>). When the electromagnetic field of light oscillates in a directionally predictable manner, it is defined as polarised. The type of polarisation describes the pattern of this oscillating electromagnetic field. When this oscillation is in a single plane, this light is defined as linearly polarised. The electric field of light can form other patterns, such as circular polarisation, with the field spiralling in three dimensions as a plane wave propagates. Linearly polarised sunlight comprises light waves which occur along a single plane produced as a by-product of light passing through the upper atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horváth and Varjú, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horváth et al., 2014</xref>). The scattering of this light creates an e-vector pattern in the sky, which is arranged in concentric circles around the sun or moon’s position with the maximum degree of polarisation located 90° from the source. Hence when the sun/moon is near the horizon, the pattern of polarised skylight is particularly simple with uniform direction of polarisation approximately parallel to the north-south axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Dacke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dacke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zeil et al., 2014</xref>). The pattern’s stability makes the sky’s polarisation a useful directional cue for orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wehner and Müller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lebhardt and Ronacher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Warrant and Dacke, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freas et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freas et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freas and Spetch, 2023</xref>), which insects detect through specialised photoreceptors located in the dorsal rim area of their eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Labhart and Meyer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Homberg and Paech, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">el Jundi et al., 2015</xref>). Like solar polarisation, though a million times weaker, the moon reflects sunlight, producing a polarised moonlight pattern emanating from the moon’s position in the night sky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gál et al., 2001</xref>). Given that the moon creates a much dimmer version of the polarisation pattern formed around the sun, only night-navigating insects with eyes highly specialised for low-light detection may be able to rely on this pattern to orient and navigate to goals.</p><p>Currently, only dung beetles (the nocturnal <italic>Scarabaeus satyrus</italic> and <italic>S. zambesianus and the diurnal Scarabaeus (Kheper) lamarcki</italic>) are known to attend to moonlight polarisation patterns during their movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dacke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dacke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dacke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smolka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foster et al., 2019</xref>). Yet interestingly, these beetles do not use moonlight to navigate, instead relying on this pattern to keep moving straight in order to roll their dung balls expeditiously away from a central dung pile. As such, this cue has only been documented for heading maintenance over short periods. While it has been theorised that this ability to detect the much dimmer polarisation pattern produced by the moon may be present across nocturnal insects more broadly, including nocturnal bees and crickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herzmann and Labhart, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greiner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rost and Honegger, 1987</xref>), there is currently no behavioural evidence for its use in goal-directed navigation. We sought such evidence in nocturnal bull ants.</p><p>The large-eyed <italic>Myrmecia</italic> ants have several species that restrict the majority of their navigation to evening twilight (outbound) and morning twilight (inbound), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Narendra et al., 2017</xref>). We know that two well-studied nocturnal ant species, <italic>Myrmecia pyriformis,</italic> and <italic>Myrmecia midas</italic>, use the overhead solar polarised light pattern, which is still visible during the twilight period to derive compass information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freas et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freas et al., 2017c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freas et al., 2018</xref>). Because the information required for visual navigation degrades beyond twilight, it has been suggested that animals tend to be less active at night. However, a small proportion of <italic>M. pyriformis</italic> foragers leave the nest (10.7% of daily foraging force) or return home during the night (13.3% of daily foraging force) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reid et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>M. midas,</italic> this nocturnal activity is even more pronounced with the majority of the foraging force returning during the night (62.8% of daily foraging force) along with a minority of foragers leaving the nest during the night (26.2% of daily foraging force) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freas et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>Nocturnal bull ants navigate using a combination of learned visual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Islam et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deeti et al., 2023</xref>) and homing vectors obtained by integrating pedometric and celestial compass information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wehner and Srinivasan, 2003</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wittlinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wehner, 2020</xref>). This ‘true nocturnal navigation’ is likely aided by the increase in the light intensity provided by the moon’s presence. In <italic>M. pyriformis</italic>, on ‘full-moon’ nights there was a significantly greater proportion of foragers leaving the nest at night compared to a ‘new-moon’ night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reid et al., 2013</xref>). This additional light at night may enhance terrestrial visual features foragers have learned and, therefore, assist in visual guidance. In addition, the moon and the lunar polarisation pattern also likely provide compass information, allowing foragers to acquire or follow a homing vector. Several arthropods, including ants and bees, directly track the moon’s position to obtain compass information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jander, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klotz and Reid, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dacke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ugolini et al., 2013</xref>). But given the moon may be occluded by clouds or overhanging canopy we aim to identify here whether the lunar polarised skylight can also be used by ants for homing.</p><p>In the current study, we studied foraging ants’ ability to orient during lunar twilight, by placing and rotating a linear polarising filter over them as they returned to the nest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This rotation blocks the ambient e-vector direction of the sky above the navigator, replacing it with an artificial e-vector of polarisation that is rotated ±45° off the ambient pattern. We also explored whether these navigators weigh their attendance to polarised moonlight across the lunar cycle, since during quarter-moon and crescent-moon nights, smaller portions of the moon’s surface reflect sunlight (as well as moonless nights when no ambient e-vector is present). Finally, we characterised changes in weighting that these ant navigators give polarised moonlight, as a function of the moon’s overnight consistency in the sky (waxing vs. waning) and the length of their accumulated path integrator, which should increase the weight given to celestial compass portion of the path integrator when in conflict with terrestrial visual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Burkhalter, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Narendra, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wystrach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freas and Cheng, 2019a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Diagram of the polarisation filter and changes to the overhead lunar polarisation pattern.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During the inbound journey, a linear polarisation filter was placed over the forager, rotating the overhead e-vector by ±45°. Panel depicts the positional measurements recorded during testing. Initial orientation routes were measured from the foraging tree release point (a) to when the polarisation filter was placed over each forager (b). Exit orientations were measured from the filter centre (b) to the forager’s exit location at the filter edge (c). Route directions under the filter (b°) were calculated from the forager’s initial route direction zeroed.

This ability to detect and use of polarised moonlight persisted throughout the lunar cycle, with foragers attending to the pattern even under a crescent moon with ~20% lunar illumination. This indicates that polarised moonlight is detectable across the lunar month, making it a stable cue these ants can use when moving or updating their path integrator overnight.</p><p>While they can utilise the lunar polarisation pattern through the lunar cycle, foragers exhibited reduced heading shifts during the waning lunar phases, during which the moon’s absence for a portion of the night leads to a cue gap overnight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These reductions in observed shifts are likely due to either decreased weighting or a degradation in the celestial compass due to periods when no celestial cues are available. The shift magnitude differences between conditions also point to moonlight polarisation being continuously tracked throughout the overnight period, in line with this celestial cue being integrated into the navigator’s path integrator. Further evidence of this cue’s integration into the path integrator is illustrated in our vector-length testing conditions. Here, foragers with longer home vectors under a full moon responded almost fully to e-vector changes regardless of their distance to the nest, while foragers with shorter vector distances led to less than half the e-vector shift, corresponding with decreases in vector cue strength at small distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wystrach et al., 2015</xref>).

The observed true nocturnal navigation in these animals could be driven by the moon’s presence with <italic>M. pyriformis</italic>, which shows more foraging activity on full moon nights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reid et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>M. midas</italic> exhibits a high level of overnight activity, with almost half of the foragers returning before the morning solar twilight. <italic>M. midas</italic> also navigates through heavily canopied forest habitat where the moon may be occluded but its polarisation pattern across the sky remains unobstructed. Thus, <italic>M. midas</italic> makes for an interesting species to characterise lunar and solar polarised light detection.</p><p>While we cannot compare solar and moonlight polarisation navigation in outbound ants (outbound foraging is highly correlated with evening twilight when the solar light would overpower any moonlight polarisation pattern), striking similarities occur when comparing solar and moonlight polarisation navigation in ants homing to the nest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In the solar polarisation study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freas et al., 2017c</xref>), inbound foragers tested during morning twilight at 4–6  m from their nest altered their paths under the filter for almost the full 45° solar e-vector manipulation (–45° rotation: –41.16°/+45° rotation: 34.13°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) but only compensated for around half of the rotation when tested 1–2  m from the nest (–45° rotation: –24.86°/+45° rotation: 19.73°). We see the same pattern with polarised moonlight with foragers exhibiting near full shifts 5 m from Nest 1 (–45° rotation: –41.4°/+45° rotation: 38.4°) and half shifts 2 m from Nest 2 (–45° rotation: –27.1°/+45° rotation: 23.4°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>We also observed consistent slight under-estimation in the shifts even when foragers had a long vector. Observations of ants after the filter was placed overhead suggest that heading updates are not immediate, occurring only after the ant travels along its original heading a few centimetres (~5 cm). This means that even if the ant fully shifts its heading, the delay will cause our measurements at the filter exit to slightly underestimate each individual’s position since we measure the angle from where the lunar cue changes (as the filter was placed overhead) and not the position at which the ant altered its heading.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Moonlight and the path integrator</title><p>We also see the same full heading changes to both solar- and moonlight-polarisation-pattern rotations when foragers were released halfway to the nest and tested 2 m with a longer 6 m vector (Solar: –45° rotation: –35.77°/+45° rotation: 39.42°; Moonlight: –45° rotation: –46.4°/+45° rotation: 41.9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In the <italic>Halfway collect &amp; Release</italic> condition, when the vector length was 2 m, this shift significantly decreased at the same testing location, indicating that the vector length and not the testing site dictated this adjustment in cue weighting. These findings suggest that under the filter, foragers use any available celestial and terrestrial cues that are still visible, yet the weighting of the polarisation pattern appears to change in accordance with the vector state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Burkhalter, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Narendra, 2007</xref>) and not its test location close to the nest tree, which could be a potentially highly salient landmark. This leads to several interesting implications. First, these ants weight the polarisation cue more highly and perform larger heading shifts when their current path integrator distance is longer. These increased shift magnitudes align with the hypothesis that with longer accumulated vectors, ants increase the weighting given this cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Burkhalter, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Narendra, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wystrach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freas et al., 2017c</xref>). Second, these ants are using polarised moonlight precisely the same way they use solar polarisation, meaning polarised moonlight is likely integrated into the forager’s path integrator throughout the night. Polarised moonlight is likely processed through the same visual pathways as polarised sunlight, meaning that these ants can use the same underlying neural architecture for polarised solar light and polarised moonlight cues. The limiting factors to lunar cue use for navigation would instead be the ant’s detection threshold for either absolute light intensity, polarization sensitivity, or spectral sensitivity. In addition to being dimmer, moonlight is less UV-rich compared to direct sunlight, and its spectrum changes across the lunar cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palmer and Johnsen, 2015</xref>), with sensitivity to green spectrum within polarised moonlight of potential importance for orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yilmaz et al., 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Polarised moonlight and lunar phase</title><p>Foragers showed clear evidence of detecting and employing polarised moonlight when homing to the nest across the lunar cycle, even on waxing crescent moon nights. This aligns with polarised moonlight’s use in dung beetles, with individuals able to maintain their straight-line paths under quarter and crescent moon e-vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dacke et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the lack of a shift-magnitude reduction between full and crescent nights suggests no reduction in detection. While we could have continued to test with smaller portions of the moon’s surface illuminated, a reduction in shift magnitude could result from either physiological limits in detection or ‘decisional’ processes in how much weight to accord the cue. Behavioural responses and physiological limits cannot be untangled behaviourally, and detection thresholds would require intracellular recordings under dim polarised light. Finally, the lack of shifts with <italic>No Moon</italic> foragers indicates that these navigators do not fall back on memories of the evening or morning solar e-vector when presented one overnight.</p><p>One unexpected finding was the reduction in shift magnitude under waning moons relative to waxing moons. When we first tested foragers under <italic>Waning Full Moons</italic> and Waning <italic>Quarter Moons</italic> they showed clear evidence of attending to the polarisation cue, but shift magnitudes were significantly smaller compared to the <italic>Waxing Moon</italic> conditions. This reduction in shift magnitude suggests that polarised moonlight was being detected but it was weighted weakly, perhaps due to the incorporation of the celestial compass into the path integrator being interrupted. This observed reduction in shift magnitude likely results from the period overnight in which the waning moon was absent from the night sky, meaning foragers could not attend to a consistent polarisation pattern throughout the night. The moonlight pattern only becomes visible in the sky once the moon reaches –18° below the horizon; thus, waning moon nights present periods when there are neither solar nor lunar cues available to maintain the compass, potentially degrading the compass portion of the vector estimate. This suggests that when the moon is waxing and present throughout the overnight period (at least until moonset), <italic>M. midas</italic> foragers are continuously tracking it and integrating this compass cue into their path integrator. When there are periods overnight when the moon and its polarisation pattern are absent, it is either weighted weakly or the path integrator may become degraded with cues having been interrupted during overnight periods with no detectable celestial cues.</p><p>In this vein, it remains unknown if these ants are tracking their lunar polarisation compass by using a time-compensated lunar compass, or if the compass is updated with reference to other cues, such as the panorama, throughout the night. It is possible that these ants form a lunar ephemeris function or time compensator for the moon’s position. Solar ephemeris functions are well demonstrated in insect navigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mouritsen and Frost, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Massy and Wotton, 2023</xref>), including honeybees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dyer and Dickinson, 1994</xref>) as well as desert ants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wehner and Lanfranconi, 1981</xref>). This study cannot untangle these possibilities as ants had a continuous view of both the sky and surrounding terrestrial cues throughout the night before testing. However, the shift reductions on nights where there was no access to the lunar polarisation cue until just prior to tests (lunar twilight before moonrise), suggests these foragers may need some set period of exposure to the moon’s polarisation pattern to employ it fully during inbound homing. Future work could tackle if a lunar ephemeris function is employed by these ants through exposing or blocking access to the sky and familiar panorama for set time periods when the moon is naturally visible overnight, during waxing gibbous phases.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Inbound <italic>M. midas</italic> foragers detect and respond predictably to rotations of the moonlight e-vector orientation under a filter and reorient back to the ambient e-vector after filter exit. This ability occurs across the lunar phase, suggesting that polarised moonlight is a detectable cue throughout the lunar month. Heading changes due to polarised moonlight align with responses to polarised sunlight as part of the path integrator during solar twilight. This indicates that polarised moonlight is likely detected and integrated into the ant’s path integrator for inbound homing along the same visual pathways as polarised sunlight. Reductions in heading shifts due to differences in PI vector lengths, and periods without access to polarised light patterns suggest that these animals can weight the information provided by celestial polarised light. In so doing these foragers can cater their navigational decisions proportionate to closely match the reliability of available navigational information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study site</title><p>Experiments were conducted from April through October 2023 on two <italic>Myrmecia midas</italic> nests on the Macquarie University Wallumattagal campus in Sydney, Australia (33°46 11 S, 151°06 40E). <italic>M. midas</italic> nests are typically located within stands of <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> trees with the nest entrance located near (&lt;30 cm) a tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deeti et al., 2024</xref>). <italic>M. midas</italic> is nocturnal, with foraging onset occurring ~20 min after sunset when foragers leave the nest to travel to and up one of several surrounding foraging trees overnight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freas et al., 2018</xref>).

For this study, we chose two nests under open canopies to ensure foragers had at least partially unobstructed visual access to the overhead sky (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

This rotation blocks the ambient e-vector direction of the sky above the navigator, replacing it with an artificial e-vector of polarisation that is rotated ±45° off the ambient pattern. This filter was held by a circular 1 cm thick ring and lifted 10 cm off the ground by four equally spaced thin metal legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). All testing was conducted overnight before morning solar twilight, during the lunar twilight for each tested lunar phase. For each night we obtained the moon’s position as it reached the horizon based on the Astronomical Almanac (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://asa.usno.navy.mil">http://asa.usno.navy.mil</ext-link>) and set the ambient lunar e-vector perpendicular to the moon’s position at moonset. We relied on a digital compass mobile application (Apple) confirmed by an analogue compass to locate the ambient e-vector and rotated the linear polariser by ±45° from this direction for each ant.</p><p>Across all conditions, we recorded four positions: the ant’s release point, the position when the filter was placed overhead, the filter exit point, and reorientation after ~1 m, taking care to slowly follow the ant and mark their positions so as to not disturb their travel. These positions determine each forager’s initial orientation, exit orientation, and reorientation directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). After testing, each forager was marked with acrylic paint (Tamiya) to prevent retesting. Testing was conducted at distinct lunar phases which predictably occur throughout the lunar month cycle (29.5 d).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Full moon</title><p>For full moon testing, we chose nights during which the waxing moon’s lunar phase was near full but with clear separation between solar and lunar twilights. Testing on true full moon nights is problematic as solar and lunar twilights fully overlap and the solar polarised light pattern would overpower the lunar counterpart. Testing during the nights preceding the full moon (waxing phase) ensured the moon’s presence in the night sky overnight and testing occurred on nights in which the lunar twilight (1 am – 4 am) was clearly separated from the start of morning solar twilight (5:22 am) with illumination above 80% of the lunar surface.</p><p>Outbound <italic>M. midas</italic> foragers from two nests were followed as they left the nest during evening twilight and collected as they climbed onto their foraging tree, (Nest 1: 6.0 m; Nest 2: 3.1 m from the nest entra). Each forager was provided a small amount of honey and held within a clear plastic phial on the ground 5 m from the foraging tree with an unobstructed view of the sky (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Foragers were held in these phials overnight until the moon’s position was within ±10° of the horizon (large stands of trees and buildings near the western horizon occluded the moon’s position during all testing; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Waxing lunar phase</title><p>We observed clear shifts in forager headings at both nests under <italic>Full Moon</italic> conditions, yet nights with over 80% lunar illumination only account for nine nights per lunar cycle. To assess if polarised moonlight can be used throughout the lunar month, we tested Nest 1 foragers in three further conditions representing distinct lunar phases: a <italic>Waxing Quarter Moon, a Waxing Crescent Moon,</italic> and a <italic>No Moon</italic> control. For the <italic>Quarter Moon</italic> and <italic>Crescent Moon</italic> conditions, we tested ants identically to full moon conditions; for overnight testing, however, the moon has a different temporal period when it is positioned near the horizon (12 am and 9 pm, respectively).</p><p>The procedure was slightly modified for <italic>No Moon</italic> testing as we did not test these foragers on the new moon night (the new moon is only present during the day). We hypothesised that foragers with no available ambient polarisation and suddenly presented with an e-vector pattern might fall back on a memory of the morning solar e-vector as many foragers return during morning twilight and this direction remains consistent across nights. In order to test on a night when there were distinct directional differences between the lunar and morning solar e-vectors (Lunar e-vector: 329°; Morning solar e-vector: 7°; Evening Solar e-vector: 353°), we chose to test on a quarter moon night when the moon was well below the horizon. Testing commenced at 9:00 pm, when the moon was 30° below the horizon and we rotated the filter around to the future lunar e-vector direction (moonrise at 12:39 am). If foragers were relying on a solar e-vector memory, we expected to see unequal shifts between ±45° (smaller shifts in the +45° condition and larger shifts in the −45° condition).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Waning lunar phases</title><p>While there is a consistent presence of polarised light during the waxing phase, during waning lunar phases there is a gap which may impede this pattern’s use as a compass cue. Testing during the waxing lunar phase, as the moon’s illuminated surface increases, corresponds with periods in which the moon rises prior to sunset and sets overnight. This creates a consistent presence of polarised light (solar then lunar) that foragers could use to continuously update their celestial compass and path integrator. In contrast, the waning lunar phase corresponds with the moon rising overnight, leading to a gap in this cue as solar twilight ends. We hypothesised that the absence of the moon’s presence as a cue overnight might decrease its weighting or degrade its integration into the celestial compass. We added two conditions to test this hypothesis: a <italic>Waning Full Moon</italic> and a <italic>Waning Quarter Moon</italic> conditions. Foragers were tested identically to previous conditions; only, they were tested during moonrise (10 pm and 1 am) overnight rather than moonset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Vector testing</title><p>After noticing differences in heading shift magnitude between nests which correlated with path integration-derived vector lengths, we tested the hypothesis that, similar to solar polarisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freas et al., 2017c</xref>), the navigator’s accumulated vector length impacts orientation to rotated lunar polarised light. While foragers at Nest 1 (6.0 m vector) reoriented almost fully, those at Nest 2 (3.1 m vector) only altered their headings by about half of the 45° e-vector shift (25.2° ± 3.7°), despite being tested on near-full-moon nights.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we tested a separate group of foragers at Nest 1 on near (waxing) full moon nights at the same spatial location, but with diverging remaining vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In the first test (called <italic>Halfway Collect &amp; Release</italic>), outbound foragers were only allowed to travel half the distance (~3 m) to their foraging tree before being collected and were then released back at this spot to be tested under the ±45° filter rotations at ~2 m from the nest with a small remaining vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, the second testing group (<italic>Halfway Release</italic>) was allowed to accumulate their full 6 m vector by collecting outbound foragers as they reached their foraging tree. When these foragers were released, we placed them at the halfway point, 3.0 m from the nest, and tested them with a larger remaining vector near (~2 m) to the nest. We followed outbound foragers to their foraging tree, collected and held them until lunar twilight (2-4 am) identically to previous full moon conditions. In both conditions, we again recorded the initial orientation, filter exit orientation, and post-filter reorientation of each forager. These conditions tested if the vector state (near zero vs. near full) or the test site underlies the observed heading shift differences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analysed with circular statistics with the statistics package Oriana Version 4 (Kovach Computing Services). Each ant had a slightly different inbound heading due to their stereotypical route along the foraging corridor and we corrected this variance by designating the initial headings (pre-filter) as 0° for calculating shift magnitudes under the filter. To assess shift magnitude between −45° and +45° foragers within conditions, we calculated the mirror of the shifts in each −45° condition, allowing shift magnitude comparisons between conditions within each test. Mirroring the −45° conditions was calculated by mirroring each individual forager’s shift across the 0° to 180° plane. This mirrored data set was then compared to the corresponding unaltered +45 condition. As mirrored −45° shifts were not significantly different from +45° shifts in any condition (Watson–Williams F-tests), they were combined for between-condition comparisons. Within-individual comparisons (Initial Orientation vs. Filter Exit and Filter Exit vs. Reorientation) were analysed using Moore’s Paired Tests. Across-condition shift magnitudes were analysed using Watson–Williams F-tests. In the lunar phase comparisons where full, quarter, and crescent shift magnitudes, as well as Waning and Waxing phases, were compared, Holm-Bonferroni corrections were applied to the <italic>p</italic>-value to account for multiple comparisons. Given Watson–Williams F-tests can be sensitive to the difference in a spread, when differences between conditions were significant, we further analysed these conditions with Var tests to assess if these differences were due to variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wystrach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Freas and Cheng, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Freas and Spetch, 2019c</xref>). Here, the absolute angular error from the mean vector was calculated for each condition and this error magnitude between conditions was compared using Mann-Whitney u tests.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-97615-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data, documentation and code is made available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/">osf.io</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/J8P2N">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/J8P2N</ext-link>).</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Freas</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2024">2024</year><data-title>Lunar Polarisation Cue Data</data-title><source>Open Science Framework</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.17605/OSF.IO/J8P2N</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was funded by a Macquarie University Research Fellowship (MQRF0001094), by Macquarie University, and by an ARC Discovery Grant (DP200102337). <italic>Land Acknowledgement</italic>.

It is not entirely clear from the discussion whether the authors are suggesting that the ants navigate home by using a time-compensated lunar compass, or that they update their polarization compass with reference to other cues as the pattern of lunar skylight gradually shifts over the course of the night - though in the discussion they appear to lean towards the latter without addressing the former. Any clues in this direction might help us understand how ants adapted to navigate using solar skylight polarization might adapt use to lunar skylight polarization and account for its different schedule. I would guess that the waxing and waning moon data can be interpreted to this effect.</p></disp-quote><p>Added a paragraph discussing this distinction in mechanisms and the limits of the current data set in untangling them. An interesting topic for a follow up to be sure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Effects of moon fullness and phase on precision</p><p>As well as the noted effect on shift magnitudes, the distributions of exit headings and reorientations also appear to differ in their precision (i.e., mean vector length) across moon phases, with somewhat shorter vectors for smaller fractions of the moon illuminated. Although these distributions are a composite of the two distributions of angles subtracted from one another to obtain these turn angles, the precision of the resulting distribution should be proportional to the original distributions. It would be interesting to know whether these differences result from poorer overall orientation precision, or more variability in reorientation, on quarter moon and crescent moon nights, and to what extent this might be attributed to sky brightness or degree of polarization.</p></disp-quote><p>See below for response to this and the next reviewer comment</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>N.B. The Watson-Williams tests for difference in mean angle are also sensitive to differences in sample variance. This can be ruled out with another variety of the test, also proposed by Watson and Williams, to check for unequal variances, for which the F statistic is = (n2-1)*(n1-R1) / (n1-1)*(n2-R2) or its inverse, whichever is &gt;1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have looked at the amount of variance from the mean heading direction in terms of both the shifts and the reorientations and found no significant difference in variance between all relevant conditions. It is possible (and probably likely) that with a higher n we might find these differences but with the current data set we cannot make statistical statements regarding degradations in navigational precision.</p><p>As an additional analysis to address the Watson-Williams test‘s sensitivity to changes in variance, we have added var test comparisons for each of the comparisons, which is a well-established test to compare variance changes. None of these were significantly different, suggesting the observed differences in the WW tests are due to changes in the mean vector and not the distribution.

Why?? It becomes even more confusing when headings described by Phi can be typically greater than 300 degrees in the figures, but they are never even close to this in the text (where you seem to have gone back to using the b degrees and c degrees angles, without explicitly saying so).

Mirroring the −45° conditions was calculated by mirroring each shift across the 0° to 180° plane and was then compared to the corresponding unaltered +45 condition.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion Might the brightness and spectrum of lunar skylight also play a role here?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a section to the discussion to mention the aspects of moonlight which may be important to these animals, including the spectrum, brightness and polarisation intensity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 451 The sensitivity threshold to absolute light intensity would not be the only limiting factor here.

Reorientation sizes do not show a consistent reduction compared to under-the-filter shifts when the lunar phase is low and is potentially harder to detect.</p><p>I have reworked this line in the text as I do not think there is much evidence for misalignment and it might be more precise to say that overnight periods where the moon is not visible may adversely impact the path integrator estimate, though it is currently unknown the full impact of this celestial cue gap of if other cues might also play a role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 642 &quot;from their&quot; should be &quot;relative to&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as requested</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1B Some mention should be made of the differences in vegetation density.</p></disp-quote><p>Added a sentence to the figure caption discussing the differences in both vegetation along the horizon and canopy cover.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 2-6 A reference line at 0 degrees change might help the reader to assess the size of orientation changes visually.
