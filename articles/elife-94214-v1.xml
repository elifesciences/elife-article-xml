undergo a process of phase separation that leads to the formation of biomolecular condensates. Intriguingly, it has been observed that some of these proteins form dense droplets of sizeable dimensions already below the critical concentration, which is the concentration at which phase separation occurs. To understand this phenomenon, which is not readily compatible with classical nucleation theory, we investigated the properties of the droplet size distributions as a function of protein concentration. We found that these distributions can be described by a scale-invariant log-normal function with an average that increases progressively as the concentration approaches the critical concentration from below. The results of this scaling analysis suggest the existence of a universal behaviour independent of the sequences and structures of the proteins undergoing phase separation. While we refrain from proposing a theoretical model here, we suggest that any model of protein phase separation should predict the scaling exponents that we reported here from the fitting of experimental measurements of droplet size distributions. Furthermore, based on these observations, we show that it is possible to use the scale invariance to estimate the critical concentration for protein phase separation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein condensation</kwd><kwd>critical exponents</kwd><kwd>phase transitions</kwd><kwd>universal behaviour</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AIRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG 26229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuxreiter</surname><given-names>Monika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The scaling invariance of the droplet size distribution as a universal aspect of protein phase separation is reported, providing a quantitative approach to determinate the critical concentration for this process.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many proteins have been shown to undergo a phase separation process into a liquid-like condensed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti and Hyman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lyon et al., 2021</xref>). This process appears to be of physiological significance since it may lead to the formation of biomolecular condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti and Hyman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lyon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buchan and Parker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2005</xref>). As a consequence, it is closely controlled by the protein homeostasis system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mateju et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qamar et al., 2018</xref>), and its dysregulation has been associated with a broad range of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitrea et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vendruscolo and Fuxreiter, 2022</xref>). It is therefore important to understand the fundamental nature of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lyon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuxreiter and Vendruscolo, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jawerth et al., 2020</xref>) to provide insights for the identification of ways of modulating it through pharmacological interventions.</p><p>To help understand the nature of the transition underlying protein phase separation on the basis of recent experimental observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stender et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kar et al., 2022</xref>), here we study the distribution of the size of the droplets below the value of the concentration at which the transition occurs, which here is referred to as the critical concentration, <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>. This question appears as a promising starting point to develop new insights since it has been reported that proteins can form droplets of sizeable dimensions already well below the concentration at which phase separation occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stender et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kar et al., 2022</xref>). This behaviour is not predicted by classical nucleation theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2012</xref>), and not readily consistent with the idea that the protein phase separation process can be described as a first-order phase transition. This is because, in a first-order phase transition, nucleation takes place in a supersaturated system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shimobayashi et al., 2021</xref>), while in a subsaturated system particles can still self-assemble, but with a probability that decreases exponentially with the size of the assemblies.</p><p>In the present study, we asked whether the experimental data on the droplet size distributions obey scale invariance, a general characteristic of complex systems, which is often used to reveal universal patterns underlying self-assembly. We report the observation that the droplet size distributions of the proteins FUS and α-synuclein follow a scale-invariant log-normal behaviour. These findings are consistent with a universal behaviour resulting from the presence of an increasingly large correlation length, <italic>ξ</italic>, as the concentration approaches the critical concentration from below. The correlation length is an emergent characteristic, and it is related to the typical spatial range over which density fluctuations are correlated. When <italic>ξ</italic> is sufficiently large, one can expect scale invariance and finite-size scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brankov et al., 2000</xref>) to occur within a range of lengths spanning from the molecular size to <italic>ξ</italic>. This means that physical observables cease to depend explicitly on numerous microscopic details that are peculiar to spatial scales smaller than <italic>ξ</italic>, thus leading to a universal behaviour characterized by quantities obtained by coarse graining over scales smaller than <italic>ξ</italic>.</p><p>At a first-order phase transition, <italic>ξ</italic> is finite, and if it is not large enough, the length range discussed above remains too short to observe scale invariance. However, the vicinity of the spinodal line, where nucleation disappears as the dilute phase becomes unstable, to the coexistence curve, where nucleation appears as the dilute phase becomes metastable, might cause a large increase of <italic>ξ</italic> as the first-order phase transition is approached by increasing the concentration. If it is not preceded by a first-order phase transition, the spinodal line would correspond to a second-order phase transition, resulting in infinite <italic>ξ</italic>, with scale invariance holding on all length scales larger than the molecular scale. Various alternative scenarios contributing to the emergence of significant correlations will be mentioned in the Discussion section. Nevertheless, our scaling analysis exhibits a high degree of generality, devoid of reliance on specific underlying models.</p><p>As an application of the above observations, we address the question of whether scale invariance holds for droplet size distributions near the coexistence curve. As a practical consequence, we use this observation to propose a procedure to overcome the challenge of estimating the critical concentration, <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, which enters explicitly into our scaling analysis. Such challenge arises from the fact that close to the critical concentration, the timescale required for the equilibration of a system grows together with <italic>ξ</italic>, thus exceeding the timescale amenable to experimental observation.</p><p>Our analysis of experimental data indicates that: (i) scale invariance does indeed hold near the coexistence curve and (ii) the droplet size distribution is log-normal. Based on the properties of the scale-invariant log-normal distribution of droplet sizes, we investigate a correlation between the moments of the distribution and the distance from <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>.</p><p>Finally, we note that methods to assess the critical concentration are crucial for understanding the location of proteins in their phase diagram, their proximity to the phase boundary between the native and droplet states, and how pharmacological interventions can modify their phase behaviour. To address this problem, we report how the moments of the distribution can be used as a scale-invariant gauge to estimate the critical concentration. In this way, an accurate estimate of the critical concentration is possible because it is based on measurements carried out away from the critical point, under conditions such that fluctuations are small, and hence experimental errors are smaller than in the proximity of the transition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Formulation of the scaling ansatz</title><p>Empirical evidence indicates that protein self-assembly into liquid-like condensates is characterized by: (i) a phase separation transition at a concentration <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> , (ii) a formation of droplets of sizeable dimensions already below <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> , and (iii) a droplet size distribution that, after an initial transient, does not change with the experimental observation time, although individual droplets can form, grow, shrink, and dissolve. An initial analysis of droplet size distributions observed experimentally led us to ask whether the region near the transition could be described in terms of a scaling theory, as commonly done for critical phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shimobayashi et al., 2021</xref>), as summarized above. We also note that this approach is analogous to analysing the cluster size distribution in a percolation problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stauffer and Aharony, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In our analysis, we called <italic>P</italic> &gt; (<italic>s</italic>|<italic>ρ</italic>) the survival distribution function (SDF = 1 - CDF, where CDF is the cumulative distribution function) corresponding to the probability to observe a droplet of size greater than <italic>s</italic>, when the concentration is <italic>ρ</italic>. The distance from the critical concentration <italic>ρ<sub>c</sub></italic> is measured in terms of the dimensionless variable <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">~</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = (<italic>ρ − ρ<sub>c</sub></italic>)<italic>/ρ<sub>c</sub></italic> , which also allows to compare data from different experiments, as explained below. <italic>P</italic> &gt; (<italic>s</italic>|<italic>ρ</italic>) in general depends separately on <italic>s</italic>, <italic>ρ</italic>, and many other parameters characterizing the process, including temperature.

The characteristic size <italic>s<sub>c</sub></italic> is defined, apart from a proportionality constant (see below), as the ratio of the second to the first moment of the droplet size distribution.

For example, it is unclear whether the droplets observed below the saturation concentration and those detected above result from the same process. Here, we aimed at describing phase separation using a scaling ansatz.</p><p>With this aim, we analysed a series of droplet size distributions of FUS and α-synuclein. We found that the droplet size distributions follow a scale-invariant log-normal behaviour. Scale invariance means that the description of the behaviour of a system remains the same regardless of the scale of observation. It has been seen for example in self-similar systems like fractals, which repeat patterns at different length scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Song et al., 2005</xref>). Scale invariance is commonly observed in physics, biology, and economics, where it helps understand complex systems by identifying consistent patterns and fundamental properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stanley, 1999</xref>). The critical exponents of the scaling model are the same for different systems. We also note the generality of the log-normal model for nucleation and grain size growth ranging from crystal seeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binder and Virnau, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmann and Bill, 2008</xref>) to the mass size distributions in organism growth of various sea organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giometto et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to discuss the links of the scale invariance with the theoretical models that have been proposed to date to explain the phenomenon of protein phase separation. A commonly adopted framework is the Flory–Huggins theory of phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flory, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huggins, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michaels et al., 2023</xref>). In its simplest form, this theory describes a first-order phase separation in a system of homopolymers, which can also be adapted to polyampholites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Overbeek and Voorn, 1957</xref>). The Flory–Huggins theory has been extended to associative polymers, with the aim of modelling the sequence composition of proteins, by Flory and Stockmayer, who described the phase separation in terms of a third-order gelation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flory, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stockmayer, 1943</xref>). Semenov and Rubinstein modified the Flory–Stockmayer theory, reporting that the gelation process is not a real phase transition, as all the derivatives of the free energy are analytical at the gelation point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Semenov and Rubinstein, 1998</xref>). It was also argued that another generalization of the Flory–Stockmayer theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tavares et al., 2010</xref>) could describe phase transitions in cytoskeletal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bueno et al., 2022</xref>). In an older study, γ-crystallin was reported to undergo a second-order phase separation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thomson et al., 1987</xref>), consistently with observations in lysozyme solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishimoto and Tanaka, 1977</xref>).</p><p>More recently, it has been suggested that the protein phase separation process is coupled with percolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mittag and Pappu, 2022</xref>). It is notable that percolation models exhibit a continuous transition marked by a diverging correlation length and a scale-invariant droplet size distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stauffer and Aharony, 2018</xref>), resembling the general form as presented in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2">Equations 1 and 2</xref>. However, the critical exponents for 3D percolation at the critical threshold are <italic>α</italic> = 1.19 and <italic>φ</italic> = 2.21, and in mean-field (<italic>d</italic> &gt; 6) scenarios, they are <italic>α</italic> = 1.5 and <italic>φ</italic> = 2, as per existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stauffer and Aharony, 2018</xref>). In contrast, our scaling analysis is consistent with <italic>α</italic> = 0 and <italic>φ</italic> = 1. Therefore, a phase separation coupled with percolation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mittag and Pappu, 2022</xref>) could be consistent with the scaling behaviour reported here if this coupling would induce a shift in the universality class from that of standard percolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stauffer and Aharony, 2018</xref>). This possibility should be further investigated to determine whether this type of models could predict the critical exponents <italic>α</italic> = 0 and <italic>φ</italic> = 1.</p><p>Scale invariance may appear to be in contrast with the Flory–Huggins theory, which characterizes droplet formation as a consequence of nucleation processes within a metastable state of a supersaturated system. In such cases, however, when the correlation length exceeds the cellular dimensions, the remnants of what should have been a first-order phase transition in an infinite system may effectively exhibit indistinguishable characteristics from a second-order phase transition. We also note that a power law distribution, but above the transition temperature, has recently been reported for nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Quite generally, the existence of scale invariance for the droplet size distribution, at least under the conditions investigated, imposes stringent constraints on theoretical models that aim to elucidate protein phase separation. The importance of a scaling analysis lies in its ability to uncover the fundamental aspects of universal phenomena, transcending models confined solely to specific systems for which they were originally designed.</p><p>As a practical consequence of the scaling model, the moments of the droplet size distribution can be used to obtain an estimate of the critical concentration for phase separation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions and perspectives</title><p>It has been challenging to determine critical concentrations in the study of protein phase separation, particularly in cell systems. As a consequence, it remains still largely unclear when the observed protein droplets are formed at subsaturation concentrations, and when they represent phase-separated condensates at supersaturation concentrations. To make progress towards understanding this problem, we have analysed the probability distributions of the droplet sizes at different concentrations. The scale-invariant log-normal behaviour that we have reported offers a tool to determine the critical concentration. This approach should enable the positioning of a system with respect to the phase boundary when experimental data could be obtained about the length (1D), area (2D), or volume (3D) of the condensates. We anticipate that this method will find applications in the study of protein condensates in the cell.</p><p>We also note that the scale invariance of the droplet size distribution that we have reported is characteristic of critical phenomena, which tend to be highly sensitive to environmental conditions. The formation and dimensions of protein droplets could therefore be rather tunable. This feature would appear to be favourable for the control of the formation of biomolecular condensates by the protein homeostasis system, and also suggest that protein phase separation could be efficiently modulated pharmacologically.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification of α-synuclein</title><p>Human wild-type α-synuclein and A90C cysteine variants were purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3)-gold (Agilent Technologies) expressing plasmid pT7-7 encoding for α-synuclein as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dada et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fusco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hardenberg et al., 2021</xref>). Following purification in 50 mM trisaminomethane-hydrochloride (Tris-HCl) at pH 7.4, α-synuclein was concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (Merck Millipore). The protein was subsequently labelled with a 1.5-fold molar excess of C5 maleimide-linked Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) overnight at 4°C with constant mixing.

The final mixture was pipetted onto a 35-mm glass-bottom dish (P35G-1.5-20-C; MatTek Life Sciences) and immediately imaged on Leica Stellaris Will inverted stage scanning confocal microscope using a 40×/1.3 HC PL Apo CS oil objective (Leica Microsystems) at room temperature. The excitation wavelength was 633 nm for all experiments. For liquid droplet size characterization, images were captured 10 min post-liquid droplet formation. To analyse the possible time dependence of the liquid droplet size distribution, phase separation was induced, and 5 min post onset of phase separation, the glass-bottom dish containing the experiment was sealed and closed to maintain a stable and controlled environment. Subsequently, images were captured at each designated time point. All images were processed and analysed in ImageJ (NIH). Images were analysed by applying a threshold function in ImageJ that excluded the background of the image and identified the liquid droplets as having a circularity of 0.8–1.The results are reported for five replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

While the experimental evidence is solid, the text lacks connection and contextualization to the well-understood expectations from the coupling of percolation and phase separation in protein condensates - a phenomenon that is increasingly gaining consensus amongst the community. The evidence supports the percolatoin+phase separation model rather than being close to a true critical point in the liquid-gas phase space. Overall, the work is useful to the community.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The experimental analysis of distinct protein condensates is very well done and the reported exponents/scaling framework provides a clear framework to help the community help deconvolve signatures of percolation in condensates.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The principal concern this reviewer has is that the reviewers adopt a framing in this paper to present a discovery of second-order features and connections to criticality - however they ignore/miss the connections to percolation (a well-understood second-order transition that is expected to play a major role in protein condensates). I believe this needs to be addressed and the paper suitably revised to help connect with these expectations.</p><p>- Protein condensates have been increasingly understood to be described as fluids whose assembly is driven by a connection of density (phase separation, first-order) and connectivity (percolation, second-order) transitions. This has been long known in the polymer community (Flory, Stockmayer, Tanaka, Rubinstein, Semenov and others) and recently repopularized in the condensate community (by Pappu and Mittag, in particular, amongst others). The authors make no connections to any of this frameworks - which actually seem to be the essence of what they are describing.</p><p>- Percolation theory, which has been around for more than half-a-century, has clear-cut scaling laws that have essentially similar forms to the ansatz adopted by the authors and the commonalities/differences are not discussed by the authors - this is essential since this provides a physical basis for their ansatz rather than an arbitrary mathematical formulation. In particular, percolation models connect size distribution exponents to factors like dimensionality, valence, etc. and if these connections can be made with this data, that would be very powerful.</p><p>- The connections between spinodal decomposition and second-order phase transitions are very confusing. Spindal decomposition happens when the barriers for first-order phase transitions are zero and systems can phase separate without crossing nucleation barriers. Further, the &quot;criticality&quot; discussed in the paper is confusing since it more likely refers to a percolation threshold and much less likely to a &quot;critical temperature&quot; (Tc -where spinodal and binodals become identical). I would recommend reframing this argument.</p><p>It's unlikely, in this reviewer's opinion, that the authors are actually discussing a &quot;first-order&quot; liquid-gas critical point - because saturation concentrations of these proteins can be much higher with temperature and the critical point would thus likely be at much higher concentrations (and ofc temperature). Further the scaling exponents don't fall in that class naturally. However, if the authors disagree, I would appreciate clear quantitative reasons (including through the scaling exponents in that universality class) and be happy to be convinced to change my mind. As provided, the data does not support this model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94214.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In response to the two referee reports, the authors have made substantial improvements. Regarding my previous concerns, the new data provided in Fig.6 for demonstrating that the droplet size distribution is stable over time is particularly valuable.</p><p>As to several of my other previous concerns regarding possible change in droplet size distribution over time, etc., the authors responded by stating that their system was below the critical concentration and therefore the possible scenarios pointed out in my previous report were not expected. While there may be a certain degree of validity to their argument, it would be much more helpful to the readers if the authors would bring up my previous concerns briefly (as readers of the journal will likely have similar concerns) and then address them succinctly within the manuscript.</p><p>Apparently, as a key element in the authors' response to the referees, the term &quot;transition concentration&quot; in the originally submitted manuscript is now changed to &quot;critical concentration&quot; (including in the title and abstract). But the two terms do not have identical meaning. A transition concentration is usually recognized as the saturation concentration at which phase separation or some other transition process commences at a given temperature. The transition concentration can be lower than the critical concentration, whereas the critical concentration is associated with the critical temperature, above (or below, depending on the temperature dependence of phase separation) which phase separation is not possible. It will be best if the authors can clarify their usage of transition concentration vs. critical concentration in the version of record of their manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94214.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Amico</surname><given-names>Tommaso</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Padova</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Padova</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dada</surname><given-names>Samuel Toluwanimi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lazzari</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Padova</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Padova</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Brezinova</surname><given-names>Michaela</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Trovato</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Padova</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Padova</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vendruscolo</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fuxreiter</surname><given-names>Monika</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Padova</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Padova</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Maritan</surname><given-names>Amos</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Padova</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Padova</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold>:</p><p>In this useful study, the authors analyze droplet size distributions of multiple protein condensates and their fit to a scaling ansatz, highlighting that they exhibit features of first- and second-order phase transitions.

While the experimental evidence is solid, the text lacks connection and contextualization to the well-understood expectations from the coupling of percolation and phase separation in protein condensates - a phenomenon that is increasingly gaining consensus amongst the community. The evidence supports the percolation and phase separation model rather than being close to a true critical point in the liquid-gas phase space. Overall, the work is useful to the community.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for these positive comments. We would like to emphasises that our contribution is not to propose a theoretical model, but rather to report a scaling behaviour in the experimentally measured droplet size distributions. The main implication of our work is that any theoretical model should predict the scaling exponents that we derived from the experimental measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>The experimental analysis of distinct protein condensates is very well done and the reported exponents/scaling framework provides a clear framework to help the community deconvolve signatures of percolation in condensates.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The principal concern this reviewer has is that the reviewers adopt a framing in this paper to present a discovery of second-order features and connections to criticality - however, they ignore/miss the connections to percolation (a well-understood second-order transition that is expected to play a major role in protein condensates). I believe this needs to be addressed and the paper suitably revised to help connect with these expectations.</p></disp-quote><p>The scaling that we found is not characteristic standard percolation, since the exponents that we obtained (a=0 and f=1) are different from those of percolation (a=1.19 and f=2.21). This difference indicates that protein phase separation is not in the same universality class of standard percolation. Further studies will be required to understand whether theoretical models based on percolation could predict the observed critical exponents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Protein condensates have been increasingly understood to be described as fluids whose assembly is driven by a connection of density (phase separation, first-order) and connectivity (percolation, second-order) transitions. This has been long known in the polymer community (Flory, Stockmayer, Tanaka, Rubinstein, Semenov, and others) and recently repopularized in the condensate community (by Pappu and Mittag, in particular, amongst others). The authors make no connections to any of these frameworks - which actually seem to be the essence of what they are describing.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, our purpose was neither to support an existing theoretical model, nor to propose a new one. Rather, we have reported a scaling behaviour and scaling exponents not noted before. Further studies will be required to establish whether existing theoretical models could account for this scaling behaviour.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Percolation theory, which has been around for more than half a century, has clear-cut scaling laws that have essentially similar forms to the ansatz adopted by the authors, and the commonalities/differences are not discussed by the authors - this is essential since this provides a physical basis for their ansatz rather than an arbitrary mathematical formulation. In particular, percolation models connect size distribution exponents to factors like dimensionality, valence, etc. and if these connections can be made with this data, that would be very powerful.</p></disp-quote><p>The scaling ansatz that we are using is commonly adopted in studies of critical phenomena, and it is not specific to percolation. The scaling exponents depends only on very few attributes like dimensionality, symmetries and if interactions are short or long range. These attributes determine the universality class. As such, scaling does not link with molecular determinants, but can distinguish different classes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The connections between spinodal decomposition and second-order phase transitions are very confusing. Spindal decomposition happens when the barriers for first-order phase transitions are zero and systems can phase separate without crossing nucleation barriers. Further, the &quot;criticality&quot; discussed in the paper is confusing since it more likely refers to a percolation threshold and much less likely to a &quot;critical temperature&quot; (Tc -where spinodal and binodals become identical). I would recommend reframing this argument.</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot refer to percolation threshold as our model is not readily compatible with it. We elaborated and better explained the differences between these models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It's unlikely, in this reviewer's opinion, that the authors are actually discussing a &quot;first-order&quot; liquid-gas critical point - because saturation concentrations of these proteins can be much higher with temperature and the critical point would thus likely be at much higher concentrations (and ofc temperature). Further, the scaling exponents don't fall into that class naturally. However, if the authors disagree, I would appreciate clear quantitative reasons (including through the scaling exponents in that universality class) and be happy to be convinced to change my mind. As provided, the data does not support this model.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified in the manuscript that we do not discuss the liquid-gas critical point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2</bold>:</p><p>This is a potentially interesting study addressing a possible scale-invariant log-normal characteristic of droplet size distribution in the phase separation behavior of biomolecular condensates. Some of the data presented are valuable and intriguing. However, as it stands, the validity and utility of this study are uncertain because there are serious deficiencies in the execution and presentation of the authors' results. Many of these shortcomings are fundamental, including a lack of clarity in the basic conceptual framework of the study, insufficient justification of the experimental setup, less-than-conclusive experimental evidence, and inadequate discussion of implications of the authors' findings to future experimental and theoretical studies of biomolecular condensates. Accordingly, this reviewer considers that the manuscript should undergo a major revision to address the following. In particular, the discussion should be significantly expanded by including references mentioned below as well as other references pertinent to the issues raised.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful comments. In the revised version of the manuscript we clarified that we aimed to use a well-established tool – the scaling analysis – to study phase transition and applied to the protein condensation process. This approach offers insight into a universal aspect of protein phase separation, and also provides a practical approach to determine the phase boundary. The observed fat-tailed distribution of protein droplet sizes is not what is normally observed in more standard phase separation systems in the subsaturated phase. Our contribution is not to propose a theoretical model, but rather to report the observation of a scaling behaviour.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The theoretical analysis in this study is based on experimental data on condensed droplet size distributions for FUS and α-synuclein. The size data for FUS droplet is indirect as it relies on the assumption that FUS droplet diameter is proportional to fluorescence intensity of labeled FUS (page 10 of manuscript), with fluorescence data adopted from a previously published work by another group (Kar et al. &amp; Pappu, ref.27). Because fluorescence of a droplet is expected to be dependent upon the condensed-phase concentration of FUS, this proportional relationship, even if it holds, must also be modulated by FUS concentration in the droplet. Moreover, why should fluorescence be proportional to diameter but not the cross-sectional area or volume of the FUS droplet, which would be more intuitive? These issues should be clarified. A new measure by microscopy is used to determine the size distribution of condensed α-synuclein; but no microscopy image is shown. It is of critical importance that such raw data (for example microscopy images) be presented for the completeness and reproducibility of the experiment because the entire study relies on the soundness of these experimental measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>As we mentioned in the article, for the scaling analysis, the droplet dimensions could be assessed in 1D (length), 2D (area) or 3D (volume). For the FUS experiments, we used the data as the authors provided in the original publication (PNAS 2022). For alpha-synuclein, we provided the data in the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Despite the authors' claim of a universal scaling relationship, the log-log scatter plots in Figure 1 (page 15 of the manuscript) exhibit significant deviations from linearity at low protein concentrations (ρ→0). Given this fact, is universal scaling really valid? Discussion of this behavior is conspicuously absent (except the statement that these data points are excluded in the fit). In any case, the possible origins of these deviations should be thoroughly discussed so that the regime of universal scaling can be properly delineated.</p></disp-quote><p>In general, one would expect the scaling ansatz to be valid close to the phase boundary. It is the feature of the ansatz, that further away from the boundary, deviations are expected because of the decreasing relevance of critical phenomena.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Droplet size distribution most likely depends on the time duration after the preparation of the sample. For α-synuclein, &quot;liquid droplet size characterisation images were captured 10 minutes post-liquid droplet formation&quot; (page 9 of the manuscript). Why 10 minutes? Have the authors tried imaging at different time points and, if so, do the distributions at different time points remain essentially the same? If they are different, what is the criterion for focusing only on a particular time point? Information related to these questions should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now determined the droplet size distribution of alpha-synuclein at different time points, finding that they are not dependent on time within experimental uncertainties (Figure 6 in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) At least two well-known mechanisms can lead to the time-dependent distribution of liquid droplet sizes: (i) coalescence of droplets in spatial proximity to form a larger droplet, and (ii) Ostwald ripening, i.e., formation of larger droplets concomitant with the dissolution of smaller droplets without fusion of droplets. The implications of these mechanisms on the authors' droplet size distributions should be addressed. Indeed, maintaining a size distribution against these mechanisms in vivo often requires active suppression [Bressloff, Phys Rev E 101, 042804 (2020)] with possible involvement of chemical reactions [Kirschbaum &amp; Zwicker, J R Soc Interface 18, 20210255 (2021)]. These considerations are central to the basic rationale of this study and therefore should be carefully tackled.</p></disp-quote><p>These two mechanism of growth are relevant above the critical concentration. Below the critical concentration, which is the regime that we investigated in our work, there is no need of active suppression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) If coalescence and/or Ostwald ripening do occur, given sufficient time after sample preparation, the condensed phase may become a single large &quot;droplet&quot; or a single liquid layer. Does this occur in the authors' experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>As we are below the critical concentration, this is unlikely to occur, as indeed supported by the experiments mentioned at point (3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) It is unclear whether the authors aim to address the kinetic phenomenon of liquid droplet formation and evolution or equilibrium properties. The two types of phenomena appear to be conflated in the authors' narrative. Clarification is needed. If this work aims to address timeindependent (or infinite-time) equilibrium properties, how are they expected to be related to droplet size distribution, which most likely is time-dependent?</p></disp-quote><p>Our analysis focuses on the equilibrium properties of the droplet size distribution below the critical concentration, and it should guide the proposal of a theoretical model that explains the emergence of scaling. In the introductory part of our manuscript, we proposed a possible scenario that tries to extend the Flory-Huggins’s theory to predict a scaling behaviour appropriate to a critical transition. Other scenarios are possible, and our result along with further experiments are needed to arrive at a deeper understanding of protein aggregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The relationship between the potentially time-dependent droplet size distribution and equilibrium properties of ρt and ρc (transition and critical concentrations, respectively) should be better spelled out. An added illustrative figure will be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We are addressing equilibrium properties, not kinetic ones. See also the answers to point 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The authors comment that their findings appear to be inconsistent with Flory-Huggins theory because Flory-Huggins &quot;characterizes droplet formation as a consequence of nucleation ...&quot; (page 8 of the manuscript). Here, three issues need detailed clarification: (i) In what way does Flory-Huggins mandate nucleation? (ii) Why are the findings of apparent scale invariance inconsistent with nucleation? (iii) If liquid droplet formations do not arise from nucleation, what physical mechanism(s) is (are) envisioned by the authors to be underpinning the formation of condensed liquid droplets in protein phase separation?</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree that the Flory-Huggins theory does not mandate nucleation above the spinodal line. However, we are addressing the equilibrium properties below the critical concentration, so the stable phase is the dilute phase, and there is no nucleation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Are any of the authors' findings related to finite-system effects of phase separation [see, e.g., Nilsson &amp; Irbäck, Phys Rev E 101, 022413 (2020)]?</p></disp-quote><p>Our experimental system is macroscopic, so we would not expect finite size effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Since the authors are using their observation of an apparent scale-invariant droplet size distribution to evaluate phase separation theory, it is important to clarify whether their findings provide any constraint on the shape of coexistence curves (phase diagrams).</p></disp-quote><p>We are only reporting the phenomenological observation of a scaling behaviour, so we may not speculate at this stage on the constraints of the coexistence curves. This is indeed an exciting opportunity for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) More specifically, do the authors' findings suggest that the phase diagrams predicted by Flory-Huggins are invalid? Or, are they suggesting that even if the phase diagrams predicted by Flory-Huggins are empirically correct (if verified by experimental testing), they are underpinned by a free energy function different from that of Flory-Huggins? It is important to answer this question to clarify the implications of the authors' findings on equilibrium phase behaviors and the falsifiability of the implications.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, our main conclusion is that the droplet size distribution follows a scaling behaviour. Our contribution is not to propose a theoretical model, but rather to propose a scaling behaviour that should be accounted for by existing of future theoretical models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) How about the implications of the authors' findings on other theories of protein phase separation that are based on interactions that are different from the short spatial range interactions treated by Flory-Huggins? For instance, it has been observed that whereas the Flory-Huggins-predicted phase diagrams always convex upward, phase diagrams for charged intrinsically disordered proteins with long spatial range Coulomb interactions exhibit a region that concave upward [Das et al., Phys Chem Chem Phys 20, 28558-28574 (2018)]. Can information be provided by the authors' findings regarding apparent scale-invariant droplet size distribution on the underlying interaction driving the protein molecules toward phase separation?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point for future studies about the type of interactions that give rise to the observed scaling behaviour.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Table S1 (page 4) and Table S2 (page 7) are mentioned in the text but these tables are not in the submitted files.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the Supplementary Tables as well as the source files for the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) The two systems studied (FUS and α-synuclein) have a single intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) component. It is not clear if the authors expect their claimed scaling relation to be applicable to systems with multiple IDP components and if so, why.</p></disp-quote><p>From the data that we have currently analysed, we feel that we may not speculate on this interesting point, leaving it to future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
