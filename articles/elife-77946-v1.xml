ion channels. There are three vertebrate OTOP channels (OTOP1, OTOP2, and OTOP3), of which one (OTOP1) functions as a sour taste receptor. Whether extracellular protons gate OTOP channels, in addition to permeating them, was not known. Here, we compare the functional properties of the three murine OTOP channels using patch-clamp recording and cytosolic pH microfluorimetry. We find that OTOP1 and OTOP3 are both steeply activated by extracellular protons, with thresholds of pH<sub>o</sub> &lt;6.0 and 5.5, respectively, and kinetics that are pH-dependent. In contrast, OTOP2 channels are broadly active over a large pH range (pH 5 pH 10) and carry outward currents in response to extracellular alkalinization (&gt;pH 9.0). Strikingly, we could change the pH-sensitive gating of OTOP2 and OTOP3 channels by swapping extracellular linkers that connect transmembrane domains. Swaps of extracellular linkers in the N domain, comprising transmembrane domains 1–6, tended to change the relative conductance at alkaline pH of chimeric channels, while swaps within the C domain, containing transmembrane domains 7–12, tended to change the rates of OTOP3 current activation. We conclude that members of the OTOP channel family are proton-gated (acid-sensitive) proton channels and that the gating apparatus is distributed across multiple extracellular regions within both the N and C domains of the channels. In addition to the taste system, OTOP channels are expressed in the vertebrate vestibular and digestive systems. The distinct gating properties we describe may allow them to subserve varying cell-type specific functions in these and other biological systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ligand-gating</kwd><kwd>proton channel</kwd><kwd>taste</kwd><kwd>vestibular</kwd><kwd>otopetrin</kwd><kwd>acid-sensing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>PH Regulation</kwd><kwd>Ion transport</kwd><kwd>Ion channel gating</kwd><kwd>Structural biology</kwd><kwd>Otop1</kwd><kwd>Otop2</kwd><kwd>Otop3</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM131234</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liman</surname><given-names>Emily R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC013741</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liman</surname><given-names>Emily R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The sour receptor, OTOP1, and related proton channel OTOP3 are steeply activated by extracellular protons while OTOP2 is active over a broad pH range and differences in gating are partly attributed to extracellular domains.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The activity of ion channels is often tightly controlled through a change in conformation, known as gating, that opens and closes the ion permeation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hille, 2001</xref>). Gating can be in response to voltage (voltage-dependent), chemical stimuli (ligand-gated), or membrane deformation (mechanically-gated). Understanding the gating of an ion channel is critical to understanding its physiological function. Recently, a new family of ion channels that are selective for protons and with little or no structural similarity to other ion channels was identified, collectively named the Otopetrins or OTOPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>). These ion channels mediate proton influx in response to acid stimuli, but whether protons also gate them was unknown. Notably, while the structures of vertebrate OTOP1 and OTOP3 channels were recently solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saotome et al., 2019</xref>), it is not known if these structures are in open or closed states due to the lack of information regarding the gating of the channels.</p><p>OTOP1 currents were first characterized in taste receptor cells, where pH sensitivity, proton selectivity, and inhibition by Zn<sup>2+</sup> were described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bushman et al., 2015</xref>). The founding member of the OTOP family, mOTOP1, was identified as the product of a gene mutated in a murine vestibular disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hurle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughes et al., 2004</xref>) and was subsequently shown to form a proton channel that functions as a receptor for sour taste in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Teng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Most vertebrate genomes encode two related proteins, OTOP2 and OTOP3, that also form proton channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>) and are expressed in a diverse array of tissues, including in the digestive tract, where mutations in the corresponding genes have been linked to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parikh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2019a</xref>). Functional OTOP channels are conserved across species, including in invertebrates, where they play roles in acid sensing and biomineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hurle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ganguly et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mi et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Ion channels selective for protons are rare in nature, comprising just a small subset of the hundreds of types of ion channels that have been described over the last 80 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hille, 2001</xref>). The two best characterized proton-selective ion channels are M2, a viral protein involved in the acidification of the influenza virus interior, and Hv1, a voltage-gated ion channel that extrudes protons during the phagocyte respiratory burst to maintain pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pinto et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morgan et al., 2009</xref>). OTOP1 channels, unlike HV1, are not gated by voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bushman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>) but might instead be gated by protons, like Hv1 and M2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cherny et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liang et al., 2016</xref>). However, establishing that the permeant ion gates an ion channel is not trivial. For example, an increase in current magnitudes as pH is lowered could be attributed to the opening of channels or an increase in the driving force for proton entry. Here we describe the biophysical response properties of the three murine OTOP channels to varying extracellular pH. By focusing on parameters that are independent of the driving force, we show that extracellular protons gate the three channels in a subtype-specific manner and that the extracellular linker between transmembrane domains eleven and twelve plays a role in gating.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differential current response profiles of three murine OTOP channels to acidic and basic stimuli</title><p>We previously reported that all three murine OTOP channels conduct inward proton currents in response to acid stimuli, but show differences in their current as a function of pH (I-pH) relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>). We reasoned that these differences likely reflect differences in gating. To test this hypothesis, we performed a careful comparative analysis of the response properties of murine OTOP1, OTOP2, and OTOP3.</p><p>We used patch-clamp recording from HEK-293 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding each of the three channels for these experiments. If not otherwise stated, the intracellular solution was pH 7.4 (Cs-Aspartate-based), and the holding potential was –80 mV. All three channels carried inward currents in response to lowering pH<sub>o</sub> in a Na<sup>+</sup>-free solution, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>). The magnitude of the OTOP1 currents increased as the extracellular pH (pH<sub>o</sub>) was lowered over a range of pH 6 to pH 4.5, while the magnitude of OTOP2 currents changed very little over the same pH range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). OTOP3 currents increased more steeply over the same range, with little or no inward currents in response to pH 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). For all three channels, currents decayed in response to prolonged acid exposure, and the rate of current decay was faster as the pH<sub>o</sub> was lowered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), likely due in part to intracellular accumulation of protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeCoursey and Cherny, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bushman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De-la-Rosa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>) (discussed below).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Three vertebrate OTOP channels vary in their I-pH response profile across a broad pH range.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proton currents elicited in response to acidic stimuli (pH 6–4.5) in the absence of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> measured from HEK-293 cells expressing each of the three OTOP channels as labeled (V<sub>m</sub> = -80 mV).

In OTOP1-expressing cells, we observed a small outward current in response to the alkaline solutions (pH 9–10) that was not observed in untransfected cells, which we, therefore, attribute to currents through OTOP1 channels. In response to the pH 9, but not pH 10 solution, we observed a ‘tail current’ upon return to neutral pH (for pH 9, I<sub>tail</sub> = –123+/-20 pA, n=5; for pH 10, I<sub>tail</sub> = –36+/-11 pA); this may reflect cytosolic H<sup>+</sup> depletion during the pH 9 stimulus, creating a driving force for proton entry through open OTOP1 channels that subsequently close when the pH was restored to 7.4. In response to pH 8 and 7 solutions, no measurable change in the baseline currents was observed.</p><p>A very different pH-response profile was observed in OTOP2-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Quite surprisingly, large outward currents were evoked in response to alkaline solutions of pH 9 and pH 10, which were similar in magnitude to the inward currents evoked in response to the acidic solutions. We also observed changes in the holding current in response to solutions at near-neutral pH (pH 8 or 7), suggesting that the channels are open at the resting pH<sub>o</sub>. Overall, we observed changes in OTOP2 currents in response to changes in extracellular pH over the entire pH range tested. The magnitude and direction of the responses were generally proportional to the driving force on the proton. This relationship broke down over the more acidic pH range, where a change of 10-fold in ion concentration (e.g. pH 6 versus pH 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) did not lead to a substantial increase in current magnitude. Although we do not yet understand this phenomenon, we suspect that it may be due in part to the rapid decay kinetics of the currents in response to acid stimuli and the consequent attenuation of the peak currents as well as possible inhibition of the channels by intracellular acidification.</p><p>OTOP3 currents were active over a narrower pH range than OTOP1 and OTOP2 currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). They were activated steeply below pH 6, and no outward currents were observed in response to any of the alkaline stimuli.</p><p>These data suggest a sharp threshold for activating OTOP1 and OTOP3 channels of ~pH 6 (OTOP1) and pH 5.5. (OTOP3). In contrast, OTOP2 channels are active over the entire pH range. They also show that both OTOP1 and OTOP2 channels can conduct outward currents, which may be physiologically relevant under some circumstances.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>OTOP2 is selective for protons and open at neutral pH</title><p>The unusual response properties of OTOP2 raise the question of whether OTOP2 is selective for protons. OTOP1 is highly selective for H<sup>+</sup> over Na<sup>+</sup>, by a factor of at least 10<sup>5</sup> fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>), and currents carried by OTOP3 follow the expectations for a proton-selective current, such as a shift in the reversal potential that follows the equilibrium potential for the H<sup>+</sup> ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). OTOP2 is known to permeate protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>), but selectivity for protons was not previously measured. To address this question, we first performed ion substitution experiments. We observed no change in the magnitude of the currents when the concentrations of either Na<sup>+</sup> or Cl<sup>-</sup> in the extracellular solution were changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that OTOP2 is not permeable to either ion. We also measured the reversal potential of OTOP2 currents as a function of ΔpH (pH<sub>o</sub> – pH<sub>i</sub>) under conditions designed to minimize H<sup>+</sup> ion accumulation (see methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cherny and DeCoursey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>). These experiments showed that E<sub>rev</sub> changed ~59 mV/pH as expected for an H<sup>+</sup>-selective ion channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

These data support the conclusion that OTOP1 and OTOP3 are gated by extracellular protons, while OTOP2 is conductive over a broad pH range.</p><p>This series of experiments also provided an opportunity to test the extent to which intracellular acidification accounts for the decay of the macroscopic currents. In particular, we noted that the decay of the currents was often accompanied by a shift in E<sub>rev</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, B). Although in these experiments the currents were not leak-subtracted and, consequently, E<sub>rev</sub> cannot be used to precisely measure ΔpH, shifts in E<sub>rev</sub> can, nonetheless, be considered as evidence of a relative change in intracellular pH. For OTOP1, the observation that E<sub>rev</sub> shifted by –42.5+/-10.4 mV (n=5) between the first and the fourth ramp depolarization (4 seconds apart) suggests that the cytosol acidified by ~0.7 pH units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A more modest shift of –27.9+/-3.4 mV (n=3) was observed for OTOP2 currents, while for slowly activating OTOP3 currents, E<sub>rev</sub> shifted slightly but significantly in the positive direction (6.82+/-2.5 mV, n=7; p=0.03, two-tailed paired Student’s T-test comparing t=0 s and t=4 s). To test whether acidification of the cytosol could account for the decay of OTOP1 and OTOP2 currents, we calculated the expected effect of the change in driving force (V<sub>m</sub>-E<sub>rev</sub>) on the current magnitude at 1 s timepoints as the currents decayed and compared this to the observed current magnitudes at these times. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, the shift in driving force mostly accounts for the decay of OTOP1 currents. For OTOP2, the decays in current magnitudes is much greater than can be explained by a change in driving force, suggesting that intracellular acidification may directly inhibit OTOP2 channel activity or conductance. We could not perform a similar analysis of OTOP3 currents, which in these experiments did not decay significantly during the stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Extracellular linkers are key determinants for pH-sensitive gating</title><p>The difference in pH<sub>o</sub> sensitivity of the three murine OTOP channels suggested that structural domains that vary among the channels contribute to the gating apparatus and that these domains could be identified using chimeric channels. Specifically, we generated chimeras between mOTOP2 and mOTOP3, which, as described above, are the most divergent functionally of the three murine OTOP channels. OTOP channels contain twelve transmembrane domains (S1-S12), with N and C termini located intracellularly. The transmembrane domains 1–6 and 7–12 respectively constitute the structurally homologous ‘N’ and ‘C’ domains. Reasoning that the residues involved in sensing the extracellular pH and gating the channels would be located on the extracellular surface of the channels, we swapped each of the six extracellular linkers that connect transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Each of the twelve chimeric channels was then tested over a range from pH 10 to pH 5.

Moreover, this chimera activated at a more mild pH than OTOP3 channels and with faster kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and F</xref>). Thus, the simple swap of the 3–4 linker conferred a partial gating phenotype of the donor, OTOP2. The chimera containing the L5-6 from OTOP2 was more similar to OTOP3, while the L1-2 chimera appeared to be non-functional. Interestingly, the C domain chimeras also produced apparent changes in gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and F</xref>): all three chimeras activated more rapidly and at higher pH, adopting some features from the donor channel (OTOP2). But they retained the steep pH sensitivity of the OTOP3 channels and did not support proton efflux in response to alkaline stimuli like OTOP2.</p><p>The structure of OTOP2 channels has not yet been resolved experimentally, and the cryo-EM structures of OTOP1 and OTOP3 channels do not allow the visualization of the S5-6 linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saotome et al., 2019</xref>), possibly because the linker adopts multiple conformations. Thus, to gain structural insight into the possible mechanisms by which extracellular linker regions could contribute to gating, we examined the structures of murine OTOP1, OTOP2, and OTOP3 channels predicted by AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>). We first verified that the AlphaFold structures were reliable by comparing them to the cryoEM structures where available (e.g. for DrOTOP1 and GgOTOP3). This analysis revealed excellent agreement between the observed and expected structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Inspection of the predicted structures of the three mammalian OTOP channels shows the putative location of the extracellular linker and associated transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, the 5–6 linker of OTOP2 is longer, and transmembrane domain 5 (TM5) of OTOP2 adopts a helical structure with a pronounced kink, whereas that of OTOP3 is straight and rod-like. Thus, it is possible that the introduction of the OTOP3 S5-6 linker onto OTOP2, which disrupts conduction at alkaline pH, may do so through a structural rearrangement of transmembrane helices within the N domain of the channel. In contrast, differences between OTOP2 and OTOP3 in the 3–4 and C terminal linkers and associated transmembrane domains are less pronounced, suggesting that single amino acids that differ between the channels may tune the pH dependence of gating. Together, we conclude that extracellular linkers participate in the gating of OTOP channels and that the gating apparatus is distributed across multiple extracellular regions within both the N and C domains.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Predicted structures of mOTOP1.</title><p>mOTOP2 and mOTOP3.

OTOP1 and OTOP3 show no or little activity at neutral pH<sub>o</sub> and are activated by lowering pH, while OTOP2 is active at neutral and alkaline pH<sub>o</sub>, and lowering pH<sub>o</sub> appears to inhibit the channel. The varying pH sensitivity of the three vertebrate OTOP channels may allow them to subserve different functions in the cells within which they are expressed and is reminiscent of the varying temperatures sensitivities of thermo-TRP channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dhaka et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>pH tuning of OTOP channels.</title><p>Lowering extracellular pH increases the slope conductance of OTOP1 and OTOP3 channels while it lowers the slope conductance of OTOP2 channels.

For example, the thermosensitive ion channel TRPV1, the acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC), and proton-activated chloride channels (PAC) are all activated by protons acting on extracellular sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Waldmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jordt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lambert and Oberwinkler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ullrich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2021</xref>).

Notably, the only other plasmalemma proton channel in eukaryotes, the voltage-gated proton channel Hv1, shows a shift in voltage dependence as a function of pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decoursey, 2012</xref>), while a lysosomal K<sup>+</sup> channel, TMEM175 was recently shown to function as a proton-activated proton channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>). For channels in which the proton is not the primary permeant ion, the effect of pH on gating can be measured simply by comparing current magnitudes as extracellular pH is varied. In contrast, because changing pH will also change the driving force for proton entry and, therefore, the magnitude of proton currents, establishing an effect of pH (protons) on the gating of a proton channel is more difficult. Such an analysis is further complicated by the exceedingly small conductance of proton channels at physiological or even acid pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decoursey, 2012</xref>), which makes it hard, if not impossible, to measure the effects of pH on the gating of single channels.</p><p>The magnitude of OTOP currents was previously shown to vary as a function of pH<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>). We confirmed the effects of pH<sub>o</sub> and extended the pH range of test solutions, allowing us to observe that OTOP2 and, to a lesser extent, OTOP1 channels can carry outward proton currents in response to extracellular alkalization. The differences in currents suggest underlying differences in gating. To provide direct evidence for differential gating of the vertebrate OTOP channels, we devised a strategy that avoids confounds introduced by the changing driving force for proton movement inherent in these experiments. Taking advantage of differences in the three murine OTOP channels, we provide three independent pieces of evidence that extracellular protons gate the OTOP channels. First, we found that OTOP1 and OTOP3 currents activated slowly in response to acid stimuli, with rates that increased as the extracellular pH was lowered. These results can be explained if lowering the pH opens the channels. Second, the slope conductance of the OTOP channels, which is independent of driving force, varied as a function of pH<sub>o</sub> for all three channels. Consistent with the kinetic data, the slope conductance of both OTOP1 and OTOP3 currents increased dramatically upon lowering the pH below 6.0 (OTOP1) and 5.5 (OTOP3), while the slope conductance of OTOP2 increased with alkalization above pH 8.0. Finally, these results are consistent with pH imaging experiments where proton efflux in response to extracellular alkalinization was only observed for OTOP1 and OTOP2 and not for OTOP3-expressing cells. Together these data allow us to conclude that the three murine OTOP channels are gated differentially by extracellular protons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Structure of OTOP channels and role of extracellular linkers</title><p>The recent cryo-EM structures of OTOP1 and OTOP3 channels have revealed that the channels adopt a novel fold, with twelve transmembrane alpha-helices organized into two structurally homologous six-helix domains (N and C domains) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saotome et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, as a dimer, the channels adopt a pseudo-tetrameric structure. However, in contrast to most ion channels where the subunits come together to form a shared pore, the central cavity of OTOP channels is filled with cholesterol-like molecules and, therefore, cannot mediate ion conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saotome et al., 2019</xref>). Three putative pathways for protons have been identified in the structures: one each in the N and C domains and another at the interface of N and C domains (intrasubunit interface). Mutations in each putative permeation pathway that cause loss of function have been identified, including mutations of conserved residues (E267 and H574 in ZfOTOP1) at the intrasubunit interface that are required for function but not subunit assembly or trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saotome et al., 2019</xref>). Whether these residues mediate gating or permeation of the channels is still not known, and it is possible they participate in both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tombola et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Musset et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, with three possible routes for proton permeation, there may be multiple pores that open under different conditions. For example, our observation that OTOP1 channels show a biphasic response to extracellular pH could be explained by two pores that open over different pH ranges, a hypothesis that would need to be tested.</p><p>Our data also provide a framework for understanding the structural basis for the gating of OTOP channels by protons. Swapping extracellular loops of OTOP2 and OTOP3 selectively changed the gating of the channels in a predictable manner. Swapping loops in the N domain of the channels selectively affected the outward currents elicited in response to alkalinization, such that OTOP2/OTOP3 (L5-6) channels carried less outward current, while OTOP3/OTOP2(L3-4) channels carried more outward current than the respective wildtype channels. They also showed rapid activation kinetics to acid stimuli like OTOP2. This suggests that the N domain either contains the pore that is active over a broad pH range or contains a sensor that opens a common pore over a large pH range (for example, at the intrasubunit interface). In contrast, swapping loops within the C domain had no discernable effect on OTOP2 but changed the gating of OTOP3 channels such that they opened faster and at higher pH (like OTOP2). This suggests that activation of OTOP3 may involve a pH-dependent conformational change within the C domain linkers that otherwise inhibit its activity.</p><p>How the structure of the extracellular linkers participate in gating and whether they function as pH sensors or allosterically modulate gating remains to be determined. Structural predictions of MmOTOP2 from AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>) point to intriguing differences in the position of S5 domain and the S5-6 linker between OTOP2 and OTOP3 that may underlie differences in gating. In contrast, AlphaFold predicted similar conformations of the L3-L4 loop for both channels, so that we do not presently have a structural basis for the phenotype of the OTOP3/OTOP2(L3-4) chimera. It is worth noting that the chemical makeup of this linker is very variable; for example, OTOP3 has three positively charged residues (two His and one Lys) and three negatively charged residues, while OTOP2 has just one positively and one negatively charged residues (conserved in OTOP1) and several aromatic residues.</p><p>Together our description of the differential gating of the three mammalian OTOP channels by protons provides the basis for a deeper understanding of this new ion channel family and will lead to a better understanding of how OTOP channels contribute to a wide range of physiological processes, from gravity senses and taste to digestion, both in health and disease. Further understanding of the mechanism by which protons gate OTOP channels will require a combination of structure-guided mutagenesis and the resolution of the structure of OTOP channels in different states.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Otop1</italic>, <italic>Otop2</italic> and <italic>Otop3</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu et al., 2018</xref>.

It provides evidence that protons gate the channels in a subtype-specific manner and identifies two extracellular loops in the protein as important contributors to pH-dependent gating. Overall, the experiments are well justified, and the results are explained clearly. The conclusions are supported by the data but there are several points that need to be addressed.</p><p>The section describing the effect of extracellular pH on slope conductance needs to be revised. Slope conductance is defined as dI/dV and can be positive or negative depending on the voltage range of activation of the channel and the current reversal potential. The connection between slope conductance and N*Po*g indicated by the authors is unclear, as Po is usually the open probability at a given V, and g is the single channels chord conductance. If the authors really wanted to measure a parameter that does not depend on the driving force for proton entry, they should have just calculated the conductance as G = I/(V-Erev), not I/V.</p><p>The I/V ratio for OTOP2 varies with pHo in a confusing way (Figure 5C). It decreases going from pHo = 10 to pHo = 6, and then increases going to pHo = 5 (while the current remains constant between pHo = 6 and pHo = 5, Figure 1C). This seems inconsistent with the statement that &quot;OTOP2 is constitutively open&quot; which implies that Po does not depend on pH in this channel.</p><p>The authors state that the pH imaging data in Figure 3 provide the first direct evidence that the three murine OTOP channels are gated by extracellular protons in a subtype-specific manner. But what about the current data in Figure 1. Why is that data not sufficient to make the claim?</p><p>In Figure 4A, for OTOP1 and OTOP3, a k(on) connects a closed state in low H<sup>+</sup> conc. to an open state in high H<sup>+</sup> conc., but the k(off) does not connect the open state to the closed state. So, in what state is the channel right after returning to neutral pH? Did the authors try to open the channels with two consecutive acid pulses?</p><p>The structural differences in the L5-6 loops of the three OTOPs predicted by AlphaFold are interesting but what about the L3-4 loops? How are these differences helpful in understanding the experimental data on loop swapping? How do AlphaFold predictions compare with the Cryo-EM structures in the resolved transmembrane region?</p><p>While the 3D structure of the loops is expected to affect function, what about the number/nature of charged and titratable residues? For instance, the L3-4 loop of OTOP2 contains three positive charges, of which two are His residues, while OTOP1 and OTOP2 have a net negative charge carried by a conserved Glu residue. It would be useful to discuss this kind of difference in light of the results of loop swapping.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Currents shown in Figure 1 at nearly all pHo tested show a pronounced decay that is reported to be faster when pHo is lower (lines 74-76). However, it is not clear whether currents plotted in Figure 1C were measured at the peak vs. some other time during the pHo change. Do the authors do not offer any insight into the mechanism underlying current decay? For example, the relatively large current amplitudes suggest that despite pipette solution pH buffering, pHi could change as a result of current flowing through open Otop channels; alternatively, Otops might exhibit a form of desensitization or inactivation. If the former is the case, are the authors confident that current amplitudes are accurately measured and that the imposed change in pHo has been achieved at the time when currents were measured? (See also comments about solution exchange time below).</p><p>2. Intracellular pH is 7.4 in all experiments (except Figure 2, where only Otop2 was measured), and the effect of changing pHi does not appear to have been tested. Why not?</p><p>3. pHluorin imaging shown in Figure 3 is indirect and, due to lack of voltage clamp and lack of good pHi buffering, an intrinsically less robust method than electrophysiology; perhaps this data is better suited to Supplementary material? Experiments demonstrating net inward vs. outward proton fluxes during voltage ramps applied at various pHo (Figure 5B) appear to be a more appropriate method for tracking the direction of permeant ion movement.</p><p>4. The fastest gating transition measured in Figure 4 is limited by solution exchange time, as the authors note, but it's not clear that solution exchange times were independently measured (i.e., by open-tip potential changes) using the same apparatus. Is the off-time constant for Otop2 (32 ms; Figure 4C, middle panel) substantially slower than the solution exchange time (if so, then the simplified scheme proposed in Figure 4A would not hold for Otop 2)?. Alternatively, the relatively slow current deactivation rate measured in Figure 4C might not be representative of the average behavior (as suggested by summary data shown in Figure 4D, middle panel). Furthermore, the kinetic schemes shown in Figure 4A do not consider that proton binding or unbinding from its putative binding site(s) might be rate-limiting for gating transitions; is this assumption supported by the experimental data?</p><p>5. What new information is gleaned from measuring slope conductance (Figure 5C)? The G vs. pHo graphs appear to have the same shape as I vs. pHo graphs in Figure 1C, suggesting that the two methods report the same pH-dependent gating transitions. Could channel numbers be estimated (i.e., via current variance analysis) to calculate unitary conductances for Otop 1-3?</p><p>6. Otop2/3 chimera data (Figure 6) are interesting, but leave open the question as to whether discrete titratable residues are responsible for low- vs. high-pH dependent gating. It would seem that the chimeras would help narrow the range of candidates, allowing the authors to focus on just a few. Additional data in single- or double-mutant channels would greatly enhance the strength of the manuscript. Why are no Otop1 chimeras shown?</p><p>7. The reliability of AlphaFold-generated models is not independently established (i.e., during MD simulations), and it remains unclear whether the structural differences shown in Figure 8 are truly representative of physiologically meaningful differences in protein structure. How does the data in Figure 8 contribute to knowledge about the structural basis of pH-dependent gating in Otop channels? Do models identify specific titratable residues that could be experimentally tested (see item 6 above)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77946.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide additional data to assess pH at the cell membrane during whole-cell patch-clamp experiments.

For OTOP3 currents, which are slowly activating (over several seconds), the shift in Erev is in the positive direction, consistent with a larger fraction of the current coming from OTOP channels (as compared with leak current) at later time points. From these experiments, it is clear that the intracellular pH decreases during the acid stimuli for OTOP1 and OTOP2. It is for this reason that we collected data for OTOP1 and OTOP2 at early time points (usually at 1 second after the onset of the stimulus for I-V curves).</p><p>To determine if the change in intracellular pH might account for the decay of the currents in response to sustained stimuli, we compared the observed magnitudes of the currents with that expected if the driving force for proton entry changed as measured from Erev. We used the equation: I(t) = I(1) * (Vm-Erev(t))/(Vm-Erev(1)), where I(1) and I(x) are the currents at times 1 second (the first measurement we could make) and x seconds, Erev (1) and Erev(x) are the reversal potential of the current at times 1 and x, and Vm was the membrane potential at which I was measured (-80 mV for these experiments). The results are shown in Figure 5- supplementary figure 1C. We can account for most of the decay of the OTOP1 currents by the change in driving force (this is also evident in panel A, where the slope of the currents changes little during the stimulus). In contrast, we noted that there was a large deviation for OTOP2 currents between the magnitudes of the currents as predicted from the shift in Erev, and what was measured. This suggests that the decay of OTOP2 currents might be attributed to changes in gating during the stimulus application. Whether this reflects an inactivation of the channels or inhibition by intracellular pH remains an open question.</p><p>Note that we do not agree that aspartate as the anion in the intracellular solution is a concern as its pKa is 3.9 and previously we did not observe the intracellular pH to drop below pH 5 in unperturbed cells (Tu et al., 2018). Moreover, if aspartate did shuttle protons out of the cell, this would help stabilize the intracellular pH in response to the acid stimuli. We have also tested the effects of changing pHi on whole-cell OTOP currents, but as these experiments require additional validation (e.g. with excised patches) and are not central to the main argument of the manuscript, that the channels are gated by extracellular protons acting on linker domains, we feel adding this data would detract from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Provide additional data to establish what solution exchange times are. See comments by reviewers #1 and #3. We suggest this could be achieved by open tip potential measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and we now included data that allowed us to estimate the kinetics of the solution exchange (Figure 4B,C). Note that the open tip method works for excised patches but is not a good estimate of solution exchange time for whole-cell recording, where the cell will disrupt laminar solution flow and slow down exchange rates (Li et al., 2000). We, therefore, adopted a variation of the method described in Li et al., 2000, estimating solution exchange time using the response of an open K<sup>+</sup> channel (KIR2.1) to changes K<sup>+</sup> concentrations. In these experiments, the K<sup>+</sup> channel was either transfected alone or co-transfected with OTOP2, to allow measurement of currents through both channels in the same cell (in response to different solutions). The results show that OTOP2 currents are activated as quickly as the K<sup>+</sup> currents, consistent with an open channel, and that decay rates for all channels are not different the expected decay rate due to removal of the permeant ion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The section describing the effect of extracellular pH on slope conductance needs to be revised and the value of the slope conductance measurements clarified. See comments by reviewers #2 and #3.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 preferred a measurement of slope conductance as I/(V-Vrev). We now explain that we measured DI/DV = ((I1-I2)/(V1-V2)) which is formally identical to I/(V-Vrev) for the case where V2=Vrev (so I2=0). Reviewer #3 asked “What new information is gleaned from measuring slope conductance” as compared to measuring current (at V = -80 mV).” We now explain that measuring slope conductance allows us to assess channel activity when the holding potential is close to Erev, and it normalizes for driving force.</p><p>Lines 203-211 now read “The slope conductance (DI/DV) was measured from response to ramp depolarizations at or near the peak of the response to the stimulus (pH<sub>o</sub> = 10 to 5) (Figure 5A, B) using a range of V<sub>m</sub> from -80 mV to 0 mV, where the currents were generally linear and not contaminated by endogenous currents. Slope conductance (G) is related to the open probability (Po) of the channel by G = N*g*Po, where N is the number of channels and g is the single-channel conductance. Since the number of channels is constant, the slope conductance is a measure of Po*g. Importantly, this provides a measure of open probability, even where the holding potential is close to the equilibrium potential for H<sup>+</sup> and therefore currents are small (e.g. for stimuli at 8.0).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Discuss which titratable residues could potentially be pH sensors. Experiments with point mutations of titratable residues could greatly increase the impact of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>A main conclusion of the paper is that the gating apparatus is distributed across multiple (if not all) extracellular linkers, which contain dozens of titratable residues. Thus, until we are able to resolve more clearly (e.g. with cryo-EM) the gating transition, we believe that discussion of such residues is premature. Moreover, we have found in unpublished work that mutations of residues that are not considered titratable can change pH-dependent gating, underscoring our hesitation to make any such claims and highlighting the difficulty in distinguishing between effects on ligand binding (where H<sup>+</sup> is the ligand) from allosteric effects on gating (e.g. lowing the energy for the channel to open). A limited discussion of some of these points is included in lines 377-386.</p><p>“How the structure of the extracellular linkers participate in gating and whether they function as pH sensors or allosterically modulate gating remains to be determined. Structural predictions of mOTOP2 from AlphaFold (Jumper et al., 2021; Varadi et al., 2022) point to intriguing differences in the position of S5 domain and the S5-6 linker between OTOP2 and OTOP3 that may underlie differences in gating. In contrast, AlphaFold predicted similar conformations of the L3-L4 loop for both channels so that we do not presently have a structural basis for the phenotype of the OTOP3/OTOP2(L3-4) chimera. It is worth noting that the chemical makeup of this linker is very variable; for example, OTOP3 has three positively charged residues (two His and one Lys) and three negatively charged residues, while OTOP2 has just one positively and one negatively charged residue (conserved in OTOP1) and several aromatic residues. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Address each of the comments of the reviewers by revision of the manuscript or explain in the response letter why not.</p></disp-quote><p>We have thoroughly revised the manuscript to address the reviewer’s comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Abstract</p><p>line 5 &quot;permeated by&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results</p><p>line 75 &quot;the rate of current decay was faster as the pHo was lowered.&quot; Could this be a result of H<sup>+</sup> accumulation/depletion?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we now add the following to indicate that this is likely the case, with appropriate references. …” likely due in part to intracellular accumulation of protons (Bushman et al., 2015; De-la-Rosa et al., 2016; DeCoursey and Cherny, 1996; Tu et al., 2018) (see below)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>line 83 &quot;this suggests that channels had opened in response to the pH 9 stimulus and subsequently closed over a period of several seconds upon return to neutral pH.

It provides evidence that protons gate the channels in a subtype-specific manner and identifies two extracellular loops in the protein as important contributors to pH-dependent gating. Overall, the experiments are well justified, and the results are explained clearly. The conclusions are supported by the data but there are several points that need to be addressed.</p><p>The section describing the effect of extracellular pH on slope conductance needs to be revised. Slope conductance is defined as dI/dV and can be positive or negative depending on the voltage range of activation of the channel and the current reversal potential. The connection between slope conductance and N*Po*g indicated by the authors is unclear, as Po is usually the open probability at a given V, and g is the single channels chord conductance.

For OTOP channels, which are not voltage-sensitive (Tue et al., 2018), the slope of the I/V curve (DI/DV) is always positive (or zero) and is not dependent on the reversal potential of the channels, or the voltage. The reason we can use the slope conductance from the macroscopic I-V curve is that Po does not change as a function of voltage (nor does N), and thus it is in principle, a measure of G. Note that we measured (DI/DV) not I/V (this was a typo that has been corrected on line 194), and this is formally the same as I/(V-Erev). Importantly, G as defined by DI/DV does not require that we know Erev (which was out of range for most of the experiments).</p><p>The new text reads “The slope conductance (DI/DV) was measured from ramp depolarizations at or near the peak of the response to the stimulus (pHo = 10 to 5) (Figure 5 A, B) using a range of V<sub>m</sub> from -80 mV to 0 mV, where the currents were generally linear and not contaminated by endogenous currents.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The I/V ratio for OTOP2 varies with pHo in a confusing way (Figure 5C).

We agree that for OTOP2, the changes in conductance are not straightforward to interpret in terms of gating of the channels by pHo, and that the most conservative interpretation is that the channels are open over a large pH range. This could be considered constitutive activity, which does not imply that it cannot be regulated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state that the pH imaging data in Figure 3 provide the first direct evidence that the three murine OTOP channels are gated by extracellular protons in a subtype-specific manner.

We believe the pH imaging provides important corroboration of a central finding of the paper, that OTOP2, and to a lesser extent OTOP1, mediates proton efflux to alkalinizing pHo. It also describes a methodology that may be useful for future studies of the channels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4A, for OTOP1 and OTOP3, a k(on) connects a closed state in low H<sup>+</sup> conc. to an open state in high H<sup>+</sup> conc., but the k(off) does not connect the open state to the closed state.

This gives us more confidence in the AlphaFold models and their utility in predicting novel structures (e.g. OTOP2) and predicting regions of the channels that could not be resolved in the cryoEM structures, such as the loops.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the 3D structure of the loops is expected to affect function, what about the number/nature of charged and titratable residues? For instance, the L3-4 loop of OTOP2 contains three positive charges, of which two are His residues, while OTOP1 and OTOP2 have a net negative charge carried by a conserved Glu residue. It would be useful to discuss this kind of difference in light of the results of loop swapping.</p></disp-quote><p>I believe the reviewer meant that OTOP3 (not OTOP2) has two His residues. Of the 12 amino acids that we swapped, 9 varied between OTOP2 and OTOP3. Six of the swaps changed a charged residue. We do not know which of these changes are responsible for the change in gating of OTOP3 and whether the charge on these residues is the relevant parameter. We now mention this in the discussion (Lines 384-386).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Currents shown in Figure 1 at nearly all pHo tested show a pronounced decay that is reported to be faster when pHo is lower (lines 74-76). However, it is not clear whether currents plotted in Figure 1C were measured at the peak vs. some other time during the pHo change. Do the authors do not offer any insight into the mechanism underlying current decay? For example, the relatively large current amplitudes suggest that despite pipette solution pH buffering, pHi could change as a result of current flowing through open Otop channels; alternatively, Otops might exhibit a form of desensitization or inactivation. If the former is the case, are the authors confident that current amplitudes are accurately measured and that the imposed change in pHo has been achieved at the time when currents were measured? (See also comments about solution exchange time below).</p></disp-quote><p>The currents were measured at their peak (now stated in the figure legend). Regarding the question of whether the “imposed change in pHo has been achieved at the time when currents were measured?” this is clearly the case for OTOP1 and OTOP3 that have time constants for activation of &gt;100 ms, more than 5-fold slower than the solution exchange times of ~20 ms. For OTOP2, the activation kinetics are similar to the rate of the solution exchange, and they decay rapidly thereafter. Thus, it is possible that the currents might have been larger if the solution exchange was faster (see below). We tried to see if we would get larger OTOP2 currents (meaning we missed the peak) by holding Vm at EH and then changing Vm to -80 mV after the stimulus was applied, but we could only do this for the condition where the difference of pHi and pHo was one pH unit (meaning EH was +60 mV), and this protocol had little effect on the current magnitudes. Thus, we agree that for OTOP2, we might have missed the peak current, but we do not believe that this changes any of the conclusions of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Intracellular pH is 7.4 in all experiments (except Figure 2, where only Otop2 was measured), and the effect of changing pHi does not appear to have been tested. Why not?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to focus on the role of extracellular pH in gating the OTOP channels, and its structural basis as this is an important way in which the channels may be regulated under physiological conditions, and it is more tractable.</p><p>The effect of intracellular pH on gating of the channels is an important but thorny issue. As researchers who work on Hv1 well know, controlling the intracellular pH in a cell with large proton currents is notoriously difficult and the problem is compounded for OTOP channels that cannot be closed by voltage to limit proton flux. Moreover, we are not able to do the kind of detailed analyses that we could in measuring effects of extracellular pH (e.g. looking at the kinetics of responses). Thus, while we have done preliminary experiments to measure OTOP currents with solutions of varying intracellular pH, we feel that including these experiments, which are not germane to the main conclusion of the manuscript, would be premature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. pHluorin imaging shown in Figure 3 is indirect and, due to lack of voltage clamp and lack of good pHi buffering, an intrinsically less robust method than electrophysiology; perhaps this data is better suited to Supplementary material? Experiments demonstrating net inward vs. outward proton fluxes during voltage ramps applied at various pHo (Figure 5B) appear to be a more appropriate method for tracking the direction of permeant ion movement.</p></disp-quote><p>The pHlourin imaging data corroborates data in Figure 1. It also provides a method for observing activity of OTOP channels with fluorometry which may be applicable to investigators working in vivo or with cells that are difficult to patch. As an example of this, note that (Parikh et al., Nature 2019) used imaging approaches to validate expression of OTOP2 in the colon; these investigators can now use alkalizing as well as acidifying stimuli to provide evidence for OTOP2 expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The fastest gating transition measured in Figure 4 is limited by solution exchange time, as the authors note, but it's not clear that solution exchange times were independently measured (i.e., by open-tip potential changes) using the same apparatus. Is the off-time constant for Otop2 (32 ms; Figure 4C, middle panel) substantially slower than the solution exchange time (if so, then the simplified scheme proposed in Figure 4A would not hold for Otop 2)?. Alternatively, the relatively slow current deactivation rate measured in Figure 4C might not be representative of the average behavior (as suggested by summary data shown in Figure 4D, middle panel). Furthermore, the kinetic schemes shown in Figure 4A do not consider that proton binding or unbinding from its putative binding site(s) might be rate-limiting for gating transitions; is this assumption supported by the experimental data?</p></disp-quote><p>We now included data that allows us to estimate the kinetics of the solution exchange in a realistic scenario – that is in whole-cell recording, using an open K<sup>+</sup> channel (KIR2.1) and changes in potassium concentrations (see above). Please note that there was some variation from cell to cell in the solution exchange time (as estimated with the K<sup>+</sup> channel), likely due to the placement of the cell in relation to the solution flow through the microcapillary tubes (three of the nine cells had similarly slow decay rates).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. What new information is gleaned from measuring slope conductance (Figure 5C)? The G vs. pHo graphs appear to have the same shape as I vs. pHo graphs in Figure 1C, suggesting that the two methods report the same pH-dependent gating transitions. Could channel numbers be estimated (i.e., via current variance analysis) to calculate unitary conductances for Otop 1-3?</p></disp-quote><p>We now more clearly explain that the slope conductance allows a measurement of gating near the neutral pH, where driving force is diminished and thus currents will not be detected. The fact that the conductance measurements and current measurements are related (but not the same) should be reassuring. Regarding estimating single-channel conductance with noise analysis, this is difficult for a channel that is gated by its permeant ion (usually this experiment is done by varying Po, by changing the voltage, while keeping the permeant ion concentration fixed). Moreover, while it would be interesting to know the single-channel conductance of the OTOPs, this would not change the interpretation of the data or the main conclusion of the paper.</p><p>New text reads “Slope conductance is related to the open probability (Po) of the channel by G = N*g*Po, where N is the number of channels and g is the single-channel conductance. Since the number of channels is constant, the slope conductance is a measure of Po*g. Importantly, this provides a measure of open probability, even where the holding potential is close to the equilibrium potential for H<sup>+</sup> and therefore currents are small (e.g. for stimuli at 8.0).” (lines 206-211).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Otop2/3 chimera data (Figure 6) are interesting, but leave open the question as to whether discrete titratable residues are responsible for low- vs. high-pH dependent gating. It would seem that the chimeras would help narrow the range of candidates, allowing the authors to focus on just a few. Additional data in single- or double-mutant channels would greatly enhance the strength of the manuscript. Why are no Otop1 chimeras shown?</p></disp-quote><p>Because we did not find one extracellular loop to be a key determinant of gating, and rather found that gating in response to changes in pH are distributed among the loops, our results do not allow us to hone in on single amino acid residues. Indeed, we do not believe such residues exist, but rather the “pH sensor” may consist of multiple titratable residues, not necessarily on the same linker. OTOP1 was not used in the chimera study because its functional properties are intermediate, so that it would be harder to resolve a change in gating in chimeras with OTOP2 or OTOP3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The reliability of AlphaFold-generated models is not independently established (i.e., during MD simulations), and it remains unclear whether the structural differences shown in Figure 8 are truly representative of physiologically meaningful differences in protein structure. How does the data in Figure 8 contribute to knowledge about the structural basis of pH-dependent gating in Otop channels? Do models identify specific titratable residues that could be experimentally tested (see item 6 above)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now tested the reliability of the Alphafold model by comparing them with the cryoEM structures, and they perform very well (Figure 8 – supplementary figure 1). The main take-home message from the comparison of the structures in Figure 8 is that they predict a large difference in the overall topology of the S5-6 linker between mOTOP2 and mOTOP3. We prefer to include these models in the manuscript, and let the reader decide if they are useful.</p></body></sub-article></article>
