cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibits the channel in a negative feedback mechanism. Cryogenic electron microscopy of rabbit RyR1 embedded in nanodiscs under partially inactivating Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions revealed an open and a closed-inactivated conformation. Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the high-affinity site engages the central and C-terminal domains into a block, which pries the S6 four-helix bundle open. Further rotation of this block pushes S6 toward the central axis, closing (inactivating) the channel. Main characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inactivated conformation are downward conformation of the cytoplasmic assembly and tightly knit subunit interface contributed by a fully occupied Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation site, two inter-subunit resolved lipids, and two salt bridges between the EF hand domain and the S2–S3 loop validated by disease-causing mutations. The structural insight illustrates the prior Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation prerequisite for Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivation and provides for a seamless transition from inactivated to closed conformations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rabbit</kwd><kwd>ryanodine receptor</kwd><kwd>inactivation</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>excitation-contraction coupling</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AR068431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samsó</surname><given-names>Montserrat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005202</institution-id><institution>Muscular Dystrophy Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MDA 352845</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samsó</surname><given-names>Montserrat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U24 GM116790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samsó</surname><given-names>Montserrat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HSSN261200800001E</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samsó</surname><given-names>Montserrat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryogenic electron microscopy of the ryanodine receptor 1 at near-atomic resolution reveals a calcium-inactivated conformation and uncovers a conserved lipid-binding site.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are complex intracellular, multidomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels that generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in cells of higher metazoans. They are pivotal for the contraction of skeletal and cardiac muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flucher and Franzini-Armstrong, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meissner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ríos, 2018</xref>), supporting a transient rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> from its resting level of ~100 nM, which is driven by a more than 1000-fold Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration gradient across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle [SR]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ziman et al., 2010</xref>). RyRs also play a role in neuron excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arias-Cavieres et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bouchard et al., 2003</xref>) and a myriad of other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathways such as differentiation, survival, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagur and Hajnóczky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tu et al., 2016</xref>). Dysregulation of the channel leads to several life-threatening diseases such as malignant hyperthermia, central core disease, sudden cardiac death, and lethal fetal akinesia deformation sequence syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alkhunaizi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCarthy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Priori et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tiso et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Treves et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The high-conductance RyR channel is strongly regulated, with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration having a biphasic effect on the probability of channel opening. Notably, both intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, RyRs and inositol P<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs), display a bell-shaped curve of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bezprozvanny et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meissner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meissner et al., 1986</xref>), characteristic of dual regulation by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In RyR, the ascendant branch of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence with half-maximal concentration (<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic>) of 1–5 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laver, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laver and Lamb, 1998</xref>) is mediated by a high-affinity cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">des Georges et al., 2016</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations above 100 μM, reached in the tight nanodomain surrounding the RyR upon its opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langer and Peskoff, 1996</xref>), inhibit the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu and Meissner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamaguchi, 2020</xref>), which rapidly enters a refractory period that has been proposed to prevent depletion of the SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bers, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ríos et al., 2008</xref>). Out of the three isoforms, the ‘skeletal muscle’ RyR1 isoform studied here is the most sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meissner, 2017</xref>), where inactivation-impairing mutations are known to cause malignant hyperthermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomez et al., 2016</xref>). While the inactivation of RyR by Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been characterized at the functional level, its underlying mechanism is unknown. Outstanding questions are whether high Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces an allosteric change in RyR that dampens the affinity of its activation site for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inactivated conformation is similar or distinct with respect to the closed conformation obtained in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>Here, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single-particle 3D reconstruction were applied to rabbit RyR1 embedded in nanodiscs under conditions of partial Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivation. Classification of two independent cryo-EM datasets revealed, in both cases, the coexistence of closed and open conformations, in agreement with functional experiments performed on the same channels using tritiated ryanodine binding. In the closed (inactivated) conformation, the resolution of the cryo-EM maps of nanodisc-embedded RyR1 enabled visualization of two lipids buried in a pocket of the transmembrane domain (TMD). To our knowledge, this is the first time that lipid is visualized in direct contact with the RyR. The open state, obtained by classification of the same dataset, represents the first RyR1 open conformation achieved in the absence of any extra activator other than the physiological activators, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ATP. We also carried out a control 3D reconstruction of RyR1 under the same conditions except for the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which yielded a closed channel. A comparison of the closed conformations of RyR1 at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> and of RyR1 in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> revealed unique features associated to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inactivation. Both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced activation and inactivation can be explained by a unifying mechanism that involves conformational rearrangements within the central region of RyR1. Thus, the 3D structures of closed, open, and inactivated RyR1 embedded in lipidic nanodisc provide a mechanistic framework to understand the biphasic response of RyR1 to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, two inter-subunit salt bridges appear to mediate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inactivated structural rearrangement, a finding supported by disease-causing mutations hindering such interactions and known to impair Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced inactivation of the RyR1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental design and functional validation of RyR1</title><p>Experimental conditions were fine-tuned to obtain the inactivated state. The channels were prepared in 2 mM free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a concentration that inactivates the channel. As RyR1 is constitutively bound to the sensitizing ATP in the muscle cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kushmerick et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meissner et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 1996</xref>), we included its non-hydrolyzable form, AMP-PCP (ACP), for its structural determination. In order to visualize the direct effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on RyR1’s conformation, FKBP12, a stabilizer of the cytoplasmic domain, was excluded. To determine the structure of RyR1 in a detergent-free, membrane-embedded natural state, RyR1 was reconstituted into membrane scaffold protein (MSP) 1E3D1 nanodiscs in the presence of phosphatidylcholine, an abundant phospholipid in membrane fraction preparations. As a control, we carried out cryo-EM and 3D reconstruction of RyR1 using identical buffer conditions and saturating ACP, and substituted Ca<sup>2+</sup> by 1 mM EGTA plus 1 mM EDTA (dataset denominated RyR1-ACP/EGTA). The channels were also reconstituted into nanodiscs in the presence of phosphatidylcholine.</p><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced activity profile of rabbit RyR1 in SR membranes was determined using the tritiated ryanodine binding assay, which reflects the probability of channel opening. The assay indicated RyR1 channel inactivation above 0.1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.6 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The presence of 2 mM ATP increased the efficacy of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced activation by approximately threefold at peak activation with similar potency for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced inactivation (IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.7 mM), in agreement with earlier results obtained in lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laver et al., 1995</xref>). We replicated the ryanodine-binding experiments over the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration range with 2 mM ACP. Maximal ryanodine binding was ~1.5-fold higher in the presence of ACP compared to ATP, and in this case slightly higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was necessary for the same degree of RyR1 inhibition, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value for Ca<sup>2+</sup> of 1.5 mM in the presence of ACP. Thus, under our experimental conditions of 2 mM free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, RyR1 inactivation was partial.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RyR1 at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration exhibits a mixture of open and inactivated conformations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ryanodine binding of rabbit skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) microsomes showing the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced inactivation of RyR1; activators ATP or ACP (2 mM) increased channel open probability by 3- and 4.5-fold, respectively.

rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>) of RyR1-ACP/EGTA indicated a closed pore with a radius constricting to 1 Å at the known hydrophobic gate Ile4937. In both RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> open A and B datasets, the hydrophobic gate as appraised by the pore profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) and as measured at the S6 helix backbone C<sub>α</sub> atoms (for more accurate measurement according to the lower resolution of the two datasets) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) had diameters of 15.8 Å and 16.0 Å, which indicates an open, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable pore in both cases. Pore dimensions are comparable to the pore diameter of RyR1 open structures obtained in the presence of activators such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PCB95 or Ca<sup>2+</sup>/caffeine/ATP (16.7 Å; PDB ID: 5TAL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">des Georges et al., 2016</xref>). The slightly narrower pore in our case could be attributed to the millimolar instead of submicromolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> in our case and/or extra activators in addition to endogenous physiological activators in earlier open structures.</p><p>The reconstructions corresponding to RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivated of the A and B datasets displayed a pore diameter at the Ile4937 gate of ~2 Å when considering the side chains, and 10.7 Å and 11.3 Å diameter, respectively, when measured at the backbone C<sub>α</sub> atoms, making it impermeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The position of the S6 backbone at Ile4937 is similar to our closed structure (<italic>r</italic> = 10.4 Å) and to RyR1-FKBP12/EGTA (<italic>r</italic> = 10.3 Å; PDB ID: 5TB0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">des Georges et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the channel pore was narrower than 1 Å at Gln4933 in RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>A</sub> inactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).</p><p>We previously established that the large square-shaped cytoplasmic shell of the RyR undergoes a conformational change upon opening. The periphery of its four quadrants tilts downward (toward the membrane), while its inner corner tilts away from it, rotating around a pivot point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Samsó et al., 2009</xref>). Such tilt can be quantified with the flexion angle, whereby negative angle (downward) correlates with opening, positive angle with closing, and absence of FKBP lowers the flexion angle of closed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steele and Samsó, 2019</xref>). In general, the approximate ranges of flexion angles are +1° to +2° for RyR1-FKBP12/EGTA closed, –1° to –3° for RyR1-EGTA closed, 0° to –3° for RyR1-FKBP12 ‘primed’ (with activating ligands and closed pore), and –1.5° to –5° for RyR1-Ca<sup>2+</sup> open with or without FKBP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iyer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steele and Samsó, 2019</xref>). Here, RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> open channels have flexion angles of –5.1° and –4.8° for the A and B datasets, within the expected range. The consensus 3D reconstruction of RyR1-ACP/EGTA had flexion angle of –2.2°, and its two classes had flexion angles of - 1.8° (24%) and –2.9° (76%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). But unexpectedly for closed-pore channels, RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivated datasets have a negative flexion angle (–4.6° and –4.2° for A and B datasets, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). As there was an indication of variability in the cytoplasmic shell of RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>A</sub>-inactivated dataset, we carried out fourfold symmetry expansion and focused classification for the monomer and obtained three subclasses, all showing downward motion: class 1 (22% of particles, 3.7 Å resolution, –3.6° flexion angle), class 2 (44% of particles, 3.3 Å resolution, –4.4° flexion angle), and class 3 (20% of particles, 3.8 Å resolution, –5.6° flexion angle) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such pronounced downward flexion angles in a closed channel cannot be explained just by the lack of FKBP12 in our preparations. The distinct conformation of RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivated, consisting of a closed pore and extreme-downward cytoplasmic assembly, prompted further analysis of the central region that joins the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Different arrangement of the central region in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inactivated, closed and open conformations</title><p>In RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> open, the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site was formed by Glu3967, Glu3893 (from the CD; residues 3668–4070), and Thr5001 (from the CTD (C-terminal domain); residues 4957–5037) as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">des Georges et al., 2016</xref>), and additionally Gln3970 in our case, which was visible up to 20σ.

Mutations Q3970E/K in RyR1 are implicated in central core disease and equivalent RyR2 mutations in cardiac arrhythmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chirasani et al., 2019</xref>), which highlights the important Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing role for this residue.</p><p>To understand how the fully occupied high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site (CD/CTD interface) led to a closed pore in RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivated, we looked for differences between RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> open and RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivated in the domains spanning from the CD/CTD interface to the pore. Specifically, we focused on domains around the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site (CD, EF hand, U-motif, CTD, and the C′ section of S6 or S6C′; domain boundaries indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which we term ‘central block.’ A comparison was done for dataset A after confirming similarity for the central block of 0.95 Å Cα root mean square deviation (RMSD) for the encompassed 672 resolved residues, between inactivated A and B datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The RMSD (Cα backbone) between individual domains from RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivated versus open was below 1.5 Å for all comparisons when the domains were pre-aligned pairwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>), indicating little conformational change. The N′ section of S6 was also included in the comparisons. Without pre-alignment, RMSD was higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating domain repositioning, the degree of which was estimated by subtracting the pre-aligned from the unaligned RMSDs. This yielded an average shift of ~2 Å per domain in going from RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> open to RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivated, except for S6N’ where the shift was ~0.7 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Comparing the same domains between RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivated and RyR1-ACP/EGTA (closed) yielded smaller repositioning with average shifts of ~1 Å, reflecting similarity in the domain’s locations, with the exception of the EF hand domain that undergoes an ~5 Å repositioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>When the central blocks were pre-aligned as a unit using their respective CD domains, and the individual domains were compared pairwise (CD-aligned; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), there was a good overlap between RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> open and RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivated (RMSD below 1.5 Å) except for S6N′ (3.8 Å), revealing the bend in the middle of S6 upon opening. In contrast, the CD-aligned RMSD of RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivated vs. RyR1-ACP/EGTA closed was higher, between 3 and 4 Å for the EF hands, U-motif, and CTD, and increases toward the C-terminus, 5 Å for S6C′ and almost 7 Å for S6N′ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, ‘CD-aligned’). This indicated that domains CD, EF hands, U-motif, S6C′, and CTD relocated together, and that the central block became more compact in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> acting at the CD/CTD interface. Taken together, these results imply that conformational changes from CD are transmitted to S6 only in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).</p><p>We analyzed how the central block may evolve from RyR1-ACP/EGTA (closed), to RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> open, to RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivated. Upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced opening, ‘engagement’ of CD and CTD by Ca<sup>2+</sup> tilts the CD out of plane (such that helix h tilts 3° inwards), while the CTD tilts up and outwards. This pulls the S6 helices (which are directly connected to the CTD) away from the pore axis, opening the ion pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). To reach the inactivated state, the central block tilts further (see rotation axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>) in a movement similar to pushing down the levers of a winged corkscrew, which pushes each S6 helix 2.5 Å toward the pore axis, closing the channel. Alpha helices within the CTD act as a lever coupling this out-of-plane rotation to S6C′ and as described further below, ATP reinforces the connection between CTD-S6C′ in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. These conformational changes involved in activation, inactivation, and transition from the inactivated to the closed state are shown in the morph among conformations in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref> and illustrated in the schematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Formation of salt bridges between EF hand domain and S2–S3 loop of the neighboring subunit in the inactivated state</title><p>The EF hand domain of RyR1, a candidate Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Du et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gomez and Yamaguchi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiong et al., 1998</xref>), did not show significant changes, with maximum Cα pre-aligned RMSD of 1.5 Å among the different states analyzed (closed, open, inactivated). The EF hand loops (residues 4081–4090, 4116–4123) were empty in our high Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions, which is consistent with the low affinity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to this site (K<sub>d</sub> 3.7 mM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiong et al., 1998</xref>). Nonetheless, the entire EF hand domain, which protrudes from the CD-C′, repositions noticeably during activation, with a 3.4° counterclockwise in-plane rotation (as seen from the cytoplasmic side), and 6.8° upward out-of-plane rotation. This movement brings the EF hand domain in closer proximity to the S2–S3 loop (cytoplasmic loop between S2 and S3 TMD helices; residues 4664–4786) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). With inactivation, an additional 1° counterclockwise rotation and 2.7° upward out-of-plane rotations define a physical limit to the counterclockwise motion, forming two salt bridges at this inter-subunit interface: Glu4075-Arg4736 and Lys4101-Asp4730, with their side chains within 3.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This interaction is critical to support inactivation, as demonstrated by the fact that MH/CCD mutations facing this interface F4732D, G4733E, and R4736W/Q, with the latter including the Arg directly involved in the salt bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), greatly reduced channel inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomez et al., 2016</xref>).

Analysis of protein-ligand interactions based on the atomic coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laskowski and Swindells, 2011</xref>) showed an increased network of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, and three predicted hydrogen bonds, that the inactivated conformation gained with respect to closed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, the nucleotide nestled deeper into the cavity in going from closed to open, and then to inactivated, increasing connectivity between S6C′ and CTD and reducing connectivity to the U-motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, ACP in RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>A</sub> inactivated acquired an interaction with the backbone carbonyl of His4983, a residue that participates in the C2H2 zinc motif that is central to the CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

These interactions may stabilize the luminal mouth of the channel, keeping the proper arrangement of the four SR luminal loops, as well as holding S6 through its conformational transitions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The goal of this work was to understand the mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced inactivation of RyR1 from a structural point of view. Although maximum inhibition occurred at 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we selected a concentration closer to the highest Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in physiological compartments, around 1–2 mM free Ca<sup>2+</sup> (in the SR lumen, cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomains, and extracellular medium). At 2 mM free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we discerned two classes within each of the two datasets, with their ion gate either in an open or a closed conformation on account of direct pore analysis. The concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> used, 2 mM, is near the IC<sub>50</sub> of this cation determined experimentally in the [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine-binding assays in the presence of ACP (the ATP analogue used in our studies), a concentration at which Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inactivated RyR1 conformations should coexist. Accordingly, we propose that they correspond with the open-pore and closed-pore conformations observed by cryo-EM, respectively.</p><p>Earlier 3D structures of RyR in the open state required synthetic activators such as caffeine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">des Georges et al., 2016</xref>), which by itself suffices to activate the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2018</xref>), or PCB95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Samsó et al., 2009</xref>). Our cryo-EM maps of RyR1 and lipid were obtained in the absence of any nonphysiological activator, and in a nanodisc environment. Given the lipidic environment provided by the nanodisc and the lack of exogenous activators, the structure of RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> open (reproduced in two independent datasets, A and B) obtained in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ACP provides an accurate account of the native open state. Overall, our open-state structure validates the previous RyR1 open structures obtained using exogenous activators.</p><p>The RyR1-ATP/caffeine/Ca<sup>2+</sup> dataset, obtained in the presence of 30 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 2 mM ATP, and 5 mM caffeine, also yielded a class with a closed pore, which was termed ‘primed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">des Georges et al., 2016</xref>). An apparently puzzling result is that our structure of RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivated is similar to the primed conformation. Both consist of an occupied Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site with a closed pore. The flexion angle of the primed structure (e.g., PDB ID: 5TAQ), around –3°, is also more akin to an open than a closed state. In these studies, caffeine was used as a means to attain the open state of the channel as caffeine sensitizes RyR1 to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and increases opening probability. However, caffeine also affects inactivation and shifts the entire bell-shaped curve of RyR1 activation as a function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations: from a maximum at 30 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, to well below 10 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of saturating caffeine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meissner et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, 30 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of caffeine is on the descending branch of the curve, which corresponds to partially inactivating conditions. According to this, the RyR1 channel conformation qualified as ‘primed’ in the earlier study is, very likely, inactivated and appears to correspond to the RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inactivated conformation characterized here.</p><p>Activation and inactivation appear to proceed under an integrated mechanism, where inactivation depends on prior activation. Both RyR1 open and inactivated conformations showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound at the high-affinity site in the CD/CTD interface, which joined these and their proximal domains (EF, U-motif, and S6C′) into a more rigid central block. In activation, CD and CTD rotate toward each other closing around the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion; the rotation of the CTD pulls S6C′ outwards, opening the pore. In inactivation, the central block rotates further into the arc initiated by the CD alone, which now pushes the S6 helices toward the central axis. The movement is similar to pushing down the levers of a winged corkscrew while pushing toward the central rod (see schematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), closing the channel in a distinctive conformation different from the EGTA-closed resting state. This state, with a closed pore and Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound to the activation site, can no longer be activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is the hallmark of an inactivated state.</p><p>Comparison of the open, closed, and inactivated conformations uncovers other novel features. A strong density connected to ACP under the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions, which we attribute to hydrated Ca<sup>2+</sup>, progressively supports more interactions with the CTD and S6, increasing cohesiveness of the central block (in the order inactivated &gt;open &gt;closed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which could help to explain the more robust Ca<sup>2+</sup>- induced inactivation reported in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sitsapesan and Williams, 2000</xref>). In this context, it is important to keep in mind that Mg<sup>2+</sup> at physiological concentration also binds to the nucleotide-binding pocket of RyR1, which we can confirm with our 3D reconstruction of RyR1-ACP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> (PDB ID: 7K0S). While in general ATP has a higher affinity for Mg<sup>2+</sup> than for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupancy of this site in the inactivated state is significant (RMSD 15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, it is difficult to predict how both cations may compete for the same site, something that will require further study. Besides the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site and the nucleotide-binding site, there were no other obvious densities in the resolved regions of the RyR1 structure that could account for a bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion, or clusters of negatively charged residues that could support further Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated conformational changes.</p><p>Mg<sup>2+</sup> is a potent inhibitor of RyR1, and a mechanism of Mg<sup>2+</sup> competition for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site was proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamb and Stephenson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meissner et al., 1986</xref>). We carried out a 3D reconstruction of RyR1-ACP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> (PDB ID: 7K0S) and found that, at a physiological concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site remains empty. Importantly, the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-inhibited conformation of RyR1 is clearly distinct from the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inactivated RyR1 and bears more resemblance to the EGTA-closed conformation.</p><p>The EF hand domain did not have Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound in the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> datasets in keeping with the low affinity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiong et al., 1998</xref>). However, this protruding domain, with its sequence between the CD and the U-motif, appears to play a distinctive role in inactivation that derives from its further anticlockwise and out-of-plane rotations with respect to the open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This conformation brings the EF hand domain in contact with the cytoplasmic loop between the S2 and S3 transmembrane helices of the neighboring subunit, forming two inter-subunit electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). One possible scenario is that the energy landscape of the open channel allows for overshoot of the opening motion, allowing interaction of the EF hand and S2–S3 loop domains by such salt bridges. These appear to stabilize the inactivated conformation by providing an extra linkage between subunits, and between the cytoplasmic assembly and TMD. Functional studies of MH mutations in the S2–S3 loop and EF hand domains identified a subset of mutations that altered RyR1 function by impairing Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomez et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, only this subset of residues, when mutated, would impair the inter-domain interactions that we identified, which supports the proposed role of the two salt bridges (Glu4075-Arg4736 and Lys4101-Asp4730) in stabilizing the inactivated state of RyR1.</p><p>In the TMD, owing to the nanodisc environment, two lipids in a crevice between S3/S4 of one subunit and S5/S6 of the neighboring subunit were resolved in the inactivated state. The hydrophobic nature of this crevice suggests that lipids may help to stabilize the TMD in the inactivated state. Although we could not resolve lipids in the closed state probably owing to the lower resolution of this 3D reconstruction, we observed lipids for the RyR2 isoform reconstituted in nanodiscs under closed-state conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iyer et al., 2020</xref>). The orientation of the two lipids in the two isoforms of RyR is identical. In the open state, the hydrophobic crevice is narrower, and Phe4808 of S4 adopts a different orientation that would clash with lipid 2, suggesting rearrangement in the open state. A similar lipid exclusion of bound lipid in the open channel was reported for the TRPV3 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singh et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the closed-state-dependent occupation of the TMD crevice by lipids could constitute a common feature among 6-TMD Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels.</p><p>Departure from α-helix geometry was also present in segments of S4 (near-3<sub>10</sub> helix and near-π-helix), and S5 and S6 (π-helix). In the case of S4, helical structural transitions correlate with the closed, open, and inactivated conformations. The dynamism of the transmembrane helices through the gating transitions appears to be supported by anchoring of Phe motifs in S4, S5, and S6 to lipids in the membrane. In addition, inter-subunit interactions including disulfide bridges inter-connect the 4860–4878 SR luminal loop, the P-loop, and S6N′ around the luminal mouth of the channel where the four protomers converge.</p><p>Functional studies employing single channels embedded in lipid bilayers show rapid channel inactivation following an RyR1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> release event. Therefore, after RyR1 opening, a refractory period is needed to relieve inactivation and recover the ability to activate again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laver and Lamb, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ríos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schiefer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sitsapesan and Williams, 2000</xref>). The 3D reconstructions reported here provide a structural basis for this refractoriness: we hypothesize that the 3D reconstructions reported here, combined with the time course of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, provide a mechanism for this refractoriness as follows. When RyR1 opens, Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in its surrounding nanodomain increases rapidly, and time from Ca<sup>2+</sup> release onset also increases. Both augment occupancy of the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site and the probability of a full conformational change of the CD/CTD block induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which in turn increases the successful formation of the inter-subunit salt bridges, ‘sealing’ the transition of the channel to the inactivated state. At this time, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inactivated state is in a distinctive locked closed conformation while the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site is still occupied. This renders this closed conformation unable to be activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> as long as Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupies the high-affinity site. In this way, Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation through the RyR1 provides negative feedback through the same binding site. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation is often observed in Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation pathways, probably to limit cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload that could be detrimental and life-threatening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomez et al., 2016</xref>). Together with previous investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gomez and Yamaguchi, 2014</xref>), we propose a structural mechanism for how naturally occurring mutations disturb RyR1 inactivation producing Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation and muscle disease. Overall, our study provides a structural basis to understand the transitions from the closed, to the open, and then to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inactivated state of the RyR1 at high resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The micrographs were low-pass filtered to 20 Å before automated particle picking. 2D class average templates for autopicking were generated by reference-free 2D classification of 1000 manually picked particles. Autopicked particles with ethane and hexagonal ice-contaminated areas were removed by visual inspection. Particle image sub-stacks required for the focused reconstructions residues 3668–5037, encompassing the CD, U-motif, TMD, and CTDs, were generated using a signal subtraction procedure employed in relion_project module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai et al., 2015</xref>). Particle image stacks of quarter sub-volumes of RyR1 corresponding to a single subunit were generated by particle subtraction following a symmetry expansion step with relion_particle_symmetry_expand tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scheres, 2016</xref>). Composite tetrameric maps were generated from the symmetry-expanded monomeric maps with Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) vop maximum tool. B-factor applied to the reconstructed maps was estimated with relion_postprocess. Analysis of the TMD was carried out on a focused map of the CD-TMD region. Unfiltered half maps obtained from the final 3D-refinement step in RELION 3.0 were further density modified with PHENIX.Resolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Terwilliger et al., 2020</xref>). The reported resolutions of the cryo-EM maps are based on FSC 0.143 criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scheres and Chen, 2012</xref>). Local resolution was estimated with ResMap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kucukelbir et al., 2014</xref>). Pixel size calibration of postprocessed maps was carried out using real space correlation metric of UCSF Chimera based on a published RyR1 cryo-EM map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">des Georges et al., 2016</xref>). Pixel size maxima of 1.07, 1.105, and 1.07 Å were obtained in RyR1-ACP/EGTA, RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>A</sub>, and RyR1-ACP/Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>B</sub> respectively.

The best resolved symmetry-expanded cryo-EM map for a single subunit in inactivated or open conformation was docked within a RyR1 monomer model with Chimera Fit in map tool. Local density fit of the RyR1 sequence was improved over an iterative process of amino acid fitting in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) alternated with real space refinement in PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonine et al., 2018</xref>). Four copies of the monomers were docked to the whole RyR1 reconstructions. Real space refinement of the tetrameric models was carried out with secondary structure and Ramachandran restraints. Further manual fitting of the CD, TMD, and CTD (3668–5037) of RyR1 was carried out in Coot.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is some ambiguity regarding the role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion in the nucleotide binding pocket in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation process. Is this site occupied by Ca<sup>2+</sup> under physiological conditions or does Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding prevail under those conditions? Is Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to this site necessary for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation? A control structure under the condition of physiological intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> could provide the information about the Mg<sup>2+</sup> occupancy at the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site and reveal the structural difference between the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound state and the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound state. The competition between these two types of divalent cations and the difference in their stability, occupancy, and duration in the binding site might underlie this transition. If not possible, an explanation should be provided, and a clearer discussion of the inactivation mechanism is warranted.</p><p>2) Provide a rationale/discussions for why lipid does not bind the closed channel and suggestions by Reviewer 2 to improve the quality of information provided in figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Lipids were found to bind in the transmembrane domain of RyR1 in the inactivated state, but not the open and closed states. The lack of binding to the open channel was rationalized by a narrower crevice and reorientation of two residues that would result in a steric clash with the lipids. A potential rationale for why lipid does not bind the closed channel is not provided or discussed. For completeness this point should be discussed for the closed RyR1 structure.</p><p>2.

Since the IC50 value for Ca<sup>2+</sup> was determined as 1.5 mM in the presence of ACP, why not use higher concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> such as 10 mM to obtain a structure representing a full inactivation state? Please add some explanation.</p><p>2. I am curious whether there are any other suspicious densities representing some new low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites under 2mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition. Through the new structure the authors excluded that the channel inactivation is due to the reduction of binding affinity of the high affinity site, but they did not provide a new hypothesis to explain how the increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] induces a conformational change from the open state to the inactivation state. In Figure S8, they hinted that the changes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupancy in the high-affinity site and the ATP site are associated with the inactivation. One possibility is that at lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding is dynamic and transient. Thus, there is not enough time for RyR to make a full transit from the open to the inactivation conformation. More discussion about the inactivation mechanism is needed.</p><p>3.

The coordination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> shown in Figure 2a is not clear in the current format, especially for the central panel. It is difficult to see the different conformations of Q3970 between the open and the inactivated states.

The RyR1-ACP/EGTA had insufficient resolution of to discern lipids, thus we did not mention about these in the closed state. But we have compelling evidence to believe that in fact, lipids bind to the closed channel, based on two reasons: 1/ a higher resolution 3D structure of RyR2 prepared under closed-state conditions shows lipids in an identical configuration, and 2/ close examination of residue’s orientation lining the crevice in RyR1-ACP/EGTA suggests that there should be no steric hindrance for lipid binding in RyR1 in the closed state. We take the identical conformation of lipids in RyR1-inactivated and RyR2-closed as an indication that lipid access characterizes both the closed and inactivated states, but not the open state, and that the binding site is conserved between the RyR1 and RyR2 isoforms. We have expanded on this concept by adding three extra panels to the corresponding supplementary figure (inactivated RyR1, closed RyR1 and closed RyR2 in the same orientation as open RyR1), and added the sentences transcribed below in results and discussion:</p><p>Results, Page 7: “We did not resolve lipids within the crevice of RyR1-ACP/EGTA, probably owing to the lower resolution of this reconstruction (4.30 Å), but examination of the crevice indicates no expected hindrance to lipid entry offered by residues Phe4808 and Tyr4912 in the closed state (Figure 5—figure supplement 1 D). Moreover, we resolved lipids in a higher-resolution (3.27 Å) 3D reconstruction of closed RyR reconstituted in lipids, in this case for the RyR2 isoform (Figure 5—figure supplement 1E; PDB ID: 6WOU (Iyer et al., 2020)). The analogous appearance of the lipid densities in the two isoforms is remarkable (three tubular densities with similar lengths and orientations; compare Figure 5—figure supplement 1, panels C and E), suggesting that the interaction of lipids with the RyR TMD crevice is conserved among isoforms, and characteristic of closed and inactivated states.”</p><p>Discussion, Page 10: “Although we could not resolve lipids in the closed state probably owing to the lower resolution of this 3D reconstruction, we observed lipids for the RyR2 isoform reconstituted in nanodiscs under closed state conditions (Iyer et al., 2020). The orientation of the two lipids in the two isoforms of RyR is identical.”</p><p>We also updated Table 1 to indicate that lipids are present in the closed state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion in the nucleotide binding pocket in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation process is somewhat vague and ambiguous. Is this site occupied by Ca<sup>2+</sup> under physiological conditions or does Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding prevail under those conditions? Is Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to this site necessary for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation? A clearer discussion of this point would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>The interplay between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> is indeed an important question. We carried out a structural determination of RyR1 in the presence of ACP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Under physiological concentrations (~1 mM free Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and as one would expect, Mg<sup>2+</sup> binds to the nucleotide site without producing significant conformational change when compared to RyR1-ACP/EGTA. It is difficult to predict the relative occupancy of this site when both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> are present in mM concentrations; further studies, using techniques other than cryo-EM, will be needed to answer this question.</p><p>We should also mention that at physiological concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the high affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site remains empty. Importantly, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inactivated and the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-inhibited RyR1s exhibit entirely different conformations. This is an extensive work and out of the scope of the current manuscript; we are preparing a manuscript describing the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. We have added the following paragraphs to address these points:</p><p>Discussion, Page 9: “In this context, it is important to keep in mind that Mg<sup>2+</sup> at physiological concentration also binds to the nucleotide binding pocket of RyR1, which we can confirm with our 3D reconstruction of RyR1-ACP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> (PDB ID: 7K0S; manuscript in preparation). While in general ATP has higher affinity for Mg<sup>2+</sup> than for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupancy of this site in the inactivated state is significant (RMSD 15; Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Thus, it is difficult to predict out how both cations may compete for the same site, something that will require further study.”</p><p>Page 10, discussion: “Mg<sup>2+</sup> is a potent inhibitor of RyR1, and a mechanism of Mg<sup>2+</sup> competition for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site was proposed (Lamb and Stephenson, 1991, Meissner et al., 1986). We carried out a 3D reconstruction of RyR1-ACP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> (PDB ID: 7K0S; manuscript in preparation) and found that, at a physiological concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the high affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site remains empty. Importantly, the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-inhibited conformation of RyR1 is clearly distinct from the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inactivated RyR1, and bearing resemblance to the EGTA-closed conformation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I suggest accepting this manuscript after a revision of the following problems.</p><p>1. Since the IC50 value for Ca<sup>2+</sup> was determined as 1.5 mM in the presence of ACP, why not use higher concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> such as 10 mM to obtain a structure representing a full inactivation state? Please add some explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We are concerned that 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a concentration that exceeds physiological conditions, and perhaps Ca<sup>2+</sup> could bind to sites that may not be physiological, or affect other parts of the structure. 1-2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the maximum found physiologically (SR store, cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomains, and extracellular medium). This is a good suggestion for a future experiment in order to test this hypothesis, which should be combined with careful data interpretation.</p><p>The Discussion now explains the rationale for selecting 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>:</p><p>Discussion, Page 8: “Although maximum inhibition occurred at 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we selected a concentration closer to the highest Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in physiological compartments, around 1-2 mM free Ca<sup>2+</sup> (in the SR lumen, cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomains, and extracellular medium).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I am curious whether there are any other suspicious densities representing some new low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites under 2mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition. Through the new structure the authors excluded that the channel inactivation is due to the reduction of binding affinity of the high affinity site, but they did not provide a new hypothesis to explain how the increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] induces a conformational change from the open state to the inactivation state. In Figure S8, they hinted that the changes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupancy in the high-affinity site and the ATP site are associated with the inactivation. One possibility is that at lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding is dynamic and transient. Thus, there is not enough time for RyR to make a full transit from the open to the inactivation conformation. More discussion about the inactivation mechanism is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We looked extensively at all the resolved regions of RyR for any extra density surrounded by negative charges and found none. This is mentioned in the manuscript:</p><p>Discussion, Page 10: “Besides the high affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site and the nucleotide binding site, there were no other obvious densities in the resolved regions of the RyR1 structure that could account for a bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion, or clusters of negatively charged residues that could support further Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated conformational changes.”</p><p>As the reviewer hints, the temporal dimension seems necessary to place the structural data in context and help to explain inactivation. During the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient, Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases rapidly since the moment when the channel opens, i.e., both Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and time from onset of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release increase in parallel. Thus, more time since channel opening may increase not only occupancy, but the probability of a full conformational change and successful formation of salt bridges, which would “seal” the transition of the channel to the inactivated conformation.</p><p>Page 11: “We hypothesize that the 3D reconstructions reported here, combined with the time course of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, provide a mechanism for this refractoriness as follows. When RyR opens, Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in its surrounding nanodomain increases rapidly, and time from Ca<sup>2+</sup> release onset also increases. Both augment occupancy of the high affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site and the probability of a full conformational change of the CD/CTD block induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which in turn increases the successful formation of the inter-subunit salt bridges, “sealing” the transition of the channel to the inactivated state.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
