Despite successful vaccination programs in the Americas and many developed countries, rubella remains endemic in many regions worldwide and outbreaks occur wherever population immunity is insufficient. Intense interest since rubella virus was first isolated in 1962 has advanced our understanding of clinical outcomes after infection disrupts key processes of fetal neurodevelopment. Yet it is still largely unknown which cell types in the developing brain are targeted. We show that in human brain slices, rubella virus predominantly infects microglia. This infection occurs in a heterogeneous population but not in a highly microglia-enriched monoculture in the absence of other cell types. By using an organoid-microglia model, we further demonstrate that rubella virus infection leads to a profound interferon response in non-microglial cells, including neurons and neural progenitor cells, and this response is attenuated by the presence of microglia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>brain organoid</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS123263</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nowakowski</surname><given-names>Tomasz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32MH118785</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Popova</surname><given-names>Galina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5F31NS108615</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Retallack</surname><given-names>Hanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFARI 491371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nowakowski</surname><given-names>Tomasz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Biohub</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intercampus Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nowakowski</surname><given-names>Tomasz</given-names></name><name><surname>DeRisi</surname><given-names>Joseph L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>NARSAD</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nowakowski</surname><given-names>Tomasz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schmidt Futures</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nowakowski</surname><given-names>Tomasz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010246</institution-id><institution>William K.

These comprise both viruses of longstanding concern like human cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus as well as emerging viruses like Zika virus. Yet our understanding of how direct viral infection and indirect inflammatory consequences affect fetal brain development is limited. This is true even for well-studied pathogens like rubella virus (RV), which is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus of the family Matonaviridae restricted to human transmission. Infection with RV typically causes a mild, self-limiting illness with a characteristic rash during childhood, often referred to as ‘German measles’. However, infection during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or a range of birth defects including congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The sequelae of congenital RV infection were first recognized in 1941 and although the first RV vaccines were licensed in 1969, an estimated 105,000 infants with CRS were born each year worldwide as of 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vynnycky et al., 2016</xref>). As of 2019, RV-containing vaccine coverage remains incomplete and inconsistent, with ongoing endemic transmission and reporting gaps primarily in the African, Eastern Mediterranean, and South-East Asian World Health Organization Regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">World Health Organization, 2020</xref>). Countries with RV-containing vaccine programs also remain susceptible to outbreaks, such as Japan and China, where outbreaks in 2013–14 and 2018–19 caused a twofold increase in reported rubella cases worldwide (26,033 total cases in 2018 vs 49,179 cases in 2019) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Plotkin, 2021</xref>) and included CRS the following year (423 total cases worldwide in 2019 vs 1252 cases in 2020) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>).</p><p>The most common features of CRS are congenital cataracts, sensorineural deafness, and cardiac defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banatvala and Brown, 2004</xref>). In addition, microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Munro et al., 1987</xref>), developmental delay and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chess, 1977</xref>), and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2001</xref>) are associated with the syndrome, but the pathophysiology of these neurological complications is not well described. To gain mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of CRS, it is essential to understand the tropism of the virus. Initial infection in the lymphoid tissues of the nasopharynx and upper respiratory tract leads to systemic viremia, with virus spread across the placenta and into nearly all fetal organs on post-mortem examination, primarily via infected mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). As for the fetal nervous system, RV was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue of fetuses and infants with CRS in studies from the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bellanti et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Esterly and Oppenheimer, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korones, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monif et al., 1965</xref>). However, further details of where RV might replicate in the brain are lacking. Autopsies in that early era revealed nonspecific gliosis and cerebral vessel degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rorke and Spiro, 1967</xref>). In limited pathology specimens from more recent outbreaks, RV RNA and antigens were identified in rare cells in the cortex and cerebellum presumed to be ‘nerve cells’ and neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lazar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Experimental infections of cells that might not accurately represent the primary cells in the developing brain have yielded little further insight. To complicate the matter, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) has been proposed as a cellular receptor for RV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cong et al., 2011</xref>), but it is exclusively expressed in oligodendrocytes in the human brain and therefore cannot explain infection in other cell populations. Thus, there is clear evidence for the presence of RV in the central nervous system in infants with CRS, but the identity of infected cell type(s) remains elusive.</p><p>Here, we address RV tropism in the human developing brain and other poorly understood molecular aspects of CRS. By combining primary human brain tissue with a variety of cell culture techniques, we show that microglia are the predominant cell type infected by RV. Furthermore, we show that diffusible factors from non-microglia cells are necessary to render microglia susceptible to RV. By using brain organoids supplemented with primary microglia, we demonstrate that RV infection leads to a robust interferon response and leads to dysregulation of multiple genes implicated in human brain development. Finally, we compared transcriptomic changes between microglia-transplanted and non-transplanted organoids and found that in the presence of microglia, interferon pathway upregulation following RV exposure is reduced.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RV infects microglia in the human developing brain</title><p>To investigate RV tropism in the human brain, cultured cortical slices from mid-gestation samples were infected with M33 RV, representing a laboratory strain originally derived from a clinical isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To confirm functional transcription and translation of the viral genome, a new reporter construct of RV designed to express GFP within the non-structural P150 gene was generated (RV-GFP, GenBank Accession OM816675, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and validated by GFP expression in Vero cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Moreover, the previously published viral entry factor MOG is not specific to microglia according to analysis of publicly available RNA and protein expression profiles of the human developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nowakowski et al., 2017</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=cortex-dev&amp;gene=MOG">https://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=cortex-dev&amp;gene=MOG</ext-link>) or human radial glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eze et al., 2021</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=early-brain&amp;gene=MOG">https://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=early-brain&amp;gene=MOG</ext-link>). Further, common components of the host cell membrane, such as sphingomyelin and cholesterol that appear to be essential for RV entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Otsuki et al., 2018</xref>), cannot explain viral tropism for microglia. Thus, to identify factors contributing to the relatively specific infection of microglia, RV infectivity was tested in monocultures of primary human microglia. Microglia from mid-gestation cortical brain samples were purified using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and then subsequently infected with RV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, RV infection of the microglia monoculture was negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To resolve this apparent paradox, we investigated whether microglia infectivity could be restored by the presence of other cell types, such as neurons or progenitor cells. Microglia were co-cultured with either neuronally enriched cultures (sorted with PSA-NCAM magnetic beads) or the glial component (flow-through that was depleted of both the CD11b-positive microglia cells and the PSA-NCAM-positive population). Both conditions together with mixed brain cells (flow-through from CD11b-depleted fraction; FT) successfully restored infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). In the pure microglial cultures, less than 2% of microglia were positive for RV capsid by immunostaining, but when different cell fractions were added to the culture (neuronal, glial, or mixed cultures), up to 60% of microglia had RV capsid immunopositivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Similar to the cortical brain slices, microglia represented the main cell type infected with RV in the mixed co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

This finding is consistent with RV tropism for monocytes in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perelygina et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van der Logt et al., 1980</xref>), and adds new information to the limited understanding of RV infection in the central nervous system. Supporting data from real-world infections including post-mortem specimens would be helpful to evaluate clinical strains. Tropism for microglia raises interesting questions about how and where RV persists in CRS, perhaps in brain tissue during the extended period of viral shedding, similar to other relatively immuno-privileged sites such as the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sugishita et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, we did not detect significant production of newly released virions, suggesting potential limitations of the culture system. Our findings also help contextualize CRS in comparison to congenital infections by other neurotropic viruses: human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and Zika virus, which target microglia directly; herpes simplex virus, which replicates poorly in microglia with cytopathic effect; and human cytomegalovirus, which causes microglia to produce antiviral cytokines without productive infection or cytopathic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lum et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Retallack et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rock et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Like some of these other viruses, we found that by establishing viral transcription and translation in microglia, RV elicits a strong interferon response in other cell types. It has been previously shown that the interferon response in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells can induce molecular and morphological changes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including neurite length and gene expression changes associated with schizophrenia and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Warre-Cornish et al., 2020</xref>). The interferon response is additionally associated with pathobiology in a range of congenital infections and interferonopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crow and Manel, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, in our preliminary experiments in organoids, where microglia do not develop under standard protocols, the RV-induced interferon response was attenuated in the presence of microglia, suggesting a possible protective role of microglia on other cell types. One limitation of the current work is the lack of information on transcriptional differences in microglia in the context of RV-exposed organoids due to the low number of recovered microglia in scRNAseq experiments. However, our data on molecular changes in neural progenitor cells and neurons, which likely produce the bulk of neurological symptoms seen in CRS, provide a valuable resource for future investigation of congenital viral infections. Our finding that the presence of microglia may reduce RV-associated transcriptional differences across different cell populations may also shed light on neuroimmune consequences of other congenital infections that coincide temporally with phases of microglia population expansion and reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Menassa et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, RV infection rates were largely influenced by the local cell environment, where proximity to non-microglia cells was necessary for RV infection of microglia. This requirement did not depend on cell-to-cell contact or cell type, thus eliminating phagocytosis of infected non-microglia cells or cell type-specific factors as the explanation for enhanced microglia infectivity. It is possible that the non-microglia supporting cells generate a reservoir of virus, though infection of non-microglia cells was limited and it is unclear how these virions would be different from virions in the viral stocks. More likely, diffusible factors contribute to RV infection of microglia, perhaps in conjunction with other ubiquitous cell surface elements. For instance, such factors could alter the activation state of microglia and thereby alter infectivity. Based on previous reports in 2D cell cultures and pathology examination of infected tissues, RV can establish infection in a variety of cell types, suggesting that the viral entry receptor is ubiquitously expressed, or that viral entry is facilitated by cell membrane components and their modifications. Indeed, membrane phospholipids and glycolipids have been shown to participate in viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mastromarino et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Otsuki et al., 2018</xref>). While our study did not directly address the molecular mechanisms of entry, our findings motivate new directions to advance our limited understanding of host factors needed for RV entry and infection. Moreover, our study highlights the importance of considering tissue complexity when studying viral infection in brain organoids. Complex, multi-lineage organoids can now be designed by incorporating vascular or immune cells into differentiation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cakir et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cakir et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Popova et al., 2021</xref>). We show that transcriptomic consequences of RV exposure are dependent on the presence of microglia in the organoid tissue environment, while future studies will be needed to determine the precise mechanisms that mediate this effect. One possibility is that microglia become the predominant cellular target of RV infection. Another possibility is microglia actively altering the microenvironment to modulate the antiviral response.</p><p>Clearly, efforts to eliminate RV worldwide through vaccination are a priority. However, our work on neuroimmune interactions in CRS may inform how early brain development goes awry in many contexts including prenatal infection with other neurotropic viruses, genetic conditions associated with dysregulated interferon responses such as Aicardi Goutières syndrome, and a variety of perturbations that activate common inflammatory pathways. Understanding the specific role of microglia may be key to unlocking the pathophysiology and developing therapies to prevent or mitigate damage.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Vero cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-1587) and maintained in DMEM (Thermo Fisher, 11965-118) with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher, 10438026), 10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher, 15630-080), and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher, 10378016).

They used brain slice and organoid-microglia experimental models to demonstrate that the main cell types targeted by rubella virus are microglia. The authors further show that infection results in augmented interferon responses in neighboring neuronal cells but not in the microglia themselves. The data convincingly support the conclusions, with major strengths being the sophisticated primary cell models and single-cell RNA-Seq used to pinpoint microglia as the main cellular targets of rubella virus, and neurons as the bystander targets of immune signaling. This study reveals a new cellular target that will have important implications for basic studies on rubella virus-host interactions and for the potential development of therapies or improved vaccines targeting this virus. As rubella virus is a pathogen of high concern during human pregnancy, this study is also relevant in the field of neonatal infectious diseases.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87696.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Maternal infection by Rubella virus (RV) early during pregnancy is a serious threat to the health of the fetus. It can cause brain malformation and later expose the newborn to a constellation of symptoms collectively named Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS). In this manuscript, the authors provide novel exciting findings on the pathophysiological mechanisms of RV infection during human brain development. By combining analyses of human fetal brain material and cerebral organoids, Popova and colleagues uncovered a selective tropism of RV for microglial cells. Their results suggest that the infection of microglia by RV relies on the presence of diffusible factors secreted by neighboring brain cells. Moreover, the authors showed that RV infection of human cerebral organoids leads to a strong interferon response and dysregulation of neurodevelopmental genes, which both may contribute to brain malformation. Altogether, these data shed some new light on the cellular tropism and the pathophysiological mechanisms triggered by RV infection in the developing brain. This study also raises the importance of using human cell-based models to further understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of CRS. Identifying the cellular and molecular targets of Rubella virus will also pave the way to develop therapies against CRS.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

As noted by reviewer 1, “This study reveals a new cellular target that will have important implications for basic studies on rubella virus-host interactions and for the potential development of therapies or improved vaccines targeting this virus. As the rubella virus is a pathogen of high concern during human pregnancy, this study also has important implications in the field of neonatal infectious diseases”.</p><p>Below, we provide responses (in blue) to specific critiques:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A weakness is that the current data do not provide information on the full replicative potential of the rubella virus in microglia, or whether the virus persists in this system.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response below.

Therefore, in primary human brain slices, there is a negligible amount of non-microglia macrophages. However, in culture microglia quickly lose their “homeostatic” identity, including P2RY12 expression, as quickly as six hours after ex vivo extraction (Gosselin et al., 2017; DOI: 10.1126/science.aal3222).</p><fig id="sa3fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>P2RY12 co-localizes with Iba1 in primary brain tissue from gestational week 17.5, including cells with more ameboid morphology (arrows).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87696-sa3-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>However, in organoids at 2 weeks post-RV exposure, we found microglia with both ameboid and more ramified morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa3fig7">Author response image 7</xref>). It would be challenging and beyond the scope of this manuscript to use morphology or Iba1 intensity levels to determine cause and effect as microglia activation state relates to RV infectivity (i.e. do activated microglia preferentially get infected with the virus, or do infected microglia become activated and upregulate Iba1 levels and change morphology).</p><fig id="sa3fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Examples of microglia with round (top) and ramified (bottom) morphology that co-localize with RV capsid staining.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87696-sa3-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding RV tropism in the 2D culture of microglia, some Iba- cells are infected by RV as they show capsid staining.

The low rate of Rubella virus infection in homogenous CD11b+ cell culture raises the question of whether the Rubella virus can infect microglia at a specific activation stage. It is also surprising that there is no infection of such cell population (also CD11b+) alone while cultured in 2D, as reported in figure 2. Why such a difference?</p></disp-quote><p>It is well established that culture of microglial cells isolated from brain tissue alters their molecular properties, which likely alters the cell surface protein composition. In the revised discussion, we include activation as a possible mechanism that will require further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Fig 4A-B, it is unclear whether organoids that are not engrafted with microglia get infected upon RV (with active viral replication) inoculation. If non-microglia-supplemented organoids are indeed infected and allow RV replication, this suggests that organoids might not be the ideal system to model human fetal brain RV infection at GW18-23.</p></disp-quote><p>We could not detect RV capsid in organoids without microglia after 72 hours of inoculation.

Is RV impacting cell fitness, proliferation, or neurodifferentiation?</p></disp-quote><p>This perceived difference is due to data presentation. Based on cell proportions, cells from organoids that were treated with microglia are more represented in the scRNAseq data, and this difference most likely comes from user-introduced imbalance in cell loading and possible cell losses during demultiplexing (Author response image 10, panel A).

If microglia is the predominant target for RV in the brain, why are microglia-free organoids susceptible to RV and who are the other cellular targets, whose infection leads to activation of interleukin pathway genes and dysregulation of brain developmental markers in selected subpopulations (RGCs, ENs..).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this point. We did not detect any appreciable RV genomic RNA in our published single cell data, nor did we identify RV capsid in the RV-exposed organoids without microglia. Our experiments on dissociated cell cultures show that a small population (~1-4%) of other cell types was positive for the RV capsid, including neuron-enriched and glial-enriched fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa3fig11">Author response image 11</xref>; Supplementary Figure 3C in current manuscript). We expect a similar proportion of non-microglia cells to be infected in the brain organoids. One possible explanation for the robust interferon response even in the absence of productive infection in other cell types is exposure to virions and virus-associated particles, including but not limited to viral RNA species, viral proteins, or even other components of the viral stocks made in Vero cells (which is a cell line that should not produce interferons, but may produce other unmeasured cytokines as a virally infected cell culture).</p><fig id="sa3fig11" position="float"><label>Author response image 11.</label><caption><title>Quantification of RV+ cells that are not microglia across different cell populations.</title><p>No statistically significant difference was detected in RV infectivity in cells cultured with or without microglia.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87696-sa3-fig11-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• QRT-PCR validations of some of these key brain targets should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that further validation of the predicted molecular changes downstream of Rubella exposure would be valuable. We have opted to validate IFITM3 and NOVA1 expression differences using immunostaining, and the results are consistent with our predictions from scRNAseq, and the data is presented in revised Figure 5 and 6 of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses of the paper: Overall, additional control experiments are needed to support the stated conclusions. Affinity chromatography is used to purify microglia and other cell types, but the overall cell enrichment is not quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer concern. However, affinity based enrichments rarely guarantee purity of the enrichment, and we do not believe accurate estimation of the purification purity would alter the biological interpretation of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In cell mixing experiments, the authors do not rule out the possibility that the added non- microglia cells also become infected, releasing additional infectious viruses. The finding that a diffusible factor is required for RV infection would be unusual if not unprecedented; therefore, additional data are required to support this claim and rule out other interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide quantification of non-microglia cells that are positive for RV capsid in the presence and absence of microglia. Small (~1-4%) of non-microglia cells get infected with the virus and can potentially release more of the virus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa3fig12">Author response image 12</xref>), but we do not know how this newly produced virus would be different from the one that was applied to the cells directly. To follow up our co-culture experiments, we wanted to exclude a possibility of microglia engulfing RV- infected cells in co-cultures, therefore we separated the two cell fractions by a liquid-permeable membrane (Figure 3 of the current manuscript). It is possible that factors secreted by other cell populations in the transwell assay experiments act on microglia cells to upregulate a yet unidentified receptor on microglia surface or other infection-dependent molecule rendering them infectable by the virus.</p><fig id="sa3fig12" position="float"><label>Author response image 12.</label><caption><title>Rubella infection in non-microglia cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of different cell types depleted of microglia.
