(PIKK) SMG1 monitors the progression of metazoan nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) by phosphorylating the RNA helicase UPF1. Previous work has shown that the activity of SMG1 is impaired by small molecule inhibitors, is reduced by the SMG1 interactors SMG8 and SMG9, and is downregulated by the so-called SMG1 insertion domain. However, the molecular basis for this complex regulatory network has remained elusive. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of human SMG1-9 and SMG1-8-9 complexes bound to either a SMG1 inhibitor or a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog at overall resolutions ranging from 2.8 to 3.6 Å. These structures reveal the basis with which a small molecule inhibitor preferentially targets SMG1 over other PIKKs. By comparison with our previously reported substrate-bound structure (Langer et al.,2020), we show that the SMG1 insertion domain can exert an autoinhibitory function by directly blocking the substrate-binding path as well as overall access to the SMG1 kinase active site. Together with biochemical analysis, our data indicate that SMG1 autoinhibition is stabilized by the presence of SMG8. Our results explain the specific inhibition of SMG1 by an ATP-competitive small molecule, provide insights into regulation of its kinase activity within the NMD pathway, and expand the understanding of PIKK regulatory mechanisms in general.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nonsense-mediated mRNA decay</kwd><kwd>PIKK</kwd><kwd>mRNA surveillance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langer</surname><given-names>Lukas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conti</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Advanced Investigator Grant EXORICO</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conti</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conti</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK1721</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conti</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB/TRR 237</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conti</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Exo-Adapt Center</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conti</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structures of human SMG1-9 and SMG1-8-9 reveal how the SMG1 kinase active site is targeted by a specific inhibitor and provide insights into the regulation of the SMG1-8-9 kinase complex in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a co-translational mRNA quality control pathway central to the detection and removal of mRNAs containing premature termination codons as well as to the regulation of many physiological transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurosaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karousis and Mühlemann, 2019</xref>). In metazoans, translation termination at a premature stop codon triggers phosphorylation of the RNA helicase UPF1, which then enables the recruitment of downstream effectors, in turn resulting in the degradation of the targeted mRNA by ribonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohnishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamashita, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chakrabarti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nicholson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Okada-Katsuhata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kashima et al., 2006</xref>). UPF1 phosphorylation is thus a crucial point in metazoan NMD; it occurs specifically at particular Ser-containing motifs and is mediated by the SMG1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denning et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamashita et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>SMG1 is a member of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family, which also includes the ATM, ATR, DNA-PKc, and mTOR kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keith and Schreiber, 1995</xref>). Despite the confounding name reflecting a possible evolutionary origin with a lipid kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keith and Schreiber, 1995</xref>), and in retrospect the ability of some PIKK family members to bind inositol-6-phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gat et al., 2019</xref>), all active PIKKs are Ser-Thr protein kinases. These large, multidomain enzymes share an overall similar architecture: a C-terminal catalytic module (comprising the so-called FAT, kinase, and FATC domains) and an N-terminal α-solenoid (that typically serves as a protein-protein interaction module). Indeed, PIKKs bind to and are regulated by interacting proteins, with which they form large and dynamic assemblies. In addition, some PIKKs contain an autoregulatory element, particularly in the variable region connecting the kinase and FATC domains, that is known as the PIKK-regulatory domain (PRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baretić and Williams, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Imseng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jansma and Hopfner, 2021</xref>). Finally, the kinase domains of PIKKs have been the target of numerous efforts in the development of specific inhibitors. Not surprisingly, given the central roles of these kinases in pathways surveilling cellular homeostasis, small molecules targeting specific PIKKs have been approved as therapeutics or are being evaluated in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janku et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Durant et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, the high conservation of the PIKK kinase domain has complicated efforts to develop inhibitors specifically targeting only a selected member of this family of enzymes. Structural data rationalizing the binding specificity of such compounds to PIKKs are still sparse in general and entirely missing for the SMG1 kinase.</p><p>In the case of SMG1, the two interacting factors SMG8 and SMG9 have been linked to dysregulated NMD and neurodevelopmental disorders in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alzahrani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shaheen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamashita et al., 2009</xref>). Previous cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies have revealed the molecular interactions that underpin the structure of the human SMG1-SMG8-SMG9 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>) and the determinants with which it recognizes and phosphorylates UPF1 peptides with specific Leu-Ser-Gln (LSQ) motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langer et al., 2020</xref>). SMG8 and SMG9 form an unusual G-domain heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The G-domain of SMG9 binds both the α-solenoid and the catalytic module of SMG1 while the G-domain of SMG8 engages only the α-solenoid, thus rationalizing biochemical studies pointing to the crucial role of SMG9 in enabling the incorporation of SMG8 into the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamashita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias-Palomo et al., 2011</xref>). In turn, SMG8 appears to have a direct regulatory function on SMG1, as its removal or C-terminal truncation results in hyper-activation of SMG1 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamashita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deniaud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias-Palomo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). However, the C-terminal domain of SMG8 remains poorly defined in all available cryo-EM reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langer et al., 2020</xref>), hindering a molecular understanding of its regulatory role.</p><p>Another portion of the complex reported to downregulate SMG1 kinase activity is the so-called insertion domain, a large 1200-residue region connecting the SMG1 kinase and FATC domains. Removal of the SMG1 insertion domain causes hyper-activation of the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deniaud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>), similarly to the effect reported for the PRDs of other PIKKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McMahon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edinger and Thompson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mordes et al., 2008</xref>). However, the SMG1 insertion domain shows no sequence similarity to the PRDs of other PIKKs and is remarkably larger in comparison. None of the current cryo-EM reconstructions of SMG1 or its complexes show density corresponding to the SMG1 insertion domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langer et al., 2020</xref>), and it is thus unclear how it regulates kinase activity.</p><p>Here, we used cryo-EM and biochemical approaches to study the basis with which SMG1 is specifically inhibited by a small molecule compound (SMG1<bold>i</bold>), and in doing so we also identified the molecular mechanisms with which SMG1 is downregulated by its own insertion domain in cis and SMG8 in trans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The compound SMG1i specifically inhibits SMG1 kinase activity in vitro</title><p>We set out to study the inhibitory mechanism of SMG1<bold>i</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), a small-molecule compound based on a pyrimidine derivative that has been reported to inhibit SMG1 catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gopalsamy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mino et al., 2019</xref>). We expressed and purified human wild-type SMG1-8-9 complex from piggyBac transposase generated HEK293T stable cell pools, essentially as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gat et al., 2019</xref>). We have previously shown that the use of a UPF1 peptide comprising the UPF1 phosphorylation site 1078 (UPF1-LSQ) allows monitoring of its specific phosphorylation by SMG1 over time using mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langer et al., 2020</xref>).

To avoid artifacts caused by ATP depletion, we performed an ATP titration and analyzed the end-point measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As a control, we used a UPF1-LDQ peptide in which we exchanged the phosphor-acceptor Ser1078 of UPF1-LSQ to aspartic acid. Next, we repeated end-point measurements under conditions of stable ATP concentration and increasing amounts of SMG1<bold>i</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In this assay, we observed a significant reduction of UPF1-LSQ phosphorylation when adding SMG1<bold>i</bold> at concentrations equimolar to the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To corroborate these results, we repeated titration of SMG1<bold>i</bold> under conditions of stable ATP concentration using a radioactivity-based phosphorylation assay and full-length UPF1 as a substrate.

The corresponding 3.6 Å reconstruction not only showed a similar mode of interaction of SMG1<bold>i</bold>, but also several features distinct from SMG1 in isolation and the SMG1-8-9 ternary complex. Globally, the α-solenoid of SMG1 rearranges, consistent with the notion of a stepwise compaction of SMG1 upon binding first SMG9 and then SMG8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Melero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Locally, the mode of interaction between SMG9 and the SMG1 α-solenoid differs between the two complexes. In the binary SMG1-9 complex, the portion of SMG9 that interacts with the N-terminal HEAT repeat helices of SMG1 changes conformation, exploiting part of a binding site that was occupied by a short N-terminal segment of SMG8 in the ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C, D and E</xref>). Indeed, two hydrophobic residues of SMG9 (Leu456 and Leu457) take the place normally reserved for two hydrophobic residues of SMG8 (Leu351 and Leu352) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4F and G</xref>). Hence, the conformation of the SMG9 segment observed in the SMG1-9 complex is incompatible with the binding of SMG8 to this part of SMG1. Importantly, the reconstruction of SMG1-9 showed no ordered density at the active site for the PRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and II</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which is in contrast to the ordered PRD density visualized in the SMG1<bold>i</bold>-bound SMG1-8-9 complex.</p><p>Next, we asked whether the autoinhibitory state of the SMG1 insertion domain in the SMG1-8-9 complex is due specifically to the presence of the SMG inhibitor or whether it is a more general feature. To address this question, we reconstituted purified wild-type SMG1-8-9 with an excess of AMPPNP (instead of SMG1<bold>i</bold>) and subjected the sample to a similar single-particle cryo-EM analysis routine. We obtained maps for SMG1-8-9 and SMG1-9 at overall resolutions of 2.8 Å and 3.1 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). Both reconstructions showed clear density for AMPPNP in the SMG1 active site. In the reconstruction of the ternary SMG1-8-9 complex, we observed an additional density at the substrate-binding site, in the same position as that observed when in the presence of SMG1<bold>i</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3III, IV</xref>). However, in the context of AMPPNP this additional density is less prominent and does not connect to the SMG1 kinase domain. It thus appears that the SMG1 inhibitor has a stabilizing effect on the autoinhibitory conformation of the SMG1 PRD. In the reconstruction of the binary SMG1-9 complex in the presence of AMPPNP, we observed no ordered density at the substrate-binding site, consistent with the reconstruction obtained in the presence of SMG1<bold>i</bold>. We concluded that the autoinhibitory conformation of the PRD in the insertion domain of SMG1 is connected to the presence of a nucleotide in the ATP-binding site and is stabilized by the presence of SMG8.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The SMG1 insertion domain can block overall access to the kinase active site and interacts with the SMG8 C-terminus</title><p>The findings above suggested a possible role for SMG8 in stabilizing an autoinhibited state of SMG1. Indeed, previous work implicated SMG8 and, in particular, its C-terminal domain in the downregulation of SMG1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias-Palomo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deniaud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamashita et al., 2009</xref>). SMG8 has a modular domain organization: the N-terminal G-domain is followed by a helical stalk that protrudes into solvent with well-defined density, but the remaining C-terminal region (amounting to about 45% of the molecule) is flexible and poorly resolved in the published cryo-EM studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langer et al., 2020</xref>). By further processing of the SMG1<bold>i</bold>-bound SMG1-8-9 data, we could achieve improved density for the C-terminal domain of SMG8, showing a knob-like feature directly connected to the end of the stalk and in turn connecting to a larger globular mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Concurrently, we observed an additional density extending from the location of the PRD that we attributed to the SMG1 insertion domain (see below). On one side, this density wraps along the catalytic module of SMG1, occludes the access to the kinase active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and reaches toward the IP<sub>6</sub>-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>). On the other side, the density projects into solvent and approaches the globular SMG8 C-terminal region. Although the low resolution of this part of the map did not allow model building, the close proximity suggested a physical contact between the SMG1 insertion domain and the SMG8 C-terminal domain.

Upon treatment of purified SMG1-8-9 with Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS<sup>3</sup>), we detected intra and inter cross-links consistent with parts of the complex for which an atomic model was available and measuring well within the expected range of distance for BS<sup>3</sup> cross-links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). We also observed reproducible intra cross-links between the end of the SMG1 insertion and the catalytic module, in particular the FAT (residues 823–1938) and kinase (residues 2080–2422) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). These cross-links mapped in close proximity to the aforementioned density extending from the PRD. We thus attribute this density to the C-terminus of the SMG1 insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B and C</xref>). By combining our low-resolution EM density and our cross-linking data with an AlphaFold prediction of SMG8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>), we were able to produce a more complete model of SMG1-8-9, now containing large parts of the SMG8 C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Importantly, we detected inter cross-links between the SMG1 insertion domain and the SMG8 C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), consistent with the proximity of the EM densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and previously reported XL-MS data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deniaud et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested whether these parts of the complex can interact directly in biochemical assays with recombinant proteins.

Since the structural analysis is indicative of a dynamic or weak contact, we performed pull-down assays in low-salt conditions. We observed that the SMG1 insertion domain indeed co-precipitated the SMG8 C-terminus in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As a control, an unrelated TwinStrep-tagged protein (PP7 coat protein) did not pull down SMG8 C-terminus under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

We showed that this compound binds to the ATP-binding site within the kinase active site. By comparison with structural data of related kinases, we identified two functional groups within the small molecule that possibly confer specificity to SMG1. Using the SMG1-related mTOR kinase as an example, we confirmed the specific action of the inhibitor biochemically.</p><p>In addition to the SMG1 inhibitor, we observed density for the N-terminal part of the SMG1 insertion domain in the SMG1-8-9 reconstruction. This part of the insertion domain acts as a PRD and occupied the substrate-binding path within the SMG1 active site. Consistent with data for other PIKKs, a PRD within the SMG1 insertion domain can therefore restrict access to the kinase active site.</p><p>The structure of an SMG1<bold>i</bold>-bound SMG1-9 complex reconstructed from the same data set as SMG1<bold>i</bold>-bound SMG1-8-9 did not show ordered density for the SMG1 PRD in the SMG1 active site. This suggested that an interaction between the SMG1 insertion and SMG8 was important for stabilizing the autoinhibited state of the complex. Consistently, our biochemical analysis indicated a direct physical link between parts of the SMG1 insertion domain and the C-terminal domain of SMG8. While autoinhibition was not observed in previously published apo-structures, our reconstructions of SMG1-9 and SMG1-8-9 bound to AMPPNP showed that blockage of the substrate-binding path was also possible when the SMG1-8-9 complex active site was bound to a nucleotide. Accordingly, the described autoinhibition was not a phenomenon limited to the inhibitor-bound structures. We conclude that at least two layers of regulation of SMG1 kinase activity exist: first, access to the SMG1 active site can be restricted in cis by a PRD within the SMG1 insertion domain. Second, this autoinhibition is stabilized in trans by the SMG8 C-terminus.</p><p>How is the autoinhibited complex activated? The position of the SMG1 insertion domain in the inhibitor-bound SMG1-8-9 complex reconstruction raised the possibility that the autoinhibited complex might not be able to interact with its substrate, UPF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3I, III</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we incubated TwinStrep-tagged SMG1-8-9 with increasing concentrations of SMG1<bold>i</bold> before adding UPF1 and performed a pull-down experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The efficiency of UPF1 co-precipitation was unaffected by the presence of SMG1<bold>i</bold>, suggesting that either UPF1 can overcome blockage of the SMG1 active site by the SMG1 insertion domain or has secondary binding sites independent of the observed SMG1 autoinhibition. Indeed, superposition of the autoinhibited complex reconstruction with a previously reported negative-stain map of a cross-linked UPF1-bound SMG1-8-9 complex raised the possibility that UPF1-binding and SMG1 autoinhibition might be able to occur in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>). An alternative explanation would be that optimal positioning of UPF1 with respect to the SMG1 kinase will allow the unstructured N- and C-terminal ends of UPF1 to efficiently compete with the SMG1 insertion domain for binding to the SMG1 active site in vivo. This would be mimicked by the high protein concentrations used in in vitro assays (such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p><p>Whether SMG8 or an SMG8-9 complex dissociates from SMG1 at any point in the kinases’ catalytic cycle during NMD in vivo is an outstanding question. Early biochemical experiments have suggested that SMG8 plays a crucial role in recruiting SMG1 complex to the NMD-competent messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamashita et al., 2009</xref>). Given that the SMG1-8-9 complex actively phosphorylated UPF1 in in vitro experiments using purified proteins and our observation that SMG1<bold>i</bold> binding did not impair the interaction of SMG1 with UPF1, it is tempting to speculate that UPF1 itself might be sufficient to overcome the effect of SMG8 on stabilizing SMG1 autoinhibition within an SMG1-8-9 complex. In this model, nucleotide binding and kinase activation could occur in two distinct steps during NMD: upon ATP binding, the kinase complex would adopt an autoinhibited conformation and only be licensed for specific phosphorylation of its target by the substrate itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, autophosphorylation of the kinase complex may play a crucial role in kinase activation.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model of SMG1 kinase regulation.</title><p>Structural and biochemical data suggest different layers of regulation on SMG1 kinase activity.

The elution was vacuum dried.</p><p>Enriched peptides were loaded onto a 30 cm analytical column (inner diameter: 75 µm; packed in-house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 µm beads, Dr. Maisch GmbH) by the Thermo Easy-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with buffer A (0.1% (v/v) Formic acid) at 400 nl/min. The analytical column was heated to 60°C. Using the nanoelectrospray interface, eluting peptides were sprayed into the benchtop Orbitrap Q Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hosp et al., 2015</xref>). As gradient, the following steps were programmed with increasing addition of buffer B (80% Acetonitrile, 0.1% Formic acid): linear increase from 8% to 30% over 60 min, followed by a linear increase to 60% over 5 min, a linear increase to 95% over the next 5 min, and finally maintenance at 95% for another 5 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode with survey scans from <italic>m/z</italic> 300to 1650 Th (resolution of 60k at <italic>m/z</italic>=200 Th), and up to 15 of the most abundant precursors were selected and fragmented using stepped Higher-energy C-trap Dissociation (HCD with a normalized collision energy of value of 19, 27, and 35). The MS2 spectra were recorded with dynamic <italic>m/z</italic> range (resolution of 30k at <italic>m/z</italic>=200 Th). AGC target for MS1 and MS2 scans were set to 3×10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup>, respectively, within a maximum injection time of 100 and 60 ms for the MS1 and MS2 scans, respectively. Charge state 2 was excluded from fragmentation to enrich the fragmentation scans for cross-linked peptide precursors.</p><p>The acquired raw data were processed using Proteome Discoverer (version 2.5.0.400) with the XlinkX/PD nodes integrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klykov et al., 2018</xref>). To identify the crosslinked peptide pairs, a database search was performed against a FASTA containing the sequences of the proteins under investigation. DSS was set as a crosslinker. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification and methionine oxidation and protein N-term acetylation were set as dynamic modifications. Trypsin/P was specified as protease and up to two missed cleavages were allowed. Furthermore, identifications were only accepted with a minimal score of 40 and a minimal delta score of 4. Otherwise, standard settings were applied. Filtering at 1 % false discovery rate (FDR) at peptide level was applied through the XlinkX Validator node with setting simple.

The nominal magnification during data collection for both data sets was 105,000×, corresponding to a pixel size of 0.8512 Å at the specimen level. The SMG1<bold>i</bold> sample was imaged with a total exposure of 89.32 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> evenly spread over 4 s and 40 frames. The AMPPNP sample was imaged with a total exposure of 60.99 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> evenly spread over 5.7 s and 40 frames at CDS mode.

After two rounds of reference-free 2D classification, particles were imported to CryoSPARC v2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>) for further processing. After additional sorting in 2D, particles were iteratively classified in 3D to separate SMG1-8-9 and SMG1-9. Particles were distributed over multiple batches for all classification steps. To visualize highly flexible parts of the SMG1 insertion domain in the SMG1<bold>i</bold>-bound complex, the particle stack containing SMG1-8-9 data was submitted to 3D variability analysis into six clusters. Filtering according to local resolution was employed to better visualize parts of the complex with different resolutions after refinement. Following Ctf refinement, a mask was generated based on the more rigid SMG1 body to focus refinement of the cleaned SMG1<bold>i</bold>-bound SMG1-8-9 particles on the inhibitor-bound SMG1 active site.

We removed all parts with a per-residue confidence score below 50 and superimposed the prediction with our EM data-derived model for the SMG8 N-terminal half (residues 4–559) using Coot. After fusing the roughly positioned AlphaFold-predicted SMG8 C-terminal half (560–991) to our SMG1<bold>i</bold>-bound SMG-1-8-9 model (PDB identifier: 7PW4), we rigid body-fitted the SMG8 C-terminus into the EM density (resulting in PDB 7PW5). It is worth noting that the somewhat different orientation of the SMG8 C-terminal domain with respect to the N-terminal part of the molecule observed when comparing the EM density to the AlphaFold model before rigid body-fitting is in agreement with the flexibility of this domain generally present in the cryo-EM data.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Reviewing/Senior Editor (Philip Cole). The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kacper B Rogala (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Although there are a substantial number of points listed below, the vast majority relate to manuscript presentation and writing issues rather than requested additional experimentation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. A significant concern with the manuscript is that there is no clear way to test the autoinhibition model. UPF1 binding itself is proposed to relieve autoinhibition, meaning that activity towards UPF1 would not be a readout of autoinhibition. One possible prediction of the model would be that activity of the complex toward a short peptide including the UPF1 phosphorylation sites should be low due to occlusion of the SMG1 catalytic cleft. Addition of an UPF1 truncation mutant lacking the C-terminal tail would be expected to activate the SMG1 complex toward phosphorylation of a peptide substrate. The SMG1-SMG9 dimer is modestly more active on UPF1 than the full SMG1-SMG8-SMG9 heterotrimer (see the Deniaud et al. paper cited in the text). However, using a peptide substrate, that difference in activity would be expected to us to be much larger. It would make the model more powerful if such ancillary enzymatic evidence were included.</p><p>2. Figure 1. Phosphorylation assays presented in this figure are missing an important control. And that is the reaction without the enzymes – for both SMG1 and mTOR. It is difficult to judge the extent of SMG1i inhibition if we cannot see the baseline with and without the enzymes. In general, monitoring of the AKT1 peptide phosphorylation with this method seems rather noisy, and this reviewer is unsure how relevant that specificity data is in the absence of proper controls. The same method presented in the authors' earlier paper (Gat et al., 2019, PMID: 31792449) seemed to be of higher quality.</p><p>3. Figure 1 is presented as providing evidence that SMG1i is selective for SMG1 over mTOR, and that it works by an ATP competitive mechanism. None of the experiments in Figure 1 or the associated supplementary figures actually investigate whether the compound is ATP-competitive; this was established later by the cryo-EM structure. It is worth noting that a non-selective analog bound at the ATP binding site when co-crystallized with PI3K-γ (reported in the paper that described SMG1i). Furthermore, in that original work, SMG1i was reported to be &gt;400-fold selective for SMG1 over mTOR, and it was also tested against a number of other kinases. From this standpoint Figure 1 should be acknowledged as being confirmatory to that prior work rather than a new result, and it could be moved to a supplemental figure. There are also some technical issues with those experiments – the mTOR kinase assays used for replicates cover only a narrow concentration range and have high background; it's not clear why the full dose response shown in Figure 1 S2A wasn't simply repeated three times. The SMG1 activity assays were also performed at high kinase concentration, so the true potency of the compound cannot be determined. The original paper reported sub-nM inhibition of SMG1.</p><p>4. PRD density in the apo vs inhibitor/AMPPNP-bound mode of the SMG1-8-9 complex. The authors do not seem to offer any visual cues or thoughts to better understand why the PRD density would only rigidify in the presence of the inhibitor or ATP analogs. And within that group – why would the PRD density be more pronounced in the presence of the inhibitor versus the ATP analog? Are there any conformational changes in the SMG1-8-9 complex upon binding of the inhibitor/AMPPNP? Can the authors trace any specific residue/domain movement and rationalize this observation?</p><p>5. Methods. For the references cited in the methods, please use the primary articles on which the technique is developed rather than a subsequent paper that cites the original reference.</p><p>6. The presented structural data is clearly of high quality but additional figure panels covering the process of cryo-EM data processing in greater detail should be produced:</p><p>a. Representative micrograph of collected cryo-EM data.</p><p>b. 2D classes of their cryo-EM data.</p><p>c. Angular distribution plot for each deposited reconstruction in addition to their 3D FSC plot.</p><p>d. FSC plots for map vs. model.</p><p>7. Crosslinking-MS analysis on the SMG1-SMG8-SMG9 complex (as well as the complex including UPF1) was also previously done, and provided largely similar results to those reported in Figure 4B. Though not the intention of the authors, the use of bold lines for the highlighted crosslinks suggests that those specific interactions were identified at higher confidence or provided a higher signal; just keeping with the color scheme would be sufficient for the purpose of drawing attention to those crosslinks. In addition to the groove that approaches the IP6 binding site where additional density is seen in the inhibitor bound complex, the C-terminus of the insert region also crosslinks at multiple points within the catalytic domain itself. Can the authors reconcile the observed crosslinks to both regions?<italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Claims/Observations:</p><p>(1) The SMG1i compound is specific to SMG1 because it engages unique residues in the active site (unique to SMG1 versus other PIKKs). Beyond the structural rationale provided by solid cryo-EM work, the authors attempted to strengthen this claim with in vitro kinase assays.</p><p>This reviewer believes that this data is of high value, but some controls for the in vitro kinase assays are missing and should be addressed to support this claim. Please see the detailed comments section.</p><p>(2) Structural rationale for the autoinhibitory function of the insertion domain of SMG1 and the C-terminal section of SMG8 – on the overall activity of the SMG1-8-9 complex.</p><p>Putative density belonging to the insertion domain (specifically its N-terminal section) is found in the active site of SMG1 – occluding the previously-mapped SQ substrate binding site, and explaining the previously-reported autoinhibitory function of this domain. Corresponding density has been observed in other PIKKs, and is normally referred to as PRD for PIKK regulatory domain. The authors were unable to unambiguously assign the amino-acid register for the putative PRD density due to its rather weak resolution. Their cross-linking mass spectrometry work confirmed that the insertion domain makes many contacts with the FATKIN domain of SMG1, and an extra few cross-links with the C-terminus of SMG8. in vitro binding assays with purified SMG1-insertion-domain and SMG8-C-terminus confirmed direct binding between these two regions of the complex, offering an explanation as to why the PRD section of the insertion domain is only rigidified in the context of the full SMG1-8-9 complex, and not the sub-complex lacking SMG8. They conclude that SMG8 stabilizes the PRD inside the SMG1 substrate binding site.</p><p>Given the wide range of methods applied to support this claim, this reviewer finds the evidence rather compelling. There are some points that should be addressed – either to clarify some statements or to expand on them. Please see the detailed comments section.<italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Langer et al., present cryo-EM reconstructions of the PIKK family SMG1-9 and SMG1-8-9 kinase complexes bound to a SMG1 inhibitor or to an ATP analogue at sub-4 Å resolutions. Together, these structures show (1) the molecular interactions that define the specificity of a SMG inhibitor and (2) reveal an autoinhibitory function of the SMG1 insertion domain. Additional biochemical and cross-linking mass spectrometry work shows interactions between the SMG1 insertion domain and the SMG8 C-terminus. It clarifies how the SMG1 insertion domain and the SMG8 mediate autoinhibition of SMG1. Additionally, the authors show that the employed inhibitor has a high specificity for the inhibition of SMG1 in vitro.</p><p>The manuscript is written very clearly. The authors' data is overall well-presented and represents the first structure of SMG1 bound to an inhibitor. The presented structural data is of high quality and appears plausible. Together, the authors' claims are supported by the presented data but additional figures and expansion of the methods section to present their cryo-EM data analysis in greater detail will increase overall clarity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The SMG1-SMG8-SMG9 kinase complex phosphorylates the protein UPF1 to promote nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, an essential co-translational quality control mechanism for degradation of messages with premature stop codons. This manuscript from Langer et al. describes cryo-EM structures of the SMG1-SMG8-SMG9 complex bound to a selective ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor. The structure provides a rationale for why the compound is selective for SMG1 over related kinases such as mTOR and DNA-PK, which should prove useful in furthering inhibitor design and development for this class of kinases. Intriguingly, the inhibitor bound structure revealed additional density absent from prior reconstructions of the complex arising from am &quot;SMG1 insertion region&quot; C-terminal to its catalytic domain. While this density could not be fit to an atomic model, a portion of it occludes the catalytic cleft, suggesting that it mediates cis-autoinhibitory regulation of the kinase. Furthermore, this region appears to contact the SMG8 subunit, and the added density is absent from cryo-EM reconstructions of an SMG1-SMG9 complex lacking SMG8. Both the SMG1 intramolecular contacts and SMG1-SMG8 intermolecular contacts were supported by crosslinking-mass spectrometry analysis, which appeared largely similar to a previously reported analysis using the same method. These observations support a model by which SMG8, through direct interactions with the SMG1 insertion region, has a key role in autoinhibition of the kinase. These studies are important for the field in that how the SMG1 complex is regulated has previously been obscure. A weakness of the study is this structural hypothesis could not be independently tested. Indeed, given that the SMG1 insertion region was not observed at high resolution, it would not be possible to design mutants to disrupt key interactions and examine their impact on SMG1 kinase activity. The authors hypothesize that these autoinhibitory interactions are relieved by substrate binding, which is consistent with prior cryo-EM characterization of the SMG1-SMG8-SMG9-UPF1 complex. However, this potential substrate activation mechanism, while plausible, is not directly addressed in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72353.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

It would make the model more powerful if such ancillary enzymatic evidence were included.</p></disp-quote><p>This point addresses two different albeit connected aspects: autoinhibition and activation.</p><p>The auto-inhibition mechanism is the focus of this manuscript.</p><p>There have been several papers suggesting the presence of negative regulation based on biochemical data but the molecular mechanism for these observation had remained unclear. For example, a negative regulatory effect of the SMG1 insertion domain has been reported in Deniaud et al., 2015 and in Zhu et al., 2019. Our observation from the cryo-EM analyses that the SMG1 insertion domain directly blocks the substrate binding path within the SMG1 active site rationalizes the negative regulation observed in biochemical data. In addition, autoinhibition by the PRD/insertion domain has been observed structurally in related kinases (see for example Stakyte et al., 2021 (human ATM) or Chen et al., 2020 (human DNA-PKc)). Furthermore, Arias-Palomo et al., 2011, Deniaud et al., 2015 and Zhu at al., 2019 described a negative regulatory effect of SMG8. Our structural data rationalize this effect: e.g. the dependency of SMG1 autoinhibition on the presence of SMG8 in the complex, the observation of close proximity of the SMG1 insertion domain and the SMG8 C-terminus as well as our discovery of a direct interaction between these parts of the complex via pull-downs using purified proteins. Overall, this allows us to integrate the existing biochemical data into a model for the concerted action of the SMG1 insertion domain and the SMG8 C-terminus to induce an autoinhibited state of the SMG1-8-9 kinase complex.</p><p>The activation mechanism is a very interesting aspect and we agree with the Reviewer/s that this remains unclear. However, the activation mechanism is not the focus of this manuscript. We briefly discuss the possible relationship between autoinhibition and activation at the end of the manuscript, to point out unanswered questions and future avenues of research.</p><p>We are grateful for the suggestions of the Reviewer/s on how to tackle the activation aspect of the process, though there are technical issues that complicate such experiments.</p><p>1) Our data indicate that ideal phosphorylation motifs bind the SMG1 active site more tightly than the SMG1 insertion domain (high resolution observed for substrate peptide in Langer et al., 2020, as compared to medium resolution observed for SMG1 insertion domain in the current manuscript). Therefore, depending on its concentration relative to the kinase, an ideal peptide will be able to compete with the insertion domain autoinhibition in this in vitro setup without any additional activation. Higher peptide concentrations might simply mimic the effect of optimal positioning of the UPF1 N- and C-terminal regions with respect to the SMG1 kinase in an in vivo NMD complex, independent of direct interaction of SMG1-8-9 and UPF1. We have included an additional sentence to our discussion to stress this possibility:</p><p>&quot;An alternative explanation would be that optimal positioning of UPF1 with respect to the SMG1 kinase in vivo will allow the unstructured N- and C-terminal ends of UPF1 to efficiently compete with the SMG1 insertion domain for binding to the SMG1 active site. This would be mimicked by the high protein concentration used in in vitro assays (such as Figure 4 Supp. 3 B)&quot;.</p><p>2) Our SMG1-8-9 purifications contain a mixture of SMG1-8-9 and SMG1-9 complexes, as evidenced by the reconstructions reported in the current manuscript and we were so far not able to separate these subpopulations during purification. The presence of a significant amount of SMG1-9 in our purifications means that any effect observable in the assay suggested by the Reviewer/s would be greatly diluted. Further aggravating this issue, overexpression of only SMG1 and SMG9, but not SMG8, in HEK293T cells results in preparations that still contain endogenous SMG8 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>SDS-PAGE analysis of complexes purified from cells transfected to stably express either TwinStrep-SMG1-8-9 or TwinStrep-SMG1-9, as indicated.</title><p>Note the co-purification of endogenous SMG8 from the cell line not transfected with SMG8.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72353-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In general, understanding of how SMG1-8-9 activation is regulated will require insights into the molecular interplay between SMG1-8-9, UPF1, other NMD factors and a terminating ribosome.

We chose to highlight the residues shown in Figure 4 C since this is where the additional density is the strongest and it allows us to illustrate the proximity to the IP6 binding site.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Residues of the SMG1 kinase domain (K2363, K2370) that cross-link to the SMG1 insertion C-terminus are observed in close proximity to the additional density (red).</title><p>Related to Figure 4 C.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72353-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>There are two residues within the SMG1 kinase site that also cross-link to the SMG1 insertion C-terminus, but are not located in direct proximity to the observed additional density.
