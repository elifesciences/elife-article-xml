potassium-leak channel Kcnk5b maintains allometric juvenile growth of adult zebrafish appendages. However, it remains unknown how this channel maintains allometric growth and how its bioelectric activity is regulated to scale these anatomical structures. We show the activation of Kcnk5b is sufficient to activate several genes that are part of important development programs. We provide in vivo transplantation evidence that the activation of gene transcription is cell autonomous. We also show that Kcnk5b will induce the expression of different subsets of the tested developmental genes in different cultured mammalian cell lines, which may explain how one electrophysiological stimulus can coordinately regulate the allometric growth of diverse populations of cells in the fin that use different developmental signals. We also provide evidence that the post-translational modification of serine 345 in Kcnk5b by calcineurin regulates channel activity to scale the fin. Thus, we show how an endogenous bioelectric mechanism can be regulated to promote coordinated developmental signaling to generate and scale a vertebrate appendage.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Organs, limbs, fins and tails are made of multiple tissues whose growth is controlled by specific signals and genetic programmes. All these different cell populations must work together during development or regeneration to form a complete structure that is the right size in relation to the rest of the body. Growing evidence suggests that this synchronicity might be down to electric signals, which are created by movements of charged particles in and out of cells.</p><p>In particular, previous work has identified two factors that control the development of fins in fish: the Kcnk5b potassium-leak channel, which allows positive ions to cross the cell membrane; and an enzyme called calcineurin, which can modify the activity of proteins. Kcnk5b and calcineurin seem to play similar roles in the proportional growth of the fins in relation to the body, but exactly how was unknown.</p><p>To investigate this question, Yi et al. used genetically modified zebrafish to show how the Kcnk5b channel could control genes responsible for appendage growth. However, their tests on different cell types revealed that potassium movement through the Kcnk5b channel leads to different sets of developmental genes being turned on, depending on the tissue type of the cell. This could explain how one type of signal (in this case, movement of ions) can coordinate the growth of a wide range of tissues that use different combinations of developmental genes to form. Kcnk5b therefore appears to coordinate the regulation of the various combinations of genes needed for different fin tissues to develop, so that every component grows in a proportional, synchronized manner. Yi et al. also showed that calcineurin can modify the Kcnk5b channel to control its activity. In turn, this affects the movement of potassium ions across the membrane, changing electrical activity and, as a consequence, the proportional growth of the fin.</p><p>Further work should explore how Kcnk5b and calcineurin link to other signals that regulate the size of fins and limbs. Ultimately, a finer understanding of the molecules controlling the growth of body parts will be useful in fields such as regenerative medicine or stem cell biology, which attempt to build organs for clinical therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>potassium channel</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>tissue scaling</kwd><kwd>proportional growth</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>calcineurin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AN 797/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antos</surname><given-names>Christopher L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ShanghaiTech University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antos</surname><given-names>Christopher L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Calcineurin regulates an electrophysiological mechanism that activates the transcription of specific developmental genes in a heirarchical manner to scale fish appendages.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue scaling involves the coordinated control of developmental programs, since anatomical structures consist of different tissues that form in a coordinated manner and grow proportionally with each other and with the body. While there are several developmental signals known to regulate cell proliferation and tissue formation, mechanisms that concomitantly activate several developmental signals to synchronize the growth of multi-tissue appendages and organs in a manner that is coordinated with body proportions remain poorly defined.</p><p>There is growing evidence that several biological phenomena involved in tissue generation and growth are influenced by electrophysiological changes in ‘non-excitable’ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sundelacruz et al., 2009</xref>). Several cell behaviors are affected by the addition of electric currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCaig et al., 2005</xref>): cell migration, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, gene transcription and consequently tissue formation are all altered by the application of an exogenous current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baer and Colello, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartel et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackiston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borgens et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geremia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sundelacruz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yasuda, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>). The culmination of these findings have led to the hypothesis that bioelectrical fields exist that have higher order organizational non-cell-autonomous properties in the development of anatomical structures (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Messerli and Graham, 2011</xref>].</p><p>As a regulator of membrane potential, K<sup>+</sup> conductance is an important component of the electrophysiological properties of cells. Evidence that illustrates the importance of K<sup>+</sup> conductance in tissue formation comes from studies in which disruption of inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels of the Kir2 family can cause cranial facial defects, abnormal number of digits and reduced digit size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canún et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sansone et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tawil et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoon et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoon et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zaritsky et al., 2000</xref>). A striking finding concerning the coordinated control of cell behavior is the formation of eye structures by overexpressing different ion channels that alter membrane potential in early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pai et al., 2012</xref>): overexpression and activation of a glycine-gated chloride channel in cells that form the eye interferes with eye formation, while overexpression of a dominant-negative K<sup>+</sup>-ATP channel simulates ectopic eye formation even in unexpected locations on the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pai et al., 2012</xref>). These findings illustrate that changes in the membrane potential of cells can have significant impacts on the development of anatomical structures. However, how electrophysiological information associates with the multiple necessary signals that control formation and/or growth of multi-tissue structures remains unclear.</p><p>The development of body structures not only involves forming tissues, it also involves coordinating the growth of each contributing tissue cell. To form organs that correctly scale with the body, each tissue grows either isometrically (grows with the same rate as the body) or allometrically (disproportionally grows in relation to the growth of the body). The zebrafish mutants <italic>another long fin</italic> (<italic>alf</italic>), <italic>long fin</italic> (<italic>lof</italic>), and <italic>schleier</italic> (<italic>schl</italic>) display continued allometric growth of each appendage from the juvenile stage into the adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lanni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perathoner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stewart et al., 2020</xref>). The dominant allometric growth phenotype of <italic>alf</italic> is due to mutations in the transmembrane pore region of <italic>kcnk5b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perathoner et al., 2014</xref>), encoding a two-pore K<sup>+</sup>-leak channel that regulates membrane potential by outward flow of K<sup>+</sup> from the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldstein et al., 2001</xref>). The dominant phenotype of <italic>lof</italic> is linked to elevated expression of a voltage-gated potassium channel <italic>Kcnh2a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stewart et al., 2020</xref>). The phenotype of <italic>schl</italic> is due to dominant-negative mutations in <italic>kcc4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lanni et al., 2019</xref>), encoding a K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter that regulates intracellular K<sup>+</sup> levels in a chloride-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marcoux et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>alf</italic>, <italic>lof</italic>, and <italic>schl</italic> demonstrate the importance of K<sup>+</sup> conductance and ultimately of electrophysiological signals for the correct body-to-appendage proportions. Despite the connection between K<sup>+</sup> conductance and the proportional growth of the fins, it remains unclear how K<sup>+</sup>-mediated signal translates into coordinated growth of the fish appendage and how any K<sup>+</sup> channel is regulated to scale tissue.</p><p>We show that activity of the single two-pore K<sup>+</sup>-leak channel Kcnk5b is sufficient to induce the activation of at least two components, Shh and Lef1, of two important morphogen pathways, not only in the adult fin but also in the larva. Our data also indicates that this induction is cell autonomous, arguing that increases in membrane potential caused by Kcnk5b regulate growth through intracellular regulation of these developmental pathways. Overexpression of <italic>kcnk5b</italic> or one of two other two-pore <italic>kcnk</italic> channels in different mammalian cell lines showed variable activation of genes belonging to different developmental signal transduction mechanisms, supporting the conclusions that the different developmental mechanisms needed to scale fish appendages can be regulated by the same electrophysiological change induced by potassium leak and that the combinatorial activation of the different developmental mechanisms by Kcnk5b is cell-type dependent. Lastly, we provide evidence for how post-translational modification of Kcnk5b at Serine345 by calcineurin regulates its electrophysiological activity and consequently the scaling of zebrafish fins. Thus, we describe an endogenous cell-autonomous mechanism through which electrophysiological signals can induce and coordinate specific morphogen and growth factor signals to mediate the scaling of an anatomical structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Kcnk5b is sufficient to induce several developmental gene programs in different cell types in adult and larva</title><p>Mutations in the two-pore K<sup>+</sup>-leak channel Kcnk5b that increase its activity lead to enhanced growth of the zebrafish appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perathoner et al., 2014</xref>). While this finding implicates the importance of bioelectric signaling in appendage scaling, it remains unknown how the activity of a single K<sup>+</sup> channel is integrated with the developmental controls that generate new appendage tissues. Growth of any appendage involves the coordinated activation of specific morphogen and growth factor pathways: Shh, β-catenin-dependent Wnt, Bmp, Fgf, and Retinoic acid. Therefore, to begin to determine how this channel is involved in the coordinated growth of the entire fin, we generated transgenic zebrafish that expresses <italic>kcnk5b</italic> under the control of a conditionally inducible promoter (heat-shock promoter) to temporally activate this channel in adult fins. After a single 10-min heat-shock pulse of the Tg[<italic>hsp70:kcnk5b</italic>-GFP] transgene, we observed significant activation of <italic>shh</italic> and <italic>lef1</italic> (β-catenin-dependent Wnt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aa</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as well as an increase in <italic>aldh1a2</italic> (retinoic acid) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ab</xref>) within 6 hr by qRT-PCR, while <italic>pea3</italic> (Fgf) was slightly increased and <italic>msxb</italic> (BMP) was not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All genes returned to control levels by 12 hr after the single pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The induction of the developmental genes coincided with the temporal expression of the <italic>kcnk5b</italic>-GFP transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), whose expression emerged as a lattice pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>), indicating that Kcnk5b-GFP was localized and functioned at cell membranes. When we maintained chronic expression of the transgene by heat shocking the caudal fin for 10 min once per day for 3 days, we observed expression of <italic>lef1</italic>, <italic>shh</italic>, <italic>aldh1a2</italic> as well as <italic>pea3</italic> and <italic>msxb</italic> over controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which included Shh’s patched receptors and slight up-regulation of <italic>bmp2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Together, these data show that Kcnk5b is sufficient to induce the transcription of certain developmental genes as though it were a part of their signaling mechanisms.

Compared to control fins (Figure 3Ea, c), localization of <italic>shh</italic> and <italic>lef1</italic> was in the distal tip of the fin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Eb, d</xref>) where growth normally occurs, and cross-sections through the fins showed that Kcnk5b-mediated induction of these genes occured in the epidermal/epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Fb</xref>,d). We also assessed increases in Shh and Lef1 protein levels after the heat-shock induction of <italic>kcnk5b-</italic>GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Because Lef1 conveys β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling by acting as a transcriptional platform for β-catenin, we examined protein expression of β-catenin and observed no significant differences in its overall levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, when we examined β-catenin protein distribution in the fin tissues by immunohistochemistry staining, we observed an increased number of nuclei with β-catenin co-staining in the outer epidermis layers and basal epithelium of the fin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–J</xref>) despite no significant differences in the measured β-catenin-associated fluorescence intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2K</xref>). To test whether the redistribution of β-catenin leads to the activation of known β-catenin-dependent genes, we performed qRT-PCR of <italic>axin2</italic>, <italic>cyclin D</italic>, and <italic>c-myc</italic>. We observed that none of these candidates were activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), which indicates that while Lef1 expression increases, β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling is not directly activated by Kcnk5b. Together, all the expression results indicate that Kcnk5b activity promotes the transcription of specific components of a limited number of developmental pathways in the adult fin.</p><p>To test whether increasing the activity of Kcnk5b has the same transcriptional effect on these developmental pathways in another in vivo context, we induced the expression of <italic>kcnk5b</italic> in the zebrafish larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We observed that <italic>lef1, shh, adlh2a, pea3</italic>, <italic>and msxb</italic> expression levels were increased by induction of <italic>kcnk5b</italic> compared to heat-shocked non-transgenic control fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To further explore the effect of Kcnk5b activity on <italic>shh</italic> transcription in developing fins, we performed in situ hybridization experiments on fish embryos and examined <italic>shh</italic> expression in the developing pectoral fin buds. Compared to the emerging expression of <italic>shh</italic> in the fin buds of heat-shocked non-transgenic embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ba</xref>,c), we observed <italic>kcnk5b</italic> expression induced increases in the rate of <italic>shh</italic> mRNA detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bb</xref>,d) and in the area of <italic>shh</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Be-h</xref>). Thus, Kcnk5b activity appears to increase both the intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bi</xref>) and the range of <italic>shh</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bj</xref>). We further assessed Lef-1-dependent transcription by crossing the heat-shock-inducible transgenic Tg[<italic>hsp70:knck5b</italic>-GFP] line with the transgenic Lef1 reporter line Tg[<italic>7XTCF-Xla.sam:</italic>mCherry]. While the double-transgenic fish Tg[<italic>hsp70:kcnk5b</italic>-GFP; <italic>7XTCF-Xla.sam:</italic>mCherry] displayed limited expression of mCherry before heat-shock induction of the <italic>kcnk5b</italic>-GFP transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ca</xref>,b,g), after heat shock, double-transgenic Tg[<italic>hsp70:kcnk5b</italic>-GFP; <italic>7XTCF-Xla.sam:</italic>mCherry] fish showed a broad increase in reporter mCherry expression over single-transgenic Tg[<italic>7XTCF-Xla.sam:</italic>mCherry] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Cd</xref>,e,g). From histological cross-sections of double-transgenic larva, we observed that mCherry was upregulated broadly in the body of the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, we observed an increase in the length of the caudal finfold along the anterioposterior axis of 5 dpf larva after induction of <italic>kcnk5b</italic>-GFP by single daily 10 min pulses over 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), while the caudal finfold lengths along the dorsoventral axis of appeared not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, we observed that when we compared both anterioposterior and dorsoventral axes measurements in relation to body length, we observed that in both instances the finfold dimensions proportionally increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>), which was in part associated with decreases in the lengths of the bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). These results showed that in relation to the body, Kcnk5b activity promoted proportional increases in the finfold dimensions. Our observation that the activity of this channel decreased the length of the body, suggests that the growth-promoting effects of Kcnk5b activity may be limited to the finfolds and appendages. Together, these results indicate that Kcnk5b activity is sufficient to promote the transcription of specific developmental genes in several different tissue types to promote allometric growth of the finfold.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Kcnk5b induces <italic>shh</italic> and <italic>lef1</italic> in zebrafish larva.</title><p>(<bold>Aa,b</bold>) Comparison of gene expression from mRNA isolated from complete three dpf zebrafish larva harboring Tg[<italic>hsp70:knck5b</italic>-GFP] 6 hr after heat-shock (HS) induction.

The broad activation of the Lef1-dependent Wnt reporter in several tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and Kcnk5b’s ability to scale all the tissues of the fin appendages suggest that Kcnk5b acts via non-cell autonomous communication among cells. To determine whether the observed Kcnk5b-mediated induction of gene expression is due to intercellular communication (e.g. through extracellular ligands such as Wnt) or due to cell autonomous activation of transcription, we transplanted cells from Tg[<italic>hsp70:kcnk5b</italic>-GFP; <italic>7XTCF-Xla.sam</italic>:mCherry] transgenic embryos into embryos harboring only the Tg[<italic>7XTCF-Xla.sam</italic>:mCherry] transgene and then raised mosaic embryos and larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Therefore, we examined the transcriptional responses to Kcnk5b in other mammalian cell lines. In HeLa cells, Kcnk5b induced PEA3 and LEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Together, these results reveal that Kcnk channel activity is sufficient to induce the transcription of genes associated with different developmental pathways in different mammalian cells types, and indicate that the downstream consequences of membrane potential changes are not intrinsic to specific signal transduction pathways. We propose that the variability in gene transcription in different cell types may explain why the solitary change in the activity of this channel in all cells of the fin leads to the variable transcriptional responses that promote coordinated growth of a multi-tissue anatomical structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Calcineurin regulates Kcnk5b channel activity and Kcnk5b-mediated gene transcription</title><p>We previously showed that the phosphatase calcineurin acts as a molecular switch between isometric and allometric proportional growth of the zebrafish fins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kujawski et al., 2014</xref>).

While the mammalian phenotypes remain unexplained, the defects in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wings have been linked to reduced Dpp (BMP) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dahal et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that intracellular K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis is important for BMP signaling.</p><p>Removal of an ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel in the early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo disrupts eye formation, while ectopic expression of this channel will produce ectopic eyes in the head and in locations that were not considered to be competent for producing eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pai et al., 2012</xref>). The ability to ectopically generate eyes was linked to electrophysiological hyperpolarization of the cells and the activation of Pax6-eyeless gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pai et al., 2012</xref>), a master regulator for eye development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chow et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Halder et al., 1995</xref>). In planaria, shortly after wounding, membrane depolarization acts as an early anterior signal that is sufficient (even when induced on the posterior side) to promote the consequent formation of all the anterior structures of the planarian head by inducing notum expression, which inhibits β-catenin-dependent Wnt signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durant et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, it was recently revealed that in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs, depolarization events promote membrane localization of the transmembrane receptor smoothened to promote Shh signaling and that membrane potential values are patterned within the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emmons-Bell and Hariharan, 2021</xref>). These discoveries show that electrophysiological changes are important signals in the formation and growth of anatomical structures.</p><p>A recent finding showed that calcineurin inhibition or increased activity of the voltage-gated Kcnh2 channel (<italic>lof</italic> mutant) promotes regenerative outgrowth from the proximal side of a mid-fin excavation, a site that normally does not mount a regenerative outgrowth response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings help explain how calcineurin-regulated and electrophysiological changes from potassium channels can lead to broader tissue organizing phenomena by showing the inductive effect that increasing K<sup>+</sup> conductance (and calcineurin’s regulation of K<sup>+</sup> conductance) can have on a broad number of developmental pathways, which is important for coordinating the organized formation of tissues and organs. Furthermore, we posit that the effect of the activity of the Kcnk5b channel is broader than the traditional mechanisms of growth factor/morphogen signaling pathways, because it is not confined to specific signal transduction mechanisms; rather, it has variable broad effects, such as activation of several developmental signals in the adult fin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and different mammalian cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). While we observed that Kcnk5b is sufficient to promote <italic>lef1</italic>-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), we did not observe direct activation of <italic>axin2</italic>, a down-stream target gene of β-catenin activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We posit that Kcnk5b activity does not directly activate canonical Wnt, but primes cells for increased β-catenin activity upon the reception of a Wnt signal through up-regulation of Lef1. Ultimately, continued Kcnk5b activity must lead to increased β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling, since all evidence indicates that Wnt signaling is required for allometric fin outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawakami et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stoick-Cooper et al., 2007</xref>), and allometric fin growth is the phenotype that we get by <italic>kcnk5b</italic> or <italic>kcnk9</italic> overexpression in amputated and unamputated fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–L</xref>). We propose that the competence to activate different developmental pathways by electrophysiological changes is because the responding cells are either primed to activate them or the pathways are already active. It will be important to find out how this electrophysiological signal coordinates the activity of these developmental signals. In this regard, only few factors are known that regulate <italic>shh</italic> and <italic>lef1</italic> transcription. Thus, our finding that an electrophysiological mechanism is involved not only provides a new understanding of how electrophysiology acts as an inductive signal, it also may lead to the discovery of molecular mechanisms that control the expression of these mediators of important morphogen signals.</p><p>The scaling activity of Kcnk5b includes all the tissues of the entire appendages of the fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perathoner et al., 2014</xref>). Previous findings implicate broader intercellular electrophysiological gradients as a mechanism for tissue growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Levin, 2013</xref>). Electrophysiological measurements of animal tissues show that electric fields are generated and are important in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borges et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jenkins et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGinnis and Vanable, 1986</xref>), which suggests the existence of in vivo bioelectric information that regulates physiological phenomena. However, from our transplantation experiments, we observe that Kcnk5b’s effect is cell autonomous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Consequently, the question arises about how the activity of this K<sup>+</sup>-leak channel relates to a broad, coordinated phenotype of scaling the several tissues of the fin. An answer is that the autonomous transcriptional programs include morphogens. What is unclear is whether a limited number of cells in the fin control the growth and organizing information so that Kcnk5b only needs to act on a limited number of cell types, or whether Kcnk5b regulates proportional growth at multiple levels and that the cell autonomous transcriptional response that we observe is one outcome of a combination of intracellular and intercellular responses induced by Kcnk5b.</p><p>Changes in membrane potential from alterations in K<sup>+</sup> conductance are also associated with the progression through the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackiston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Urrego et al., 2014</xref>), because K<sup>+</sup> channel activity increases at specific cell cycle phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Urrego et al., 2014</xref>), and inhibition of K<sup>+</sup> channel activity leads to cell cycle arrest in many different tissue cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackiston et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible that this phenomenon explains part of Kcnk5b’s ability to promote allometric growth. We do not yet know whether other phenomena linked to the activity of mammalian Kcnk5 [influence cell tonicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Niemeyer et al., 2001</xref>), metabolic acidosis and alkalinization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warth et al., 2004</xref>), CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> chemosensing in retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flores et al., 2011</xref>) and apoptosis in lymphocytes and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Göb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nam et al., 2011</xref>)] are involved in appendage scaling.</p><p>We previously showed that calcineurin inhibition shifts isometric growth to allometric growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kujawski et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequently, Daane et al. showed that this effect is reversible in that removal of calcineurin inhibitors restores isometric growth. The authors also suggest an alternative mechanism for calcineurin regulation of Kcnk5b in its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daane et al., 2018</xref>); however, their model posits that active calcineurin promotes the activity of Kcnk5b, which does not yet explain how calcineurin inhibition and increased Kcnk5b activity each promote allometric growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kujawski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perathoner et al., 2014</xref>). In either case, these data implicate calcineurin as a molecular switch governing isometric versus allometric growth control. Our findings provide a mechanism for how this switch acts to scale the fish appendages by directly regulating the activity of Kcnk5b through the dephosphorylation and phosphorylation of a specific serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The ability to mimic or block calcineurin regulation of this K<sup>+</sup>-leak channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), whose activity levels directly translate into the extent of allometric growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), defines how calcineurin inhibition expands clonal populations during fin regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tornini et al., 2016</xref>). However, as we observed from both calcineurin inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kujawski et al., 2014</xref>) and from conditionally inducing Kcnk5b activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the induced allometric growth of the entire fin is more than expanding clonal populations, since the outcome is not tumorigenesis. Instead, the growth is coordinated among all the tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I,K,L</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kujawski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perathoner et al., 2014</xref>), and our finding that Kcnk5b activates several developmental pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) argues that calcineurin activity acting on Kcnk5b regulates more than cell cycle progression.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of calcineurin regulation of Kcnk5b-mediated activation of developmental gene transcription.</title><p>Kcnk5b activation results in reduced cytoplasmic K<sup>+</sup>, which is sufficient to induce the transcription of the <italic>shh</italic> ligand and <italic>lef1</italic> transcription factor as well as components of other developmental pathways to induce coordinated allometric growth of the tissues of the fish fin appendage. Scaling information from the body or local tissues in the fin activate calcineurin so that it dephosphorylates Kcnk5b on S345 to reduce its K<sup>+</sup>-channel activity, which results in isometric growth of the fin.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60691-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>An important next step is to learn how the calcineurin-Kcnk5b circuit is integrated into the broader mechanisms that scale the appendages. Calcineurin is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzyme which suggests that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is involved in scaling information. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a broad second messenger that can activate several downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzymes, so broad changes in its subcellular levels likely have multiple effects. It remains unclear whether there is a specific intracellular distribution pattern that leads to calcineurin-mediated control of scaling. It is also possible that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated activation of calcineurin—and consequent restoration of isometric growth—is so dominant that other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated activities have little effect.</p><p>Two mechanisms that regulate proportional growth of organs are vitamin D and Hippo signaling. Increasing vitamin D signaling enhance the growth of the entire body, including the fins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2019</xref>). We propose that vitamin D is a systemic body signal that ultimately leads to the increase in Kcnk5b signaling. It is also possible that this hormone acts independently of Kcnk5b. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Hippo pathway regulates brain size and size of the imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>). Mice overexpressing a nuclear version of the Hippo-signaling component Yap1 in the adult liver develop significantly enlarged livers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camargo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2007</xref>). The Hippo signal transduction pathway consists of several core components that can be regulated by different factors at plasma membrane and within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu and Guan, 2013</xref>), so there are several possible nodes of interaction between of Kcnk5b and Hippo cascade. It is also possible the Hippo-mediated transcription regulates <italic>kcnk5b</italic> expression or channel activity.</p><p>Connexin43 also regulates proportional growth of the fins, since mutations that reduce the intercellular connectivity of connexin43 produce adult fins that are half the size as the fins of wild-type siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoptak-Solga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iovine et al., 2005</xref>). The connective nature of these intercellular junction proteins indicate that direct communication between intracellular compartments of tissue cells is an important component of the scaling mechanism of the fins. Our observation that Kcnk5b cell-autonomously activates the <italic>7XTCF-Xla.sam</italic>:mCherry reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) indicates that it is not due to intracellular transfer of K<sup>+</sup>. It is still unclear whether the disruption of intracellular trafficking of other ions (such as Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>) or of other factors is responsible for the connexin43’s effect on scaling.</p><p>Kcnk5b’s ability to activate the Lef1-dependent reporter cell autonomously in different tissue types supports the conclusion that K<sup>+</sup> conductance has the potential to regulate developmental transcription in a broad range of tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>). The observation that neuronal cells in the brain and myocytes in the trunk muscle respond similarly to non-excitable cells elsewhere in the body suggests that even cells that harbor action potentials use K<sup>+</sup> conductance to regulate gene expression. However, when we either stably expressed or transient transfected Kcnk5b in different cell lines, we did not observe consistent activation of Lef1 or Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We posit that the competencies of the cultured cell lines are different from the developmental competencies of the in vivo cells. Also, the mammalian cell lines are cancer cells, so they may already have an increased transcriptional base line for the selected developmental genes that the two-pore potassium-leak channels can only partially affect.</p><p>While we observed similarities between Kcnk5b and Kcnk9 or Kcnk10 in HEK cells, in Hela and N2A cells, we observed only partially similar profiles for the selected genes (while Kcnk9 and Kcnk10 were similar) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We postulate that the observed differences may come from one or both of the following explanations. First, different responses from channels of the same ion-type are due to different levels of membrane potential changes, which results in different levels of gene transcription. Second, these channels have different intracellular sequences, which may determine other unknown intermolecular interactions that have different signal transduction properties. In any case, we did observe that transgenic overexpression of Kcnk9 produces a similar allometric growth of the caudal fin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K,L</xref>). It remains to be explored whether intermolecular interactions between the channels and another protein contribute to the scaling of other organs as well as how other electrophysiological mechanisms that control membrane potential have the same growth effect.</p><p>In conclusion, we show how a specific electrophysiological mechanism activates important morphogen pathways to scale tissues in different in vivo contexts. We propose the observed diversity in morphogen and growth factor expression to Kcnk5b activity explains why the increased activity of Kcnk5b produces the diverse transcriptional response in the different tissues associated with the observed coordinated outgrowth of the entire fin. Also, we show how changes in phosphorylation of S345 in the cytoplasmic C-terminus can be regulated by calcineurin to directly control electrophysiological activity of the channel to scale the fin. Thus, we offer an in vivo paradigm in which membrane potential acts as potent regulator of coordinated developmental signaling, and we show how the two-pore K<sup>+</sup>-leak channel Kcnk5b is involved in the initial activation of specific developmental mechanisms that lead to the scaling of the fish fin appendages.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

allometric versus isometric fin growth in zebrafish. The manuscript also presents interesting results supporting a cell-autonomous effect of Kcnk5b, rather than non-autonomous bioelectric action, proposed for channels by several earlier publications in the field.

The manuscript investigates the relationship between calcineurin and Kcnk5b in regulation of allometric versus isometric fin growth in zebrafish. The manuscript also presents interesting results supporting a cell-autonomous effect of Kcnk5b, rather than non-autonomous bioelectric action, currently prevailing model. Towards understanding the molecular mechanism via which Kcnk5b activity regulates fin growth the authors provide evidence of changes in Wnt and Shh signaling and/or expression, providing a model for how Kcnk5b could exert its effects. Finally, Ser to Alanine and Ser to Glutamic acid mutations in transgenic zebrafish and cell culture, support a model that regulation of Ser435 phosphorylation by Calcineurin regulates fin growth. This work advances understanding of how potassium channels regulate allometric fin growth.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript reports large amount of data, which is in general well presented. However, several conclusions require further experimental support, toning down and/or clarification. These and other concerns need to be addressed before the manuscript becomes suitable for publication.</p><p>1. In the manuscript, the control for the heat-shock Tg[hsp70:kcnk5b-GFP] transgenic animals is the transgenic line not subjected to heat shock. Since heat-shock is known to induce significant transcriptional changes, the authors need to repeat all experiments comparing heat-shocked wild-types with heat-shocked transgenics. This is particularly important since some of the results are unexpected (msx being up after 6, but not 12 hours, aldh1 strongly up after 6 but down after 12 hours).</p><p>2. The gene expression changes presented in Figure 1 are impressive. However, interpreting the changes in lef1 as evidence for alteration of Wnt signaling, and changes of mxb as alterations of BMP signaling, requires further support. While lef1 is a good direct Wnt target in many tissues, it can be regulated in the fin in a Wnt independent manner (Wehner et al. Cell Reports 2014). Moreover, it is not clear that msxb is only regulated by BMP signaling and thus could serve as readout for pathway activity. Similar to the larval experiments, authors should use a Wnt reporter to support their findings that Wnt signaling is regulated. For Hedgehog signaling, patched is often used as readout, and authors should also assay for its expression.</p><p>3. The authors conclude increased nuclear localization of b-catenin in Tg[hsp70:kcnk5b-GFP] upon HS, without altered overall b-catenin fluorescence intensity. However, in the presented panels anti-β catenin intensity appears higher in the HS transgenic tissue. Figure 1H: instead of showing single channels for the overview, single channels should be shown for the higher mag, so readers can assess themselves whether there is nuclear β-catenin. Also, please clarify the thickness of sections and whether we are looking at a regular IFF or confocal sections?</p><p>4. The mosaic experiments are interesting, but their description and documentation should be improved. Moreover, the conclusions are not fully supported by the data.</p><p>– Line 193-194 The authors state &quot;Moreover, in all tissues, the ectopic mCherry expression was always limited to the Kcnk5b-positive cells (Figure 3B-D). However, the graph in Figure 3D, show many more mCherry positive cells than GFP positive cells? Isn't this consistent with the non-autonomous model? 10)</p><p>– Second, why are the numbers of mCherry+ cells much higher in 3 of the counted tissues in the graph in D than of the GFP+ cells? If this included endogenous mCherry expression, including endogenous expression domains is meaningless for the purpose of showing whether induction is cell-autonomous. Authors must concentrate on domains where there is no endogenous mCherry &quot;background&quot;.</p><p>– Third, it needs to be considered that Wnt ligands induced by transgene expression might not spread far considering their hydrophobic nature. Thus, proving that there is no mCherry induction outside the GFP domain must be done at very high cellular resolution and not in those low-resolution images the authors provide.</p><p>– Figure 3A cartoon needs to be revised as the text states that &quot;we raised mosaic embryos as larva (should be larvae), but the figure shows analyses of mosaic blastulae. When exactly at the larval stage heat shock has been applied? On line 185 the authors talk about &quot;chimeric embryos&quot; – please clarify. Also, please provide the number of experimental &quot;chimeric animals (embryo or larvae)&quot;.</p><p>5. It's interesting that authors can detect increased growth of the fin fold relative to the body, although the channel and the presumed downstream signals are induced everywhere. So what about overall larval growth? Does this also increase?</p><p>6. Based on the results presented in Figure 4, the authors conclude that &quot;Transfection of HEK cells with these two other channels resulted in the same transcriptional profile as Kcnk5b. However, similar changes were observed for SHH and PEA3, but not for LEF1, ALDH1a2 or MSX1, contrasting the results for kcn5b in HEK293T in Figure 4Bb. This undermines the authors' conclusion that &quot;that the transcriptional response to Kcnk5b is a response to the electrophysiological changes associated with intracellular K<sup>+</sup> 221 leak.&quot; To further test this, such comparative experiments should be performed also in HeLa and N2 cells, in which Kcn5b channel induces distinct transcriptional responses.</p><p>7. Authors assay for gene expression in stably transfected cells. Continuous expression of the channel might have many effects on the physiology / proliferation of the cells, which preclude meaningful conclusions from transcriptional changes. Experiments should also be performed with inducible expression systems.</p><p>8. The experiments testing the specificity of Calcineurin regulation of Kcnk5b are compelling as are the experiments testing the role of S345 and its phosphorylation. However, Ser345 phosphorylation can be only inferred from these experiments. To make this conclusion, a more direct evidence of S345 would be required. Therefore, it is an overstatement &quot;we observed a linear relationship between the proportional length of the unamputated lobes and the phosphorylation status of the channels&quot;, this should be revised as &quot;presumptive phosphorylation&quot;.</p><p>9. According to Figure 6B the difference between the proportional length of the unamputated lobes for wild-type Kcnk5b channel and the phosphomimetic S345E form is not significant. This could be due to relatively small number of experimental animals; however, the authors need to acknowledge this. It is also possible that in vivo effect of this mutation are not as strong as suggested by electrophysiology. The most elegant way to test effects of these mutations would be to edit them into the endogenous kcnk5b locus, although this would require significant amount of time and is not essential.</p><p>10. The authors conclude &quot;kcnk5bS345E mutant was resistant to calcineurin-mediated inhibition (Figure 6D)&quot;. However, it appears that Calcineurin addition enhanced the mutant channel activity? Are these differences significant?</p><p>11. The number of experimental animals, and the number of experiments performed should be clearly indicated in figures or figure legends.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An endogenous scaling mechanism that controls a K<sup>+</sup>-leak channel to regulate morphogen and growth factor transcription&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

While an upregulation is observed of lef1 and shh after 6 hours, albeit much less dramatically as when compared to non-heat shocked fish (about 1.5 to 2 fold with the appropriate new controls, compared to 30 to 40 fold in the old data), the effect after 12 hours has disappeared. In fact, some of the results like downregulation of lef1 after 12 hours have disappeared as well. However, the authors still state &quot;The elevated expression of shh and lef1 continued 12 hours after the single pulse (Figure 1Ba Figure 1—figure supplement Figure 1B)&quot;. This is clearly not what the Figure 1—figure supplement Figure 1B.</p><p>The new results representing properly-controlled experiments should be moved to the main figures. These new results need to be appropriately incorporated into the authors conclusions.</p><p>Appropriate controls using heat-shocked WT without the Tg[hsp70:kcnk5b-GFP] transgene, should be also performed for other experiments, e.g. much of figure 2.</p><p>In their response letter, the authors agree with the reviewers that &quot;lef1 activation may be independent&quot; of Wnt signaling and alone cannot be used as a reporter for Wnt signaling. The authors changed some of the conclusions in the Results. However, the abstract still states &quot;We show the activation of Kcnk5b is sufficient to activate several development programs, the most responsive of which are shh and lef1&quot;. &quot;Developmental programs&quot; is an overstatement and this needs to be rephrased. Similarly, the Abstract states &quot;Kcnk5b can induce the expression of these developmental programs in cultured mammalian cell lines&quot;. The phrase &quot;developmental programs&quot; should be removed as it implies a gene or signaling cascade(s) for which there is insufficient evidence.</p><p>In response to the request to clarify whether data points in qPCR graphs are biological replicates, the authors claim they added that information, but it is very unclear. E.g in the legend to Figure 1 they write &quot;…each experiment represents an N of 3 or more, with each N having 2 or more replicates&quot;. What does that mean? One is concerned that &quot;replicates&quot; are technical replicates and the impressively large sample sizes used for the qPCR experiments throughout the paper include technical replicates. In the response letter the authors state that sufficient number of biological replicates have been performed. This needs to be clearly presented in the manuscript.</p><p>Moreover, the authors agree with the reviewers that posttranslational modification of serine 345 in Kcnk5b is &quot;presumptive&quot; Yet, the Abstract states &quot;We also demonstrate how post translational modification of serine 345 in Kcnk5b by calcineurin regulates channel activity and controls these developmental programs to scale the fin.&quot; The authors discuss their efforts to generate appropriate transgenic or genome edited lines to more directly test this presumptive serine modification. These are challenging experiments. However, without such experiments, one cannot make these definitive conclusions in the Abstract (or elsewhere in the manuscript).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60691.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript reports large amount of data, which is in general well presented.

We kept the reference of <italic>msxb</italic> to BMP signaling, because the increased <italic>bmp</italic> transcription that we did see although was slight, it was statistically significant. To address the reviewer’s point about β-catenin regulated transcription, we also examined the expression of other β-catenin-activated genes: <italic>axin2, cyclin D and myc</italic>, but we did not see upregulation (data placed in Suppl. Figure 1I). Thus, as the reviewer suggested might be the case, <italic>lef1</italic> activation may be independent. These results altered our interpretation, and consequently, we have modified our text to focus on <italic>lef1</italic> transcription and less on direct β-catenin-dependent Wnt activation. We still do see more β-catenin nuclear localization from the counted confocal images of the immunohistochemistry sections, and ultimately one can expect β-catenin-dependent Wnt to be activated indirectly, since the phenotype involves patterned fin growth even for the unamputated fins. We provide the following hypotheses to these observations in the Discussion section:</p><p>“While we observed that Kcnk5b is sufficient to promote <italic>lef1</italic>-mediated transcription (Figures 1-3), we did not observe direct activation of down-stream target genes of β-catenin activity (Figure 1—figure supplement Figure 1I). We posit that Kcnk5b activity does not directly activate canonical Wnt, but primes cells for increased β-catenin activity upon the reception of a Wnt signal through up-regulation of Lef1. Ultimately, continued Kcnk5b activity must lead to increased β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling, since evidence indicates that it is required for fin outgrowth (Kawakami et al., 2006; Stoick-Cooper et al., 2007), which is the phenotype we get by Kcnk5b activation in amputated and unamputated fin (Figure E-I).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors conclude increased nuclear localization of b-catenin in Tg[hsp70:kcnk5b-GFP] upon HS, without altered overall β-catenin fluorescence intensity.

The sections are of 10 µm thick and the images are taken by confocal microscopy. Each confocal image as shown in Figure 1H is 0.45 μm. We now include this information in the figure legend: “Confocal planes (0.45 μm) of immunohistochemistry stained 10 μm sections of…” (lines 569-570). We decided to use the sections with the highest intensities and clearest histology for each group for the panels, but this clearly raised a discrepancy in difference in expression. We have gone through all of our stainings and now provide panels that are representative of our general observations and of our quantitative analyses. In addition, we added confocal serial sections as supplemental data (Figure 1—figure supplement Figure 2E-J) and high-light a few nuclei to show what we mean by nuclear β-catenin nuclear staining. We also provided the higher magnification image panels. Each point in the graph represents a combined total of β-catenin nuclear distribution for one confocal section. We sectioned &gt; 6 fins (3 different experiments) for each group, so our quantitative analyses should reliably reflect what is occurring in fin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We included these cells to represent the cells normally expressing β-catenin-Wnt signaling, because we were concerned that if we didn’t, then an alternative argument could be made that there should be some cells that endogenously express the reporter, and there might be concern that the recipient fish were not transgenic for the reporter. However, we do see the review’s point. To address both issues better, we removed the measurements of the endogenous cells and reconfirmed the mCherry genotypes by qPCR on the fish parents and recipient fish harboring the donor cells. All the animals are homozygous for the mCherry reporter.</p><p>We are very certain about our conclusion that all ectopic mCherry expression is limited to only the cells expressing Kcnk5b-GFP.

Unexpectedly, we observe that the body lengths are reduced by the <italic>kcnk5b</italic> expression. Despite this, the average lengths of the anterior-to-posterior finfolds are increased. We include these data in Figure 3—figure supplement Figure 1G and 2H. We speculate that the reduced body size stems from negative effects on different body systems such as the central nervous system and circulatory system. We had to modify the heat-shock method to perform a daily heat-shock protocol, since continued heat shock after the heart formation lead to significant mortality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Based on the results presented in Figure 4, the authors conclude that &quot;Transfection of HEK cells with these two other channels resulted in the same transcriptional profile as Kcnk5b.

This undermines the authors' conclusion that &quot;that the transcriptional response to Kcnk5b is a response to the electrophysiological changes associated with intracellular K<sup>+</sup> 221 leak.&quot; To further test this, such comparative experiments should be performed also in HeLa and N2 cells, in which Kcn5b channel induces distinct transcriptional responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand this point, and we modified our conclusions about the effects of Kcnk5b.</p><p>“However, when we either stably expressed or transient transfected Kcnk5b in different cell lines, we did not observe consistent activation of Lef1 or Shh (Figure 4).

These data support the reviewer’s point. Consequently, we have modified the text in the Results section:</p><p>“When we tested whether Kcnk9 and Kcnk10 produce similar transcription profiles as Kcnk5b in HELA and N2A cells, we observed similar profiles between Kcnk9 and Kcnk10 (Figure 4H-L), but differences between their outcomes and the transcriptional outcome of Kcnk5b. […] We propose that the variability in genes that are transcribed may explain why the solitary change in the activity of this channel in all cells of the fin leads to the variable transcriptional responses that are needed to promote coordinated growth of a multi-tissue anatomical structure.”</p><p>And in the Discussion section:</p><p>“While we observed similarities between Kcnk5b and Kcnk9 or Kcnk10 in HEK cells, in Hela and N2A cells, we observed only partially similar profiles for the selected genes (while Kcnk9 and Kcnk10 were similar) (Figure 4). We postulate that the observed differences may come from one or more of the following explanations. First, different responses from channels of the same ion-type are due to different levels of membrane potential changes, which results in different levels of gene transcription. Second, these channels have different intracellular sequences, which may determine other unknown intermolecular interactions that have different signal transduction properties. In any case, we did observe that transgenic overexpression of Kcnk9 produces a similar allometric growth of the caudal fin (Figure 6K,L)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

We have also replaced the mRNA in situ experiments for <italic>shh</italic> and <italic>lef1</italic> (Figure 1E and F) with experiments that contain the heat-shock wild-type controls to make clear that heat shock alone does not induce the expression of these genes. The expression patterns are the same as the previous data (which showed that transgenic fish that were not heat shocked do not induce the expression of these genes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Appropriate controls using heat-shocked WT without the Tg[hsp70:kcnk5b-GFP] transgene, should be also performed for other experiments, e.g. much of figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the requested controls to those figure panels that lacked them and joined them in one figure panel (Figure 2A). We have also provided new in situ results for <italic>shh</italic> expression the fish pectoral fin bud (Figure 2B) to further support the qRT-PCR results (now with the additional heat shock controls). The other figure panels already included non-transgenic heat-shocked fish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In their response letter, the authors agree with the reviewers that &quot;lef1 activation may be independent&quot; of Wnt signaling and alone cannot be used as a reporter for Wnt signaling. The authors changed some of the conclusions in the Results. However, the abstract still states &quot;We show the activation of Kcnk5b is sufficient to activate several development programs, the most responsive of which are shh and lef1&quot;. &quot;Developmental programs&quot; is an overstatement and this needs to be rephrased. Similarly, the Abstract states &quot;Kcnk5b can induce the expression of these developmental programs in cultured mammalian cell lines&quot;. The phrase &quot;developmental programs&quot; should be removed as it implies a gene or signaling cascade(s) for which there is insufficient evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the “developmental program” term, not only because of the activation of the genes important for development, but that ultimately the all developmental programs required for fin growth (which the formation/development of new tissues) must be activated to induce the allometric growth phenotype that we observe in Figure 6. However, we understand the concerns, so we made the requested changes and hope that our current conclusions address the issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In response to the request to clarify whether data points in qPCR graphs are biological replicates, the authors claim they added that information, but it is very unclear. E.g in the legend to Figure 1 they write &quot;…each experiment represents an N of 3 or more, with each N having 2 or more replicates&quot;. What does that mean? One is concerned that &quot;replicates&quot; are technical replicates and the impressively large sample sizes used for the qPCR experiments throughout the paper include technical replicates. In the response letter the authors state that sufficient number of biological replicates have been performed. This needs to be clearly presented in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the ambiguity. We detailed the representation of our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the authors agree with the reviewers that posttranslational modification of serine 345 in Kcnk5b is &quot;presumptive&quot; Yet, the Abstract states &quot;We also demonstrate how post translational modification of serine 345 in Kcnk5b by calcineurin regulates channel activity and controls these developmental programs to scale the fin.&quot; The authors discuss their efforts to generate appropriate transgenic or genome edited lines to more directly test this presumptive serine modification. These are challenging experiments. However, without such experiments, one cannot make these definitive conclusions in the Abstract (or elsewhere in the manuscript).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for missing this change. We have revised accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
