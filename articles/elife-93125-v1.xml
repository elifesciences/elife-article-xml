However, the role of sirtuins in the modulation of the immune metabolism pertaining to salmonellosis is largely unknown. Here, our investigation focussed on the role of two important sirtuins, SIRT1 and SIRT3, shedding light on their impact on intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic>’s metabolic switch and pathogenesis establishment. Our study indicated the ability of the live <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium to differentially regulate the levels of SIRT1 and SIRT3 for maintaining the high glycolytic metabolism and low fatty acid metabolism in <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Perturbing SIRT1 or SIRT3 through knockdown or inhibition resulted in a remarkable shift in the host metabolism to low fatty acid oxidation and high glycolysis. This switch led to decreased proliferation of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the macrophages. Further, <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced higher levels of SIRT1 and SIRT3 led to a skewed polarization state of the macrophages from a pro-inflammatory M1 state toward an immunosuppressive M2, making it more conducive for the intracellular life of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Alongside, governing immunological functions by modulating p65 NF-κB acetylation, SIRT1, and SIRT3 also skew <italic>Salmonella-</italic>induced host metabolic switch by regulating the acetylation status of HIF-1α and PDHA1. Interestingly, though knockdown of SIRT1/3 attenuated <italic>Salmonella</italic> proliferation in macrophages, in in vivo mice model of infection, inhibition or knockdown of SIRT1/3 led to more dissemination and higher organ burden, which can be attributed to enhanced ROS and IL-6 production. Our study hence reports for the first time that <italic>Salmonella</italic> modulates SIRT1/3 levels to maintain its own metabolism for successful pathogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium</kwd><kwd>immune regulation</kwd><kwd>metabolic shift</kwd><kwd><italic>Salmonella </italic>metabolism</kwd><kwd>bacterial dissemination</kwd><kwd>SIRT1</kwd><kwd>SIRT3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPM-07/079(0293)/2019-EMR-I (CSIR Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Fellowship)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hajra</surname><given-names>Dipasree</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001502</institution-id><institution>Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DAE00195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakravortty</surname><given-names>Dipshikha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science &amp; Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBT-IISC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakravortty</surname><given-names>Dipshikha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001411</institution-id><institution>Indian Council of Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakravortty</surname><given-names>Dipshikha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science &amp; Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakravortty</surname><given-names>Dipshikha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/RLF/re-entry/14/2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Shashi Kumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SIRT1 and SIRT3-mediated immunometabolic shift governs intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> proliferation both in vitro and in vivo and dissemination in mice, thereby influencing the infection outcomes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent deacetylases that are present in all forms of life. Sirtuins comprise a conserved core catalytic domain that removes acetyl moiety from the lysine residues of proteins in the presence of NAD+ as a cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Landry et al., 2000</xref>), giving rise to 2’O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and free nicotinamide as products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackson and Denu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sauve et al., 2001</xref>). Free nicotinamide acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of sirtuins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bitterman et al., 2002</xref>). They possess variable N terminal and C terminal domains that confer different subcellular localization, substrate specificity, and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sanders et al., 2010</xref>). Mammals have seven sirtuins that are responsible for regulating various biological functions such as cell survival, apoptosis, oxidative stress, metabolism, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin and Fang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guarente, 2007</xref>). SIRT1, 6, and 7 have nuclear localization, SIRT2 is cytoplasmic, and SIRT 3, 4, and 5 comprise the mitochondrial SIRTs. In addition to their deacetylase activity, they possess ADP ribosylation (SIRT1, SIRT4, and SIRT6), desuccinylation and demalonylation (SIRT5), delipoylation (SIRT4), and demyristoylation and depalmitoylation (SIRT6) enzymatic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martínez-Redondo and Vaquero, 2013</xref>). Previous studies have shown that SIRT1 gets activated in response to acute immune response and deacetylates RelA/p65 component of NFκB, thereby mediating its proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, it activates RelB component of NFκB pathway. RelB causes heterochromatinization of pro-inflammatory genes like <italic>Tnfa</italic> and <italic>Il1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El Gazzar et al., 2007</xref>). SIRT1 activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), mediating a metabolic switch from glycolysis toward fatty acid oxidation (FAO). SIRT1-mediated RelB activation, in turn, activates SIRT3, causing the promotion of mitochondrial bioenergetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2015b</xref>). PGC-1α, a major player in mitochondrial biogenesis, activates SIRT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kong et al., 2010</xref>), which in turn causes activation of PGC-1α, thereby fuelling a positive feedback loop. SIRT3 accounts for the major mitochondrial deacetylase, orchestrating several metabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation (FAO), promotion of the Tricaroboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and inhibition of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van de Ven et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium is a facultative intracellular Gram-negative enteric pathogen, causing a wide array of infections ranging from self-limiting gastroenteritis to diarrhoea in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garai et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovar Typhi cause systemic infection in humans with typhoidal symptoms. Recent reports reported incidences of 21 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhutta, 2009</xref>) typhoid cases and 93 million of non-typhoidal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Majowicz et al., 2010</xref>) cases round the year. The virulence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> is majorly regulated by two pathogenicity islands, namely, SPI-1 and SPI-2. It uses SPI-1 encoded T3SS and the effector proteins to invade host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haraga et al., 2008</xref>). Inside the macrophages, they harbour within the <italic>Salmonella</italic> containing vacuoles (SCV) by virtue of its SPI-2 effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hajra et al., 2021</xref>). Macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils are responsible for successful dissemination throughout the body through the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haraga et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Macrophages, serving as an intracellular niche for <italic>Salmonella,</italic> exhibit several continua of polarization states. At the two extreme ends of the spectrum lie the classically polarized M1 macrophages and alternatively activated M2 macrophages. M1 macrophages comprise of the proinflammatory antimicrobial state producing IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12, and IFN-γ cytokines and exhibit enhanced expression of CD80, CD86 surface markers. The anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages promote bacterial persistence by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β and show increased expression of Arg-1 and CD206 surface markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawrence and Natoli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martinez et al., 2009</xref>). To sustain the continuous production of proinflammatory cytokines, M1 macrophages rely on glycolysis for their energy requirements. On the other hand, M2 macrophages are fuelled by enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and FAO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Namgaladze and Brüne, 2014</xref>). It has been previously reported that sirtuins-mediated attuning of metabolism impacts polarization of macrophages in vivo. SIRT1 has the ability to promote the polarization of M2 macrophages and inhibit inflammation in macrophages of adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kratz et al., 2014</xref>). SIRT3 suppresses ROS by deacetylating and activating MnSOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cimen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Several bacteria are known to subvert the host immune system toward an immunosuppressive state. <italic>Salmonella</italic> or <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> have evolved mechanisms to counteract the M1 state of the host macrophage. <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium uses its SPI-2 effectors to inhibit the recruitment of NADPH oxidase to the SCV, thereby preventing oxidative burst-mediated microbicidal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vazquez-Torres et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> bacillus Calmette–Guérin prevents NOS2 recruitment to phagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Salmonella</italic> Dublin causes inhibition of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-18 and IL-12p70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bost and Clements, 1997</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Mycobacteria</italic> inhibits NFκB signalling and IFN-γ-mediated downstream pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pathak et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> elicits an M2 response by inducing arginase-1 expression and TGF-β1 and IL-4 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tumitan et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Yersinia</italic> TTSS effector LcrV induces an M2 phenotype supposedly by IL-10 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brubaker, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Since SIRT1 and SIRT3 are the major modulators of the immunometabolic paradigm, we intend to decipher the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in influencing host and <italic>Salmonella</italic> metabolism. This study highlights the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in intracellular pathogen survival by promoting <italic>Salmonella</italic> glycolysis and concomitantly driving host metabolism toward FAO. Additionally, <italic>Salmonella</italic> trigger an immunosuppressive M2 environment conducive to its intravacuolar proliferation by modulating SIRT1 and SIRT3 levels. Here, we have shown that SIRT1 and SIRT3 knockdown cause decreased M2 surface marker expression such as CD206, along with increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS generation, together amounting to attenuated bacterial intracellular proliferation within the infected macrophages. Moreover, SIRT1-mediated p65 NF-κB deacetylation played a vital role in immune function regulation within the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected macrophages with increased interaction of SIRT1 with p65 NF-κB. SIRT1 knockdown or inhibition resulted in hyperacetylation of p65 NF-κB, thereby leading to enhanced pro-inflammatory response in <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium-infected macrophages. Further, SIRT1 and SIRT3 knockdown or inhibition skewed the <italic>Salmonella-</italic>induced host metabolic shift by regulating acetylation status of HIF-1α and PDHA. This caused increased host glycolysis and reduced FAO. However, the <italic>Salmonella</italic> shows the opposing metabolic profile with increased FAO and reduced glycolysis upon SIRT1 or SIRT3 inhibition. In contrast to the macrophages, in in vivo mice model of infection, SIRT1 and SIRT3 inhibition resulted in increased pathogen loads in organs and triggered enhanced bacterial dissemination, together leading to increased susceptibility of the mice to <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection owing to increased ROS and IL-6 production. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report implying the ability of host sirtuins in impacting intracellular bacterial metabolism crucial for successful pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Salmonella</italic> modulates SIRT1 and SIRT3 expression along its course of infection in macrophages</title><p>Upon infection of RAW 264.7 murine macrophages with wildtype <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strain 14028S, we observed an increased expression level of <italic>Sirt1</italic> and <italic>Sirt3</italic> at initial and middle phases of infection, precisely at 2 hr and 6 hr post-infection through qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The <italic>Sirt1</italic> expression level declined at later phases of infection. On the other hand, the <italic>Sirt3</italic> transcript levels remained elevated at all time points with respect to uninfected control with a marked increment at 16 hr time point post-infection, which subsided at 20 hr post-infection. We even monitored the expression profile of <italic>Sirt1</italic> and <italic>Sirt3</italic> in primary macrophages like peritoneal macrophages of C57BL/6 mice and observed a similar trend of elevated expression at initial (2 hr), middle (6 hr), and late (16 hr) time points post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). In confocal laser scanning microscopy (CSLM) studies, we observed a similar increase in SIRT1 and SIRT3 expression at 6 hr post-infection within the infected macrophages RAW 264.7 macrophages. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>). Immunoblotting revealed increased protein expression of both SIRT1 and SIRT3 at 2 hr post-infection in comparison to the uninfected control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, SIRT1 expression exhibits a gradual decline at the late phase of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>). In line with the confocal microscopy data, SIRT3 immunoblotting data shows an increased protein expression profile at 6 hr and 16 hr post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Subsequently, to ascertain whether indeed <italic>Salmonella</italic> could modulate SIRT1 or SIRT3 expression levels, we evaluated the <italic>Sirt1</italic> and <italic>Sirt3</italic> mRNA and SIRT1 and SIRT3 protein expression profile within RAW 264.7 macrophages upon infection with wildtype <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium and SPI-1 (∆<italic>invC</italic>) (InvC, protein export apparatus) or SPI-2 (∆<italic>ssaV</italic> and <italic>∆steE</italic>) (SsaV, structural component of SPI-2 needle apparatus; SteE, SPI-2 effector protein involved in driving M2 polarization) mutants of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium. Our results depict the ability of wildtype <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium to induce the expression of both SIRT1 and SIRT3 within the infected RAW 264.7 macrophages. However, infection with either SPI-1 or SPI-2 mutant abrogates the induction of <italic>Sirt1,</italic> whereas only SPI-2 mutants (∆<italic>ssaV</italic> and ∆<italic>steE</italic>) and not SPI-1 mutant infection caused reduction in <italic>Sirt3</italic> transcript-level expression in the infected macrophages, implicating the role of SPI-1 and SPI-2 genes in triggering SIRT1 and SIRT3 in the infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). However, at the protein level, only SPI-2 mutant infection resulted in a predominant decline in SIRT3 expression and a mild reduction in SIRT1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Therefore, we intend to check whether SIRT1 or SIRT3 regulates immune functions in <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected macrophages. To delineate the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in the modulation of immune responses, we wished to investigate the production of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in knockdown RAW 264.7 macrophages upon <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection. Post 48 hr transfection, cells were subjected to wildtype <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection at an MOI of 10. At the indicated time points, cell-free supernatant was harvested and evaluated for pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production by ELISA. Inhibition of both SIRT1 and SIRT3 increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 significantly at 2 hr and 20 hr post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, there was only a significant reduction in anti-inflammatory IL-10 production upon <italic>Sirt1</italic> and <italic>Sirt3</italic> knockdown at 2 hr and 20 hr post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In peritoneal macrophages upon SIRT1 (EX-527-1 µM) or SIRT3 (3-TYP-1µM) chemical inhibitor treatment, an increase in IL-6 and IL-1β cytokine levels was observed at 6 hr post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>).

Since SIRT1 and SIRT3 played an immunemodulatory role in <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, we investigated whether <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection is associated with a shift in macrophage polarization status.

Typhimurium infection at the indicated time points in RAW 264.7 macrophages. A gradual shift from pro-inflammatory M1 toward the anti-inflammatory M2 state was observed with the progression of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection.

Typhimurium (STM) infection scenario, we undertook SIRT1 immunoprecipitation in the infected RAW 264.7 macrophages at 16 hr post-infection alongside the uninfected macrophages and probed for NF-κB p65 interaction. We observed an increased interaction of SIRT1 with NF-κB p65 in the infected macrophages in comparison to the uninfected control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Further, the knockdown of <italic>Sirt1</italic> resulted in increased acetylation status of the NF-κB p65 upon infection in comparison to the scrambled, infected control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). To understand whether the enzymatic domain of SIRT1 possess any role in mediating this interaction, we carried out NF-κB p65 immunoprecipitation in infected RAW 264.7 macrophages in the presence or absence of SIRT1 catalytic chemical inhibitor, EX-527 (1 µM) treatment at 16 hr post-infection. We observed an increased interaction of NF-κB p65 with SIRT1 in the infected untreated macrophages compared to the untreated uninfected control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, the interaction of NF-κB p65 with SIRT1 gets abrogated under the EX-527 inhibitor treatment in the infected macrophages, thereby implying the function of the catalytic domain in mediating the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Therefore, we speculated that the decreased intracellular proliferation within the <italic>Sirt1</italic> or <italic>Sirt3</italic> knockdown macrophages might be on account of increased intracellular ROS production, which might lead to increased killing of the intracellular bacteria. This hypothesis led us to evaluate the intracellular bacterial burden within the infected <italic>Sirt1</italic> or <italic>Sirt3</italic> knockdown RAW 264.7 macrophages or SIRT1 or SIRT3 inhibitor-treated peritoneal macrophages (isolated from C57BL/6 adult mice post fifth day of thioglycolate injection) in the presence of a ROS inhibitor named N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).

Since previous data suggested progression of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection with the shift in polarization state of the macrophage, we decided to investigate alteration of the metabolic state of the macrophages as macrophage polarization is governed by immune-metabolic shift. In pursuit of fulfilling such requirement, we performed gene expression studies of various metabolic genes through nanoString nCounter technology in <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium-infected RAW 264.7 macrophages. Analysis of the gene profile revealed upregulation of genes involved in FAO and tricarboxylic acid cycle and corresponding downregulation of genes involved in glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To validate the findings, we carried out qRT PCR to quantitatively measure the expression of a FAO gene, <italic>Pppard,</italic> in infected RAW 264.7 macrophages. We found that the mRNA level was elevated to twofold at 2 hr and 6 hr post-infection. At the late phase of infection, 16 hr post-infection around sixfold upregulation in mRNA transcript was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Lactate estimation assay of <italic>S</italic>.

HIF1α is a master regulator of glycolysis in host during stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kierans and Taylor, 2021</xref>). Previous reports have suggested HIF1α to be a target of deacetylation by SIRT1 at Lys 674, which contribute to metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. During hypoxia, downregulation of SIRT1 leads to increased acetylation and activation of HIF1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, in CD4+ T cells, ectopic expression of SIRT1 inhibited IL-9 production and glycolysis by negatively regulating HIF1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). To delve into the mechanism behind SIRT1-mediated modulation of metabolic responses, we assessed the interaction of SIRT1 with HIF-1α in infected RAW 264.7 macrophages. The immunoprecipitation studies of SIRT1 showed increased interaction of the SIRT1 with HIF1α in the <italic>S</italic>.

We found that SIRT1 knockdown showed increased acetylation of HIF1α in the infected macrophages in comparison to the scrambled infected control at 16 hr post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Immunoprecipitation studies under SIRT1 (EX-527) inhibitor treatment in RAW 264.7 macrophages revealed increased acetylation of HIF1-α along with reduced interaction of HIF-1α with SIRT1, thereby indicating the probable role of the catalytic domain in influencing the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>). Further, to ascertain the role of HIF-1α in mediating the glycolytic switch in the infected macrophages, we estimated the lactate production under <italic>Sirt1</italic> and <italic>Sirt3</italic> knockdown conditions in the presence or absence of HIF-1α inhibitor (chetomin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Viziteu et al., 2016</xref>).

Together, our results implicate the role of SIRT1 in governing glycolytic shift in the infected macrophages by deacetylating HIF1α. Upon SIRT1 knockdown or inhibition, HIF1α gets hyperacetylated, which causes activation of the downstream glycolytic genes. Alternatively, several key literature suggest the role of SIRT3 in modulating metabolic programming by deacetylating several proteins involved in FAO, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirschey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). PDHA1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit alpha) is a key enzyme linking glycolysis to TCA cycle and OXPHOS. SIRT3 regulates PDHA1 acetylation by deacetylating PDHA1 at lysine 385 residue, thereby playing a key role in metabolic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). PDHA1 acetylation coincides with PDH activity and increased PDHA1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the role of SIRT3 in the modulation of host FAO upon <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection in RAW 264.7 macrophages. To do so, we immunoprecipitated PDHA1 and checked for its interaction with SIRT3 or SIRT1 under the knockdown condition of SIRT3 or upon SIRT3 inhibitor treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H, I and J</xref>). We observed an increased interaction of PDHA1 with SIRT3 in the infection scenario in comparison to the uninfected control, which gets eventually abolished under the knockdown condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H and I</xref>) and under the chemical inhibitor treatment of SIRT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J, K and L</xref>) suggesting the role of the SIRT3 in mediating the interaction with PDHA1. Alongside the decreased interaction of PDHA1 with SIRT3, increased acetylation of PDHA1 was detected upon SIRT3 inhibitor treatment in infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K and L</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>SIRT1 inhibition triggers hyperacetylation of glycolytic master regulator HIF-1α within <italic>S</italic>.

Following the inhibitor treatment, the mice were orally gavaged with 10<sup>7</sup> CFU of <italic>S. Typhimurium</italic> 14028S for organ burden evaluation or with 10<sup>8</sup> CFU of wildtype <italic>S. Typhimurium</italic> for survival studies. On day 5<sup>th</sup> post-infection, mice were sacrificed, and the liver, spleen and Mesenteric Lymph Node (MLN) were harvested for enumeration of the organ burden. The SIRT1 inhibitor, EX-527 and SIRT3 inhibitor, 3TYP-treated mice cohorts exhibited increased organ loads in liver, spleen and MLN in comparison to the vehicle control. On the contrary, the SRT1720 treated mice group showed organ burden comparable to that of the vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Moreover, the SIRT1 and the SIRT3 inhibitor-treated mice cohorts died earlier than the vehicle-treated control mice group or the SIRT1 activator-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Further, the SIRT1 and the SIRT3 inhibitor-treated mice cohorts showed increased splenic length in comparison to the vehicle-treated mice group and the SIRT1 activator-treated mice cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The increased organ burden in the EX-527 or 3TYP treated group might be due to increased bacterial dissemination in blood. To assess bacterial dissemination, blood was collected from infected mice post-inhibitor treatment at specific days post-infection retro-orbitally and plated onto <italic>Salmonella Shigella</italic> (SS) agar plates for bacterial enumeration. Indeed, increased bacterial dissemination was observed in the blood of mice treated with SIRT1 inhibitor, EX-527 or SIRT3 inhibitor, 3TYP at day 1-, 2-, 3- ,4- post-infection in comparison to the vehicle-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Further, we wanted to examine whether the increased bacterial dissemination was due to increased ROS production or due to the presence of elevated inflammatory cytokine levels like IL-6 and IL-1β. In the wildtype C57BL/6 mice treated with SIRT3 inhibitor 3TYP showed heightened bacterial burden in blood at 5<sup>th</sup> day post-infection in comparison to the vehicle control. Nevertheless, the <italic>Cybb</italic>-/- mice group lacking the catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase did not depict significant variation in the bacterial load among the different mice treatment cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Further, the EX-527 (SIRT1 inhibitor) and the 3TYP (SIRT3 inhibitor) treated mice possessed elevated levels of serum IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>), IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and showed increased intracellular ROS burden in infected liver tissues in comparison to the vehicle-treated control and the SRT1720 (SIRT1 activator) treated mice group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). The increased mouse serum IL-6 and IL-1β production was in a similar line with the increased IL-6 or IL-1β cytokine generation in EX-527 or 3TYP treated peritoneal macrophages under the infection scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-E</xref>). Moreover, estimation of IL-1β within the infected intestinal ileal sections of the mice revealed increased pro-inflammatory IL-1β generation in the SIRT1 and SIRT3 inhibitor-treated mice groups in comparison to the untreated or the SIRT1-activator treated mice cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). However, contrary to the in vitro studies wherein <italic>Sirt1</italic> or <italic>Sirt3</italic> knockdown or inhibition resulted in attenuated intracellular proliferation, here in in vivo mouse model of infection, we observed increased bacterial organ loads owing to increased bacterial dissemination. To delineate this observation further, we evaluated the bacterial load within splenocytes isolated from control or inhibitor-treated C57BL/6 mice infected with GFP expressing <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium at 5<sup>th</sup> day post-infection via flow cytometry. We observed heightened bacterial load in the EX-527 or the 3TYP treated mice cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A-B</xref>). However, when we enumerated the bacterial count within the F4/80+ macrophage population of the infected splenocytes, we noticed decreased bacterial loads in the EX-527 or 3TYP -treated mice group in comparison to the vehicle-treated control group or the SRT-1720 activator-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C-D</xref>). Further, we evaluated additional splenic populations including CD45+, Ly6C+, and CD11c+ populations. Our results show that the CD45+ splenic population depicts increased bacterial loads like that of the total splenic population within the SIRT1 or SIRT3 inhibitor-treated cohorts. However, CD45+ monocytes and Ly6C positive splenic population exhibit compromised burden within the SIRT1 and SIRT3 inhibitor-treated cohorts. Moreover, CD11c+ population, CD45+ granulocytes, or lymphocytes show comparable organ loads to that of the vehicle control or SIRT1 activator-treated mice group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E-K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>). Overall, our data suggest heterogeneous bacterial burden in diverse splenic populations. This opposing phenotype could be attributed to the increased IL-6 and IL-1β cytokine storm and elevated ROS production upon the SIRT1 or SIRT3 inhibitor treatment which in turn resulted in bacterial dissemination in vivo and concomitantly restricted the in vitro intracellular proliferation within macrophages. To validate this observation, we estimated the ROS levels within the liver and spleen tissues harvested from <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infected C57BL/6 mice, treated with specific catalytic inhibitor, activator or vehicle via DCFDA staining using flow cytometry at 5<sup>th</sup> day post-infection. We detected escalated levels of ROS within both the infected liver and spleen tissues of the EX-527 or 3TYP-treated mice groups in comparison to the vehicle-treated or the SRT1720 treated mice cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Haematoxylin and eosin staining of the liver sections (harvested at 5<sup>th</sup> day post-infection) revealed increased inflammation with multiple areas of severe acute hepatic necrosis with complete loss of hepatic architecture in the EX-527 and 3-TYP treated liver samples in comparison to the vehicle-treated control and SRT-1720 treated liver samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A-B</xref>).

We have validated such findings and further elaborated it by depicting the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in the modulation of host immune responses as well as host–bacterial metabolism. <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection modulates the expression profile of both SIRT1 and SIRT3 in the infected macrophages at both mRNA and protein level via its SPI-2 effector. Downregulation of <italic>Sirt1</italic> and <italic>Sirt3</italic> through shRNA-mediated knockdown resulted in heightened pro-inflammatory immune responses with increased production of IL-6, IL-1β cytokines and decreased surface expression of anti-inflammatory CD206. SIRT1 and SIRT3 downregulation also resulted in increased intracellular ROS production in the infected macrophages. <italic>Sirt1</italic> and <italic>Sirt3</italic> knockdown macrophages not only show altered host immune status but also depict shift in the metabolic state with increased glycolytic shift. This altered host metabolism upon <italic>Sirt1</italic> and <italic>Sirt3</italic> knockdown condition influences the outcome of infection by regulating the intracellular bacterial metabolism, which shows reduced bacterial glycolysis and increased FAO. All these outcomes account for attenuated intracellular bacterial proliferation in the <italic>Sirt1</italic> and <italic>Sirt3</italic> knockdown macrophages. However, in murine model of infection, SIRT1 or SIRT3 inhibitor treatment led to increased organ burden and triggered bacterial dissemination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, our study highlights the crucial role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in governing the host immune-metabolic shift during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, which in turn is vital for maintaining <italic>Salmonella</italic> metabolism.</p><p>Previous reports have elucidated the role of SIRT1 and SIRT2 pertaining to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Ganesan et al. have depicted the role of SIRT1 in autophagy in <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ganesan et al., 2017</xref>). Gogoi et al. have demonstrated SIRT2-mediated modulation of immune responses in dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gogoi et al., 2018</xref>). To date, there is no report highlighting the role of SIRT3 governing the <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis. The function of SIRT3 in infection scenario has been explored quite recently. In <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection condition, SIRT3 control mitochondrial function and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). SIRT3 downregulation in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected macrophages is associated with dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism and increased cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smulan et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we have explored the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in mediating host immune-metabolic switch in <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium-infected macrophages, which further govern intracellular bacterial metabolism and pathogenesis.</p><p>Our findings suggest the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in mediating polarization of the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory state. Upon knockdown of <italic>Sirt1</italic> and <italic>Sirt3</italic> in the infected macrophages, we detect robust pro-inflammatory response and oxidative burst. This is in line with the findings by Elsela et al., wherein SIRT1 knockout respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-infected Bone marrow derived dendritic cells, BMDCs showed significant increase in <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Il6,</italic> and <italic>Il23</italic> expression and ROS generation in comparison to the wildtype RSV-infected BMDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elesela et al., 2020</xref>). Also, Kim et al. showed presence of aggravated inflammatory responses in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected <italic>Sirt3</italic>-/- Bone marrow derived macrophages, BMDMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). This heightened pro-inflammatory cytokine and oxidative burst restrict the intracellular survival of the pathogen as detected by the lower intracellular bacterial burden in the <italic>Sirt1</italic> and <italic>Sirt3</italic> knockdown murine macrophages. <italic>Salmonella</italic> showed enhanced proliferation in the M2 macrophages owing to the reduced arsenals in terms of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS production. Moreover, the M2 macrophages are fuelled by increased FAO and reduced glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eisele et al., 2013</xref>). This might facilitate enhanced bacterial proliferation as the host unutilized intracellular glucose can be readily up taken by the pathogen and used to support its own glycolysis. Similarly, M1 or pro-inflammatory macrophages resort to glycolysis to meet their energy demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cramer et al., 2003</xref>), thereby limiting the glucose availability for the intracellular pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cramer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Merrill et al., 1997</xref>). In such conditions, bacteria show enhanced fatty acid metabolism to sustain their energy demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reens et al., 2019</xref>). In our study, we found that wildtype <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection drives host metabolism toward increased FAO via its SPI-2 effector protein with concomitant increase in the bacterial glycolysis. SIRT1 and SIRT3 inhibition abrogates the metabolic switch and triggers increase in host glycolysis, which in turn skew the bacterial metabolism from increased glycolysis to enhanced FAO and reduced glycolysis. Together, these findings implicate the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in reprogramming the host metabolism, which in turn affect the intracellular nutrient niche of the pathogen, thereby influencing intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> proliferation. However, our in vivo findings in the murine model of infection show increased bacterial burden upon SIRT1 or SIRT3 inhibition. This increased burden could be attributed to increased dissemination from the macrophages into the bloodstream owing to the increased level of serum IL-6 levels. This is in concert with previous findings in <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> infection in mice wherein increased inflammatory response upon HIF-1α activation induces bacterial dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holden et al., 2016</xref>). Further correlation analysis of immune responses to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection revealed that increased innate immune ‘cassette’ opposes the adaptive immune arm, leading to increased bacterial load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hotson et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, previous literature studies suggested that a low dose of Sirt1 activator such as resveratrol treatment in rats for 25-day treatment under 5% dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis condition led to alterations in gut microbiota profile with increased lactobacilli and bifidobacteria alongside a reduced abundance of enterobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lakhan and Kirchgessner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Larrosa et al., 2009</xref>). This study correlates with our study wherein we have detected enhanced <italic>Salmonella</italic> (belonging to Enterobacteriaceae family) loads under both SIRT1/3 in vivo knockdown or inhibitor-treated condition in C57BL/6 mice alongside reduced burden under SIRT1 activator, SRT1720 treatment.</p><p>Future studies might explore the host and bacterial interacting partners of SIRT1 and SIRT3 through mass spectrometry analyses in <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected macrophages, which might hint at the underlying mechanism of their action and regulation. Together, this study highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of host–pathogen interactions, and the need for further research to fully understand the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in the context of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium ATCC strain 14028S (STM)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC strain 14028S – gfted by Prof. M.

Mann –Whitney <italic>t</italic>-test was used as a non-parametric counterpart of Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test when variances differed. Adjusted p-values&lt;0.05 are considered statistically significant. The results are expressed as mean ± SD or SEM of three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Materials availability statement</title><p>Materials are available upon request and availability.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines of the institutional animal ethics committee at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India (Registration No: 48/1999/CPCSEA).

Thank you for appreciating the merit of our manuscript. As rightly pointed out by the eminent reviewer, we acknowledge the probable link of Sirtuin on gut microbiota and its effect on increased bacterial loads as indicated by previous literature studies (PMID: 22115311, PMID: 19228061). These reports suggested that a low dose of Sirt1 activator, resveratrol treatment in rats for 25 days treatment under 5% DSS induced colitis condition led to alterations in gut microbiota profile with increased lactobacilli and bifidobacteria alongside reduced abundance of enterobacteria. This study correlates with our study wherein we have detected enhanced <italic>Salmonella</italic> (belonging to Enterobacteriaceae family) loads under both Sirt1/3 in vivo knockdown condition or inhibitor-treated condition in C57BL/6 mice and reduced burden under Sirt-1 activator treatment SRT1720.</p><p>As per your valid suggestion, we have discussed this possibility in our discussion section.

In the revised manuscript, we aimed to eliminate the low-quality data sets and have tried to substantiate them with better and conclusive ones, as directed in the recommendations for the author section. We agree with the reviewer that the inclusion of both Sirtuins 1 and 3 has resulted in too many pathways and mechanisms and focusing on one SIRT and its mechanism of metabolic reprogramming and immune modulation would have been a less complicated alternative approach. However, as rightly pointed out, our work demonstrated the shared and few overlapping roles of the two sirtuins, SIRT1 and SIRT3, together mediating the immune-metabolic switch upon <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have performed additional experiments with HIF-1α inhibitor treatment in our revised manuscript to substantiate our correlative findings on SIRT1-mediated regulation of host glycolysis (Fig.7G). We wanted to clarify our claim in this regard. Our results suggested that loss of SIRT1 function triggered increased host glycolysis alongside hyperacetylation of HIF-1α. HIF-1α is reported to be one of the important players in glycolysis regulation (Kierans SJ, Taylor CT. Regulation of glycolysis by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF): implications for cellular physiology. J Physiol. 2021;599(1):23-37. doi:10.1113/JP280572.) and additionally, SIRT1 has been shown to regulate HIF-1α acetylation status (Lim JH, Lee YM, Chun YS, Chen J, Kim JE, Park JW. Sirtuin 1 modulates cellular responses to hypoxia by deacetylating hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha. Mol Cell. 2010;38(6):864-878. doi:10.1016/j.molcel.2010.05.023.) Further, ectopic expression of SIRT1 has been demonstrated to reduce glycolysis by negatively regulating HIF-1α. (Wang Y, Bi Y, Chen X, et al. Histone Deacetylase SIRT1 Negatively Regulates the Differentiation of Interleukin-9-Producing CD4(+) T Cells. Immunity. 2016;44(6):1337-1349. doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2016.05.009). We have subsequently shown in Fig. 7G, that the increase in host glycolysis upon SIRT knockdown in the infected macrophages gets lowered upon HIF-1α inhibitor treatment, suggesting that one of the mechanisms of SIRT-mediated regulation of host glycolysis is via regulation of HIF-1α. However, this warrants further future mechanistic research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figures 8I-S: are only viable cells used for analysis?

We have re-evaluated the intensities on imageJ and have provided with the correct band intensities. We are highly apologetic for the inaccuracies.</p><p>As per the reviewer’s previous suggestion, we have performed additional experiments with HIF-1α inhibitor treatment in our revised manuscript to substantiate our correlative findings on SIRT1-mediated regulation of host glycolysis (Fig.7G). We wanted to clarify our claim in this regard. Our results suggested that loss of SIRT1 function triggered increased host glycolysis alongside hyperacetylation of HIF-1α. HIF-1α is reported to be one of the important players of glycolysis regulation (Kierans SJ, Taylor CT. Regulation of glycolysis by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF): implications for cellular physiology. J Physiol. 2021;599(1):23-37. doi:10.1113/JP280572.) and additionally, SIRT1 has been shown to regulate HIF-1α acetylation status (Lim JH, Lee YM, Chun YS, Chen J, Kim JE, Park JW. Sirtuin 1 modulates cellular responses to hypoxia by deacetylating hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha. Mol Cell. 2010;38(6):864-878. doi:10.1016/j.molcel.2010.05.023.) Further, ectopic expression of SIRT1 has been demonstrated to reduce glycolysis by negatively regulating HIF-1α. (Wang Y, Bi Y, Chen X, et al. Histone Deacetylase SIRT1 Negatively Regulates the Differentiation of Interleukin-9-Producing CD4(+) T Cells. Immunity. 2016;44(6):1337-1349. doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2016.05.009). We have subsequently shown in Fig. 7G, that the increase in host glycolysis upon SIRT knockdown in the infected macrophages gets lowered upon HIF-1α inhibitor treatment, suggesting that one of the mechanisms of SIRT-mediated regulation of host glycolysis is via regulation of HIF-1α. However, this warrants further future mechanistic research.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s claim of increased HIF-1α acetylation in the UI sh1 versus UI SCR. The apparent reduced acetylation depicted in UI sh1 in Fig. 7B could be attributed to lower HIF-1α levels in the UI sh1 compared to UI SCR. Therefore, we have provided an alternate blot image that been used for quantification in Fig. 7C (Author response image 6).</p><p>To answer the reviewer’s question in Fig. 7D, we have noticed more or less equal degree of immunoprecipitation of HIF-1α under pull down of HIF-1α in all the sample cohorts under conditions of SIRT1 inhibitor treatment. However, we have observed reduced interaction of HIF-1α with SIRT1 in the infected sample upon SIRT1 inhibitor treatment.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting improvements in the blot labelling and for raising this concern. We have corrected the blot labelling to avoid the previous confusion.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern and therefore we have provided an alternate blot image for Fig. 7H which might address the previous stated concern wherein we have achieved an enhanced SIRT3 knockdown percentage.</p><p>We are extremely apologetic for the improper labelling of the Input blot with unmarked lanes. We have addressed this issue by labelling the lanes in the input section of the blots.</p></body></sub-article></article>
