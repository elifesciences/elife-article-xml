chloroplast unfolded protein response (cpUPR). We isolated <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> mutants that disrupt cpUPR signaling and identified a gene encoding a previously uncharacterized cytoplasmic protein kinase, termed Mars1—for <underline>m</underline>utant <underline>a</underline>ffected in chloroplast-to-nucleus <underline>r</underline>etrograde <underline>s</underline>ignaling—as the first known component in cpUPR signal transmission. Lack of cpUPR induction in <italic>MARS1</italic> mutant cells impaired their ability to cope with chloroplast stress, including exposure to excessive light. Conversely, transgenic activation of cpUPR signaling conferred an advantage to cells undergoing photooxidative stress. Our results indicate that the cpUPR mitigates chloroplast photodamage and that manipulation of this pathway is a potential avenue for engineering photosynthetic organisms with increased tolerance to chloroplast stress.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Life on Earth crucially depends on photosynthesis, the process by which energy stored in sunlight is harnessed to convert carbon dioxide into sugars and oxygen. In plants and algae, photosynthesis occurs in specialized cellular compartments called chloroplasts. Inside chloroplasts, complex molecular machines absorb light and channel its energy into the appropriate chemical reactions. These machines are composed of proteins that need to be assembled and maintained. However, proteins can become damaged, and when this occurs, they must be recognized, removed, and replaced.</p><p>When exposed to bright light, the photosynthetic machinery is pushed into overdrive and protein damage is accelerated. In response, the chloroplast sends an alarm signal to activate a protective system called the “chloroplast unfolded protein response”, or cpUPR for short. The cpUPR leads to the production of specialized proteins that help protect and repair the chloroplast.</p><p>It was not known how plants and algae evaluate the level of damaged proteins in the chloroplast, or which signals trigger the cpUPR. To address these questions, Perlaza et al. designed a method to identify the molecular components of the alarm signal. These experiments used specially engineered cells from the algae <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> that fluoresced when the cpUPR was activated. Perlaza et al. mutagenized these cells – that is, damaged the cells’ DNA to cause random changes in the genetic code. If a mutagenized cell no longer fluoresced in response to protein damage, it indicated that communication between protein damage and the cpUPR had been broken. In other words, the mutation had damaged a piece of DNA that encoded a protein critical for activating the cpUPR.</p><p>These experiments identified one protein – which Perlaza et al. named Mars1 – as a crucial molecular player that is required to trigger the cpUPR. Algal cells with defective Mars1 were more vulnerable to chloroplast damage, including that caused by excessive light.</p><p>These discoveries in algae will serve as a foundation for understanding the mechanism and significance of the cpUPR in land plants. Perlaza et al. also found that mild artificial activation of the cpUPR could preemptively guard cells against damaged chloroplast proteins. This suggests that the cpUPR could be harnessed in agriculture, for example, to help crop plants endure harsher climates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>organellar

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In photosynthetic eukaryotes chloroplasts fulfill many essential functions such as photosynthetic conversion of light into chemical energy, synthesis of essential amino acids, fatty acids and other secondary metabolites. Moreover, they act as signaling platforms during plant development and stress adaptation, as they can alter the expression of thousands of nuclear genes and influence many cellular activities that are key to plant performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2016</xref>). Selective impairment of protein homeostasis in chloroplasts triggers the chloroplast unfolded protein response (cpUPR), a conserved organelle quality control pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramundo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Llamas et al., 2017</xref>). Akin to unfolded protein responses operating from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shpilka and Haynes, 2018</xref>), the cpUPR invokes comprehensive transcriptional changes thought to mitigate an increased burden of proteotoxicity in the organelle. As such, the cpUPR comprises the selective up-regulation of nuclear encoded chloroplast-localized small heat shock proteins, chaperones, proteases, and proteins involved in chloroplast membrane biogenesis. Furthermore, other pathways, such as autophagy and sulfur uptake are activated to mitigate general cellular stress caused by chloroplast metabolic dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramundo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the single-celled alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,</italic> the cpUPR is induced after either inactivation of the Clp protease, which degrades misfolded chloroplast proteins in the organelle’s stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), or exposure to higher than normal light intensity (high light ‘HL’), which causes protein damage through the production of reactive oxygen species in the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramundo et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, in higher plants, mutants with constitutively reduced levels of the Clp and FtsH proteases selectively upregulate the expression of chloroplast chaperones, such as Cpn60, Hsp70, Hsp90, Hsp100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Llamas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zybailov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sjögren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rudella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dogra et al., 2019</xref>). However, the mechanism by which chloroplast proteotoxic stress is monitored and how the signal is transmitted from the organelle to the nucleus has remained unknown.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reporter strain for high-throughput screening for cpUPR mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of cpUPR regulation in the reporter strain.

The two remaining mutants exhibited a complete defect in the induction of the cpUPR target genes upon ClpP1 repression, demonstrated by their lack of Vipp2 and Hsp22E/F, another strongly induced protein during the cpUPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramundo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rütgers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

To corroborate this conclusion, we picked two additional <italic>MARS1</italic> loss-of-function alleles from a <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> mutant library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2019</xref>). As predicted, these mutants —<italic>mars1-3</italic> and <italic>mars1-4</italic>, carrying insertions in <italic>MARS1</italic> intron 19 and exon 18, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>)— were defective in inducing Vipp2 upon exposure to HL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

By contrast, we detected residual <italic>MARS1</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>mars1-1</italic> cells, suggesting that a strong reduction in <italic>MARS1</italic> gene expression is sufficient to impair activation of the cpUPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E</xref>).</p><p>The Phytozome-annotated (URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html">https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html</ext-link>) <italic>MARS1</italic> gene model specifies an unusually long 5’ untranslated region (5' UTR) that spans the first five exons of <italic>MARS1</italic> and predicts that the start site of the <italic>MARS1</italic> open reading frame is in the middle of exon 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, ATG(<italic>ii</italic>)). However, in the same gene model, an alternative in-frame translation start-site can be found in exon 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, ATG(<italic>i</italic>)). Interestingly, the coding sequence starting from ATG(<italic>ii</italic>) would give rise to a Mars1 protein with a potential N-terminal chloroplast target peptide, while the 138aa N-terminal extension translated from the alternative start codon ATG(<italic>i</italic>) predicts a Mars1 protein with a cytosolic localization. For complementation analyses, we generated two epitope-tagged <italic>MARS1</italic> transgenes (<italic>MARS1-A</italic> and <italic>MARS1-D</italic>). These two transgenes include the endogenous promoter, 5’UTR and 3’UTR, but the 3x-Flag epitope is in different positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In <italic>MARS1-A</italic>, we placed the 3x-Flag far downstream of the two putative translation start sites, yet upstream of the putative kinase domain. In <italic>MARS1-D</italic>, we placed the 3x-Flag epitope directly after ATG(<italic>ii</italic>), at the beginning of the putative N-terminal chloroplast target peptide that might be translated from this potential start site. Immunoblot and qPCR analyses of Vipp2 and Hsp22E/F confirmed that expression of either transgene could rescue the cpUPR-silencing phenotype of the <italic>MARS1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Moreover, the Mars1 protein could be detected by Flag immunoblot analysis not only in the case of <italic>MARS1-A</italic> but also when the <italic>MARS1-D</italic> transgene was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Since the N-terminus of chloroplast stromal proteins is cleaved and promptly degraded upon organellar import, this result suggested that Mars1 was translated from ATG(<italic>i</italic>) and, therefore, would likely be localized in the cytosol. To support this notion, we performed biochemical fractionation and dual immunofluorescence microscopy using the internally tagged <italic>MARS1</italic> transgene (<italic>MARS1-A</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).

Activation of cpUPR through Mars1 mitigates photooxidative stress and delays photobleaching. However, loss of Mars1 does not impair expression of genes involved in non-photochemical quenching. Thus, the exact mechanism by which the cpUPR pathway confers photoprotection remains to be deciphered. Input conditions that activate the cpUPR, as well as cpUPR target genes identified to date, are phylogenetically conserved from <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Llamas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zybailov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D’Andrea et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, despite not yet having identified a functional ortholog of <italic>MARS1</italic> in higher plants, it is reasonable to assume that the cpUPR’s previously unknown role in protecting cells against photooxidative stress would likewise be conserved. This notion is particularly appealing in light of the observation that basal induction of the cpUPR conferred a protective effect in response to stress and that, conversely, loss of Mars1 activity profoundly sensitized cells towards HL and other chloroplast stressors. Hence, engineering plants with constitutive cpUPR activation may be a promising strategy to enhance their tolerance to environmental stresses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>)</td><td><italic>clpP1</italic></td><td>GenBank</td><td>L28803.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>)</td><td><italic>VIPP2</italic></td><td>Phytozome</td><td>Cre11.g468050</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>)</td><td><italic>MARS1</italic></td><td>Phytozome</td><td>Cre16.g692228</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>YFP 3x-FLAG</td><td>GenBank</td><td>ANF29833.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pMJ016c</td><td>GenBank</td><td>KX077951.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-ClpP1</td><td>gift from Francis-André Wollman <break/>and Olivier Vallon</td><td/><td>1:5000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Vipp2 (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>developed during this study</td><td/><td>(1:3000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-FLAG (mouse, monoclonal)</td><td>Sigma</td><td>F1804</td><td>(1:3000 for IB; 1:500 for IF)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Hsp22E/F (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>gift from Michael Schroda</td><td/><td>(1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-DnaK (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>gift from Jean David Rochaix</td><td/><td>(1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-α tubulin (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>Sigma</td><td>T5168</td><td>(1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Histone H3 (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>Agrisera</td><td>AS10 710</td><td>(1:10000 for <break/>IB; 1:500 for IF)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-AtpD (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>Agrisera</td><td>AS10 1590</td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Nab1 (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>Agrisera</td><td>AS08 333</td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-AtpD (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>Agrisera</td><td>AS10 1590</td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-RpoA (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>gift from Jean David Rochaix</td><td/><td>(1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-holo Rubisco (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>gift from Jean David <break/>Rochaix</td><td/><td>(1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Aox1 <break/>(rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>Agrisera</td><td>AS06 152</td><td>(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Sultr2 (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>gift from Arthur Grossman</td><td/><td>(1:3000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Hsp90 (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>Agrisera</td><td>AS06 174</td><td>(1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>71086–3</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>F530L</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>PureYield Plasmid Miniprep System</td><td>Promega</td><td>A1222</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up</td><td>Clontech</td><td>740609</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus</td><td>Zymo Research</td><td>R2070</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Alexa Fluor 488 Tyramide SuperBoost Kit, goat anti-mouse IgG</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>B40941</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>In-Fusion HD cloning plus</td><td>Takara</td><td>638910</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>CircLigase II ssDNA</td><td>Epicentre</td><td>CL9025K</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>PrimeScript 1 st strand cDNA Synthesis Kit</td><td>Takara</td><td>6110A</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="bottom">iQ SYBR Green Supermix -

All PCRsPCRse performed using Phusion Hotstart II polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). PCR products were gel-extracted using NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-Up Kit (Takara) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and they were further purified by ultrapurephenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v) (Life Technologies) extraction and ice-cold ethanol (Sigma) precipitation. These three purified DNA fragments were then mixed with a purified and linearized pHyg3 vector, previously digested by PciI and EcoRV, and incubated with the In-Fusion reagents (Takara) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The In-Fusion product was transformed in Stellar competent cells (Takara) according to manufacturer’s instructions and putative positive clones were selected in LB solid media (1.7% agar) supplemented with ampicillin after overnight incubation. The resulting plasmid, pPW3217, was purified using the Kit PureYield Plasmid Miniprep System (Promega) and verified by analytical digestion and sequencing.

A 6 ml aliquot of a liquid TAP culture in mid-log phase were spun down, and the media was decanted. The pellet was resuspended in 400 µl of water and then 1 vol of 2x DNA lysis buffer was added (200 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 6% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS), 2 mM EthyleneDiamineTetraAcetic acid (EDTA). To digest proteins, 5 µl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K (Life Technologies) was added and allowed to incubate at Room Temperature (RT) for 15 min. 200 µl of 5M NaCl was then added and mixed gently. Next, to selectively precipitate nucleic acids, 160 µl of 10% cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) (EMD Millipore) in 0.7 M NaCl was added and allowed to sit for 10 min at 65°C with gentle agitation. Two or more consecutive rounds of DNA extraction using ultrapure phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v) were performed to achieve a clean interphase. Then, the upper aqueous phase was retained and mixed with 1 vol of 2-propanol (Sigma). This was mixed gently for 15 min at RT. Then it was spun down for half an hour at 21,000 x g at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and 1 vol of ice-cold 70% ethanol was added and mixed with the pellet. This mixture was spun down for 15 min at 21,000 x g. The supernatant was removed and the DNA precipitate was dried in a speed-vac for about 10–25 min and resuspended in 40 µl of nuclease-free water (Ambion). To ensure complete removal of any potential RNA contamination, in most cases, the gDNA prep was then subjected to in-solution ribonuclease treatment using Rnase A/Rnase T1 mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, the gDNA was quickly repurified through an additional round of DNA extraction using ultrapure phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v) and 2-propanol precipitation as described above.</p><p>The purity of the gDNA prep was assessed by Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific), ensuring absorbance ratios at 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm to be ~1.8 and ~2.0, respectively, prior to using the gDNA preparation for most of the follow-up applications. For the pooled (whole genome sequencing) DNA samples, the genomic DNA extraction was performed with the following protocol adapted from the Qiagen, DNeasy Plant Mini Kit using its proprietary buffers (Buffer P3, AW1, AW2, AE). A 25 ml culture of each progeny was grown for ~2 days to about 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells ml<sup>−1</sup>. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 0.5 ml of SDS-EB lysis buffer buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O, 2% SDS, 1% Polyvinylpyrrolidone -average molecular weight = 40,000-, 1 mg/ml of proteinase K) and allowed to incubate for ~10 min. One volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v) was added and mixed vigorously. The mixture was spun at 13,500 x g for 5 min at RT. The upper phase was transferred into new Eppendorf tubes and 5 µl of 100 mg/ml of RNase A, was added and incubated at RT for 30 min. The lysate was mixed with 130 µl aliquot of Buffer P3 and incubated on ice for 5 min. This mixture was spun at 18,400 x g for 5 min at RT. The lysate was transferred to the QIAshredder Mini column and spun for 18,500 x g for 2 min. The flow-through fraction was transferred into a new tube and 1.5 volumes of Buffer AW1 was added to the cleared lysate and mixed well. This mixture was then transferred to a DNeasy Mini column and spun at 7600 x g for 1 min. The flow-through fraction was discarded and this step was repeated for any remaining mixture. The DNeasy Mini column was transferred to a new collection tube and 500 µl of Buffer AW2 was added, centrifuged at 7600 x g for 1 min and the flow-through discarded. Another 500 µl of Buffer AW2 was added and centrifuged at 18,400 x g to dry the membrane. The column was then transferred to a new Eppendorf tube. 90 µl of Buffer AE was added onto the DNeasy membrane and incubated for 5 min at RT. The DNA was eluted by centrifugation at 7600 x <italic>g</italic> for 1 min. This step was repeated again, using the 90 µl of Buffer AE collected after the first centrifugation. The quality of the DNA samples was assessed by Nanodrop as described above.

A pure genomic DNA preparation was assured by running the DNA on a 1.5% agar gel prior to starting. A single-stranded DNA fragment was generated by extending a biotinylated primer from the cassette to the flanking DNA using either primer oMJ598 or primer oMJ1234, which anneals to the 3’ or 5’ end of the mutagenic cassette, respectively. The linear extension mix was set in the following way: 500 ng of gDNA, 2 µl of 0.25 µM of biotinylated primer, 0.5 µl of Phusion Hot Start Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 µl of Phusion GC buffer, 3 µl of DMSO, 1 µl of 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 µl of 10 mM dNTPs. Prior to starting the mix, the GC buffer was thawed, heated to 95°C for five minutes, vortexed and then put back on ice until the solution became completely clear. The linear extension reaction was carried out in a thermocycler with the following program: Stage 1) 98°C for 3 min; Stage 2) 98°C for 10 s, 65°C for 30 s, 72°C for 18 s (40 cycles). This program was run twice and, in between the first run and the second run, 0.5 µl of Phusion Hot Start Polymerase was added. The Dynabeads kilobase Binder Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to purify the linear extension product. For each reaction, 8 µl of streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads) were transferred into an Eppendorf tube and washed in 100 µl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) up to four times using a DynaMag magnet (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Dynabeads were then washed once more in 20 µl of binding solution and gently resuspended in 100 µl of binding solution, pipetting up and down only a few times. Next, the beads were transferred in the PCR tube from the linear extension reaction described above. To allow efficient binding of the linear extension product to the streptavidin-couple magnetic beads, the samples were incubated overnight at RT on an overhead-rotating platform. The following day, the linear extension product was isolated and ligated to a single-strand DNA adaptor, per the following procedure. The beads were washed three times with 100 µl of PBS allowing 8 min incubation in between washes. At the end of the final wash, we ensured that all PBS was carefully removed to avoid interference with the ssDNA ligation reaction. A 20 µl ssDNA ligation reaction was added and gently mixed with the magnetic beads. The ligation mix contained 11.25 µl of H<sub>2</sub>O, 1 µl of 25 µM ssDNA adapter primer (oMJ619), 1 µl of 50 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 µl of 5 M betaine, 2 µl of CircLigase II reaction buffer, 0.75 µl of CircLigase II (Epicentre). The beads were transferred to the thermocycler, which was pre-heated to 60°C for 10 min. This mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 60°C. The beads were then washed three times with 100 µl of PBS as described above. Next, the ssDNA was converted to a dsDNA using primers annealing to the ligated adaptors at the ends of the ssDNA sequence. 1 µl of 25 µM of Primer 1 (see below), 1 µl of 25 µM of Primer 2 (oMJ621), 0.5 µl of Phusion HotStart, 10 µl of Phusion GC buffer, 32.5 µl of H<sub>2</sub>O, 3 µl of DMSO, 1 µl of 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 µl of 10 mM dNTPs and the template DNA (beads) were mixed together. Primer one depended on whether the original extension from the cassette was in the 5’ or 3’ orientation. If the 3’ cassette flanking primer (oMJ598) was used during the linear extension, primer T3_3’oMJ016c 11/23 was chosen. Instead, when the 5’ cassette flanking primer (oMJ1234) was used during linear extension, oMJ1239 was chosen. Primer 2 (oMJ621) annealed to the ligated adaptor. Both primers were designed to contain a binding site for the mutagenic cassette and a binding site for a T3 sequencing primer. The following amplification program was used: Stage 1) 98°C for 3 min, Stage 2) 98°C for 10 s, 63°C for 25 s, 72°C for 20 s (10 cycles), Stage 3) 98°C for 10 s, 72°C for 45 s (13 cycles). The dsDNA products were then run on a 1% gel. The DNA smears were cut out of the agarose gel, purified using NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-Up Kit (Takara) according to manufacturer’s instructions and subjected to Sanger Sequencing using a standard T3 sequencing primer. Finally, to identify the insertion site of the mutagenic cassette, the sequencing results were blasted in Phytozome, v5.5.

After ~1–2 weeks, the vegetative cells were scraped off using a small rectangular soft razor blade (Personna, .009’', two-facet aluminum blade) with gentle pressure on the agar. Zygotes adhere to the agar surface and can be recognized under a light microscope due to their darker and larger appearance. A 100 µl aliquot of liquid TAP medium was then added on top of the zygotes and a more rigid scalpel (Feather, N.2) was used to scrape the zygotes off the agar. A line was drawn onto the center of a fresh TAP 1.5% agar plate, and the zygotes were spotted along this line. The cells were then allowed to dry.

Under the dissection scope, tetrads and octads were found and dissected. Incomplete tetrads, full tetrads and octads were then re-arrayed onto TAP agar in a 96-array format and then replicated onto the appropriate drug resistances.

Slight modifications were applied during the HL assays described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and will be underscored below. Liquid cultures were started from TAP plates that had all been grown in dim light and in the same conditions. A small slab of cells was taken from the agar plate and resuspended in 28 ml of TAP media in 50 ml falcon tubes (Sarstedt). The Olympus Plastics brand product line from Genesee Scientific was avoided because there was a higher propensity for the cells to adhere to this plastic material. An equal slab of cells was used for each culture to approximate the same level of starting cells. Typically, the strains had been growing in fresh TAP agar for ~3–5 days. The cells were pre-conditioned in low light (~20–50 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) for about 38–44 hr. For the HL assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, the cells were preconditioned for slightly longer period,~3 days. The chlorophyll concentration of the cell cultures was measured using the methanol extraction method as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Porra et al. (1989)</xref>. At the above described time points, it was found to be ~13–18 µg/ml (HL assays described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>), or ~25 µg/ml (in the HL assays described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Cell cultures were then equally diluted to ~10 µg chlorophyll ml<sup>−1</sup> (in the case of the HL assays described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>), or to 7 µg chlorophyll ml<sup>−1</sup> (HL assays described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Chlorophyll concentrations were confirmed and, if needed, re-adjusted after dilution before HL was started. The final volume of cell culture used for high light treatment was ~26 ml in 50 ml Falcon tubes. During the high light treatment, the distance between the light source (Phlizon 2017, 2000W Plant LED Growth light) and the shaker was set to 25 cm. The HL intensity was measured at 1100 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> at the beginning of the experiment but was reduced to ~900 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> by the end of the experiment. On the right and left side of the shaker, two fans were turned on to keep the samples at RT and a Smart Sensor (SensorPush) was used to monitor temperature in real-time. Typically a 4°C increase in temperature (from 24.5°C to about 28.5°C) was measured after the cultures were shifted from the dim light growth setup to this HL setup. The light intensity at each position of the culture on the shaker was measured to ensure cells were getting the same number of photons (~50,000 LUX). The cultures in the Falcon tubes were taped (clear tape) onto the shaker and the shaker was set at 150 rpm. Chlorophyll measurements were taken at multiple time points of HL treatment (during HL assays described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and after 27 hr or 50 hr of HL treatment (during HL assays described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, respectively). Serial dilutions performed on cultures before and after the HL treatment were spotted onto TAP plates. Photographs of these plates were taken over time to track cell recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s3-21"><title>Metronidazole assays</title><p>For immunoblot analyses, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, cell cultures were grown in liquid TAP medium in a 50 ml Falcon tube for about two days to a chlorophyll concentration of 11 µg/ml in a volume of 30 ml. Cells were spun down and the pellet was resuspended in 1.5 ml of TAP. 0.3 ml of the resuspended pellet was then added to 10 ml of TAP with or without 1.1 mM metronidazole (Sigma). These cultures were then placed under white light (20–50 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) for 12–15 hr and then spun down and saved at −20°C or directly used for denaturing protein extraction as described above.</p><p>For growth tests on TAP agar supplemented with metronidazole, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>, strains were either manually re-streaked or robotically replicated from TAP agar plate to +/- 1.5 mM metronidazole TAP agar plates.</p><p>For dilution spot tests, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, cells were freshly inoculed from a 3-4 days old agar plate and grown in in falcon tubes for 2 days in a starting volume of 30 ml of TAP. After these 2 days of preconditioning, chlorophyll concentrations were normalized to be at ~18 µg/ml and serial dilutions of 1.5-fold were done in liquid TAP using a 96-well plate. Finally, 6 µl cells from each dilution series were spotted onto TAP agar plates with or without 2.2 mM metronidazole. Photographs were taken periodically to track growth over time.</p><p>Metronidazole is rather insoluble in aqueous solutions; therefore, it was always added (as powder) directly to the autoclaved liquid TAP medium at final concentrations of 1.1 mM, 1.5 mM or 2.2 mM.</p></sec><sec id="s3-22"><title>Flag affinity purification and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis</title><p>Mars1-D and Mars1-D KD strains were subjected to metronidazole treatment for 15 hr.

consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were largely positive about your work and appreciated your elegant forward genetic approach in order to identify novel molecular players involved in cpUPR. However, they also identified some shortcomings that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title of your manuscript claims that MARS confers photoprotection, however, photosynthetic parameters were not presented. The reviewers ask you to either balance your discussion or to substantiate your claims by including photosynthetic parameters of wt and mars1 mutants under stress.</p><p>2) The reviewers also pinpointed the paper lack of experimental evidences for kinase activity and signalling transduction function of MARS1. Please either provide additional evidences or adjust the manuscript.</p><p>3) Your data suggests that MARS1 is involved in cpUPR, but it would be nice to discuss whether it could have additional, cpUPR-independent roles.</p><p>Please see below the additional comments of the reviewers, which may guide you to further strengthen your manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript, to my knowledge, identifies and describes the first known component of the &quot;chloroplast unfolded protein response&quot; (cpUPR), a chloroplast to nucleus retrograde signaling pathway in the alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. Proteins often enter organellar compartments (i.e. ER, mitochondria and chloroplasts) in an unfolded state and must then be folded very quickly to avoid protein aggregation and cellular damage as a consequence. To prevent this type of damage from happening in chloroplasts cpUPR can be elicited. Stress such as excessive light can trigger cpUPR that will upregulate expression of nuclear-encoded chaperones, proteases and other factors aiding protein homeostasis. This manuscript describes an elegant high-throughput genetic screen (based on a riboswitch to turn off the chloroplast ClpP1 protease and activate cpUPR) in the <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> algal model system to identify components of the signaling pathway that relays proteotoxic signals emanating from the chloroplast to the nucleus. The screen identifies the cytoplasmic kinase MARS1 (mutant affected in chloroplast-to-nucleus retrograde signaling). In addition, a dominant active allele of MARS1 is shown to constitutively induce cpUPR and alleviate photooxidative stress. The authors suggest that the pathway could be engineered in photosynthetic organisms to increase tolerance to chloroplast stress.</p><p>This is a very original manuscript that would cater well to a wide interest audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. The claims of the paper are well supported by a wealth of data often obtained using state of the art techniques. Furthermore, the paper is expertly written and the figures are of excellent quality.</p><p>Regarding MARS1 cellular localization: from the Results and Discussion section, Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2A it was difficult to figure out the nature of MARS1-A (as well as -B, -C, -D). Could this be improved? Is it really necessary to mention the existence of a potential N-terminal chloroplast targeting signal if ATg(ii) would be the start codon? This was also somewhat unclear to me initially.</p><p>Stress in chloroplasts typically affects photosynthesis and this appears to be the case here as mars1 cells lacked photoprotection and exhibited accelerated photobleaching under highlight. It would therefore be really interesting to know whether and how photosynthetic parameters are affected by cpUPR and in the mars1 mutant. I'd consider such data standard in this type of study.</p><p>The discovery of MARS1 is exciting. It would be very nice to hear more about the authors' hypotheses on the mechanisms of MARS1-dependent signal transduction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript follows up on previous work performed by the corresponding author Ramundo that investigated how unfolded proteins in the chloroplast can be a retrograde stress signal in the green algae <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. Here, the authors attempt to identify signaling components of such a pathway by performing a clever and novel genetic screen in the same algae. They have constructed a strain with vitamin-inducible unfolded protein stress in the chloroplast and added a reporter construct with the YFP gene driven by the promoter of <italic>VIPP2</italic>, which is strongly induced by this particular retrograde signal. With this strain, they screened for mutants that failed to express YFP during the chloroplast unfolded protein response. Such mutants may be defective in their ability to send retrograde signals from stressed chloroplasts. Two true mutants were retrieved by the screen and both were alleles of <italic>MARS1</italic>, which encodes an uncharacterized cytoplasmic-localized kinase . The authors show that its kinase activity is required for the signals, and whole transcriptome analyses of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> show that this kinase is necessary to regulate about half of the genes controlled by the unfolded chloroplast protein response. Importantly, the authors show that the <italic>MARS1</italic> mutant cells are also sensitive to excess light and chloroplast hydrogen peroxide, demonstrating that the Mars1 protein is likely part of a physiologically relevant stress signal.</p><p>Altogether, this is very nicely performed work that should be of general interest to those in the field of abiotic stress signaling and organelles biology. I do however, think the manuscript feels a bit too compressed in parts and there are sections that could benefit from additional information, analysis, and detail (please see below).</p><p>Questions for the authors:</p><p>1) Can more information be provided about the Mars1 protein? What kind of domains does it have? Is it conserved among algae or plants? Are there any paralogues? etc. Are there any available bioinformatics data about expression at the transcript or protein level? Can any of this information provide clues to its function, localization, or evolutionary history?</p><p>2) For the complementation analysis, was flag-tagged Mars1 protein used? If so, this was not at all clear in the text. Again, more detail in the text will help to guide the reader through the manuscript.</p><p>3) The explanation of the localization studies were too brief. Please take the time to explain the experiment and how the conclusions were drawn. Also, was localization also tested under stress conditions? Perhaps MARS1 is mobile or uses alternative start sites.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript provides novel information on a gene related to a signal transduction pathway for a so-called chloroplast unfolded protein response (cpUPR). The authors constructed an elegant reporter system for screening mutants that had defects in inducing <italic>VIPP2</italic> promoter activity upon suppression of the ClpP1 protease in the chloroplast of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. Two mutants thus obtained were characterized in detail. In the case of the first mutant (<italic>mars1-1</italic>), a previously uncharacterized Ser/Thr kinase (Cre16.g692228) that they named Mars1 in this study was disrupted. Another mutant (mars1-2) also had a deletion encompassing <italic>MARS1</italic>. All mutants including two additional mutants from the CLiP library showed a similar phenotype. Moreover, they confirmed the lack of Mars1 transcript expression in the mutants and the phenotypic rescue of the mutants by the cDNA. The <italic>mars1</italic> phenotype was sensitive to a mutation in a possible Ser/Thr kinase domain. The <italic>mars1</italic> mutant did not express Vipp2 and Hsp22E/F and bleached under HL or under normal light in the presence of metronidazole. The mutants affected the expression of many high light-inducible genes, which seem to belong to a distinct cluster from that previously reported as NPQ related functions. Based on these results, the authors propose that a retrograde signal from the chloroplast activates the cytoplasmic kinase Mars1 upon chloroplast proteotoxic stress, which in turn orchestrates the cpUPR transcriptional program.</p><p>The experiments here were carefully performed, the presentations are mostly clear, and the methods are meticulously described. This is a solid study of a new possibly interesting kinase. On the whole, however, I got the impression that the research is just premature. I have a suggestion if this manuscript is eventually published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The nature of proteotoxic stress studies here should be more clarified.</p><p>As shown by the result, this cpUPR event led by Mars1 was not affected by tunicamycin, indicating it is independent of the stress due to the accumulation of premature proteins (UPR). The authors found it was promoted by either suppression of ClpP1 or HL stress in the chloroplast, suggesting cpUPR is rather dependent on the stress due to the accumulation of degraded proteins in the chloroplast. The two types of stress seem to be fundamentally distinct. In fact, if the current result is showing a mechanical relationship between UPR and cpUPR, that could be of broader interest. If the Mars1-dependent genes were involved in cpUPR, they would be induced under the conditions when ClpP1 was OFF and HL was illuminated. However, there were 43 Mars1-dependent genes among HL inducible genes including <italic>SIR</italic>, <italic>CHLM</italic>, <italic>DSS1</italic>, etc. that were not expressed under ClpP1 OFF conditions (Figure 5C). How to explain this?</p><p>The authors are encouraged to fill the fatal link between the proteotoxic stress and Mars1-dependent phosphorylation, preferably by determining the retrograde signal and/or the partner of the Mar1 kinase.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49577.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title of your manuscript claims that Mars1 confers photoprotection, however, photosynthetic parameters were not presented.

In brief, we provide clear evidence that Mars1 mitigates photooxidative stress and delays photobleaching. Moreover, loss of Mars1 does not impair expression of genes involved in non-photochemical quenching (Figure 5C), suggesting that photoprotection is conferred by a different mechanism. However, given the large number of photoprotective strategies that plants employ to cope with such stresses, determining the molecular mechanism(s) by which this occurs is not a straightforward undertaking that is beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers also pinpointed the paper lack of experimental evidences for kinase activity and signalling transduction function of Mars1.
