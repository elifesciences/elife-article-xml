An intriguing open question concerns how the various attributes of sensory neurons arise in development. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larvae undergo a behavioral transition by robustly activating a thermal nociceptive escape behavior during the second half of larval development (third instar). The Class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons are multimodal sensors which tile the body wall of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and detect nociceptive temperature, light, and mechanical force. In contrast to the increase in nociceptive behavior in the third instar, we find that ultraviolet light-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in C4da neurons decreases during the same period of larval development. Loss of ecdysone receptor has previously been shown to reduce nociception in third instar larvae. We find that ligand-dependent activation of ecdysone signaling is sufficient to promote nociceptive responses in second instar larvae and suppress expression of <italic>subdued</italic> (encoding a TMEM16 channel). Reduction of <italic>subdued</italic> expression in second instar C4da neurons not only increases thermal nociception but also decreases the response to ultraviolet light. Thus, steroid hormone signaling suppresses <italic>subdued</italic> expression to facilitate the sensory switch of C4da neurons. This regulation of a developmental sensory switch through steroid hormone regulation of channel expression raises the possibility that ion channel homeostasis is a key target for tuning the development of sensory modalities.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>During their lives, animals encounter a broad range of stimuli from their surroundings including heat, light and touch. The ability to appropriately respond to such stimuli is crucial for survival as it allows the animals to avoid predators and other dangers, locate food and shelter, and find mates.</p><p>Fruit fly larvae are a useful model for studying how animals respond to unpleasant (known as painful) heat stimuli. When something hot touches a larva, the larva rolls away to avoid the stimulus. The heat stimulates electrical activity in a type of neuron known as C4da neurons on the surface of the larva. Ultraviolet light and several other stimuli are also able to activate electrical activity in C4da neurons, resulting in the larvae changing the direction they move to avoid the stimuli.</p><p>Only older fly larvae respond to painful heat stimuli and previous studies found that a hormone receptor protein is required for this response. However, it remains unclear how this response develops as the larvae age.</p><p>Jaszczak et al. studied the behavior of fly larvae and electrical activities of C4da neurons in response to painful heat and ultraviolet light. The experiments found that painful heat triggered more rolling behavior from older larvae than those of younger larvae. In contrast, ultraviolet light triggered lower levels of electrical activity in the C4da neurons of older larvae than those of younger larvae. The team raised the levels of a hormone known as ecdysone and found that this increased the rolling behavior in younger larvae. They then increased the amount of receptor protein for this hormone in the neurons and found that it decreased the levels of another protein called Subdued in the C4da neurons. This in turn increased the neurons’ response to painful heat and decreased their response to ultraviolet light.</p><p>Jaszczak et al. propose that as the larva develops, ecdysone reduces the levels of Subdued, which promotes C4da neurons to switch their sensitivity from detecting ultraviolet light to painful heat. In the future, better understanding of what causes pain sensations in developing animals will help us search for factors that cause long-term pain conditions in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nociception</kwd><kwd>ecdysone</kwd><kwd>TMEM16 channel</kwd><kwd>da neuron</kwd><kwd>multimodal sensory processing</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM130019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaszczak</surname><given-names>Jacob S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS097227</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jan</surname><given-names>Yuh Nung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jan</surname><given-names>Lily Yeh</given-names></name><name><surname>Jan</surname><given-names>Yuh Nung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ecdysone-mediated repression of the TMEM16 channel <italic>subdued</italic> initiates a sensory switch in peripheral nociceptors during <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval development, increasing thermal nociceptive behavior and reducing responsiveness to ultraviolet light.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Detection of internal and external stimuli depends on developmental programing of the proper physiological and morphological properties of sensory neurons. It is an intriguing open question as to how the characteristics of sensory transduction arise during development, and which neuronal properties are crucial for the initiation of sensory detection.</p><p>Nociception, the ability to detect and escape potentially harmful stimuli, is a highly conserved function of sensory systems present in all animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arenas et al., 2017</xref>). A nociception system is composed of nociceptors, which are neurons with molecular components that directly sense harmful stimuli; a processing center where the stimuli are interpreted, typically the neural circuits of the central nervous system (CNS); and the reflexive neuromuscular circuit which generates a reaction to escape injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baliki and Apkarian, 2015</xref>). Development of sensory systems requires the coordination of processes on the cellular, morphogenic, and circuit level.</p><p>Thermal nociception generates an avoidance behavior, such as a fast limb retraction or change of movement trajectory. Previous studies of thermal nociception behaviors and neural activity demonstrate a change in nociceptive responses during development of both mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For example, a mouse paw exhibits low sensitivity to painful heat early in postnatal development, but the rate of reflex gets faster as the animal develops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jankowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ford et al., 2019</xref>). A developmental transition is also observed in nociceptor activity, as revealed by the change in the number of heat-sensitive C-fibers with age in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hiura et al., 1992</xref>). Likewise, a behavioral transition in heat thermal nociception has been observed in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sulkowski et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> third instar larvae exhibit a stereotyped ‘corkscrew’ behavior, when a thermal probe heated above 38°C touches the cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tracey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babcock et al., 2009</xref>). However, this behavior is not observed in second instar or earlier larval stages, and appears to be acquired only during the last stage of larval development.</p><p>The larval nociceptive behavior has been a useful model for dissection of the molecular mechanisms and circuitry of nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Himmel et al., 2017</xref>). Among the heat-sensitive neurons in the larval cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2003</xref>) are the Class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons, which function as the primary nociceptors for noxious heat-induced escape behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tracey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hwang et al., 2007</xref>). C4da neurons are multimodal sensors for harmful stimuli, with the capacity to respond to multiple forms of sensory information. In addition to responding to temperature, C4da neurons respond to high-intensity blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>), noxious UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2019</xref>), and harsh touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>While noxious heat and touch both elicit the rolling escape behavior, stimulation of C4da neurons with short wavelength (blue or UV) light causes a locomotion trajectory avoidance behavior. These different stimuli cause different electrical signals in C4da neurons. Noxious heat causes high-frequency spike trains interspersed with quiescent periods, in contrast to blue light which elicits lower frequency firing with few quiescent periods in third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Terada et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, distinct behaviors appear to be encoded by the C4da neurons according to their differential responses to differing stimuli.</p><p>The majority of studies of nociception in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae have focused on the last (i.e., the third) larval instar, where nearly all larvae will perform the behavioral response. However, Sulkowski et al. found that during the first half of larval development (i.e., the first and second instars), larvae exhibited either no or a low rate of thermal nociceptive behavior, leading to the hypothesis that a developmental transition occurs between the second and third larval instars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sulkowski et al., 2011</xref>). The mechanisms which regulate this transition remain unknown. Optogenetic activation of C4da neurons can induce the corkscrew behavior or a locomotion trajectory avoidance behavior in third instar larvae. However, optogenetic activation could only induce a locomotion trajectory avoidance behavior in the second instar. This difference between second and third instars in the optogenetic activation of behavior, taken together with the difference in coding activity in C4da neurons in response to thermal stimulation or light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Terada et al., 2016</xref>), raises the possibility that the developmental transition may involve a change in sensory coding. Supporting this possibility, misexpression of low temperature activated TrpA1 (isoform A) channels in the C4da neurons enables second instar larvae to exhibit corkscrew behavior in response to an innocuous temperature stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2017</xref>). It is conceivable that the sensory switch may be caused by a cell autonomous change in the C4da neurons. Whether C4da neurons change in their neural activity during the developmental transition from second to third instar is unknown, and the regulators of such transition are unknown as well.</p><p>Transcription factors facilitate the formation of distinct neuronal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parrish et al., 2014</xref>) and regulate the dynamic expression profiles of many developmental transitions between and during larval instars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sullivan and Thummel, 2003</xref>). One such transcription factor is the nuclear hormone receptor ecdysone receptor (EcR). EcR forms a heterodimer with ultraspiracle (USP) and binds the ligand ecdysone, a steroid hormone, to coordinate a wide variety of developmental programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamanaka et al., 2013</xref>). EcR and USP are required for thermal nociception in the third instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McParland et al., 2015</xref>), but the mechanism and role of ecdysone signaling in the second instar have not been determined.</p><p>EcR expression in C4da neurons has been reported at the beginning and end of larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirilly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McParland et al., 2015</xref>). In the absence of ligand, EcR and USP distribute between the cytoplasm and nucleus, while ligand binding increases nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nieva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nieva et al., 2008</xref>). Without ligand binding, EcR and USP recruit nucleosome remodeling proteins to compact the chromatin and locally suppress transcription. When bound to ecdysone, EcR-USP recruit coactivators, such as histone acetylases, to expand the chromatin structure and promote transcription. In this way, steroid hormone signaling can create positive and negative feedback to promote cascades of transcriptional programs at developmentally precise periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sullivan and Thummel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hill et al., 2013</xref>). Whether the ligand-induced activity and transcriptional regulation are involved in EcR-mediated thermal nociception remains to be determined.</p><p>In this study, we performed a series of experiments to determine the activity of the C4da neurons during the developmental nociceptive transition as well as the mechanisms which regulate this sensory switch. These experiments demonstrate that steroid hormone signaling in nociceptive neurons regulates the channel composition in C4da neurons to modulate the sensory properties and behavioral response at distinct stages of larval development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>C4da neuron sensory switch between second and third larval instars is modality specific</title><p>C4da neurons are multimodal nociceptive sensors of thermal, short wavelength light, and mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Himmel et al., 2017</xref>). While first instar and third instar larvae respond at similar frequency to mechanonociceptive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almeida-Carvalho et al., 2017</xref>), larvae do not robustly activate the thermally triggered nociceptive behavior until the last (third) instar of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sulkowski et al., 2011</xref>). Whether the C4da neurons respond to short wavelength light changes during larval development is unknown. To investigate whether this developmental transition is specific to thermal nociception, we sought to compare the responses of second and third instar larvae to thermal and light stimuli.</p><p>First, we measured the frequency and latency of the nociceptive behavior in second and third instar larvae across a range of nociceptive temperatures. Compared to third instar larvae, second instar larvae had a lower response frequency of nociceptive behavior across all nociceptive temperatures above 40°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Among the larvae which did display a nociceptive behavior, second instar larvae had a longer latency before initiating the nociceptive response than third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).

The small size of second instar larvae makes electrophysiological recording of C4da neurons prohibitive, therefore, we sought to compare the magnitude of the UV-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. To determine if the UV light-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity response of C4da neurons changes during development, we measured GCaMP6s signals of these sensory neurons in second and third instar larvae in response to 405 nm (UV-A) light stimulation. In contrast to the transition of thermal nociceptive behavior, UV-A stimuli-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of C4da neurons in second instar larvae was higher than that in third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). This pattern, of third instar C4da neurons having lower UV-A-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity than second instar C4da neurons, was validated by quantifying both the number of neurons which surpassed a threshold value of UV-A-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and the magnitude of the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). Thus, the UV-A-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity decreased with larval development, in contrast to the increase of thermal nociceptive neuronal response from second to third instar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Based on these observations, we conclude that regulation of the sensory switch during the second and third instar development is modality specific.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Steroid hormone ecdysone promotes the development of thermal nociception</title><p>Having found modality-specific sensory responses during the second to third instar developmental transition, we sought to find regulators of the sensory switch in C4da neurons by first examining the thermal nociceptive transition.

However, the expression and localization of EcR isoforms during the second larval instars are unknown. To investigate EcR dynamics during the developmental period with different levels of thermal nociception, we examined the localization of EcR in second and third instar larval C4da neurons with an antibody which recognizes a common domain of all EcR isoforms. Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirilly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McParland et al., 2015</xref>), we observed nuclear localization of EcR in wandering third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Earlier in larval development, EcR was evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm in the second instar (2 and 8 hr After L2 Ecdysis) and at the beginning of the third instar, 2 hr After L3 Ecdysis (AL3E). Nuclear localization increased 8 hr AL3E and in wandering third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>).

Quantification of total EcR immunoreactivity in C4da neurons did not reveal any significant change during the second and third instar development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In the third instar, reduction of EcR-A expression reduces thermal nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McParland et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we tested the effects of disrupting the EcR-A domains responsible for either ligand binding or coactivator recruitment on nociception, by characterizing mutants with alanine substitution in either the ligand-binding domain (EcR-A-W650A) or the coactivator recruitment domain (EcR-A-F645A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cherbas et al., 2003</xref>). The W650A mutation prevents ligand binding and disrupts both derepression and activation. The F645A mutation cannot mediate activation, but retains the ligand-binding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, differences between the effect of overexpression of these mutant EcR-A constructs are likely due to differences in ligand-binding ability. Mutant forms of EcR can function in a dominant negative capacity by outcompeting the endogenous wild-type EcR, thereby inactivating the endogenous receptor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cherbas et al., 2003</xref>). In this way, overexpression of these mutant EcR-A constructs can distinguish the requirements of coactivation (disrupted by F645A) or ligand-induced derepression (disrupted by W650A). When assaying for a dominant negative mutant phenotype, we observed that expression of EcR-A-F645A in C4da neurons did not change nociceptive behavior in third instar larvae, while expression of EcR-A-W650A reduced the number of larvae exhibiting nociceptive behavior in third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Of the larvae that did exhibit nociceptive behavior, expression of EcR-A-W650A did not alter their response latency relative to the W650A controls, but did increase the latency relative to F645A genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

EcR-ΔC is an artificial isoform which contains only the sequences common to all isoforms and no A/B domain.

Additionally, overexpression of these EcR isoforms did not alter nociception in the third instar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Given that expression of neither the domains common to all EcR isoforms, which are present in EcR-ΔC, nor the AF1 domain of EcR-B1 could increase nociception in the second instar, we conclude that the A/B domain unique to EcR-A is required to increase nociception of second instar larvae.</p><p>Expression of EcR-A RNAi or EcR-B1-dominant negative mutant in the third instar larvae reduces the number of dendrite tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McParland et al., 2015</xref>).

EcR-A overexpression can specifically suppress <italic>subdued</italic> expression in second instar larvae, as expected from the decrease of <italic>subdued</italic> expression in third instar larvae. We also found that inhibiting EcR-A ligand-binding capacity with expression of EcR-A-W650A can reduce expression of more nociceptive genes than expression of wild-type EcR-A. EcR-A-W650A expression reduced <italic>subdued</italic> expression in the second instar, and further reduced expression of <italic>subdued</italic> in the third instar larvae. We conclude that during the developmental period of the sensory switch, EcR-A regulates expression of <italic>subdued</italic>, and that ligand-binding activity is necessary for maintaining the regulated expression of multiple nociceptor genes in the third instar.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Reduction of <italic>subdued</italic> confers second instar nociceptors with thermal and light sensitivity characteristic of third instar nociceptors</title><p>Our transcriptional data indicate that EcR-A overexpression specifically suppresses <italic>subdued</italic> expression in second instar C4da neurons.

These effects of reduced <italic>subdued</italic> expression match the developmental progression of the sensory switch. We conclude that EcR-A regulation of the C4da sensory switch is mediated in part by reduction of <italic>subdued</italic> expression levels: <italic>subdued</italic> expression, owing to the EcR-A unliganded activity in second instar C4da neurons, is associated with a lack of thermal nociception, whereas suppression of <italic>subdued</italic> expression via EcR-A overexpression or <italic>subdued</italic>-RNAi in second instar C4da neurons causes precocious thermal nociception while reducing responsiveness to UV light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The impact of peripheral nervous system (PNS) development on behavior is underscored by the recent finding that defects in the PNS are sufficient to produce symptoms in mouse models of autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Orefice et al., 2016</xref>). The role of hormonal regulation of sensory systems during periods of postnatal development has also been highlighted by studies of growth hormone regulation of thermal sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ford et al., 2019</xref>). Considering that sensory neurons progress through transcriptionally distinct identities during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>), characterizing how the specific changes in receptors or channels that produce these developmentally specific outcomes is of prominent importance for understanding the development of neurological disease.</p><p>In this study, we address how a nociceptive behavior is temporally acquired during development. We demonstrate how steroid hormone regulation of nociceptor activity in a class of sensory neurons in the PNS adjusts the developing larval response to nociceptive stimuli. Heat-induced nociceptive behavior in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae arises during the final (third) instar of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sulkowski et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we show that this behavioral transition reflects a nociceptive sensory switch through regulation of Subdued by the steroid hormone ecdysone and the EcR isoform EcR-A.</p><p>While previous studies have focused on EcR localization in the third instar and pupal stages of C4da neurons, we show EcR is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in the second instar, followed with an increase of EcR nuclear localization 8 hr into the third instar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Previous work has shown that loss of EcR-A reduces thermal nociception in the third instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McParland et al., 2015</xref>). While we did not find detectable transcriptional changes in nociceptor genes in third instar C4da neurons during <italic>EcR-A</italic> RNAi expression, we found broad suppression of nociceptor genes during EcR ligand-binding mutant (W650A) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Through behavioral and transcriptional analysis, we show that EcR-A nociception regulation is ligand dependent, by demonstrating that increased ecdysone titer and overexpression of ligand-competent EcR both accelerate nociception in the second instar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Ligand binding of EcR leads to widespread epigenetic changes through release of corepressors and recruitment of coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Uyehara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uyehara and McKay, 2019</xref>). The precocious activation of nociception in the second instar requires the unique A/B domain of the isoform EcR-A, as other isoforms lacking this domain do not increase nociception (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The A/B domain of EcR-A is less activating and more repressive then the EcR-B1 A/B domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dela Cruz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mouillet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2003</xref>). It thus appears that ligand-dependent derepression could be the action which promotes nociception. Moreover, expression of the EcR coactivator mutant (F645A) phenocopies expression of wild-type EcR in its ability to promote nociception (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that in contrast to coactivator recruitment, preservation of the ability to remove corepressors is required for nociception. This regulation of repression may account for the ability of the EcR ligand-binding mutant (W650A) to suppress multiple nociceptive genes including <italic>subdued</italic> in the second and third instars. The release of corepressors could allow other transcription factors to gain access to response elements which suppress <italic>subdued</italic>, or directly promote transcription of a repressor of <italic>subdued</italic>. How derepression leads to the suppression of <italic>subdued</italic> is an intriguing open question.</p><p>For third instar larval nociception, our data suggest there are both ligand-dependent and -independent EcR-A pathways. We find third instar expression of EcR-A ligand-binding mutant to have a temperature-specific phenotype. Expression of the EcR-A ligand-binding mutant inhibits nociception at 42°C, but does not reduce nociception at 46°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, D</xref>). This temperature-specific effect is reminiscent of the phenotype of TrpA1 mutant larvae, which lose nociceptive behavior at probe temperatures of 44°C and lower, but are still responsive to 46°C stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2019</xref>). We found that expression of EcR-A ligand-binding mutant reduced <italic>subdued</italic> expression in the third instar even more than during the developmental transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, C</xref>), suggesting that this loss of <italic>subdued</italic> expression may contribute to the phenotype at 42°C but not at 46°C. Consistent with this possibility, we observed that Subdued-RNAi was able to increase nociception in second instar larvae while Subdued knockout mutation did not increase nociception. Together these results suggest that the amount of <italic>subdued</italic> expression is important for promoting or inhibiting nociception. Furthermore, there are Subdued and EcR-A ligand-independent pathways which promote nociception in the third instar. We observe alteration of <italic>TrpA1</italic>, <italic>painless</italic>, <italic>ppk1</italic> and <italic>ppk26</italic> expression during development but not as a result of EcR overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These separate pathways may involve mechanisms of regulating temperature specificity in C4da neurons.</p><p>Subdued has homology to the Calcium-activated Chloride Channels (CaCC) of the mammalian TMEM16 family, with channel activity similar to both TMEM16A and TMEM16F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le et al., 2019</xref>). The effect of CaCC on neural activity is dependent on the intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> concentration ([Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg et al., 2012</xref>). When [Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is high, elevation of internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> level activates CaCCs and causes Cl<sup>−</sup> efflux, leading to excitation. In contrast, when [Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is low, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of CaCCs causes an influx of Cl<sup>−</sup> which has an inhibitory effect on neuronal excitability. Differential expression of symporters and cotransporters in the CNS and PNS, as well as in immature and mature neurons, is important for creating the inhibitory or excitatory effects of CaCCs. In third instar larvae, Cl<sup>−</sup> efflux has been observed during thermal nociceptive stimulation of C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Onodera et al., 2017</xref>). However, Onodera et al. found that loss of Subdued did not significantly change the magnitude of the Cl<sup>−</sup> efflux during heat stimulus, suggesting other channels are responsible for the Cl<sup>−</sup> efflux in third instar C4da neurons. The direction of Cl<sup>−</sup> movement in the second instar remains to be determined, and it is conceivable that Subdued could produce an inhibitory influx of Cl<sup>−</sup> in the second instar. Characterizing Cl<sup>−</sup> homeostasis during C4da neuron development and its impact on nociception will be of interest in future studies.</p><p>Subdued has previously been found to regulate thermal nociception in third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jang et al., 2015</xref>). Jang et al. found the strongest decrease of nociception in the third instar when expression of <italic>subdued</italic> was reduced in all dendritic arborization neurons. Additionally, when <italic>subdued</italic> was overexpressed in C4da neurons the number of third instar larvae that responded to nociceptive heat did not significantly change. Interesting, when <italic>subdued</italic> was overexpressed with a subdued-Gal4, the number of fast responding third instar larvae increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jang et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests there may be a substantial thermal nociception role for Subdued in dendritic arborization neurons other than C4da neurons during third instar. Our data suggest that as C4da neurons develop from second to third instars, the ability of Subdued to influence detection of stimuli may change. We find that thermal nociception is enhanced by reduction of <italic>subdued</italic> expression in second instar C4da neurons, via either EcR-A overexpression or Subdued-RNAi knockdown. Additionally, we find that expression of the EcR-A-ligand mutant reduces <italic>subdued</italic> expression even further in third instar C4da neurons, and that this is associated with a loss of nociception. The greater amount of <italic>subdued</italic> expression in the second instar may mean that Subdued could have a greater impact on Cl<sup>−</sup> regulation during the second instar. This mechanism of Subdued activity would be dependent on the intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> concentration created by symporters and cotransporters. The importance of Cl<sup>−</sup> regulation has recently been highlighted in the Class III da neurons, as both Subdued and depolarizing Cl<sup>−</sup> currents have recently been found to promote cold-evoked nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Himmel et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, identifying regulators of Cl<sup>−</sup> concentration during the development of C4da neurons and their impact on nociception will be of interest in future studies.</p><p>Our work adds to the evidence that the developmental transition of thermal nociception represents a shift in sensory state rather than a change in sensory system construction: (1) optogenetics can stimulate aversive behavior in both second and third instar C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sulkowski et al., 2011</xref>), (2) TrpA1 misexpression can confer nociceptive behavior in both second and third instar larvae exposed to innocuous temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2017</xref>), (3) UV-A stimulation induces greater Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in second instar than in third instar C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and (4) reduction of <italic>subdued</italic> expression in second instar renders C4da neurons responsive to thermal nociceptive stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Additional properties of C4da neurons during this developmental transition remain to be determined. These properties include: whether thermally induced calcium activity in C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Terada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2019</xref>) also changes over this period of development, whether EcR regulates the ‘burst and pause’ encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Terada et al., 2016</xref>), and whether EcR regulation alters synaptic connections of C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Valdes-Aleman et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Recent findings have highlighted the occurrence of developmentally timed modulation of sensory state in both larvae and adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. A sensory switch in thermotaxis behavior of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae is regulated by transcriptional regulation of thermoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tyrrell et al., 2021</xref>). In adults, male courtship behavior is modulated through olfactory neuron pheromone sensitivity and hormone-mediate chromatin reprograming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Our study highlights that temporally programed sensory switches may be a widely used developmental mechanism to match behavioral outcomes with life history events.</p><p>We speculate that the nociceptive shift in sensory state is an important mechanism for matching sensory system function with life history transitions. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae do not develop robust thermal nociception until the second half of the larval phase. This means that for the first half of larval life, larvae do not have thermal nociception behavior. In contrast, nociceptor activity to UV-A light decreases from the second to third instars, suggesting that nociceptive sensitivity to short wavelength light decreases during the second half of the larval phase. This transition correlates with larval behavioral changes that emerge during the third instar, such as cessation of feeding beneath the surface and wandering above ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wegman et al., 2010</xref>). Larvae are transitioning from predominantly feeding behavior in the second instar, often shielded from light and high temperatures, to movement away from food in search of pupation sites in the third instar. In a natural habitat, this transition can mean leaving the food source, which necessitates greater exposure to heat, increasing the risk of predation and desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballman et al., 2017</xref>). This sensory switch may function as a developmental strategy, shaping behavioral outcomes as animals encounter changing environments, thus increasing survival.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> stocks and culturing</title><p>Detailed stock genotypes and sources are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

Larvae were briefly rinse in dH<sub>2</sub>0 and allowed to acclimatize for 1 min on a vinyl sheet. The larvae were kept moist and a temperature-controlled heat probe (ProDev Engineering, TX) was used to apply heat between the larval body segments A3–A6 of forward crawling larvae. Nociceptive behavior was defined as at least one complete 360° roll. The time to complete one roll (latency) was measured up to a 20 s cutoff. Each larva was presented with a single stimulus to avoid habituation. Latency was calculated for each biological replicate as the time at which greater than or equal to 50% of the responding population (nonresponding larvae we excluded) had responded to the stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>20E feeding</title><p>For food supplemented with 20E (Sigma, H5142), 20E was dissolved in 100% ethanol and mixed with room temperature cornmeal-molasses media.

To increase C4da neuron concentration in the final cell suspension, the larval body wall was inverted and the CNS, imaginal discs, gut, and fatbody were removed. After dissection cell suspensions were prepared by vortexed with 1.5 μl 1× Liberase TM (Roche, LIBTM-RO) in 500 μl cold PBS. To dissociate cells samples were incubated for three periods at 25°C at 1000 rpm, triturating 10 times with a glass pipette between each incubation. Suspensions were strained through a 40-μm cell strainer (Fisher Scientific) and brought to 1.5 ml with Schneider’s media. 1 μl ethidium homodimer-1 (Thermo Fisher, L3224) was added before sorting to mark dead cells. C4da neurons were isolated by FACS with an Aria II (Becton Dickinson). GFP+nonautofluorescent RFP− events were sorted into 20 μl lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher, KIT0204) and immediately frozen on dry ice. 100–1000 cells were isolated per dissection replicate. RNA was isolated with PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Thermo Fisher, KIT0204), cDNA was synthesized with Applied Biosystems High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher, 4368813), and qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR green (Thermo Fisher, A25742) with a QuantStudio7 (Thermo Fisher).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after careful consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we genuinely regret to inform you that this work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in current form. However, if you choose to perform all of the large number of experiments requested by the reviewers, and if you so wish, then <italic>eLife</italic> should be happy to consider an extensively revised manuscript for review, nominally as a new submission.</p><p>The reviewers felt the problem being addressed was interesting and expressed particular interest in the role of subdued as a functional target of ECR, but had several concerns regarding both the clarity of underlying mechanisms as proposed in this manuscript and the overall level of advance over previous work (eg. McPharland et al.).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study by the Jan group examines the onset/development of functional thermal (and UV) nociception in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. Previously, other groups had established that there are differences in nociceptive responses between second and third instar larvae (Cox) and that ecdysone receptor function is required for functional nociceptor development (Ganter). This study does a more thorough job than that previous work in documenting the stage differences and identifies a molecular player (subdued) that appears to be required for stage-specific changes in sensitivity. Overall, the data are sound and convincing and the paper is very well written. A few suggestions for improvement/clarification are offered.</p><p>1. Data organization. Some of the best data showing the stage-specific difference is in supplemental figure 1C- latency. This should really be in the main figure 1- probably as panel B. Figure 1C could benefit and would be more complete if second instar data were shown for 25 and 36 degrees.</p><p>2. The baseline calcium levels in second versus third instar is quite different- much higher in second instar looking at figure 1B. This data is essentially normalized/compared to same stage's baseline but this does raise the question: Does EcR function or subdued function shift the magnitude of response or shift the second instar (or third instar) baseline? It's a little hard to tell because Figure 3 (EcR) doesn't have stills of representative cells and Figure 6 (subdued, temperature) does not either. All we see here is the ratio data. Representative still data should be presented and whether the gene affects baseline calcium versus magnitude of change upon stimulus should be discussed.</p><p>3. Figure 2 organization: Personal preference but the 20E data currently in supplement 2B is probably more important to the main point than the third instar data (Main figure 2D).</p><p>4. Some of the discussion of the differences between second and third instar seems a bit oversimplified, especially as it refers to the EcR expression data in Figure 2 supplement. It's not really accurate to say that second instar has low EcR and third has high. Reality (from the data shown) is that nuclear EcR is high in early second and later third and low in late second and early third. There isn't really data to address intra-stage differences in responsiveness so this should be described a bit more clearly- without the current oversimplification. Adding modifiers (late second instar, early third instar) would help.</p><p>5. Analysis of subdued: Most helpful would be confirmation that this RNAi line is actually reducing subdued transcript levels, as one would predict. This would enhance confidence that there are no off-target effects. Also helpful would be the converse experiment to RNAi loss of function. Authors perform Subdued RNAi and see changes in second instar thermal responsiveness. Does overexpression of Subdued shift responsiveness in third instar?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript deals with the basis of an intriguing shift in nociceptive behavior shown by <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae as they move from the L2 to the L3 instar. Prior publications have shown that the shift is controlled by ecdysone and implicated the EcR-A knock-down of EcR-A levels rendered the neurons hyposensitive to noxious thermal and mechanical stimulation and also altered features of their anatomy. Reduction in EcR-B1 did not effect their responses but has anatomical ramifications. This paper extends these studies into Ca<sup>2+</sup> data from specific da neurons and also reveals a gene, subdued, that may play a role in the change in responsiveness.</p><p>There are a number of substantial concerns:</p><p>1. The paper focuses on the differences between the L2 and L3 instars. According to the Methods, their L2 stage is in the middle of the L2 period, but the L3 stage is a wandering L3 larva which is at least 50 hours older. There are three critical ecdysone-related events that occur in this 50 hour span: the critical weight at about 8-10 hr after L3 ecdysis, the mid-L3 transition, and the ecdysone peak that initiates wandering. If the transition occurs during the transition from L2 to L3, then the &quot;critical weight&quot; transition would be a good candidate and L3 larvae about 12 to 18 hr after ecdysis would be more appropriate.</p><p>2. Another troubling methodological issue is that their behavioral tests were run at either 42 or 46 C while the Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements are done at 44 C. This becomes a concern in a situation like in Figure 2 where W650A expression is behaviorally effective at 42 C but has no effect at 46 C. We are then provided with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> response at 44 C. Since this temp is half-way between the two used for the behavior tests, we have no way of assessing whether or not the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response tracks the behavioral response.</p><p>3. A serious interpretational issue has to do with ignoring the complexity imposed by the EcR isoforms. Through most of the paper and figures, the authors speak of &quot;EcR&quot; when they really should be saying &quot;EcR-A&quot;. This is not a trivial issue because the EcR-B isoforms have a strong hormone-independent transactivation domain at their N-terminus whereas EcR-A does not. At times when EcR-B1 is a present, the expression of wildtype EcR-A dampens the cellular response by competing with the endogenous EcR-B1 [Schubiger et al., 2003, Mech. Dev. 120:909]. Previous experiments (McPharland et al.) used RNAi to selectively knockdown different isoforms and these suggested a function for EcR-A. Ectopic expression of EcR-A alone, without EcR-B1 for comparison, can lead to wrong interpretations, especially since both isoforms are found in the da neurons (see McPharland).</p><p>4. Another problem is with the interpretation of the EcR dominant negatives (EcR-DN). The function of nuclear receptors, like EcR, is too well understood to gloss over the impact of these point mutations by saying that they either prevent hormone binding [for W650A] or &quot;co-factor&quot; binding [for F645A]. The W650A mutation is in the binding pocket and prevents 20E binding. This prevents the loss of co-repressors and the assembly of a co-activator complex. Therefore, this forms serves as a constitutive repressor that is not responsive to 20E. The F645A substitution, by contrast is in the helix that changes conformation after 20E binding and is one of the residues involved in co-activator assembly. EcR-F645A allows 20E binding and the conformation changes that lose the co-repressors but it cannot support the co-activation. Therefore, it ca show hormone-dependent derepression but not activation.</p><p>5. Paragraph 299: This paragraph argues that expression of EcR[-A] in the L2 suppresses subdued expression and they conclude that expression of EcR-A in the L3 will enhance subdued expression because the EcR-A w650A suppresses subdued expression in the latter. They really need to show the effects of expression of the wild-type EcR-A receptor in the L3 as well as W650A. This information is important because as noted above, ectopic expression of EcR-A could act to suppress expression although likely not to the level seen for the W650A dominant negative.</p><p>6. The interpretation of the W650A data in the L3 is confusing because its expression in the third suppresses both TrpA1 and subdued [Figure 4C] but has minimal effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to heat [Figure 3] and has no effect on behavioral responses to 46 C [Figure 2D]. I was hoping that the Discussion would pull things together into a consistent story, but the Discussion tended to invoke a number of ad hoc hypotheses to account for pieces of data which do not seem to fit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Jaszczak et al. examines how steroid hormone signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> activates in sensory switch in C4da neurons that promotes a thermal nociceptive escape response behavior. The authors show that a greater percent of third instar larvae are able to generate the thermal nociceptive escape response than second instar larvae. They also show calcium responses in the soma of C4da neurons are larger in third instar larvae in response to high temperatures in comparison to second instar larvae. In contrast, they see the opposite with UV light. Both the behavioral response and the calcium response can be increased in second instar larvae by increasing ecdysone signaling. The authors also find that subdued expression is suppressed by increasing ecdysone signaling and link subdued to this developmental transition. Overall, the findings in the manuscript are interesting, but I think the authors need to address several points to strengthen their conclusions.</p><p>1. Some explanation as to why the soma is being imaged instead of dendrites or axons is needed. I assume the size of dendrites and axons make it too difficult to image in intact larvae.</p><p>2. The authors mention that other groups have shown that EcR regulates dendritic growth. Could the role of EcR in this sensory switch be due to changes in dendritic growth instead of changes in calcium levels. This possibility should at least be discussed.</p><p>3. The authors use a dominant-negative approach (EcR-W650A) to reduce ecdysone signaling in third instar larvae. Dominant-negative approaches are difficult to interpret. The authors should use an EcR RNAi to knockdown ECR in C4da neurons. This should be done for both the thermal nociceptive escape responses and for the calcium imaging experiments.</p><p>4. Why does the approach dominant-negative (EcR-W650A) reduce subdued expression in third instar larvae? I would expect that reduced ecdysone signaling would enhance subdued expression.</p><p>5. TrpA1 levels in second instar larvae are not affected by increased ecdysone signaling (overexpression of EcR) in second instar larvae, but they are reduced by expression of a dominant-negative (EcR-W650A). Again, this experiment should be repeated with an EcR RNAi for third instar larvae.</p><p>6. If TrpA1 levels are regulated by ecdysone, does reducing TrpA1 in C4da neurons in third instar larvae reduce both the nociceptive response and calcium levels.</p><p>7. Subdued RNAi increases the nociceptive response and C4da calcium levels in second instar larvae. Does overexpression of Subdued reduce the nociceptive response and C4da calcium levels in third instar larvae? This experiment would nicely show that Subdued levels are required for this developmental transition.</p><p>8. UAS controls are missing in figures 3 and 4.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Steroid hormone signaling activates thermal nociception during <italic>Drosophila</italic> peripheral nervous system development” for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

They have addressed most of my comments. The one issue that remains is the removal of the data for calcium levels at different developmental stages in response to temperature. The data in the manuscript shows calcium responses during periods of UV treatment are reduced in third instar larvae compared to second instar larvae. Subdued levels are reduced in third instar larvae and knockdown of subdued reduces calcium responses in second instar larvae. The question that remains is what happens to calcium levels in response to temperature at these developmental stages. I think these data are important in understanding how this developmental switch and subdued affects thermal nociception.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This revision by the Jan group has addressed many of the issues that were raised in the first round of review. Specifically, staging of larvae has been improved especially with respect to the analysis of EcR immunostaining. Similarly, the text has been revised to address nuances related to EcR isoforms and ecdysone action across the L2-L3 larval stages. Finally, knockdown controls have been provided for RNAi transgenes, bolstering the conclusions. The removal of the calcium-imaging data for technical reasons is a little bit of a shame but the basic conclusions still stand on the improved behavioral and transcriptional analysis. The finding that EcRA and subdued are regulators of the L2-L3 transition in nociceptive sensitivity will be of interest to the fly field and those researchers more generally interested in mechanisms of modulation of nociceptive sensitivity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The resubmission of this paper is greatly improved over the original. I only have a few problems with the current version.</p><p>The first is with the Figures: I do not understand their philosophy for selecting data for the supplemental figures. The paper does not have many figures and the ones that they have are relatively simple. I do not see why important data are moved into supplemental figures. Figure 3 is a case in point. Part 3B presents third instar data showing that the W650A dominant negative (DN), suppresses the response to a 42C probe while the F645A-DN does not. The response latency data for this temperature are then shown in a supplemental Figure [lacking data for F645A-DN]. The supplemental Figure also shows the important data for the 46C probe showing both % response (for W650A-DN and F645A-DN) and latency (this also lacking F645A-DN data). It would be more helpful to the reader to have them combined in a single Figure. The same could be said for combining Figure 4 with Figure 4 Supp 1A-C.</p><p>In the body of Figures 3 through 5 they represent the isoforms with a period between EcR and the isoform designation (i.e. as “EcR.A” rather than “EcR-A”). They use the correct designations in the text and the figure legends (Also in Figure 4, Supp 1E-G). They should change the Figures to have a dash between EcR and its isoform designation.</p><p>Figure 2, Supp 1 A could confuse a reader into thinking that there are actually four EcR isoforms, the last being EcR-C. The last is a truncated, experimental construct. I suggest that the authors give it a name that reflects this – perhaps δ-EcR (using the Greek letter). This designation should be used throughout the text and in Figure 4A as well as Figure 2.</p><p>Figure 5: and supplement: I assume that in ppk-GAL4/EcR.A is actually ppk-GAL4/UAS-EcR.A.</p><p>The second problem is with the use of AF1 domains when one should be talking about A/B domains. In the Discussion the authors nicely come to grips with the complexity of ecdysone signaling and the diversity of its receptors. In the results, though, some of their Interim conclusions become confusing, especially with their usage of &quot;AF1&quot; rather than“&quot;A/”&quot; domain. AF1 refers to a functionality while A/B refers to the variable, N-terminal region of the receptor. If the terms are not used properly it can be confusing because EcR-A has an A/B domain but it has no AF1 function (see Hu et al., 2003). I suggest the following changes</p><p>Line 195: This sentence would be more clear as:“&quot;the binding of ecdysone to EcR causes the recruitment of co-activators and the loss of co-repressors”&quot;</p><p>Line 200 better to call it the“&quot;co-activator recruitment domai”&quot;.</p><p>Line 204: F645A does block activation, but since it allows hormone binding, ligand-dependent de-repression can occur. W650A should prevent both de-repression and activation.</p><p>Line 219. Is this really correct that ecdysone“&quot;activatio”&quot; of EcR is required? Your data show that with the F645A-DN (which blocks ligand-dependent activation) show the appropriate shift in nociception. All of your data suggest that ecdysone is acting via de-repression</p><p>Line 233 More properly:“&quot;difference between EcR isoforms is within their A/B domain”&quot;.</p><p>Line 235: should use Δ-EcR rather than EcR-C; same for ln 237, and 240.</p><p>Line 236: … to all isoforms and no A/B region.</p><p>Line 241-42: this is where it becomes confusing because EcR-A does not have a AF1 domain! The fact that EcR-A is effective while δ-EcR is not suggests that the A/B region of EcR-A carries a unique repressor function. Ecdysone binding is required to lose this repression (hence the differences between W650A and F645A). The paper gets around to this idea in the Discussion but the logic through the results is a bit muddy.</p><p>Line 277: better as …the EcR-A A/B domain and ligand binding are …..</p><p>Line 392 …. The unique A/B domain of the EcR-A isoform …..</p><p>The third issue that the paper focuses on the role of the isoforms so there should at least be images of EcR-A immunostaining along with EcR-common in Figure 2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76464.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

According to the Methods, their L2 stage is in the middle of the L2 period, but the L3 stage is a wandering L3 larva which is at least 50 hours older. There are three critical ecdysone-related events that occur in this 50 hour span: the critical weight at about 8-10 hr after L3 ecdysis, the mid-L3 transition, and the ecdysone peak that initiates wandering. If the transition occurs during the transition from L2 to L3, then the &quot;critical weight&quot; transition would be a good candidate and L3 larvae about 12 to 18 hr after ecdysis would be more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>To more precisely examine the expression of EcR in second and third instar we have performed new IHC staining with improved developmental staging and quantification of EcR presence in the nucleus and cytoplasm. We have presented this data in a newly formatted Figure 2. We find that earlier in larval development, EcR is evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm in the second instar and at the beginning of the third instar. Nuclear localization increased 8 hrs after L3 ecdysis and in wandering third instar larvae.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Another troubling methodological issue is that their behavioral tests were run at either 42 or 46 C while the Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements are done at 44 C. This becomes a concern in a situation like in Figure 2 where W650A expression is behaviorally effective at 42 C but has no effect at 46 C. We are then provided with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> response at 44 C. Since this temp is half-way between the two used for the behavior tests, we have no way of assessing whether or not the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response tracks the behavioral response.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the manuscript to make a clear comparison of behavioral phenotypes with a 42<sup>o</sup>C probe as shown in the main figure: we have moved the 46<sup>o</sup>C data to supplement figures while expanding our explanation for preforming these experiments and our conclusions from these data. We have removed the calcium measurements after running into technical issues that reduced our confidence in comparing calcium levels between different developmental stages at different temperatures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A serious interpretational issue has to do with ignoring the complexity imposed by the EcR isoforms. Through most of the paper and figures, the authors speak of “EcR” when they really should be saying “EcR-A”. This is not a trivial issue because the EcR-B isoforms have a strong hormone-independent transactivation domain at their N-terminus whereas EcR-A does not. At times when EcR-B1 is a present, the expression of wildtype EcR-A dampens the cellular response by competing with the endogenous EcR-B1 [Schubiger et al., 2003, Mech. Dev. 120:909]. Previous experiments (McPharland et al.) used RNAi to selectively knockdown different isoforms and these suggested a function for EcR-A. Ectopic expression of EcR-A alone, without EcR-B1 for comparison, can lead to wrong interpretations, especially since both isoforms are found in the da neurons (see McPharland).</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these concerns by: (1) Specifying which EcR isoform is being discussed, (2) Measuring EcR-A and EcR-B1 protein levels by using specific targeting antibodies in Figure 2, (3) Comparing the effects of overexpression of EcR-A, EcR-B1, and C on nociception in second and third instar larvae, and (4) Including an explanation of the interactions between EcR isoforms and interpretation of the overexpression experiments (Lines 232-246).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Another problem is with the interpretation of the EcR dominant negatives (EcR-DN). The function of nuclear receptors, like EcR, is too well understood to gloss over the impact of these point mutations by saying that they either prevent hormone binding [for W650A] or &quot;co-factor&quot; binding [for F645A]. The W650A mutation is in the binding pocket and prevents 20E binding. This prevents the loss of co-repressors and the assembly of a co-activator complex. Therefore, this forms serves as a constitutive repressor that is not responsive to 20E. The F645A substitution, by contrast is in the helix that changes conformation after 20E binding and is one of the residues involved in co-activator assembly. EcR-F645A allows 20E binding and the conformation changes that lose the co-repressors but it cannot support the co-activation. Therefore, it ca show hormone-dependent derepression but not activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the advice regarding how our writing about the activities of the EcR mutants can be improved. We have made revisions throughout the entire manuscript, including the explanation for the activity of the function of nuclear receptors (Lines 98-107) and the effects of the point mutations on their function (Lines 196-212).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Paragraph 299: This paragraph argues that expression of EcR[-A] in the L2 suppresses subdued expression and they conclude that expression of EcR-A in the L3 will enhance subdued expression because the EcR-A w650A suppresses subdued expression in the latter. They really need to show the effects of expression of the wild-type EcR-A receptor in the L3 as well as W650A. This information is important because as noted above, ectopic expression of EcR-A could act to suppress expression although likely not to the level seen for the W650A dominant negative.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tested the effect of expression of wild-type EcR-A expression on third instar nociception and found it neither reduced nor increased nociception. We have included this data in Figure 4 —figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The interpretation of the W650A data in the L3 is confusing because its expression in the third suppresses both TrpA1 and subdued [Figure 4C] but has minimal effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to heat [Figure 3] and has no effect on behavioral responses to 46 C [Figure 2D]. I was hoping that the Discussion would pull things together into a consistent story, but the Discussion tended to invoke a number of ad hoc hypotheses to account for pieces of data which do not seem to fit.</p></disp-quote><p>For the transcriptional data, upon further analysis of additional controls and nociceptive genes, as well as comparison to expression of EcR-W650A in second instar and third instar expression of EcR-A RNAi, we have found a broad effect of EcR-W650A on nociceptor transcription (Figure 5 —figure supplement 12) (we have moved the 46<sup>o</sup>C data to supplement figures.). Due to the broad effect of EcR-W650A on nociceptor transcription in second and third instar, and the limited effect of EcR-RNAi, we have narrowed our hypotheses in the discussion to the requirement of EcR-A ligand activity for maintaining appropriate expression of nociceptive genes, and the presence of EcR-A ligand-independent pathways which promote nociception in the third instar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Jaszczak et al. examines how steroid hormone signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> activates in sensory switch in C4da neurons that promotes a thermal nociceptive escape response behavior. The authors show that a greater percent of third instar larvae are able to generate the thermal nociceptive escape response than second instar larvae. They also show calcium responses in the soma of C4da neurons are larger in third instar larvae in response to high temperatures in comparison to second instar larvae. In contrast, they see the opposite with UV light. Both the behavioral response and the calcium response can be increased in second instar larvae by increasing ecdysone signaling. The authors also find that subdued expression is suppressed by increasing ecdysone signaling and link subdued to this developmental transition. Overall, the findings in the manuscript are interesting, but I think the authors need to address several points to strengthen their conclusions.</p><p>1. Some explanation as to why the soma is being imaged instead of dendrites or axons is needed. I assume the size of dendrites and axons make it too difficult to image in intact larvae.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to technical issues that reduced our confidence in comparing calcium levels in different developmental stages at different temperatures, we decided to remove the thermo-calcium data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors mention that other groups have shown that EcR regulates dendritic growth. Could the role of EcR in this sensory switch be due to changes in dendritic growth instead of changes in calcium levels. This possibility should at least be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Measurement of dendrite architecture in second instar larvae overexpressing EcR-A has been added to the text and to Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors use a dominant-negative approach (EcR-W650A) to reduce ecdysone signaling in third instar larvae. Dominant-negative approaches are difficult to interpret. The authors should use an EcR RNAi to knockdown ECR in C4da neurons. This should be done for both the thermal nociceptive escape responses and for the calcium imaging experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>By adding new data beyond what has been previously reported with EcR-RNAi (McParland et al. 2015) and comparing the effects of EcR-DN with those of EcR-RNAi, we now show nociceptor gene expression with expression of either EcR-DN or EcR-A RNAi in Figure 5 —figure supplement 2. While we did not find detectable transcriptional changes in nociceptor genes in third instar C4da neurons with EcR-A RNAi knockdown, we found broad suppression of nociceptor genes in third instar C4da neurons with EcR ligand binding mutant (W650A) expression (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2). We have incorporated this data into our discussion of the hypothesis that EcR-A ligand activity may function in a de-repressive capacity (Lines 383-407).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Why does the approach dominant-negative (EcR-W650A) reduce subdued expression in third instar larvae? I would expect that reduced ecdysone signaling would enhance subdued expression.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to further examine this effect of EcR-DN, we have compared nociceptor gene expression with EcR-DN at second and third instars (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2) and found a broad reduction of nociceptor gene expression at both stages of development. We have added to the Discussion the hypothesis that ligand dependent de-repression may be required for appropriate regulation of nociceptor gene transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. TrpA1 levels in second instar larvae are not affected by increased ecdysone signaling (overexpression of EcR) in second instar larvae, but they are reduced by expression of a dominant-negative (EcR-W650A). Again, this experiment should be repeated with an EcR RNAi for third instar larvae.</p></disp-quote><p>We have compared nociceptor gene expression with expression of either EcR-DN or EcR-A RNAi (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2).

Reducing TrpA1 expression in third instar larvae has previously been shown to reduce nociception (Zhong et al. 2012; Terada et al. 2016; Gu et al. 2019) – we have referred to these previous studies in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Subdued RNAi increases the nociceptive response and C4da calcium levels in second instar larvae. Does overexpression of Subdued reduce the nociceptive response and C4da calcium levels in third instar larvae? This experiment would nicely show that Subdued levels are required for this developmental transition.</p></disp-quote><p>Overexpression of Subdued in C4da neurons has previously been reported by Jang et al. 2015 to yield no effect on the responsiveness of third instar larvae. However, when we used a subdued-Gal4 to drive Subdued overexpression, the number of fast responding third instar larvae increased. We have added these data to our discussion (Lines 437-443).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

The paper does not have many figures and the ones that they have are relatively simple. I do not see why important data are moved into supplemental figures. Figure 3 is a case in point. Part 3B presents third instar data showing that the W650A dominant negative (DN), suppresses the response to a 42C probe while the F645A-DN does not. The response latency data for this temperature are then shown in a supplemental Figure [lacking data for F645A-DN]. The supplemental Figure also shows the important data for the 46C probe showing both % response (for W650A-DN and F645A-DN) and latency (this also lacking F645A-DN data). It would be more helpful to the reader to have them combined in a single Figure. The same could be said for combining Figure 4 with Figure 4 Supp 1A-C.</p></disp-quote><p>We have combined the Figure 3 and the supplement into a single figure.

AF1 refers to a functionality while A/B refers to the variable, N-terminal region of the receptor.
