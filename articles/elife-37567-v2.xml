transcription factors that regulate many developmental processes. In insects, the SoxB gene <italic>Dichaete</italic> is the only Sox gene known to be involved in segmentation. To determine if similar mechanisms are used in other arthropods, we investigated the role of Sox genes during segmentation in the spider <italic>Parasteatoda tepidariorum</italic>. While <italic>Dichaete</italic> does not appear to be involved in spider segmentation, we found that the closely related <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> gene acts as a gap gene during formation of anterior segments and is also part of the segmentation clock for development of the segment addition zone and sequential addition of opisthosomal segments. Thus, we have found that two different mechanisms of segmentation in a non-mandibulate arthropod are regulated by a SoxB gene. Our work provides new insights into the function of an important and conserved gene family, and the evolution of the regulation of segmentation in arthropods.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37567.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Insects, spiders, centipedes and lobsters all belong to a group of animals known as arthropods. A common feature of these animals is that their bodies are made up of repeated segments. However different arthropods build their segmented bodies in different ways. For example, the fruit fly makes all of its segments at the same time, while most other arthropods – including spiders – make a few segments at once and then add the rest, one or two at a time, to the rear end of their bodies.</p><p>Recent research in different insects has shown that these two processes – adding segments simultaneously or sequentially – are more similar than previously thought. This research also showed that these processes involve a gene called <italic>Dichaete</italic>, which belongs to the Sox gene family. However it was not known if Sox genes also control the production of segments in other arthropods like spiders.</p><p>Paese et al. have now found that, just like insects, the common house spider does indeed require a Sox gene to form its segments. Specifically, the experiments revealed that spiders need a Sox gene called <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> to make both the segments that carry their legs (which are made all at once), and the segments that make up the rear of their bodies (which are added one at a time).</p><p>Since spiders and insects both use a Sox gene to control the formation of their body segments, it is likely that the ancestor of arthropods used one too. However, because spiders and insects use a different Sox gene for these processes, Paese et al. suggest that one gene may have replaced the role of the other during the evolution of insects and spiders.</p><p>Together these findings broaden the current understanding of how genes interact to organise cells to build organisms and how these processes evolve over time. Furthermore, since Sox genes direct many important events in all animals, including humans, the discovery of a new role for one of these genes may help scientists to better understand the development of other animals too.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parasteatoda tepidariorum</kwd><kwd>spider</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>segmentation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>234586/2014-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paese</surname><given-names>Christian Louis Bonatto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPG-2016-234</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGregor</surname><given-names>Alistair P</given-names></name><name><surname>Schoenauer</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N007069/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sox21b-1 regulates simultaneous formation of anterior segments and addition of posterior segments in a spider, which resembles segmentation in long- and short-germ insects, and suggests SoxB regulation of segmentation is an ancestral feature of arthropods.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Arthropods are the most speciose and widespread of the animal phyla, and it is thought that their diversification and success are at least in part explained by their segmented body plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tautz, 2004</xref>). In terms of development, insects utilise either derived long germ embryogenesis, where all body segments are made more or less simultaneously, or short/intermediate germ embryogenesis, where a few anterior segments are specified and posterior segments are added sequentially from a growth or segment addition zone (SAZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis and Patel, 2002</xref>). It is thought that segmentation in the ancestral arthropod resembled the short germ mode seen in most insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McGregor et al., 2009</xref>). Understanding the regulation of segmentation more widely across the arthropods is important for understanding both the development and evolution of these highly successful animals.</p><p>We have a detailed and growing understanding of the regulation of segmentation in various insects, especially the long germ dipteran <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and the short germ beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum.</italic> However, studies of other arthropods including the myriapods <italic>Strigamia maritima</italic> and <italic>Glomeris marginata</italic>, and chelicerates, such as the spiders <italic>Cupiennius salei</italic> and <italic>Parasteatoda tepidariorum,</italic> have provided important mechanistic and evolutionary insights into arthropod segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hilbrant et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McGregor et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leite and McGregor, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Janssen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brena and Akam, 2012</xref>). Previous studies have shown that different genetic mechanisms are used to generate segments along the anterior-posterior axis of spider embryos. In the anterior tagma, the prosoma or cephalothorax, the cheliceral and pedipalpal segments are generated by dynamic waves of <italic>hedgehog</italic> (<italic>hh</italic>) and <italic>orthodenticle</italic> (<italic>otd</italic>) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kanayama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pechmann et al., 2009</xref>). The leg-bearing segments are specified by gap gene like functions of <italic>hunchback</italic> (<italic>hb</italic>) and <italic>distal-less</italic> (<italic>dll</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pechmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schwager et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, the segments of the posterior tagma, the opisthosoma or abdomen, are generated sequentially from a SAZ. This process is regulated by dynamic interactions between Delta-Notch and Wnt8 signalling to regulate <italic>caudal</italic> (<italic>cad</italic>), which in turn is required for oscillatory expression of pair-rule gene orthologues including <italic>even-skipped</italic> (<italic>eve</italic>), and <italic>runt</italic> (<italic>run</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McGregor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McGregor et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schönauer et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, these pair-rule gene orthologues are not involved in the production of the prosomal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schönauer et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the genetic regulation of segmentation along the anterior-posterior axis in the spider exhibits similarities and differences to segmentation in both long germ and short germ insects.</p><p>The Group B Sox (Sry-Related High-Mobility Group box) family gene <italic>Dichaete</italic> is required for correct embryonic segmentation in the long germ insect <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> where it regulates pair-rule gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nambu and Nambu, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Russell et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, it was recently discovered that a <italic>Dichaete</italic> orthologue is also likely involved in segmentation in the short germ insect <italic>T. castaneum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark and Peel, 2018</xref>). This similarity is consistent with work inferring that these modes of segmentation are more similar than previously thought and provides insights into how the long germ mode evolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark and Peel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clark, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Verd et al., 2018</xref>). However, it appears that despite these similarities, <italic>Dichaete</italic> can play different roles in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>T. castaneum</italic> consistent with the generation of segments simultaneously via a gap gene mechanism in the former and sequentially from a posterior SAZ in the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark and Peel, 2018</xref>).</p><p>We recently described the characterisation of 14 Sox genes in the genome of the spider <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paese et al., 2017</xref>) and that several of the spider Sox genes are represented by multiple copies likely produced during the whole genome duplication (WGD) in the lineage leading to this arachnid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paese et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schwager et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, while <italic>Dichaete</italic> is not expressed in a pattern consistent with a role in segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paese et al., 2017</xref>), we found that the closely related SoxB gene, <italic>Sox21b-1,</italic> is expressed in both the prosoma and opisthosoma before and during segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paese et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we report that in <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic>, <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> regulates both prosomal and opisthosomal segmentation. In the prosoma, <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> has a gap-like gene function and is required for the generation of the four leg-bearing segments. In addition, <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> appears to act upstream of both Delta-Notch and Wnt8 signalling to regulate the formation of the SAZ, and knockdown of <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> results in truncated embryos missing all opisthosomal segments. Therefore, while prosomal and opisthosomal segments are generated by different mechanisms in the spider, our analysis shows that <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> is required for segmentation in both regions of the developing spider embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Sox21b-1</italic> is maternally deposited and is subsequently expressed in the germ disc and germ band of spider embryos</title><p>We previously identified and assayed the expression of the complement of Sox genes in the genome of the spider <italic>P. tepidariorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paese et al., 2017</xref>) (and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Since migration of the cumulus is required for the transition from germ disc to germ band, this observation at least in part explains the subsequent Class III phenotype. Note that in this phenotypic class, the cells migrate towards the centre of the germ disc, creating a thick aggregation of blastomeres, whereas in embryos that we classified as ‘dead’, the cells are scattered and stop migrating after the germ disc stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the effect of <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> depletion on cell death and proliferation at stages 5 and 9 between knockdown and control embryos using antibodies against Caspase-3 and phosphorylated Histone 3 (PHH3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nikola-Michael Prpic (Reviewer #1); Natascha Turetzek (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have studied the role of a SoxB related gene, <italic>Sox21b-1</italic>, during the embryonic development of the spider <italic>Parasteatoda tepidariorum</italic>. In insects where the role of SoxB family genes in segmentation was examined, it was reported that a particular member of this gene family, called <italic>Dichaete</italic>, was involved. The present paper shows that although <italic>Dichaete</italic> is present and conserved in spiders, it is not involved in segmentation; instead, another SoxB paralog called <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> is involved in spider segmentation. The authors show that the gene is maternally provided and is then expressed in an anterior and a posterior domain in the forming embryo. They have also tested the function of the gene by RNAi and find that the RNAi knockdown animals show a striking phenotype where the entire posterior portion of the germ band is missing. Interestingly, a milder phenotype shows a &quot;gap-gene-like&quot; phenotype. The authors therefore go on to investigate the influence of <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> RNAi on known gap-like factors and posterior dynamic factors. They convincingly show that <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> is required for the expression of the known gap-like factors but is also required for the expression of the posterior dynamic patterning system that operates in the segment addition zone. Thus, with this work the authors provide the first factor that integrates the central gap system with the posterior dynamic system of spider segmentation. In fact, Paese et al. have identified a gene that is required for the development of the entire opisthosoma, and acts upstream of the previously identified system of caudal, Delta-Notch, and Wnt8 signalling. Moreover, the authors provide data for a mechanism in which <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> orchestrates posterior segment addition by organising the germ layers and the specification of mesendodermal cells. Finally, this study provides insight about how certain gene regulatory interactions can change during evolution following gene/genome duplication events.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should interpret the missing expression of some likely target genes after <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> RNAi more carefully. The expression might be reduced/lost because the input of <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> is missing. However, the expression might also be lost simply because the cells/tissue/organ where the gene is usually expressed are reduced/lost (especially because some of the RNAi phenotypes are quite severe because of the loss of <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> maternal contribution). By using whole-mount in situ hybridisation as the only indicator of target gene expression, it may be difficult in some cases to distinguish why the expression is reduced/lost in the RNAi animals and this may lead to erroneous statements about gene regulatory interactions between the studied genes. Remarkably, all of the studied (likely) target genes presumably respond &quot;negatively&quot; to <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> RNAi (i.e. their expression is reduced or lost), which increases the likelihood that not all of these &quot;negative responses&quot; are due to true genetic interactions. To clarify this, a marker could be used that co-expresses with one (or all) of these presumed targets, but that is not regulated by <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> to show that the cells are there and their identity properly specified. This would strengthen the authors’ claim that <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> is upstream and solidify their model in Figure 6. Alternatively, clonal RNAi in embryos could be performed, that would provide &quot;control&quot; cells directly next to injected RNAi cells. As these experiments would, however, require extensive additional work, the authors are therefore asked to carefully rephrase those portions of the text that deal with this issue of gene regulation and expressly state that the reduction/loss of gene expression after RNAi may have other causes than gene interaction and therefore not all of the genes shown in the manuscript to respond negatively upon <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> RNAi may be true regulatory targets.</p><p>2) The authors provide a very detailed staging of all the presented embryos, however the decision exactly which developmental stage is present is not always clear from the pictures especially in severely affected RNAi embryos. Please provide the criteria for staging of the RNAi embryos in the Materials and methods section. Was the staging based on certain landmarks or developmental processes of the normal developmental table? If yes, how was the decision made when these landmarks were lost after gene knockdown? Or were the RNAi embryos staged by developmental time?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37567.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should interpret the missing expression of some likely target genes after Sox21b-1 RNAi more carefully.

While our data shows that Sox21b-1 acts upstream of the segmentation genes we have tested, we did not mean to suggest that these genes are directly regulated by this transcription factor. Indeed, this regulation could well be several steps upstream of these genes and Sox21b-1 regulation could even be indirect by specifying the cells that will express these genes. Unfortunately, we do not know of a suitable marker that is expressed in the specific germ disc cells at the relevant stages that would be able to help with this point as suggested by the reviewers. With regard to embryonic RNAi injections, we believe that clonal analysis of <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> knockdown may be difficult to interpret and, as the reviewers recognise, would involve a significant amount of new experimental effort that, in the end, may not be conclusive. However, as mentioned above, we do accept the reviewers point that effects we see may not be direct and, therefore, as requested, we have rephrased the relevant text to clarify that not all of the genes that respond negatively to the <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> RNAi may be regulatory targets and that indeed the observed effects could be indirect through Sox21b-1 regulation of other intermediate genes or through the incorrect specification of germ disc cells. For example, in the Discussion section, we have added: “Note that while it is possible that Sox21b-1 could regulate <italic>Delta</italic> and <italic>Wnt8</italic> and other segmentation genes directly or via intermediate factors, it remains possible that the loss of expression of these genes upon <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> RNAi could be an indirect consequence of the loss of cells or incorrect cell specification when <italic>Sox21b-1</italic> expression is knocked-down.”</p><p>We have also tried to make this clearer in Figure 6 and the legend of this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors provide a very detailed staging of all the presented embryos, however the decision exactly which developmental stage is present is not always clear from the pictures especially in severely affected RNAi embryos.

Therefore, we have added a more detailed explanation of the criteria used for the fixation and staging of the RNAi embryos to the Materials and methods section. In summary, even though the embryos were immersed in oil for visualization, it was sometimes difficult to stage embryos due to their severe phenotypes (especially class III). Consequently, we relied on developmental staging by hours, and the morphology of sibling embryos from the same cocoon that did not show the phenotype (i.e. from cocoons where the effect was not fully penetrant) and at least in the case of older embryos, by the appearance of the limbs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
