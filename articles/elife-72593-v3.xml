cellular metabolism, bioenergetics, and redox homeostasis. Despite decades of research, a comprehensive investigation into the consequences of TCA cycle dysfunction remains elusive. Here, we targeted two TCA cycle enzymes, fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and combined metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics analyses to fully appraise the consequences of TCA cycle inhibition (TCAi) in murine kidney epithelial cells. Our comparative approach shows that TCAi elicits a convergent rewiring of redox and amino acid metabolism dependent on the activation of ATF4 and the integrated stress response (ISR). Furthermore, we also uncover a divergent metabolic response, whereby acute FHi, but not SDHi, can maintain asparagine levels via reductive carboxylation and maintenance of cytosolic aspartate synthesis. Our work highlights an important interplay between the TCA cycle, redox biology, and amino acid homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TCA cycle</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC_MC_UU_12022/6.</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frezza</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC819920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>Dylan Gerard</given-names></name><name><surname>Frezza</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multi-omic analyses reveal a connection between the integrated stress response and the regulation of redox and amino acid metabolism when the TCA cycle is impaired.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most of the energy-rich adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generated in metabolism is provided by the complete oxidation of key fuel molecules to CO<sub>2</sub> in mitochondria. This catabolic process primarily occurs in the mitochondrial matrix via a series of reactions known as the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krebs and Johnson, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Owen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saraste, 1999</xref>). In addition, the TCA cycle is a source of precursors for the synthesis of many other biological molecules, such as nonessential amino acids (NEAAs), lipids, nucleotide bases and porphyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Owen et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, any dysfunction of the TCA cycle is expected to elicit profound metabolic reprogramming of the cell beyond defective ATP generation. FH is a homotetrameric enzyme localized to the mitochondrial matrix and cytosol that catalyzes the stereospecific hydration of fumarate to L-malate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tuboi et al., 1986</xref>). SDH, also known as complex II of the electron transport chain (ETC), is a heterotetrameric complex composed of four different subunits, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yankovskaya et al., 2003</xref>). SDH localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schultz and Chan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yankovskaya et al., 2003</xref>). SDH is the only TCA cycle enzyme that is also a component of the ETC and so provides a physical link between the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Interestingly, mutations of both FH and SDH predispose kidney tubuluar epithelium to transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sciacovelli et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that the kidney can be particularly affected by TCA cycle dysfunction.</p><p>Mitochondrial stress activates a retrograde signaling pathway to communicate metabolic dysfunction to the nucleus, a process first described in yeast over 20 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butow and Avadhani, 2004</xref>). However, only recently has mitochondrial stress signalling in mammals been linked to the integrated stress response (ISR) and the transcription factor Atf4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Quirós et al., 2017</xref>). The ISR is an evolutionary conserved signaling network that responds to diverse cellular stresses, from amino acid deprivation to viral infection, and operates by reprogramming translation (general translation inhibitor via phosphorylation of the translational initiation factor eIF2α) and increasing the translation of specific stress-induced mRNAs, such as <italic>Atf4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). While much is understood about the mechanisms of ISR signaling and Atf4 activation as a whole, we are only beginning to understand how mitochondria engage this pathway and how the ISR and Atf4 regulate the metabolic response to stress. Likewise, despite decades of research, a comprehensive investigation into the metabolic consequences and cellular response to TCA cycle dysfunction specifically in mammalian cells remains elusive. Here, we perform a comparative investigation into the consequences of acute TCAi in murine epithelial kidney cells. We identify a shared metabolic signature of TCAi, whereby enhanced glutathione synthesis is accompanied by a concomitant impairment in de novo proline and aspartate synthesis. Importantly, the selective disruption of mitochondrial thiol redox homeostasis is sufficient to recapitulate the convergent TCAi metabolic signature. Furthermore, acute TCAi phenocopied an amino acid deprivation-like state and activated the integrated stress response to counter redox and amino acid stress. Notably, acute SDHi led to a pronounced decrease in asparagine synthesis, an effect not observed with FHi, where reductive carboxylation and cytosolic aspartate synthesis maintain the asparagine pool. Finally, this work highlights a previously underappreciated role for oxidative TCA cycle activity and respiration in proline synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TCA cycle inhibition promotes glutathione synthesis while impairing de novo proline and aspartate synthesis</title><p>To identify a common metabolic signature of TCA cycle dysfunction, we performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomic analysis of kidney epithelial cells upon TCAi. To this aim, we assessed the response to acute TCAi with the FH inhibitor, FHIN-1, and the SDH inhibitors, Atpenin A5 (AA5) and Thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA) (Acute model) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) as it enabled us to chart the early events of TCAi in a controlled fashion without adaptive compensations. We then compared it to cells in which <italic>Fh1</italic> or <italic>Sdhb</italic> have been genetically ablated (Chronic model). This analysis revealed substantial changes in the metabolome upon TCAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–1H</xref>) with bona fide metabolic markers of FH and SDH deficiency observed (Figure S1E-H). For FHi, this included the accumulation of (S)–2-succinocysteine (2SC) and succinicGSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,G</xref>), metabolites formed from fumarate-mediated alkylation of free cysteine and the major anti-oxidant GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). For SDHi, this included a significant accumulation in intracellular succinate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F,H</xref>). Comparative analysis of all five conditions revealed that only two metabolites were significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), whilst eight metabolites were significantly decreased across all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The two significantly increased metabolites were GSH and oxidized GSH (GSSG), which suggested a perturbation in redox homeostasis when TCA cycle activity is inhibited. Of the eight decreased metabolites, notably, two were TCA cycle metabolites (malate and <italic>cis</italic>-aconitate). Furthermore, the amino acids proline and aspartate were also decreased. Completing the list were propionylcarnitine and butyrylcarnitine, which are products of catabolic pathways known to feed the TCA cycle, while UTP and UDP-glucose are pyrimidine-associated metabolites (synthesized from aspartate) involved in glucose metabolism. Interestingly, while both acute FHi and SDHi impaired intracellular aspartate, proline and cystine levels (albeit to a different extent), only SDHi led to a significant decrease in intracellular asparagine levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Of note, acute FHi or SDHi led to a decrease in aspartate and proline levels already after 1 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J,K</xref>), which suggests that the impairment in amino acid synthesis precedes the changes in GSH metabolism. Finally, we observed that <italic>Fh1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Sdhb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells increased intracellular cystine, serine, glycine, and asparagine levels, suggesting that chronic perturbations of the TCA cycle may induce adaptive compensatory metabolic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TCA cycle inhibition promotes cytosolic glutathione synthesis while impairing de novo proline and aspartate synthesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of comparative metabolomic approach to assess the metabolic response of kidney epithelial cells to TCAi.

Stable-assisted isotope tracing revealed that a significant proportion of glutamate and proline are derived from glutamine as their pools consist primarily of the m + 5 isotopologue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Total m + 5 labeling from glutamine significantly decreased in proline, suggesting an impairment in glutamate-derived proline synthesis upon TCAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, m + 3 labeled proline, which is derived from α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) that has undergone one round of oxidative TCA cycle catabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), disappears with TCAi. U-<sup>13</sup>C-glutamine tracing also revealed robust labeling of TCA cycle intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and an impairment in oxidative TCA cycling with FHi and SDHi, as determined by a decrease in m + 4 and m + 2-labeled citrate and <italic>cis</italic>-aconitate, m + 3-labeled α-KG and 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and m + 2-labeled succinate, malate, fumarate, and aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Aspartate is directly synthesized from TCA cycle-derived oxaloacetate via glutamate-aspartate transaminase 2 (GOT2), downstream of FH and SDH in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardaci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). Aspartate is subsequently exported to the cytosol where it can also be converted into asparagine via the action of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). We observed a significant decrease in m + 4-labeled aspartate and asparagine upon TCAi, suggesting an impairment in mitochondrial-synthesized aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). It is worth noting that SDHi was more effective at decreasing m + 4-labeled aspartate than FHi, explaining the lower levels of asparagine synthesis observed with SDHi. Acute FHi promoted reductive carboxylation, as determined by an increase in m + 5-labeled isotopologue fractional enrichment in α-KG, 2-HG, citrate and <italic>cis</italic>-aconitate and in m + 3-labeled malate, aspartate and asparagine (which arises from the cytosolic synthesis of aspartate via GOT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Despite a reduction in the m + 3 labeling, the total pools of malate, aspartate, and asparagine were maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast to FHi, SDHi significantly decreased reductive carboxylation and fully impaired cytosolic aspartate and asparagine synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). A complete loss of m + 3 labeled alanine was also observed with TCAi, which may be derived from oxaloacetate-derived phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or from m + 3-labeled malate as a consequence of reductive carboxylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with elevated levels of cytosolic GSH synthesis following TCAi, an increase in the intensity of m + 5 labeling in γ-glutamylcysteine, GSH and GSSG and m + 10-labeled GSSG was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>This tracing analysis was further supported by combining metabolomics of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. Indeed, whilst mitochondrial aspartate levels where equally reduced by both FHi and SDHi, SDHi led to a more pronounced decrease in the cytosolic fraction of aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Additionally, asparagine levels were maintained in the cytosol with FHi, but decreased with SDHi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Therefore, asparagine levels are maintained upon FHi in part from a less severe depletion of cytosolic aspartate levels and from the maintenance of reductive carboxylation and GOT1-derived aspartate synthesis. Fractionation also revealed a decrease in proline upon TCAi, and an increase in GSSG levels with SDHi and in succinicGSH with FHi across both fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Due to increased oxidative stress with TCAi, as determined by a significant increase in GSSG levels when compared to GSH levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and the aforementioned accumulation of succinicGSH adducts with FHi, we investigated whether cytosolic GSH synthesis and amino acid metabolism were sensitive to perturbations in mitochondrial thiol redox homeostasis. To achieve this, we utilized a recently developed tool, termed mitoCDNB, to selectively deplete mitochondrial GSH pools and inhibit thioredoxin reductase 2 and peroxiredoxin 3, thus impairing mitochondrial thiol redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cvetko et al., 2021</xref>). We confirmed the previously-described formation of the mitoCDNB-GSH adduct (MitoGSDNB) upon treatment with mitoCDNB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booty et al., 2019</xref>), thus validating the approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similar to TCAi, impaired mitochondrial thiol redox homeostasis significantly decreased proline and aspartate levels and increased GSH synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, mitoCDNB decreased m + 5 labeling in proline and m + 4 labeling in aspartate while increasing m + 5 labeling inγ-glutamylcysteine, GSH and GSSG and m + 10-labeled GSSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) upon incubation with U-<sup>13</sup>C-glutamine. The decrease in aspartate with mitoCDNB is likely due to reduced oxidative TCA cycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, m + 4 labeled asparagine was unaffected with mitoCDNB and similarly to FHi, we observe an increase in reductive carboxylation, cytosolic aspartate synthesis, and an increase in m + 3-labeled asparagine despite lower levels of m + 3-labeled aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Overall, this data supports the idea that impaired mitochondrial redox homeostasis may causally contribute to the changes in amino acid metabolism observed upon TCAi.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Disrupted mitochondrial thiol redox homeostasis phenocopies TCA cycle inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram highlighting mito <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/1-chloro-2-4-dinitrobenzene">1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene</ext-link> (mitoCDNB) reaction with glutathione and the formation of mito 1-S-glutathionyl-2,4-dinitrobenzene (MitoGSDNB) and intensity levels in DMSO-treated and mitoCDNB (10 μM)-treated <italic>Fh1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> cells.

Given that glutamate is an essential source for proline biosynthesis, TCA cycle anaplerosis, and GSH synthesis, we hypothesized that the defect in proline might arise from differences in glutamate apportioning into these pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We therefore tested whether the γ-glutamylcysteine ligase (GCL) inhibitor L-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO), which blunted GSH synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), would restore proline levels. In support of the glutamate apportioning hypothesis, BSO treatment of kidney epithelial cells increased glutamate, aspartate and asparagine abundance, whilst a trend in increased proline was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, when TCAi was coupled with impaired GSH synthesis, it led to significantly higher intracellular glutamate and cystine levels but failed to rescue the decrease in proline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). In fact, proline levels decreased further, suggesting that glutathione synthesis is required to support proline synthesis when TCA cycle activity is interrupted and redox stress increases. Likewise, alanine, asparagine, and aspartate levels were also significantly lower with a combination of FHi and BSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), whilst SDHi and BSO lead to a further drop in asparagine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

To achieve this, we measured the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup>, NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup>, and ATP/ADP ratio with TCAi on its own or coupled to BSO or eGSH treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Intriguingly, we observed a significant increase in the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio with both FHi (~12 fold) and SDHi (~4.65 fold), but the increase was more than double with FHi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This difference was also reflected by the elevated lactate/pyruvate ratio observed with FHi compared to SDHi, whereas the decrease in the citrate/pyruvate ratio was similar between both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio was decreased with BSO co-treatment suggesting an essential interplay between GSH synthesis and the redox state of the cell upon TCAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). TCAi also led to a significant decrease in the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio is a readout of oxidative stress given the role of NADPH in supporting anti-oxidant defence systems and in the reduction of cystine to cysteine for GSH synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, we observed an increase in the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio (and an increase in cystine) with TCAi and BSO co-treatment, while eGSH supplementation prevented a decrease in the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio with TCAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This data suggests that TCAi places cells under conditions of oxidative stress and that the drop in NADPH is due in part to an increased requirement of the cell to convert oxidized cystine to reduced cysteine to support GSH synthesis. Recently, NADPH has been implicated as the major cofactor supporting mitochondrial proline biosynthesis and this could partly explain the decrease in proline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). However, neither BSO or eGSH could rescue proline synthesis despite increasing intracellular glutamate or re-establishing NADPH levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Whilst not precluding the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio as being an important mitochondrial factor governing this response, it suggested other mechanisms could also be at play with TCAi.</p><p>The main function of the TCA cycle is to support NADH generation for OXPHOS. As expected, TCAi led to a significant decrease in the ATP/ADP ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and a decrease in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis, as assessed with a Seahorse flux analyzer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Unlike the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio, BSO and eGSH treatments failed to rescue the decrease in the ATP/ADP ratio, and FHi and BSO treatment actually led to a further decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Given the importance of ATP as a cofactor for the proline synthetic enzyme Aldh18a1 (also known as P5C synthetase), this data suggested that impaired respiration and ATP availability was a factor governing reduced proline biosynthesis with TCAi. To validate this hypothesis, we treated cells with the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>-ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin. In line with our hypothesis, we observed a significant decrease in the ATP/ADP ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) and proline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). We also observed an increase in γ-glutamylcysteine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) and no significant change in the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> or NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), although a trend toward a decrease in the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio was observed. Given the requirement of ATP for NADK2-mediated phosphorylation of NAD<sup>+</sup> to generate NADP<sup>+</sup> in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>), it’s likely that a combined reduction of mitochondrial ATP and NAD(P)H give rise to the defect in proline synthesis. Further support for mitochondrial respiration involvement in regulating de novo proline synthesis came from the inhibition of complex III with antimycin A, which significantly decreased aspartate, asparagine and proline, while promoting GSH synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). mitoCDNB had no significant effect on the overall ATP/ADP ratio, but increased the lactate/ pyruvate and the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating a minor defect in mitochondrial complex I and respiration with no alterations in the ATP/ADP ratio. This result is also consistent with increased asparagine levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and lower levels of proline inhibition with mitoCDNB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) of the significantly increased genes/proteins using Enrichr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) revealed that cytosolic tRNA aminoacylation and amino acid metabolism were among the most enriched pathways using the Reactome database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) again lending support to the idea that perturbed amino acid metabolism was a key outcome of interrupted TCA cycle activity. We also observed a suppression of cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) consistent with previous reports using respiration inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mick et al., 2020</xref>), while mitoribosome subunits and respiration-associated proteins were found to decrease in abundance with TCAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, despite this apparent decrease in mitoribosome subunits, we failed to observe a decrease in 35S-methionine labeling of mitochondrial proteins with TCAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which suggests that mitochondrial protein synthesis is resistant to both impaired respiration and a decrease in the components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus over the tested timeframe (24 h).

Likewise, GOT1 levels were also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This data suggested that cytosolic asparagine synthesis was maintained with FHi in part via reductive carboxylation and GOT1-directed aspartate synthesis, but also due to increased Asns expression. It also emphasized the importance of cytosolic aspartate synthesis, as acute SDHi robustly increased Asns but failed to maintain asparagine synthesis. A clear upregulation of PSPH, PSAT1, PHGDH, and SHMT1/2 is also observed with TCAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), which may support GSH synthesis via the provision of glycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, TCAi led to a robust increase in the cytosolic proline synthetic enzyme, Pycr3, at the protein level. Consistent with a more pronounced decrease in proline levels with SDHi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>, S1I), Aldh18a1 and Pycr1 were also upregulated to a greater extent at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, the most highly increased tRNA synthetase at the protein level with TCAi was the asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (NARS1), while one of the most highly increased on the transcript level was the glutamate-proline tRNA synthetase (EPRS1). These data support the notion that a key metabolic module affected by TCA cycle dysfunction is amino acid metabolism, with a particular focus on proline and aspartate/asparagine. Finally, a notable increase in the cysteine (CARS)-, glycine (GARS)-, alanine (AARS)-, and serine(SARS)-tRNA synthetases along with enzymes associated with cysteine, glycine, serine, and alanine biosynthesis (CTH, SHMT1/2, PSAT1, PSPH1 and GPT2) with either FHi or SDHi (or both) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) lend further support to the idea TCAi promotes compensatory transcriptional/translational rewiring to support GSH and amino acid metabolism in order to counteract amino acid stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>TCA cycle inhibition activates Atf4 and the integrated stress response</title><p>To understand how the transcriptional changes induced upon TCAi were communicated to the nucleus, we performed transcription factor (TF) enrichment analysis and uncovered activation of several metabolic stress response TFs associated with the ISR, namely Ddit3/Chop, Atf5, Atf4, Atf3, Cebpb, and Cebpg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>).

ISRIB works within a defined window of activation, inhibiting low level ISR activity but not affecting strong ISR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rabouw et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we used a lower dose of FHIN-1 (10 μM) and observed an attenuation in FHi-induced Atf4 stability and Atf4-target gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Importantly, this regulation was only strongly observed with FHi-induced Atf4 and not basal Atf4 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This result confirmed that the ISR was involved in Atf4 stabilization and FHi-induced gene expression. In order to determine whether induction of the ISR regulated the metabolic response to TCAi, we treated wild-type cells with FHIN-1 or FHIN-1 and ISRIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). While ISRIB treatment led to a significant decrease in proline (~25%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>) likely due to basal p-eIF2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Co-treatment of FHIN-1 and ISRIB led to a substantial decrease in intracellular proline (~75%) when compared to FHIN-1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Similarly, aspartate and asparagine levels were also decreased with co-treatment of FHIN-1 and ISRIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) supporting the idea that the ISR was activated to compensate for the defect in the de novo synthesis of these amino acids. In addition to countering amino acid stress, we observed an increase in oxidative stress with FHi when the ISR was attenuated, as assessed by a significant increase in GSSG/GSH ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In summary, TCAi triggers the ISR to counter amino acid and redox stress in kidney epithelial cells.</p><p>To evaluate the role of Atf4 in the response to TCAi, we ablated Atf4 expression using two independent siRNAs and confirmed a decrease at the protein and transcript level of Atf4 and Atf4-target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Atf4 was stabilized to a certain extent basally in our cells and its ablation revealed that Atf4 is a key regulator of GSH synthesis, as expected given it’s important role in regulating cysteine metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sbodio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Torrence et al., 2021</xref>), and of the amino acids proline, alanine, and asparagine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

The ability to perform such analysis is only now possible due to the advent of powerful mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing technologies that allow us to observe the transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome in greater detail than ever before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hasin et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we undertook a multi-modal analysis to elucidate how the TCA cycle operates and integrates with the transcriptome and proteome of the cell. Our analysis revealed significant differences when comparing the metabolic profile of FH or SDH inhibition. These key differences likely arise for several reasons. FH, unlike SDH, is also localised to the cytosol and can also translocate to the nucleus upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). As such, FH loss may give rise to extramitochondrial consequences. SDH is physically associated with the ETC and tethered to the inner mitochondrial membrane. The different distribution of both enzymes within mitochondria is likely to influence their impact mitochondrial bioenergetics and on the overall metabolic profile. A major difference between FH and SDH loss is the accumulation of fumarate. Fumarate is a mildly electrophilic metabolite that can succinate GSH and protein cysteine residues to form a post-translational modification termed succination, as previously mentioned. In contrast, SDH loss results in a decrease of fumarate and an accumulation of succinate. Unlike fumarate, succinate is not an electrophilic compound that can modify cystine residues and so differences between FH and SDH loss are likely owed to succination, at least in part. Finally, succinate released from cells can bind to the succinate receptor SUCNR1, which is expressed in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">He et al., 2004</xref>). Autocrine and paracrine ligation of SUCNR1 by high levels of succinate accumulation and release with SDH loss is likely to alter the metabolic and transcriptional landscape of the cells.</p><p>From a metabolic perspective, our analysis also revealed an unexpected link between a functional oxidative TCA cycle, mitochondrial respiration and thiol redox homeostasis with de novo proline biosynthesis. This is reminiscent of the work previously linking appropriate ETC function with aspartate synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardaci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>) and suggests that mitochondrial function is also essential for de novo proline synthesis in certain contexts. Our analysis implicated decreased α-KG siphoning and diminished mitochondrial ATP levels as the mechanism by which the TCA cycle impairs proline synthesis. Recently, two elegant studies revealed that contrary to previous reports, NAD(P)H and not NADH is the primary redox cofactor required for mitochondrial proline synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). Given the drop in the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio we observe and the reliance of mitochondrial NADP<sup>+</sup> pools on ATP and the NAD kinase NADK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that a combined bioenergetic and reductive power defect plays a role upon TCAi. Furthermore, studies show that Pycr1 is a redox sensitive enzyme that can be modified by reactive electrophilic species (RES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Timblin et al., 2021</xref>), while proline synthetic enzymes are oxidative stress-inducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krishnan et al., 2008</xref>) and are also targets of reactive oxygen specie (ROS)-mediated cysteine oxidation, as determined by quantitative redox proteomics of murine tissues in vivo (OxiMouse) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>). Given TCAi leads to increased oxidative stress (and succination with FHi) and that direct perturbations of thiol redox homeostasis with mitoCDNB impair proline synthesis, it is also tempting to speculate that ROS or RES could impair this pathway. This could also explain why a common outcome of TCAi is the enhancement of GSH synthesis and why inhibiting GSH synthesis with BSO led to a further decrease in proline levels.</p><p>Intriguingly, a novel ribosome profiling technique termed diricore was recently developed to uncover signals of restrictive amino acid availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loayza-Puch et al., 2016</xref>). Application of diricore to a cohort of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients, a common renal cancer type associated with severe mitochondrial dysfunction and derived from kidney epithelial cells, uncovered a signal indicating proline restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loayza-Puch et al., 2016</xref>). The authors also found that ccRCC upregulated PYCR1 in order to compensate for this proline deficit and was a targetable vulnerability in these tumours. As such, our work provides mechanistic insight into how and why proline would be restricted in the context of kidney epithelial cells with mitochondrial dysfunction. ATF4 is likely the transcriptional regulator of the proline synthetic enzymes, Aldh18a1 and Pycr1, in this context. These findings suggest that tumours can compensate for deficiencies in the synthesis of NEAAs linked to mitochondrial function, while tumor-associated stromal cells may also act to provide NEAAs under these conditions. However, identification of these metabolic vulnerabilities may guide therapeutic strategies that utilise diet and pharmacological approaches to treat certain tumour types. While proline and Pycr1 regulation has been linked to Atf4 signaling previously, this was in the context of stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D’Aniello et al., 2015</xref>) and not that of mitochondrial dysfunction. Although it has been suggested that the pancreas is the major site of proline production in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tran et al., 2021</xref>), the kidney has been proposed to operate as a proline-producing organ under conditions of fasting and with low proline diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Watanabe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Watanabe et al., 1997</xref>). Given the high density of mitochondria in proximal kidney tubules, it would be tempting to speculate that high rates of oxidative TCA activity could be important to facilitate proline biosynthesis for use by other organs under conditions of fasting or nutrient scarcity.</p><p>The importance of mitochondrial retrograde signaling to the cytosol and nucleus, and its regulation of both homeostatic and pathogenic signaling events is only beginning to be appreciated. In this study, we also investigated mitochondrial retrograde signaling events that occur in response to acute TCA cycle dysfunction to better understand the molecular underpinnings of the response. We found that TCAi increased Atf4 levels and triggered a transcriptional response reminiscent of amino deprivation and heme-deficiency. HRI has recently been implicated as the ISR kinase responsible for sensing mitochondrial dysfunction via a newly discovered pathway that involves the proteolytic cleavage of DELE1 by the protease OMA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fessler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, asparagine has also recently been implicated in signaling mitochondrial respiration to Atf4 via GCN2, which detects uncharged aminoacyl tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Krall et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mick et al., 2020</xref>). Our data likely supports the idea that one or both of these kinases is responsible for sensing TCA cycle dysfunction, however, future investigations are required to fully validate this hypothesis. Our work does however support the idea that reprogramming events are elicited to support the maintenance of both aspartate and asparagine pools under conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction. In contrast to previous studies, our analysis revealed a surprising degree of metabolic plasticity to this defect in kidney epithelial cells depending on the insult. Cells with acute FHi, but not SDHi, maintained reductive carboxylation and cytosolic aspartate synthesis likely due to decreased Complex I activity and increased NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mullen et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike acute FHi, chronic FH loss impairs reductive carboxylation in murine kidney epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frezza et al., 2011</xref>) likely via higher and sustained levels of fumarate-mediated protein succination that affect aconitase function, required for this metabolic re-routing. Acute FHi also led to increased consumption of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) valine and leucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and an increase in the cytosolic branched chain aminotransferase (BCAT1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), but this was not observed with SDHi. BCAAs can act as an important nitrogen source for the synthesis of cytosolic aspartate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mayers et al., 2016</xref>) and so another possibility for the increased capacity for cytosolic aspartate synthesis with FHi is the reprogramming of BCAA catabolism via BCAT1. Importantly, this work also suggests that the relative pool size of aspartate exceeds that of asparagine, as even under conditions of limited aspartate availability, metabolic and transcriptional changes can maintain asparagine levels. This indicates a reprioritization toward maintaining asparagine levels under certain stress conditions despite impaired aspartate synthesis.</p><p>In conclusion, both FHi and SDHi impair de novo proline and aspartate synthesis by interrupting oxidative TCA cycle activity and OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). TCAi also decreases the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio to support cystine reduction and promote cytosolic GSH synthesis in order to counteract amino acid and redox stress. A clear upregulation of PSPH, PSAT1, PHGDH, and SHMT1/2 is also observed that may serve to support glutathione synthesis via the provision of glycine. Intriguingly, acute FHi maintains asparagine synthesis via reductive carboxylation, cytosolic aspartate synthesis and an Atf4-induced increase in ASNS. However, SDHi leads to a significant impairment in asparagine synthesis as it fails to engage reductive carboxylation and promote sufficient levels of cytosolic aspartate synthesis. Finally, TCAi triggers activation of the ISR and Atf4 stabilization to communicate an amino-acid-deprived and redox-stressed state to the nucleus. Overall, our work highlights the crucial role that the TCA cycle plays in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and reveals the magnificent plasticity and unique adaptations that may arise in response to metabolic perturbations.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p>Although comprehensive in its metabolic investigation of acute TCA cycle dysfunction, this study was performed in a proliferating epithelial cell type of kidney origin in vitro. As such, whether these findings extend to different cell types or tissue types will need to be investigated further. While beyond the scope of this study, the precise mechanism(s) by which TCA cycle dysfunction triggers the ISR or how different tissues respond to TCA cycle inhibition in vivo under fed and fasted conditions will also be important to assess in future investigations. Finally, our study used high-nutrient DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated serum. The use of this medium enables careful control of our in vitro experiments and is commonly used for most molecular biology studies. Recently, it has also proved important in revealing specific metabolic dependencies relating to proline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). However, it will be important to assess this response under nutrient scarcity or with different nutrient compositions in the future to reveal other facets of the metabolic response. mitoCDNB is a new tool recently developed to perturb thiol redox homeostasis in mitochondria by depleting GSH and modifying protein cysteines on certain redox enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booty et al., 2019</xref>). As such, it is difficult to define whether the effect it has on mitochondrial function and metabolism is due to GSH depletion or direct modification of identified targets. Whether mitoCDNB will modify currently unidentified targets also remains to be determined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Reagent type (species) or resource</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Designation</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Source or reference</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Identifiers</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Additional information</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Fh1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frezza et al., 2011</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Fh1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kidney epithelial cell line</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Fh1<sup>-/-CL1</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frezza et al., 2011</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Fh1<sup>-/-CL1</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kidney epithelial cell line</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Fh1<sup>-/-CL19</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frezza et al., 2011</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Fh1<sup>-/-CL19</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kidney epithelial cell line</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Sdhb<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardaci et al., 2015</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Sdhb<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kidney epithelial cell line</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Sdhb<sup>-/-CL5</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardaci et al., 2015</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Sdhb<sup>-/-CL5</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kidney epithelial cell line</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Sdhb<sup>-/-CL7</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardaci et al., 2015</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Sdhb<sup>-/-CL7</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kidney epithelial cell line</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">D8418</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fumarate hydratase inhibitor 1 (FHIN-1)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MedChemExpress</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Daniel Tennant (Reviewer #2); Christian Metallo (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this work is the first to comprehensively look at the differences, rather than the similarities, between FH and SDH disruption, although agreed that some additional discussion of what might drive those differences is warranted. The reviewers each made specific comments, and agreed that none necessarily require additional experiments, but to enhance the impact of the paper I have copied the full reviewer comments below. I also ask you pay particular attention to these points when adding additional discussion in your revised manuscript.</p><p>1. Please clarify how data were normalized (Reviewer 1 point 1).</p><p>2. Please discuss what may account for differences observed between SDH and FH loss.</p><p>3. Please check all figures to ensure data are accessible (i.e. not too small to evaluate) and consider the points raised by Reviewer 2 regarding data presentation.</p><p>4. Please clarify the timing of all treatments and discuss limitations of the compounds used (Reviewer 2).</p><p>5. Please consider the various suggestions raised by Reviewer 2 in their extensive review.</p><p>6. Please discuss that NEAA may be available from other cell types in tumors with SDH or FH loss.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As noted above – the authors should address:</p><p>1. Exactly how each perturbation affects cell proliferation is not clear. This should be considered, as whether some of the differences are a result in changes in growth or proliferation rate is possible, and will affect how they normalize their data.</p><p>2. It is unclear why FH loss is different than SDH loss, and it is also somewhat surprising that the effects of acute and chronic loss of either enzyme are not that different. While explaining this is too much to ask, some additional speculation might be warranted.</p><p>3. The increase in glutathione and GSSG is interpreted as a consequence of increased oxidative stress, but that will not necessarily affect total levels.</p><p>4. The text in the Figure S1 PCA plots have legends is too small to read. This should be corrected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall a very elegant manuscript that pulls together complex datasets to identify a coherent signalling mechanism between dysfunctional mitochondrial metabolism and a nuclear transcriptional response. I feel that there are a few areas in which the manuscript could be improved from both the technical and 'readability' perspectives, but overall it is of a very high standard.</p><p>1. The idea of a single figure legend for multiple graphs is often excellent. However, due to the large number of colours and treatment conditions, I found it a bit difficult to interpret some of the figures with this layout. For example, where some graphs are MIDs and others are treatments, the single legend meant it took longer to interpret (see Figure 2B, C and E for example). The size of the legend also meant that the large numbers of colours for MIDs could be tricky to interpret on a screen (see Figure 1B – the orange and pink shown in the legend were almost indistinguishable on the screen and when printed out). Some work on the presentation of the data in this way would really aid the reader interpreting some of the metabolic results.</p><p>2. The length of treatment with compounds is not always clear – I was unable to find details of the length of oligomycin or BSO treatments used, as examples.</p><p>3. In the initial metabolomics screen (Figure 1, S1), I was unable to find succinicGSH in the heatmap (S1E), while it was reported in the graphed data next to it. If it is there, could this be made clearer – perhaps highlighting in bold those metabolites that the authors refer to?</p><p>4. As highlighted in the public review, I'm not aware of the mitoCDNB being shown not to interfere with other aspects of mitochondrial metabolism, such as ETC activity. This would also be predicted to have a similar effect on the metabolites shown, based on other evidence in this manuscript. One way of addressing this might be to confirm that respiration continues after mitoCDNB treatment. Short-term BSO treatment has also previously been shown to affect the cytosolic glutathione pool, while the mitochondrial pool is slower to turn over. This should not have the same metabolic dysfunctional effect as longer BSO treatment that depletes total glutathione. Perhaps therefore repeating the BSO experiment shown in Figure 4 with a more acute treatment might be another approach?</p><p>5. In Figure 2C, while aspartate m+4 is 20% or less of the untreated levels, asparagine m+4 is closer to 60%. This effect is also apparent in the m+3 isotopomer comparison (Figure S2C) – while aspartate is reduced to around 40% of levels, asparagine is unchanged. Given the significant (2 orders of magnitude) difference in concentration between these metabolites, is this a reprioritisation of aspartate fate? This is also apparent in Figure 4C, in which BSO treatment has a substantial effect on asparagine concentrations, while aspartate is comparatively unaffected.</p><p>6. Conventionally, the pyridine nucleotide ratios are either NAD+:NADH and NADP+:NADPH, or as a generalised form NAD(P)}:NAD(P)H. In some cases, the authors are using a mixed ratio – NAD(P)H:NADP+ or similar. It isn't clear why this is important, or whether this is just an oversight? Indeed, given that the Tran et al., (2021) paper showed that NADK2 is required for P5C synthesis, can we now be more certain that ALDH18A1 is most likely to utilise NADPH under physiological conditions?</p><p>7. In Figure 4A, the BSO values appear to be close to 0, or not detected. However, as it stands this could be clearer – could the authors use another method – either split axis or log scale, or highlight 'ND' if it was below the analytical noise?</p><p>8. Could the authors comment on the possibility that some of the metabolite rescue observed after eGSH treatment could be through recycling of the compound itself into metabolic pools – e.g. glutamate? (Figure S4B).</p><p>9. In Figure 4G, use of oligomycin did not alter the cellular NADH:NAD+ ratio. This is a non-obvious result, as it could be expected to change, depending on the time for which oligomycin treatment was used. Could the authors comment on this in the text, or show how the cells are compensating with significantly increased lactate synthesis?</p><p>10. From line 266 onwards, the authors suggest that reduced ATP and NADPH availability is the likely explanation for the results observed. However, the authors did not report a change in the NADPH:NADP+ ratio (Figure 4G), so based on the evidence provided, the drop in ATP could be considered sufficient for their hypothesis.</p><p>11. In the proteomic analysis, the authors identify a significant change in a significant number of enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism. The change in ASNS, for example was a clearly consistent and significant change across treatments. However, the authors also specifically mention PYCR3 as being altered. While this is the case, there are others that appear more consistently upregulated but not mentioned. One example of this is PSPH/PSAT1/PHGDH/SHMT<sub>1/2</sub>, which are all increased in both FHi and SDHi conditions, and form a fairly coherent metabolic network that is highly compelling. As the authors will be highly aware, the provision of glycine for glutathione synthesis is likely to rely on these enzymes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Nice work.</p><p>The key limitation I see is: the impact of mito defects on NEAA synthesis is well-established and clear, but this severe metabolic dependence is also a function of in vitro growth conditions.

Exactly how each perturbation affects cell proliferation is not clear. This should be considered, as whether some of the differences are a result in changes in growth or proliferation rate is possible, and will affect how they normalize their data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for raising a critical point and allowing us to clarify how we normalize metabolomics experiments. All the metabolomics data takes into consideration the cell number. Indeed, prior to metabolite extraction, cells are counted using a separate counting plate prepared in parallel and treated exactly like the experimental plate. In this way, differences in cell number are accounted for and the efficiency of metabolic extraction is preserved. Consumption release (CoRe) metabolomics also takes into consideration the proliferation rate during normalization since we normalise data to the final cell number. We have expanded the description in the relevant sections in the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is unclear why FH loss is different than SDH loss, and it is also somewhat surprising that the effects of acute and chronic loss of either enzyme are not that different. While explaining this is too much to ask, some additional speculation might be warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We postulate that FH loss is different to SDH loss for several reasons:</p><p>A. FH is localized to mitochondria (specifically in the mitochondrial matrix) and the cytosol (cytFH). cytFH can translocate to the nucleus to regulate the DNA damage response (PMID: 26237645). In contrast, the SDH complex is only localized to mitochondria. As such, a loss of FH function is likely to have mitochondrial and extramitochondrial consequences.</p><p>B. SDH is also the only TCA cycle enzyme that's physically associated with the electron transport chain (ETC) and tethered to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it also regulates the ubiquinone pool. The different distribution of both enzymes within mitochondria is likely to influence their impact mitochondrial bioenergetics and on the overall metabolic profile.</p><p>C. A major difference between FH and SDH loss is the accumulation of fumarate. As discussed in the manuscript, fumarate is a mildly electrophilic metabolite that can succinate GSH and protein cysteine residues to form a post-translational modification termed succination. Fumarate-mediated succination is known to impair iron-sulphur cluster metabolism and perturb aconitase and Complex I function (PMID: 29069586). This is just one example of how succination can affect cellular function. In contrast, SDH loss results in a decrease of fumarate and an accumulation of succinate.Unlike fumarate, succinate is not an electrophilic compound that can modify cystine residues, and so differences between FH and SDH loss are likely owed to succination, at least in part.</p><p>D. While it hasn't been investigated in this study, succinate released from cells can bind to the succinate receptor SUCNR1, which is expressed in the kidney (PMID: 21803970). Autocrine and paracrine ligation of SUCNR1 by high levels succinate accumulation and release is likely to alter the metabolic and transcriptional landscape of the cells.</p><p>Based on these observations, we also argue that the effect of acute and chronic enzyme inhibition is expectedly different regarding how the key metabolic and signalling hallmarks of FH and SDH loss develop and interact with each other over time. This hypothesis is part of work currently undergoing in our laboratory. For example, chronic SDH loss led to a significant increase in 20 metabolites however, acute SDH inhibition with TTFA and AA5 led to an increase in 60 and 50 metabolites, respectively. Chronic FH loss also led to a significant increase in 92 metabolites, whereas acute FH inhibition led to a significant increase in 49. The fact that only 2 metabolites overlap between all conditions indicates apparent differences between the loss of both enzymes on the metabolome and whether the loss is acute or chronic in nature. There are also notable differences between chronic FH loss and acute FH inhibition in relation to reductive carboxylation. Chronic FH loss triggers a higher accumulation of fumarate and succination of aconitase that impairs reductive carboxylation (PMID: 21849978); however, acute inhibition facilitates reductive carboxylation (Figure S2), likely due to lower levels of succination given the acute treatment. As such, we feel there are notable differences in the metabolite profiles and rewiring events associated with acute versus chronic enzyme inhibition. We have discussed these important points in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The increase in glutathione and GSSG is interpreted as a consequence of increased oxidative stress, but that will not necessarily affect total levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that oxidative stress will not necessarily affect total glutathione levels and this finding is likely a time-dependent phenomenon due to persistent redox signalling. In this instance, the alterations in total glutathione levels are likely linked to transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in GSH biosynthetic enzymes and the observed metabolic reprogramming. While ATF4 regulates the glutathione redox state and glutathione levels, it's not entirely clear if it is solely responsible for increasing total glutathione levels with TCA cycle inhibition. One possibility is that there is simultaneous activation of the transcription factor NRF2, which is a crucial regulator of glutathione synthesis and is known to be regulated by FH loss and succination (PMID: 22014567) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). ATF4 and NRF2 may cooperate to transactivate glutathione-related metabolic enzymes upon TCA cycle inhibition, as previously reported in other contexts (PMID: 23618921). Further investigation of the crosstalk between these two transcription factors is warranted in this context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The idea of a single figure legend for multiple graphs is often excellent. However, due to the large number of colours and treatment conditions, I found it a bit difficult to interpret some of the figures with this layout.

The heatmaps provided include the 'Top 50' metabolites ranked by ANOVA, and in this instance, succinicGSH was excluded in this visualization due to this cut-off. For consistency, we opted to stick with Top 50 as opposed to changing the number on display, which can become quite unreadable and dense if increased further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Perhaps therefore repeating the BSO experiment shown in Figure 4 with a more acute treatment might be another approach?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the author for their insight regarding mitoCDNB and the potential caveats of this compound, which we also pondered. mitoCDNB does modify reactive thiols in some mitochondrial enzymes, including TrxR2 and peroxiredoxin 3. This compound may react with other thiols on components of the electron transport chain directly. Indeed, although mitoCDNB was reported to have minimal effect on respiration in a different cell type (PMID: 30713096), the decrease in aspartate level suggests that there is respiration impairment upon treatment with mitoCDNB. To provide an overview of the possible effect of this compound, we have now updated Figure S3 to show the ATP/ADP ratio, which is unchanged, and NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> and lactate/pyruvate ratios, which are both increased. The NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio does suggest an impairment with Complex I. Given the importance of glutathione in regulating ROS and iron-sulphur clusters (PMID: 32854270; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04025-w#Sec4), it is likely that its depletion and perturbation of thiol redox homeostasis will also impair complex I function indirectly. As such, it is difficult to dissect whether the effect of mitoCDNB is mediated by impairment of thiol redox homeostasis or direct inhibition of complex I or the ETC. We have mentioned this caveat in the limitations of the study.</p><p>We also thank the reviewer for the suggestion with the BSO treatments and we apologize that the treatment strategy was not clear in the manuscript. Our TCA cycle inhibitors were co-treated with BSO simultaneously for 24 h. We reasoned that intervention represents a more acute inhibition of cytosolic GSH synthesis at the time of TCA cycle inhibition, as opposed to a longer-term depletion of glutathione pools to first deplete both cytosolic and mitochondrial GSH pools. Mitochondrial GSH pools would be completely intact at the time of TCA cycle inhibition given the slower turnover and this was the reason we opted for the co-treatment as opposed to a pre-treatment with BSO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

This observation likely reflects the different size in the aspartate and asparagine pools and the increase in ASNS and cytosolic aspartate synthesis upon TCA cycle inhibition. We speculate that a smaller asparagine pool makes this aminoacid a sensitive sensor of the nutrient state of the cell and of asparate levels. In addition, this finding speak for a reprioritization, as adeptly put by the reviewer, of aspartate for asparagine synthesis, despite a depletion of aspartate under stress conditions. This finding is especially noticeable with acute FHi. We have included a mention of this important point in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
