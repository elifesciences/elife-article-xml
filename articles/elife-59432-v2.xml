nexin-27 (SNX27) is linked to various neuropathologies through sorting of integral proteins to the synaptic surface, most notably AMPA receptors. To provide a broader view of SNX27-associated pathologies, we performed proteomics in rat primary neurons to identify SNX27-dependent cargoes, and identified proteins linked to excitotoxicity, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, and working memory deficits. Focusing on the synaptic adhesion molecule LRFN2, we established that SNX27 binds to LRFN2 and regulates its endosomal sorting. Furthermore, LRFN2 associates with AMPA receptors and knockdown of LRFN2 results in decreased surface AMPA receptor expression, reduced synaptic activity, and attenuated hippocampal long-term potentiation. Overall, our study provides an additional mechanism by which SNX27 can control AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission and plasticity indirectly through the sorting of LRFN2 and offers molecular insight into the perturbed function of SNX27 and LRFN2 in a range of neurological conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SNX27</kwd><kwd>membrane

controlling the functionality of the cell surface through orchestrating the sorting of endocytosed integral proteins between two fates: either degradation within the lysosome or retrieval from degradation for active recycling back to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cullen and Steinberg, 2018</xref>). While the molecular details of sorting to the degradative fate are relatively well described, only recently, with the identification of sorting nexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurten et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stockinger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joubert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strochlic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harterink et al., 2011</xref>), retromer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seaman et al., 1998</xref>), retriever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McNally et al., 2017</xref>), and the WASH, CCC and ESCPE-1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Derivery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gomez and Billadeau, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Phillips-Krawczak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simonetti et al., 2019</xref>), have the core and evolutionarily conserved sorting complexes that orchestrate retrieval and recycling begun to be identified. Importantly, an increasing body of clinical evidence is linking mutations in these sorting complexes with a variety of human pathologies, most notably neurological diseases and disorders, metabolic conditions and pathogen infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cullen and Steinberg, 2018</xref>). With the notable exception of defects in the CCC complex-mediated retrieval and recycling of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the clearance of circulating LDL-cholesterol during hypercholesterolaemia and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartuzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fedoseienko et al., 2018</xref>), how defects in the cell surface proteome, that arise from perturbed endosomal sorting, relate to the aetiology of these complex disorders remains poorly understood. A case in point is sorting nexin-27 (SNX27), in which destabilised expression is associated with Down’s Syndrome and coding mutations are observed in patients with pleomorphic phenotypes that have at their core epilepsy, developmental delay and subcortical white matter abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Damseh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parente et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>SNX27 is unique within the sorting nexin family in that it contains an amino-terminal PSD-95, Disc-large and ZO-1 (PDZ) domain. This serves a bifunctional role mediating two mutually exclusive protein:protein interactions: first, the binding to the heterotrimeric retromer complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gallon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>); and secondly, the binding to a specific type of PDZ domain-binding motif located at the carboxy-terminus of an array of integral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cullen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lauffer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Temkin et al., 2011</xref>). Through these interactions SNX27 regulates the retromer-dependent retrieval of internalised integral proteins that contain the specific PDZ domain-binding motif and promotes their recycling to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lauffer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Temkin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The identification and functional validation of a handful of neuronal integral proteins that rely on SNX27 for their trafficking has provided some insight into the complex aetiology of SNX27-associated pathology. These proteins include α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loo et al., 2014</xref>), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2011</xref>), serotonin (5-HT) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joubert et al., 2004</xref>) and the G protein–activated inward rectifying potassium channels (GIRK/Kir3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lunn et al., 2007</xref>). From studies in SNX27 knockout mice, it is clear that SNX27 is required to maintain AMPA-receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents during the process of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the de-regulation of SNX27 expression associated with Down’s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), is considered to lead to synaptic dysfunction, in part, through reduced SNX27-mediated AMPA receptor trafficking. SNX27 therefore plays a pivotal role in the endosomal sorting of AMPA receptors. The current dogma describing SNX27-mediated AMPA receptor sorting relies upon the direct binding of the PDZ binding motif presented at the carboxy-termini of AMPA receptor subunits to the PDZ domain of SNX27. However, using isothermal titration calorimetry Clairfeuille and colleagues were unable to detect quantifiable binding of SNX27 to the AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2. Moreover, the authors failed to observe binding upon GluA1 phosphorylation, or upon association of SNX27 with the retromer component VPS26, which is known to enhance SNX27 binding to other PDZ binding motif-containing cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clairfeuille et al., 2016</xref>). These data suggest a need to reflect on the molecular details of SNX27-mediated endosomal sorting of AMPA receptors.</p><p>Here, using unbiased proteomics, we define the SNX27 interactome in primary rat cortical neurons and describe the identification of new SNX27-dependent neuronal cargo. Many of these integral proteins provide further molecular insight into the underlying neuronal de-regulation associated with SNX27-associated pathologies. In particular, we functionally validate one specific cargo, the synaptic adhesion molecule leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin type-III domain containing protein 2 (LRFN2). We identify that SNX27 directly associates with the carboxy-terminal PDZ binding motif of LRFN2, while the amino-terminal region of LRFN2 associates with AMPA receptors. Functionally, SNX27 is required for the cell surface recycling of endocytosed LRFN2 and AMPA receptors. By establishing that LRFN2 knockdown also results in decreased surface expression of AMPA receptors and, in ex vivo recordings, the reduction of synaptic activity and attenuation of hippocampal long-term potentiation, we add to the known complexities of SNX27-mediated AMPA receptor endosomal sorting by proposing a role for LRFN2 in bridging the indirect association of SNX27 with AMPA receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A neuronal SNX27 interactome reveals new cargoes for SNX27-mediated trafficking</title><p>To identify neuronal cargoes that depend on SNX27 for their trafficking, we took an unbiased proteomic approach to quantify the SNX27 interactome in primary rat cortical neuronal cultures. Here, we transduced cortical neurons with sindbis virus expressing either GFP or GFP-SNX27 and verified that the GFP-SNX27 retained the ability to localise to endosomes as defined by co-localisation with the early endosomal marker EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After 24 hr, we performed GFP-nanotrap immunoisolation followed by protein digestion and tandem mass tagging (TMT) of the resulting peptides. Interactors were identified quantitatively using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and quantified across three independent biological repeats. A single list of SNX27-interacting proteins (276 proteins) was initially resolved by excluding proteins not present in all three datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We further refined these data by excluding proteins that had an average log-fold change of GFP-SNX27:GFP of less than two and removed identified proteins if they did not meet statistical significance (p&lt;0.05). The resulting 212 proteins were considered to comprise a high confidence cortical neuronal SNX27 interactome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SNX27 interactome reveals new neuronal cargoes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining of endogenous early endosomal marker EEA1 (pseudocoloured in magenta) in DIV21 rat cortical neurons transduced with GFP or GFP-SNX27 expressing sindbis virus. Scale bars, 20 µm.

That said, GluA2 was quantified in one data set but did not fulfil the stringent filtering criteria and hence was not annotated in the final interactome. This could reveal a weak, low abundance association between SNX27 and GluA2, which may reflect an indirect mechanism of association. However, to independently examine the binding of SNX27 to the PDZ-binding motifs of AMPA receptor subunits, we generated a series of amino-terminal GFP-tagged AMPA receptor fusion proteins by cloning the carboxy-terminal tails of rat GluA1, GluA2, GluA3, and GluA4 into a mammalian GFP expression vector. To act as positive controls, we also cloned the carboxy-terminal tails of the high-affinity glutamate transporter SLC1A3 and the sodium bicarbonate co-transporter SLC4A7. These two proteins contain an optimal motif for high-affinity binding to the SNX27 PDZ domain as defined by an acidic residue at the −3 position of their Type I PDZ binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clairfeuille et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The AMPA receptor PDZ binding motifs lack this optimal sequence. Alongside the wild-type tails of SLC1A3 and SLC4A7, we also generated corresponding PDZ binding motif mutants through removal of the last three carboxy-terminal amino acids. The resulting series of plasmids were transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells prior to GFP-nanotrap immunoisolation and quantitative western blotting of the resulting precipitates. While both GFP-SLC1A3 and GFP-SLC4A7 efficiently pulled down endogenous SNX27, in a manner dependent on their PDZ binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), we failed to observe detectable association of endogenous SNX27 with any of the GFP-tagged AMPA receptor subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>To ensure that the lack of detectable binding did not arise from species cross reactivity, an unlikely event given the high-sequence conservation between rat and human SNX27, we also performed a series of co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells expressing the GFP-tagged AMPA receptor carboxy-terminal tails and Flag-tagged full-length rat SNX27. Again, we failed to observe a detectable association of AMPA receptor subunits with rat SNX27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, to examine whether SNX27 could potentially interact with AMPA receptors specifically in the context of neurons we transduced primary rat cortical neuronal cultures with sindbis virus expressing either GFP or GFP-SNX27. Twenty-four hr after transduction we carried out GFP-nanotrap immunoisolation and quantitative western blotting for the endogenous AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2. Again, under these conditions, we failed to detect any association of endogenous GluA1 or GluA2 with rat SNX27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Together these data are consistent with the AMPA receptor PDZ binding motifs lacking the optimal sequence for high-affinity SNX27 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clairfeuille et al., 2016</xref>) and corroborate our proteomic data. Whilst our data do not exclude that SNX27 may directly bind to AMPA receptors under specific circumstances, our data is more consistent with the SNX27-dependent recycling of AMPA receptors being principally controlled by indirect binding. Hence, we assessed the SNX27 interactome further, to identify any interactors that may serve to ‘bridge’ the association of SNX27 with AMPA receptors. Of particular interest in this regard was LRFN2, a protein known to be involved in synaptic clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LRFNs interact with SNX27 through their PDZ-binding motifs</title><p>The LRFN family (also known as synaptic adhesion-like molecules [SALMs]) comprises five single transmembrane spanning proteins, LRFN1 through to LRFN5, that each contain an extracellular region of six leucine-rich repeats (LRR), an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and a fibronectin type III domain, but differ in their cytosolic facing carboxy-terminal tails with LRFN1, LRFN2, and LRFN4 containing a Type I PDZ binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seabold et al., 2008</xref>).

To validate the association of SNX27 with LRFN2, we cloned the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tails of all five LRFNs into mammalian GFP expression vectors. Transient transfection into HEK293T cells followed by GFP-nanotrap immunoisolation of the GFP-LRFN fusion proteins and quantitative western blotting revealed that only those LRFNs containing a PDZ binding motif, LRFN1, LRFN2 and LRFN4, associated with endogenous SNX27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

After 7 days of culturing, the intensity of GluA1 and GluA2 staining were quantified with antibodies that specifically detect extracellular epitopes of these subunits. Consistent with the aforementioned biochemical analysis this revealed a significant reduction in cell surface GluA1 and GluA2 staining upon SNX27 suppression (GluA1: an approximate 16% reduction, n = 50, Mann Whitney test, U (730), p = 0.0003; GluA2: an approximate 34% reduction n = 50, Mann Whitney test, U (632), p &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

After 7 days of culturing with shRNA treatment, surface GluA2 receptor subunits were labelled with an antibody that specifically detected the extracellular epitope of the GluA2 subunit. The GluA2 was allowed to internalise for 1 hr before fixation. The antibody remaining on the surface was labelled with a secondary Alexa Fluor 405 antibody. After permeabilisation, the neurons were co-stained with VPS35 to label the endosome or LAMP1 to label the lysosome and internalised receptors were detected using a distinct secondary Alexa Fluor 647 antibody. The intensity of internalised GluA2 was quantified in the cell body and proximal dendrites and found to be significantly increased after suppression of both SNX27 (an approximate 43% increase, n = 58, Mann Whitney test, U (827), p &lt; 0.0001) and LRFN2 (an approximate 14% increase, n = 58, Mann Whitney test, U (1198), p = 0.0073) with the GluA2 overlapping with both VPS35 and LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B, C</xref>).

Six to eight weeks after surgery, we prepared ex vivo hippocampal slices and performed electrophysiological recordings by stimulating Schaffer collaterals and recording field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the stratum radiatum of GFP-positive regions of CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

AMPA receptors utilise membrane trafficking pathways to dynamically regulate their number, composition, and biophysical properties at the postsynaptic membrane during the modulation of synaptic strength associated with learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henley and Wilkinson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diering and Huganir, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huganir and Nicoll, 2013</xref>). At the mechanistic level, the regulation of AMPA receptors by SNX27 is considered to arise from the PDZ domain of SNX27 directly binding to the PDZ binding motifs present in the carboxy-terminal tails of AMPA receptor subunits. However, using unbiased proteomics and biochemical validation coupled with in cellulo and ex vivo analysis, we have presented evidence consistent with SNX27 regulating the surface expression and activity of AMPA receptors through association with the synaptic adhesion protein LRFN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). LRFN2 belongs to the LRFN family, also known as synaptic adhesion-like molecules (SALMs), and whilst these proteins have been associated with inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2018</xref>) and at the pre-synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brouwer et al., 2019</xref>), their function has principally been linked with excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mah et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Loh et al., 2016</xref>).

This missorting leads to an overall reduction in AMPA receptor expression at the cell surface. Our data proposes that LRFN2 acts as a ‘bridging’ factor in SNX27-mediated AMPA receptor trafficking (2). Here, internalised LRFN2 directly associates with SNX27 through its PDZ binding motif (PDZbm) and is a classical cargo for SNX27-dependent retrieval and recycling to the synaptic cell surface. Upon SNX27 suppression, internalised LRFN2 is missorted to lysosomes where it undergoes degradation, leading to a reduction in LRFN2 levels at the synaptic surface. LRFN2 associates with AMPA receptors and LRFN2 suppression leads to AMPA receptor missorting into the degradative pathway. Taken together, we propose that the association of LRFN2 with AMPA receptors is required for the SNX27-dependent endosomal recycling of GluA1-lacking AMPA receptors. LRFN2 may also display properties of an ‘auxiliary’ protein in aiding the retrieval and recycling of internalised AMPA receptors through the SNX27-positive endosomal compartment and, in addition, may function as an adhesion molecule to anchor and stabilise AMPA receptor expression at the cell surface.

In addition, we have shown that LRFN2 associates with the AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2, interactions that are principally governed by the extracellular LRR and Ig domains of LRFN2. This is consistent with these domains mediating protein:protein interactions, most notably for the trans-synaptic interactions of LRFNs with type-II receptor tyrosine phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). In the hippocampus the major forms of AMPA receptors include GluA1/2 and GluA2/3 heteromers, and GluA1 homomers, with the differential trafficking of GluA1-containing and GluA1-lacking receptors having important implications in transmission and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diering and Huganir, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huganir and Nicoll, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wenthold et al., 1996</xref>). Our data indicates that LRFN2 helps maintain surface expression of GluA1-lacking receptors, but suggests that other pathways that also rely on SNX27 may exist to maintain surface expression of GluA1-containing receptors. Our focus in this study was LRFN2 as it was the only LRFN retained through our high stringency data filtering, and because defects in LRFN2 have been implicated in various neurological conditions, consistent with an important role in brain development, function, and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morimura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rautiainen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thevenon et al., 2016</xref>). However, given that LRFN1 and LFRN4 also associated with SNX27 and contain an optimal PDZ binding motif for binding to the SNX27 PDZ domain, we consider that the endosomal sorting of these proteins will also by mediated by SNX27 and that further studies into LRFN1 and LRFN4 are therefore likely to provide additional insights into SNX27-associated pathologies. Interestingly, LRFN1 has also been shown to interact with AMPA receptors on the synaptic surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morimura et al., 2017</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that redundancies between the LRFN proteins may explain why GluA1-containing receptors are not affected after LRFN2 suppression.</p><p>Using electrophysiology in ex vivo slices, we have shown that suppression of SNX27 leads to a dramatic loss of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic activity, validating our biochemical data showing reduced surface AMPA receptor expression. This supports previous findings showing reduced AMPA receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents in SNX27<sup>+/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, we have also shown that LRFN2 depletion caused a loss of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic activity, consistent with a role for LRFN2 in SNX27-dependent AMPA receptor trafficking. We also observed an attenuated activity-dependent hippocampal LTP upon LRFN2 suppression, which supports the study of Li and colleagues who reported a reduction of LTP in an LRFN2 knockout mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, Morimura and colleagues reported an increase in silent synapses and an enhancement of LTP in another LRFN2 knockout mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morimura et al., 2017</xref>). The distinct methodology used in our study, post-development suppression of LRFN2 compared with developmental knockout of LRFN2, may in part explain these differences.</p><p>It is well established that AMPA receptors can interact with a multitude of transmembrane proteins to stabilise and retain their expression at the postsynaptic density, including scaffolding proteins, synaptic adhesion molecules, and auxiliary subunits, such as the transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) and cornichon-like proteins CNIH2/CNIH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwenk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coombs and Cull-Candy, 2009</xref>).

The PDZ binding motif present in LRFN1, LRFN2 and LRFN4 can associate with many other PDZ domain-containing proteins including the synaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that LRFNs could also have a role in the anchoring and stability of AMPA receptors at the synaptic surface. It is possible that LRFNs interact with the AMPA receptor subunits through their extracellular LRR and Ig domains and PSD-95 through their PDZ binding motifs to stabilise AMPA receptors at the synaptic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This would be an interesting avenue to explore further.</p><p>Interestingly, NMDA receptors, which are also required for excitatory transmission and synaptic plasticity, interact with both SNX27 and LRFN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thevenon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clairfeuille et al., 2016</xref>).

LRFN2 had the highest level of reduction compared to other synaptic proteins in all three forms of dementia, and its loss was strongly associated with rate of cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bereczki et al., 2018</xref>). Our data demonstrating that LRFN2 can control AMPA receptor activity therefore provides additional insight into the role of LRFN2 in these conditions.</p><p>In summary, we have identified LRFN2 as a high-affinity neuronal interactor of SNX27 that is required for AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. Suppression of SNX27 leads to a reduction in LRFN2 expression which results in a loss of surface expression of GluA2 and, correspondingly, a loss of synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The link between SNX27, LRFN2, and AMPA receptors provides a new point of control for AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission and plasticity and provides additional insight into the association of LRFN2 and SNX27 with many neurological and psychiatric conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The intracellular C-terminal tails of GluA1 (amino acids 827–907), GluA2 (amino acids 834–883), GluA3 (amino acids 839–888), and GluA4 (amino acids 835–902) were cloned from rat whole brain cDNA into the vector pEGFP-C3.

Evidence is provided arguing against direct SNX27/AMPA-receptor interactions. Rather, the authors discover that the integral membrane LFRN2 protein mediates indirect association of SNX27 with AMPA-receptor subunits via a cytoplasmic, C-terminal, PDZ-ligand and a lumenal domain that contains LRR, Ig and fibronectin type III domains. The PDZ interaction (SNX27/LFRN2) is shown to be direct while the exoplasmic interaction (LFRN2/GluA2) is demonstrated by co-transfection/co-IP/blot. The physiological significance of LFRN2 on AMPA-receptor function is confirmed by knockdown in both isolated cells and in animals. Overall, these are convincing experiments revealing a novel and important interaction contributing to the control of AMPA-receptor levels and function. I have only minor issues that I believe the authors could better explain.</p><p>1. Although the immuno-isolation techniques employed here might favor binary complexes, it would be expected that indirect interactions would persist to some degree. Why then is there no evidence for the ternary complex SNX27/LFRN2/GluA2 in the data?</p><p>2. The failure of LFRN2 knockdown to affect GluA1 surface levels should be explained. Especially in light of the evidence that LFRN2 binds both GluA1 and GluA2 and that, if my understanding is correct, GluA1-containing surface receptors also contain GluA2.</p><p>3. Can the stoichiometry between LFRN2 and AMPA-receptor be estimated?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 :</italic></p><p>This study uses proteomics to identify interactors of GFP-SNX27 in neurons using immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP nanobodies. The authors identify 212 proteins as a high-confidence SNX27 interactome. The authors follow up on LRFN2, a PDZ binding motif-containing protein, and test its role in maintaining GluA1 and GluA2 expression in neurons and AMPA receptor activity in the hippocampus. The study provides a useful dataset of proteins that immunoprecipitate with SNX27, provides support that LRFN2 interacts with SNX27, and shows that SNX27 and LRFN2 affect AMPA receptor expression and activity.</p><p>1. The main concern I have is about the specific model proposed – that SNX27 is required for LRFN2 recycling (and not for AMPA recycling?) and that LRFN2 on the surface is required for AMPAR stability on the surface. But neither aspect of the model is tested in this manuscript. To present this model, the authors need to test LRFN2 and AMPAR recycling directly using one of many established assays, and also test AMPAR destabilization on the surface, by either directly measuring mobility or following surface AMPAR expression over time after LRFN2 depletion.</p><p>AMPA receptor destabilization on the surface and recycling has been heavily studied, and the mechanisms could be more complex and redundant than the authors describe. For example LRFN1 depletion also reduces AMPA and NMDA receptors on the surface (Morimura et al). LRFN2 and AMPA receptor subunits can bind multiple PDZ proteins including PSD-95, PSD-93, and SAP97. NMDA receptors bind both SNX27 and LRFN2, and they both might act together in its surface expression. The authors need to discuss a model that integrates existing data and this complexity better.</p><p>2. LRFN2 PDZ domain is required for ER export and localization (Seabold et al., 2012). This makes Figure 3 difficult to interpret the way authors do. The loss of total and surface LRFN2 could be due to block in ER export and degradation. This mislocalization could also lead to loss of IP of the PDZ mutants.</p><p>3. Figure 4D shows that LRFN2 IP is better with GluA1 than GluA2. But Figure 4F shows better GluA2 IP. Is this a function of the myc vs. SEP tag? Also, the reduction in interaction is not obvious with GluA1 in Figure 4F. Repeating these, quantitating the levels and doing statistics, or using another quantitative assay to measure interaction, is necessary to make this conclusion.</p><p>4. The antibody staining in Figure 4 is not well described. When staining for surface expression of GluA1, GluA2 and LRFN2, were all antibodies added before fixation? Are the LRFN antibodies in the same fluorescence spectrum as mCherry, in which case we will not be able to differentiate surface from total? Is there a control surface protein or membrane staining that the authors can use?</p><p>5. It is difficult to definitively prove that two proteins do not interact. Many interactions that are accepted now cannot be easily detected using IP. Based on sequence analysis in Clairfeuille et al., GluA1 is expected to weakly bind SNX27. Considering that this is a key conclusion of the study, can the authors measure affinity of the PDZbm of GluA1 and GluA2 to SNX27 by ITC?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>McMillan et al., challenge the current view that SNX27 directly interacts with AMPA receptors. They convincingly show that LRFN2 acts as an adaptor linking AMPA receptors to SNX27. They went on to confirm other previously published data on the function of SNX27 and LRFN2 in a range of neurological conditions.</p><p>Most of the experiments and data presented are convincing.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor.

Your study has convincing experiments revealing a novel and important interaction contributing to the control of AMPA-receptor surface levels and function. Listed verbatim below are a handful of residual issues raised by the review that can be addressed by modifications of the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript includes data to address some of the concerns raised in the previous submission. The manuscript includes data that suppressing SNX27 increases LRFN2 colocalization with LAMP2, suggesting that SNX27 protects against lysosomal degradation of LRFN2, and that SNX27 and LRFN2 suppression causes increased localization of GluA2 in intracellular compartments. The manuscript also includes transferrin receptor as a control surface protein for SNX27 suppression. The concern about ER export block was partly addressed by showing that the localization of a PDZ mutant looks the same as that of the wild type. The authors have also added new discussion on AMPA receptor trafficking literature and expanded the model.</p><p>Overall, the proteomic, biochemical, and physiological data are convincing and interesting. The manuscript shows that SNX27 binds LRFN2, that SNX27 regulates LRFN2 trafficking, that SNX27 and LRFN2 regulate AMPA receptor surface levels, and that. The trafficking data support the model that SNX27 binds LRFN2 and regulates LRFN2 surface levels, and that these proteins play a role in regulating AMPA receptor surface levels. Although the exact model they propose for AMPA receptor trafficking still needs to be supported better, the manuscript is valuable in that it implicates LRFN2 as a factor that regulates AMPA receptor surface levels and thereby modulates neuronal function.</p><p>My comments are for clarity and can be addressed by revising the text. Mainly, I urge the authors to be specific in stating what the experiments test and in the conclusions drawn from the experiments, particularly for the trafficking experiments.</p><p>For example Figure 6 is titled &quot;Suppression of SNX27 or LRFN2 increases the retention time of AMPA receptors in the endo-lysosomal system&quot;. As far as I can make out, the authors do not quantitate retention time but show only that there is more AMPA receptors inside the cell after 1 hour of internalization.</p><p>Figure 3 tests internalization and degradation (loss of surface levels and the new data that there is more colocalization of LRFN with LAMP2 after SNX27 suppression) but the conclusion is focused on recycling.</p><p>Figure 4 is titled &quot;LRFNs interact with AMPA receptors and regulate their membrane trafficking&quot;, but membrane trafficking is not tested at all.</p><p>Figure 5 titled 'SNX27 and LRFN2 suppression affects AMPA receptor expression&quot;, do they mean surface levels or protein expression?</p><p>In Figure 6, how was the internal pool specifically quantitated (as opposed to measuring total fluorescence)? Were the neurons treated, e.g., acid washed, to remove cell surface antibodies? There is very little staining on the surface.</p><p>Does Figure 7F show the same data that are represented in B and D? If so, it is difficult to interpret because the control curves in B and D look different.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59432.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

Although the immuno-isolation techniques employed here might favor binary complexes, it would be expected that indirect interactions would persist to some degree. Why then is there no evidence for the ternary complex SNX27/LFRN2/GluA2 in the data?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The isolation of a ternary complex is dependent on the affinity of individual interactions and the amount of the steady-state complex. We suspect therefore that the lack of a quantified SNX27/LRFN2/GluA2 complex results from the low μM affinity of individual interactions and the relatively low steady-state levels of the ternary complex. When combined, these parameters work against the isolation of sufficient ternary complex for detection by western analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The failure of LFRN2 knockdown to affect GluA1 surface levels should be explained. Especially in light of the evidence that LFRN2 binds both GluA1 and GluA2 and that, if my understanding is correct, GluA1-containing surface receptors also contain GluA2.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. While the reviewer is correct that GluA1/GluA2-containing AMPA receptors represent a major population, GluA1-lacking receptors (GluA2/GluA3-containing AMPA receptors) constitute the other major heteromeric combination<sup>1</sup>. Indeed, differential trafficking of GluA1-containing and GluA1-lacking receptors is observed during models of synaptic plasticity – for example, the synaptic expression of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors is enhanced during LTP, while LTD is best characterised by the removal of GluA2-containing receptors <sup>2,3</sup>. Thus, different effects on GluA1 versus GluA2 are not unexpected from the literature.</p><p>Since LRFN2 interacts with both GluA1- and GluA2-containing AMPA receptors it may, at first glance, seem surprising that LRFN2 loss primarily affects GluA2. However, AMPA receptor trafficking is an extraordinarily plastic process, and it remains possible that pathways exist that can act to maintain surface expression of GluA1-containing receptors (<italic>e.g.</italic> GluA1/GluA2 receptors) upon loss of LRFN2. However, our data suggest that for GluA1-lacking receptors this is not the case, and thus we conclude that LRFN2 plays an essential role in maintaining surface expression of this population of receptors. Consequently, we observe a reduction in GluA2 surface expression upon LRFN2 knockdown, but no effect on GluA1. Furthermore, there is the possibility that there are some redundancies between the LRFN family. We have shown that LRFN1 and LRFN4 can also interact with GluA1 and GluA2 subunits so it could be possible that other LRFN proteins maintain surface expression of GluA1-containing receptors upon loss of LRFN2. We have edited the discussion (lines: 679-687, 715-736) and the model in Figure 8 to clarify these points in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Can the stoichiometry between LFRN2 and AMPA-receptor be estimated?</p></disp-quote><p>This is another interesting question, and investigation of the subunit stoichiometry of AMPA receptors with their transmembrane regulators is an active field of research. However, while this represents an interesting question for future studies, the primary focus of our study is to establish the link between LRFN2 and SNX27-dependent AMPA receptor trafficking. As a result, we feel detailed investigation on the LRFN2-AMPA receptor stoichiometry is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 :</p><p>This study uses proteomics to identify interactors of GFP-SNX27 in neurons using immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP nanobodies.

The authors follow up on LRFN2, a PDZ binding motif-containing protein, and test its role in maintaining GluA1 and GluA2 expression in neurons and AMPA receptor activity in the hippocampus. The study provides a useful dataset of proteins that immunoprecipitate with SNX27, provides support that LRFN2 interacts with SNX27, and shows that SNX27 and LRFN2 affect AMPA receptor expression and activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this summary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The main concern I have is about the specific model proposed – that SNX27 is required for LRFN2 recycling (and not for AMPA recycling?) and that LRFN2 on the surface is required for AMPAR stability on the surface. But neither aspect of the model is tested in this manuscript. To present this model, the authors need to test LRFN2 and AMPAR recycling directly using one of many established assays, and also test AMPAR destabilization on the surface, by either directly measuring mobility or following surface AMPAR expression over time after LRFN2 depletion.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise that our model was not clearly stated. Our data do not contradict that AMPA receptor recycling requires SNX27, indeed we have shown that surface levels of AMPA receptors are decreased after SNX27 suppression (Figure 3D and Figure 5A). Rather we argue that recycling is not principally controlled by direct SNX27 binding to AMPA receptors (the present dogma). Of course, we cannot conclude that under certain circumstances SNX27 may directly bind to AMPA receptors. We do propose however, that SNX27 can control AMPA receptor expression and activity through its regulation of the ‘bridging’ adaptor LRFN2. We have revised the manuscript and edited the model in an attempt to make this clearer (lines: 40-44, 128-137, 218-233, 255-262, 695-707, 796-799).</p><p>To provide additional support of the proposed model, we have carried out new experiments to further investigate the trafficking of LRFN2 and AMPA receptors. Unfortunately, we did not have a reliable antibody for detecting endogenous LRFN2 by immunofluorescence. Therefore, to investigate LRFN2 recycling we transfected the neuroglioma H4 cells with a construct encoding for N-terminally mCherry tagged full length LRFN2. Using an anti-mCherry antibody to label the exofacial mCherry epitope, cell surface uptake assay have revealed that in SNX27 suppressed cells, the recycling of LRFN2 is perturbed as shown by an increased colocalization of LRFN2 with the lysosomal marker LAMP2 (see Figure 3G; lines: 405-415). In combination with biochemical data from primary neurons where we have analysing total and surface expression of LRFN2 after SNX27 suppression, these data demonstrate that SNX27 is required for LRFN2 trafficking to the cell surface and for preventing LRFN2 missorting into the degradative lysosomal compartment.</p><p>To test which step of AMPA receptor trafficking SNX27 and LRFN2 suppression affects we labelled surface GLUA2 receptors and then looked at their internalisation in rat hippocampal neurons. In both SNX27 and LRFN2 suppressed neurons we found an increase in the intensity of internalised GLUA2 in the endo-lysosomal system (co-labelled with EEA1 and LAMP1). This suggests that the recycling of GLUA2 is perturbed thereby increasing its retention time in the endosomal system. We have updated the manuscript and our model to integrate these new data (Figures 6 and 8; lines: 515-531).</p><p>Our reference to LRFN2 regulating the stability of cell surface AMPA receptors comes from the existing literature where LRFNs are considered to cluster receptors at the synaptic surface. We agree with the reviewer that this has not been tested in our model and so we have revised the manuscript and the model to make this clearer (Figure 8; lines: 762-771).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>AMPA receptor destabilization on the surface and recycling has been heavily studied, and the mechanisms could be more complex and redundant than the authors describe. For example LRFN1 depletion also reduces AMPA and NMDA receptors on the surface (Morimura et al). LRFN2 and AMPA receptor subunits can bind multiple PDZ proteins including PSD-95, PSD-93, and SAP97. NMDA receptors bind both SNX27 and LRFN2, and they both might act together in its surface expression. The authors need to discuss a model that integrates existing data and this complexity better.</p></disp-quote><p>Our study shows that LRFN2 can associate with AMPA receptors and mediate their SNX27-dependent trafficing but we completely agree with the reviewer that the molecular mechanisms of AMPA and NMDA receptor trafficking, both at the cell surface and within the endosomal network, are highly complex and tightly regulated. To clarify this point we have added further discussion to the revised manuscript (lines: 753-778) and have edited the model in Figure 8 to further integrate these complexities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. LRFN2 PDZ domain is required for ER export and localization (Seabold et al., 2012). This makes Figure 3 difficult to interpret the way authors do. The loss of total and surface LRFN2 could be due to block in ER export and degradation. This mislocalization could also lead to loss of IP of the PDZ mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>In the experiments shown in Figure 3 we have suppressed SNX27 and measured the total and surface levels of endogenous LRFN2. Therefore, the PDZ binding motif present in the LRFN2 tail is intact. These experiments do not target LRFN2 directly nor are any PDZ binding motif mutants used, hence there should be no block in ER export of the endogenous protein. The cell-based IPs with wild type LRFN’s and corresponding PDZ mutants are all derived from expression constructs encoding for just the cytoplasmic tail domains, they do not contain the transmembrane domain. These constructs are all therefore expressed in the cytoplasm and hence ‘mis-localisation’ in the context of being trapped in the ER is not an issue.</p><p>To address these concerns further however we transduced rat hippocampal neurons with sindbis viruses expressing LRFN2 (with and without the PDZbm) and stained with the ER marker Calnexin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We could see no evidence of increased colocalization of the LRFN2ΔPDZbm construct in the ER compared to the LRFN2 construct.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59432-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 4D shows that LRFN2 IP is better with GluA1 than GluA2. But Figure 4F shows better GluA2 IP. Is this a function of the myc vs. SEP tag? Also, the reduction in interaction is not obvious with GluA1 in Figure 4F. Repeating these, quantitating the levels and doing statistics, or using another quantitative assay to measure interaction, is necessary to make this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. We have added the quantification and statistical analysis for Figure 4F showing the reduction in interaction of the LRFN2 mutants with GLUA1 and GLUA2 (Figure 4F; lines 448-460). We did find that the myc-GluA2 expressed better in HEK293T cells than the GFP-GluA2; which can be seen by the low GFP expression of the GluA2 construct in Figure 4D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The antibody staining in Figure 4 is not well described. When staining for surface expression of GluA1, GluA2 and LRFN2, were all antibodies added before fixation? Are the LRFN antibodies in the same fluorescence spectrum as mCherry, in which case we will not be able to differentiate surface from total? Is there a control surface protein or membrane staining that the authors can use?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise that we did not make this clearer. We have added text to both the figure legend and the methods (lines: 430-436, 469-478, 1028-1036). The antibodies to GluA1 or GluA2, and to mCherry, were added prior to fixation to only allow staining of surface expressed proteins. The surface mCherry staining, representing surface expressed LRFN2, was then detected using a far-red labelled secondary antibody, allowing distinction between far-red (surface LRFN2) and red (total LRFN2) signals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It is difficult to definitively prove that two proteins do not interact. Many interactions that are accepted now cannot be easily detected using IP. Based on sequence analysis in Clairfeuille et al., GluA1 is expected to weakly bind SNX27. Considering that this is a key conclusion of the study, can the authors measure affinity of the PDZbm of GluA1 and GluA2 to SNX27 by ITC?</p></disp-quote><p>In Supplementary Figure 3 of Clairfeuille et al., ITC quantification established that the PDZ domain of SNX27 does not show significant binding to GluA1 or GluA2 <sup>4</sup>. Moreover, in the same Figure the authors establish that binding is not enhanced by phosphorylation of serine or tyrosine residues found in GluA1 or by association with VPS26. We have now included specific reference to these data in the revised manuscript (lines: 114-121). However, we agree that it is difficult to definitively prove a negative and have revised the manuscript to address this point (lines: 257-260).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>McMillan et al., challenge the current view that SNX27 directly interacts with AMPA receptors. They convincingly show that LRFN2 acts as an adaptor linking AMPA receptors to SNX27. They went on to confirm other previously published data on the function of SNX27 and LRFN2 in a range of neurological conditions. Most of the experiments and data presented are convincing. Most of the interaction data shown in western blots is not quantified. However, the quantification should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this positive summary and have included quantification for the immunoprecipitation experiments where there is a reduction in binding in the revised manuscript (Figures 1F, 2B, 2C, 4F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The role of SNX27 in AMPA receptor trafficking and neurological consequences has been addressed in:</p><p>Wang et al., Nat.

Rather we argue that besides direct SNX27 binding to AMPA receptors (the present dogma), LRFN2 acts as a ‘bridging’ adaptor in SNX27-dependent endosomal recycling of internalized AMPA receptors. We believe that this constitutes an important discovery in our current understanding of SNX27-mediated AMPA receptor trafficking. In suggesting a revised consideration of SNX27-mediated AMPA receptor recycling through identifying LRFN2 as a component of this pathway, we strongly believe our study represents an important advance in our understanding. We have edited the manuscript to clarify these points further (lines: 40-44, 128-137, 218-233, 255-262, 695-707, 796-799).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The role of LRFN2 in AMPA receptor trafficking and neurological consequences has been addressed in: Morimura et al., Nat. Comm. 2017</p></disp-quote><p>Respectfully we disagree that the role of LRFN2 in AMPA receptor trafficking has been addressed. We demonstrate that LRFN2 contributes to AMPA receptor trafficking through coupling receptors to SNX27 – this has certainly not been described previously. While two studies have examined hippocampal LTP in LRFN2 knockout mice (Li et al., 2018 and, as the reviewer notes, Morimura et al., 2017, both of which are referenced in our manuscript lines: 737-752), the findings have been contradictory, with Li et al. observing reduced LTP in LRFN2 knockout mice, and Morimura et al., reporting enhanced LTP upon loss of LRFN2. Given this contradictory data, and lack of mechanistic insight into the link between LRFN2 and AMPA receptors, we believe our data is a significant addition to the field. Moreover, our molecular level investigation of the role of LRFN2, combined with ex vivo electrophysiology, not only adds insight into the role of LRFN2, but clarifies the contradictory evidence relating to the role of LRFN2 in plasticity by examining post-development suppression of LRFN2 and its consequences on AMPA receptor activity (compared to KO studies in which LRFN2 has been removed throughout development). We have edited the Discussion section of our manuscript to clarify the significance of our study further (lines: 782-799).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This not a complete literature survey as LRFN proteins also go by the name of SALM.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise if this was not clear in our manuscript and have clarified this point in our revised manuscript (lines: 266, 699-700). In the references we have included many of the original SALM papers (Wang et al., 2006; Ko et al., 2006; Seabold et al., 2008; Mah et al., 2010; Nam et al., 2011; Lie et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018; Brouwer et al., 2019). The official gene/protein name for the LRFN family is LRFN1, LRFN2 etc which is why we chose to use this nomenclature throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should explain better what we learn from their study besides that SNX27 does not bind directly AMPA receptors but does it through an adaptor, LRFN2.</p></disp-quote><p>There is an increasing interest in the role of the endosomal system in neurodegenerative disease with endosomal swelling classed as an early feature of disease. This enlargement of endosomes indicates a trafficking defect, but the molecular mechanisms of how endosomal dysfunction leads to neurodegeneration is unclear. An increasing body of work is focusing on the role of the SNX27 which has been associated with several neuropathologies including Down’s syndrome. Many of these studies focus on the role of SNX27 in regulating AMPA receptor trafficking, leading to a dogma that places SNX27’s ability to directly bind these receptors at its mechanistic heart. In this study we define an interaction between SNX27 and a synaptic adhesion molecule LRFN2 which contributes to the control of glutamatergic transmission and activity which we believe represents an important advance in the field. LRFN2 is increasingly being linked to neurodegenerative diseases with our study providing new molecular insight into the role LRFN2 could play in these diseases through its regulation of AMPA receptor expression.</p><p>Besides the identification of the SNX27:LRFN2:AMPA receptor pathway, our unbiased proteomic analysis in primary neurons has also identified an array of new SNX27 cargo proteins (see Figure 1), many of which provide new insight into SNX27’s potential role in regulating neuronal activity. Their identification is likely to drive additional research into the underlying causes of SNX27-associated pathologies associated with neurodegeneration, epilepsy, spastic paraplegia and intellectual disability. We have edited the Discussion section of the manuscript to address these points and to highlight further the significance of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The pathophysiological consequences of loss of function of SNX27 and LRFN2 have already been described.</p></disp-quote><p>While this is true, these neuronal pathologies have not previously been considered as functionally linked. In describing a mechanistic link (at least in the context of AMPA receptor trafficking) we provide clear evidence that these pathologies are coupled. Furthermore, the association between LRFN2 and AMPA receptors has not previously been recognised as a potential mechanism for LRFN2’s role in cognitive decline. Thus, in addition to adding molecular insight into the role of SNX27 and LRFN2 in AMPA receptor trafficking, our manuscript provides an important link between SNX27 and LRFN2-dependent cognitive decline, providing new understanding of how the co-operative action of these proteins maintains cognitive function.

Your study has convincing experiments revealing a novel and important interaction contributing to the control of AMPA-receptor surface levels and function. Listed verbatim below are a handful of residual issues raised by the review that can be addressed by modifications of the text. Please resubmit a revision and cover letter explaining the changes before a final decision.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The revised manuscript includes data to address some of the concerns raised in the previous submission. The manuscript includes data that suppressing SNX27 increases LRFN2 colocalization with LAMP2, suggesting that SNX27 protects against lysosomal degradation of LRFN2, and that SNX27 and LRFN2 suppression causes increased localization of GluA2 in intracellular compartments. The manuscript also includes transferrin receptor as a control surface protein for SNX27 suppression. The concern about ER export block was partly addressed by showing that the localization of a PDZ mutant looks the same as that of the wild type. The authors have also added new discussion on AMPA receptor trafficking literature and expanded the model.</p><p>Overall, the proteomic, biochemical, and physiological data are convincing and interesting. The manuscript shows that SNX27 binds LRFN2, that SNX27 regulates LRFN2 trafficking, that SNX27 and LRFN2 regulate AMPA receptor surface levels, and that. The trafficking data support the model that SNX27 binds LRFN2 and regulates LRFN2 surface levels, and that these proteins play a role in regulating AMPA receptor surface levels. Although the exact model they propose for AMPA receptor trafficking still needs to be supported better, the manuscript is valuable in that it implicates LRFN2 as a factor that regulates AMPA receptor surface levels and thereby modulates neuronal function.</p><p>My comments are for clarity and can be addressed by revising the text. Mainly, I urge the authors to be specific in stating what the experiments test and in the conclusions drawn from the experiments, particularly for the trafficking experiments.</p><p>For example Figure 6 is titled &quot;Suppression of SNX27 or LRFN2 increases the retention time of AMPA receptors in the endo-lysosomal system&quot;. As far as I can make out, the authors do not quantitate retention time but show only that there is more AMPA receptors inside the cell after 1 hour of internalization.</p><p>Figure 3 tests internalization and degradation (loss of surface levels and the new data that there is more colocalization of LRFN with LAMP2 after SNX27 suppression) but the conclusion is focused on recycling.</p><p>Figure 4 is titled &quot;LRFNs interact with AMPA receptors and regulate their membrane trafficking&quot;, but membrane trafficking is not tested at all.</p><p>Figure 5 titled 'SNX27 and LRFN2 suppression affects AMPA receptor expression&quot;, do they mean surface levels or protein expression?</p><p>In Figure 6, how was the internal pool specifically quantitated (as opposed to measuring total fluorescence)? Were the neurons treated, e.g., acid washed, to remove cell surface antibodies? There is very little staining on the surface.</p><p>Does Figure 7F show the same data that are represented in B and D? If so, it is difficult to interpret because the control curves in B and D look different.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to Reviewer 2’s comments we have revised the text to improve the clarity of our results including the titles and conclusions for Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 (lines: 418-421; 467; 539; 556-566) and thank the reviewer for these suggestions. For Figure 6 we apologise for the confusion in our methodology and have updated the text in the figure legend and results and methods sections (lines: 519-524; 556-566; 1070-1074; 1086-1088). In brief, after antibody feeding with a N-terminally tagged GluA2 antibody, the antibody remaining on the surface was labelled with a secondary Alexa Fluor 405 antibody to block secondary binding sites for receptors that remained on the surface. Internalised receptors were then detected by permbealisation followed by staining with a distinct secondary Alexa Fluor 647 antibody. As the reviewer mentioned there is very little staining on the surface indicating that we are specifically detecting internalised GluA2 for quantification. In addition, for further clarity, we have added the surface staining in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 (562-564; 1461-1472).</p><p>For Figure 7F, the same data are represented in B and D. We have analysed the input-output for the SNX27 and LRFN2 control shRNAs and found that they were not significantly different, validating the comparison of the two shRNA groups. We have now amended the text to report the data and also state that we are cautious to over-interpret this result (lines: 596-601).</p></body></sub-article></article>
