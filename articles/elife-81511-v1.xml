Does each cerebellar region receive input from a single cortical area or convergent inputs from multiple cortical areas? Here, we use task-based fMRI data to build a range of cortico-cerebellar connectivity models, each allowing for a different degree of convergence. We compared these models by their ability to predict cerebellar activity patterns for novel Task Sets. Models that allow some degree of convergence provided the best predictions, arguing for convergence of multiple cortical inputs onto single cerebellar voxels. Importantly, the degree of convergence varied across the cerebellum with the highest convergence observed in areas linked to language, working memory, and social cognition. These findings suggest important differences in the way that functional subdivisions of the cerebellum support motor and cognitive function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>task-based fMRI</kwd><kwd>connectivity</kwd><kwd>predictive modeling</kwd><kwd>multi-domain task battery</kwd><kwd>cortical parcellations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT 159520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diedrichsen</surname><given-names>Jörn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS092079</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivry</surname><given-names>Richard B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS105839</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivry</surname><given-names>Richard B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Models of cortico-cerebellar connectivity are quantified using task-based fMRI, and demonstrate that convergent rather than sparse inputs best characterize cortico-cerebellar connectivity, namely, cerebellar areas linked to cognition receive the highest convergence of cortical inputs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The last 30 years has witnessed a paradigm shift with regard to cerebellar function, with broad recognition that this subcortical structure is engaged in many aspects of human cognition. Since the first report of cerebellar activation in a semantic retrieval task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petersen et al., 1989</xref>), thousands of neuroimaging papers have reported cerebellar recruitment during a broad range of tasks that cannot be attributed to the motor demands of these tasks. Functional interpretations include hypotheses concerning how the cerebellum may facilitate attentional shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 1997</xref>), stimulus-response mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bischoff-Grethe et al., 2002</xref>), higher order rule processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balsters et al., 2013</xref>), verbal working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marvel and Desmond, 2010</xref>), language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiez, 2016</xref>), and social cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Overwalle et al., 2015</xref>). This body of work has produced functional maps of the cerebellum that depict the association of particular cognitive processes with different subregions of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">King et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Given the relative uniform cytoarchitecture of the cerebellar cortex, it is assumed that differences in function mainly arise from variation in the input to the cerebellum. Trans-synaptic tracing methods employed in non-human primates studies have revealed extensive reciprocal connections between many frontal and parietal areas and the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dum and Strick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelly and Strick, 2003</xref>). These studies have highlighted the closed-loop nature of these connections, with each (neo-)cortical region projecting to a specific cerebellar region, and receiving input from the same area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strick et al., 2009</xref>). In humans, resting state functional connectivity analyses have revealed a set of cerebellar networks, each one associated with a specific cortical network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marek et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>An important unanswered question is whether each cerebellar region receives input from a restricted cortical region or whether it receives convergent input from multiple cortical regions. Providing an answer to this question has important implications for our understanding of cerebellar function. An architecture marked by a one-to-one relationship between cortical and cerebellar regions would suggest that the function of each cerebellar region is to fine-tune the dynamics in its cortical input. In contrast, a convergent architecture would suggest that subregions within the cerebellum integrate information across disparate cortical regions and may coordinate their interactions. Indeed, recent work in the rodent brain has suggested convergence of mossy fibers from diverse sources onto the same cerebellar region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henschke and Pakan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pisano et al., 2021</xref>), or even onto the same granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the pattern of cortico-cerebellar convergence may vary across the cerebellar cortex, similar to how cortical areas show considerable variation in the degree to which they serve as points of convergence from other cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertolero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yeo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yeo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we introduce a novel approach to study cortico-cerebellar connectivity. Using the data from a large battery of tasks, we derived models that could be used to predict the activity in each cerebellar voxel based on the activity pattern in the neocortex. While this approach allowed us to evaluate the degree of convergence of cortical inputs to the cerebellar cortex, we recognize that the model could also be evaluated in the opposite direction, namely, to predict activity in the neocortex based on cerebellar activity patterns. However, we believe that using the model to make directional predictions from neocortex to cerebellum is most appropriate for fMRI data. The BOLD signal in the cerebellar cortex overwhelmingly reflects cortical input (via the pons) with no measurable contribution from the Purkinje cells, the output neurons of the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mathiesen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alahmadi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alahmadi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mapelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gagliano et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, the neocortical BOLD signal reflects many sources including inputs from other cortical regions, local activity (input and output), as well as ascending input. While the latter will include cerebellar input via the thalamus, this source is likely to make a relatively small contribution to the overall BOLD response in the neocortex. As such, the relationship between neocortical and cerebellar BOLD signals will be most informative in evaluating cortico-cerebellar connectivity.</p><p>We trained multiple models of neocortical-cerebellar connectivity on a fMRI data set obtained while human participants completed a large task battery that was designed to engage cognitive processes across a broad range of functional domains (e.g. visual cognition, memory, attention, cognitive control). The models varied in terms of the degree of convergence of cortical inputs onto each cerebellar area. To evaluate the models in a cross-validated fashion, we examined how well each model predicted cerebellar data obtained from different tasks and/or different participants, using only the corresponding neocortical data. These analyses reveal a novel picture of cortico-cerebellar connectivity, one in which the degree of convergence was higher in cerebellar regions associated with more complex cognitive functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overview</title><p>We compared three models of cortico-cerebellar connectivity by using a region-to-region predictive modeling approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mell et al., 2021</xref>). For each model, the task-evoked activity in each cerebellar voxel was predicted as a linear combination of task-evoked activity patterns across the entire neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As a model of sparse connectivity, we used a Winner-Take-All (WTA) model which imposes the strong constraint that only a single cortical region is used to predict the activity in each cerebellar voxel. The other two models allowed for some degree of convergence. Models estimated with Lasso Regression (L1 regularization) find sparse solutions, minimizing the number of cortical inputs by setting to zero those weights that make a negligible contribution to the predicted activity. Models estimated with Ridge Regression (L2 regularization) allow for a wide distribution of inputs, keeping each weight as small as possible. For model input, we used a set of cortical parcellations that varied in terms of their level of granularity. We trained the models on cortical and cerebellar fMRI data obtained from 24 participants who performed a task battery with 29 task conditions (Task Set A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These were acquired over two sessions on separate days, with the tasks identical across sessions. These data were used to estimate the connectivity weights <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%7D#0">W^</ext-link>separately for each model and participant (see Methods).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Connectivity model training and evaluation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Models were trained on Task Set A (session 1 and 2) of the multi-domain task battery (MDTB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">King et al., 2019</xref>). Model hyperparameters were tuned using fourfold cross validation. Three types of models were used (WTA, Lasso, Ridge), each with 7 cortical parcellations of different granularity. (<bold>B</bold>) Models were tested on an independent Task Set B (sessions 3 and 4), which included both novel and common tasks. Models had to predict the cerebellar activity solely from cortical activity patterns. To avoid the influence of shared noise correlations across cortex and cerebellum, the models were trained and tested by using cortical and cerebellar activity patterns from different sessions within each task set (see Methods). (<bold>C</bold>) As a test of generalization, the models were used to predict cerebellar activity from cortical data obtained from a separate experiment (King et al., unpublished data).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81511-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To compare the models, we tested their prediction performance on two independent datasets. First, we used data from the same 24 participants when tested in two different sessions (Task Set B) that included 18 novel conditions and 14 conditions repeated from Task Set A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To predict the cerebellar activity patterns, we used the observed cortical activity patterns from Task Set B and the estimated connectivity weights (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%7D#0">W^</ext-link>) from Task Set A for each participant. Note that because the model predictions relied on a single set of connectivity weights across all tasks, the input is based only on the cortical activity patterns without reference to any features of the tasks themselves. Second, we also tested how the models would generalize when tested with data from a new group of participants tested on a set of novel tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>The use of separate training and evaluation datasets allowed us to determine the best task-general model of cortico-cerebellar connectivity without overfitting the data. To validate that this approach enabled us to distinguish between different forms of cortico-cerebellar connectivity, we conducted a range of model recovery simulations (see Methods for details). Using the measured cortical activity for each participant, we generated artificial sets of cerebellar data imposing either a one-to-one or a many-to-one mapping. Following the procedure used with the real data, we trained the three models on Task Set A and tested them on Task Set B. The simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) showed that the WTA performed best if each cerebellar voxel was connected to only one cortical parcel, whereas ridge regression performed better if there was substantial convergence, with Lasso performing at an intermediate level. Thus, despite the presence of some degree of collinearity between the cortical parcels, these simulations demonstrate that our modeling approach is able to distinguish between different forms of connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cortico-cerebellar connectivity is best captured by models with convergence</title><p>We first compared the different models, asking how well they predicted activity patterns obtained when the same participants were tested on Task Set B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Models allowing for some degree of convergence outperformed the WTA model, and this advantage was observed across all levels of cortical granularity. Indeed, the prediction performance for the Ridge, Lasso, and WTA models was relatively independent of granularity. Averaged across all levels of granularity, the Ridge models outperformed the WTA models (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,23</sub> = 47.122, p&lt;0.001). Post-hoc tests revealed that this advantage for the Ridge model was consistent across all levels of granularity, starting with a parcellation of 80 regions (<italic>t</italic><sub>23</sub>=5.172, p&lt;0.001). We also found a significant difference in predictive accuracy between the Ridge and Lasso model (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,23</sub> = 15.055, p&lt;0.001). Post-hoc tests showed that there was no significant difference in predictive accuracy at the lowest level of granularity (<italic>t</italic><sub>23</sub>=1.279, p=0.213), whereas the difference was significant for the finer parcellations (all <italic>t</italic><sub>23</sub> &gt;10.937, p&lt;0.001).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Performance of cortico-cerebellar connectivity models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Predictive accuracy (Pearson correlation) of the Ridge, Lasso, and WTA regression models for the test data of Task Set B (<bold>B</bold>) Predictive accuracy normalized to the noise ceiling based on reliability of both cerebellar and cortical data (see Methods).

There are two issues of note here. First, the models predicted activity of individual voxels, without any smoothing across cerebellar voxels. Thus, the upper bound for the predictive accuracy is limited by the reliability of the cerebellar test data. The correlation of the measured cerebellar activity patterns across the two sessions of Task Set B was, on average, <italic>r</italic>=0.51 (SD = 0.102). Reliability was fairly consistent across the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), with some decreases in lobules I-IV. This dropoff likely reflects the fact that our battery only included hand and eye movements, and did not activate the lower body representation that is prominent in this area. Second, predictive accuracy is also limited by the reliability of the cortical data that was used to make the prediction. This is an especially limiting factor for WTA models that use fine granularity, since the predictions will be based on data obtained from a small cortical region.</p><p>Given these issues, we calculated a noise ceiling for each model, taking into account the reliability of the cerebellar data, the reliability of the cortical data, and the effect of granularity (see Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). As an unbiased comparison of the model predictions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> re-plots the predictive accuracy of each model normalized by its noise ceiling. As with the original analysis, the Ridge model significantly outperformed the WTA model (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,23</sub> = 16.49, p&lt;0.01), and in post-hoc tests, the advantage was especially pronounced for finer parcellations (1848 regions; <italic>t</italic><sub>23</sub>=5.073, p&lt;0.001). Overall, the noise ceiling calculation showed that the Ridge model was able to predict approximately 45% of the systematic variance of the cerebellar activity patterns across tasks (average R<sup>2</sup>=0.67<sup>2</sup>). While the predictive accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) was best in anterior motor regions, it was reasonably high across the entire cerebellar surface.</p><p>The predicted and observed activity patterns for two exemplary tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) demonstrate the quality of these predictions at the group level. In both of these examples, (spatial working memory and social cognition tasks), the connectivity model predicted the pattern of task activity with a high degree of fidelity. This is especially compelling for the spatial working memory task as the training set did not include a task with similar characteristics.</p><p>To ensure that our results were not biased by the use of an essentially arbitrary parcellation of the neocortex, we repeated the analysis using a range of published functional parcellations. For example, we used a 7-network cortical parcellation based on resting state fMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>) to train and test the three models. Here, too, the WTA model was inferior to the Ridge models (<italic>t</italic><sub>23</sub>=2.956, p&lt;0.01), with no performance difference between Ridge and Lasso models (<italic>t</italic><sub>23</sub>=–1.235, p=0.229). The same pattern held when we used other common functional parcellations of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these results demonstrate that models which entail some degree of convergence from the neocortex to the cerebellum outperform a model in which cerebellar activity is based on input from a single cortical region.

As expected given the crossed connectivity between M1 and lobules IV/V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelly and Strick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krienen and Buckner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O’Reilly et al., 2010</xref>), the input to the hand regions of the cerebellum (regions 1 and 2) was centered around the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex with some additional input from premotor and parietal cortex. Regions 3 and 4 are the other two cerebellar regions associated with motor function. Activity in region 3, the oculomotor vermis, is predicted by a bilateral set of cortical regions including the frontal eye fields (FEF), regions in the intraparietal sulcus, and extrastriate visual regions. Region 4, an area strongly activated during action observation, is predicted by a bilateral network of regions including premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and parietal cortex. Cerebellar regions 5–10, the regions associated with more cognitive processes are predicted by a distributed set of cortical regions, with stronger input coming from the contralateral cortical hemisphere. For example, cerebellar region 5, a region restricted to the left cerebellum, receives much stronger input from the right cerebral hemisphere. In summary, these results suggest that most cerebellar regions are best predicted by multiple cortical regions, pointing to some degree of cortical-cerebellar convergence.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cortical connectivity weight maps for the Ridge regression model with 1848 cortical parcels for each of 10 functional cerebellar regions.</title><p>Each region is denoted by the most important functional term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">King et al., 2019</xref>).

For example, inputs to hand motor regions MDTB (regions 1 and 2) arise from a relatively small area of the neocortex, while inputs to regions in lobule VII (regions 3–10) come from a larger area. To quantify this observation, we tallied the number of non-zero regression weights for each cerebellar voxel as a measure of its input surface area. For this calculation, we used the Lasso model (80 cortical parcels) since it uses the minimal set of cortical areas necessary for predicting each cerebellar voxel. As the Lasso model forces the estimates of the other weights to zero, it allows for a quantification of input area without applying an arbitrary threshold. This calculation revealed a substantial variation in the degree of convergence across the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). For example, predicting the activity pattern of voxels within Crus I required inclusion of up to 10% of the cortical surface whereas predicting the activity of voxels in the anterior lobe required less than 5% of the neocortex.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cortico-cerebellar convergence measures using the Lasso model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Map of the cerebellum showing percentage of cortical parcels with non-zero weights for the Lasso model (n=80 parcels).

The lowest level of convergence was observed for regions 1 and 2, the anterior hand regions of the cerebellum. The highest levels of convergence were found in regions of the cerebellum associated with more cognitive functions (e.g. regions 7 and 8, areas engaged during language comprehension). Noteworthy, this pattern holds for cortical parcellations of different levels of granularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), as well as for the thresholded coefficients from the Ridge regression models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether these differences were driven by the collinearity of the cortical data, rather than by cortical-cerebellar connectivity, we ran a simulation (see Methods, model recovery simulations) in which we replaced the cerebellar data with the activity profile of the most similar cortical parcel. In this simulation, we did not find any differences in the area of estimated input across cerebellar regions (F<sub>9,207</sub>=1.762, p=0.076). Thus, the observed variation in convergence cannot be explained by the collinearity between different cortical input regions.</p><p>As an independent method to quantify convergence, we determined the spatial spread of the inputs across the cortical surface. For example, MDTB region 4, which is activated by action observation, is explained by a set of cortical regions with a relatively small surface area. Nonetheless these regions are spread widely across the cortex (e.g. fusiform gyrus, parietal and premotor regions). For a measure of dispersion, we calculated the spherical variance of the non-zero connectivity weights on an inflated model for each cerebral hemisphere (see Methods). This analysis revealed a similar pattern as seen in the surface area measure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref> <italic>F</italic><sub>9,207</sub>=18.322, p&lt;0.001). For example, the cortical inputs to the hand motor regions of the cerebellum were more concentrated, whereas the cortical inputs to lobule VII were more dispersed. Again, this pattern also holds for the Ridge models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we observed variation in the degree of cortico-cerebellar convergence across the cerebellar cortex. In particular, cerebellar motor areas such as the hand region in lobule V and VIII received relatively focal cortical input whereas cerebellar areas associated with cognitive processes (e.g. language, working memory) in lobule VII exhibited a higher degree of convergence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cortico-cerebellar connectivity model predicts new cerebellar data</title><p>A strong test of a model is how well it predicts novel data obtained in contexts distinct from that data used to develop the model.

These results provide evidence that our cortico-cerebellar connectivity models capture important aspects of connectivity that are stable both across tasks and participants.

This work demonstrates that each region of the cerebellum receives input from a distinct set of cortical regions. For example, anterior and posterior cerebellar motor regions show correlated activity with contral-lateral sensorimotor cortex and non-motor or ‘cognitive’ cerebellar regions show correlated activity with specific parietal and frontal association areas.</p><p>Despite these important insights, previous work has not been designed to examine the patterns of convergence between the neocortex and cerebellum. Resting state connectivity maps are generally produced by assigning each cerebellar voxel to a single cortical network, a <italic>de facto</italic> winner-take-all model. In the present study, we quantified and compared models of cortico-cerebellar connectivity. The models differed in the degree of convergence of cortical inputs to each cerebellar region, ranging from an architecture constrained to a strict one-to-one mapping to architectures that allowed for distributed inputs. We evaluated these models in terms of how well they could predict cerebellar activity patterns on a novel Task Set. For nearly the entire cerebellum, models that allowed for some convergence predicted cerebellar activity better than the WTA model.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Convergence differs across cerebellar circuits</title><p>Importantly, the amount of convergence differed across the cerebellar cortex. Specifically, regions in anterior (lobules I-V) and inferior cerebellum (lobules VIII-X) were well predicted by a relatively small and concentrated area of the neocortex. In contrast, regions in lobule VI and especially lobule VII required input from a larger and spatially more dispersed set of cortical regions that were primarily located in association areas of prefrontal, parietal, and cingulate cortex. This finding underscores the heterogeneity of cortico-cerebellar connectivity with some cerebellar areas functioning in nearly a 1:1 relationship with a single cortical region, whereas other areas integrate input from a more diverse set of cortical regions.</p><p>This variation bears some resemblance to a motor/cognitive gradient identified from resting state data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guell et al., 2018</xref>). However, there are a few notable exceptions. First, based on our evaluation metrics, Region 3 (oculomotor vermis) was best explained by a large and relatively dispersed set of cortical regions, including intraparietal sulcus, the frontal eye fields (FEF), and extrastriate visual areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Second, sub-regions of lobules IX, functionally associated with non-motor tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckner et al., 2011</xref>), are best explained by a relatively restricted set of cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>). Thus, rather than following a functional distinction, it appears that regions with strong convergence are anatomically restricted to lobules VI and VII, two areas that have disproportionately increased in size during primate evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balsters et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Variation in cortico-cerebellar connectivity has important implications for theories of cerebellar function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Zeeuw et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diedrichsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henschke and Pakan, 2020</xref>). A cerebellar region that forms a closed-loop circuit with a single cortical region can only fine-tune the computational processes that are ongoing in its connected cortical region. In contrast, a cerebellar region that receives convergent input would be able to coordinate the interactions between dispersed cortical regions. Indeed, using a rodent model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pisano et al., 2021</xref> have identified cerebellar areas that project back to multiple cortical areas, providing a substrate by which the cerebellum can influence neuronal dynamics not only in a focal cortical area but also interactions within networks of cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pisano et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Task-based vs. resting-state connectivity analyses</title><p>While our modeling approach could be applied to resting-state data, we opted to use the data from the multi-domain task battery for a variety of reasons. First, the breadth of tasks included in the battery assured that there would be reliable variation in activity across most of the neocortex and cerebellum, a necessary precondition for building a complete connectivity model. Second, the dataset allowed us to avoid biases that arise from correlated noise across abutting cortical and cerebellar regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckner et al., 2011</xref>). We used the cortical activity patterns from one session to predict cerebellar activity patterns in a different session, relying on the fact that measurement noise is independent across sessions. Third, the MDTB data set allowed us to test the model across a broad set of tasks and mental states. While resting-state correlations are predictive of task-based activation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">King et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tavor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhi et al., 2022</xref>), resting in an fMRI scanner is arguably a relatively restricted situation. Our generalization test shows that the connectivity model can robustly predict activity patterns for new tasks and participants.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Directionality of the model</title><p>We opted in the present study to model the correlations between neocortical and cerebellar activity in a directional manner, making inferences from these data about connectivity from the neocortex to the cerebellum. We recognize that the two structures communicate with each other in a closed loop. Our decision to focus on cortico-cerebellar connectivity is based on studies of cerebellar blood flow in rodents. Increases in cerebellar blood flow, a major contributor to the BOLD signal, are the result of increases in mossy fiber activity, the primary input to the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alahmadi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alahmadi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gagliano et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mapelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mathiesen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomsen et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, even a dramatic increase in the (complex or simple spike) firing rate of Purkinje cells does not produce a measurable change in blood flow within the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thomsen et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the cerebellar BOLD signal provides a relatively clear image of the cortical inputs to the cerebellum; importantly, this signal does not provide information about the output of the cerebellar cortex (or cerebellum in general). In contrast, the BOLD signal in the neocortex reflects a combination of signals including local inputs/outputs across cortical layers, inputs from other cortical regions, and ascending inputs such as from the thalamus which will include input from the cerebellum. Given this asymmetry, a priori, we should expect that correlations in the fMRI signal between the neocortex and cerebellum will more strongly reflect the flow of information from the cortex to the cerebellum than the reverse.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is possible that some of the convergent inputs identified in our modeling work may be due to divergent projections from a single cerebellar region to multiple cortical regions. Indeed, recent viral tracing work has shown that some cerebellar areas project to the reticular nuclei in the thalamus, which in turn projects to a wide array of cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelly and Strick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pisano et al., 2021</xref>). A complete analysis of the entire cortico-cerebellar circuit will require the methods such as viral tracing techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelly and Strick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pisano et al., 2021</xref>) or functional activation measures that target key nodes in the ascending pathway (deep cerebellar nuclei, thalamus).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Methodological limitations</title><p>Inter-region correlations of fMRI data can of course only provide indirect evidence of true functional connectivity. As such, it is important to consider methodological limitations that may influence the validity of our conclusions. From a statistical perspective, it was not clear, a priori, that we would have the power to distinguish between models of connectivity given that there can be substantial collinearity between different cortical regions. The model-recovery simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>) suggest that the present dataset was suitable to make such inferences, namely, activity patterns in different cortical regions were sufficiently de-correlated, likely reflecting the use of a broad task battery. Thus, we were able to recover the correct model used to simulate the data, regardless of whether we assumed one-to-one connectivity or different degrees of convergence.</p><p>However, the simulations also indicated that the approach (and data) was not sufficient to determine the absolute degree of convergence with high confidence. For example, the size of the cortical input area for each cerebellar region differed substantially between the Ridge and Lasso regression models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nonetheless, the two models result in similar predictive accuracy when using real data. Therefore, the true extent of the cortical input to a cerebellar region likely lies somewhere between the extremes provided by the Ridge and Lasso models. Importantly, this ambiguity does not impact the core observation that the degree of convergence varies systematically across the cerebellar cortex. Whether using measures based on cortical surface area or dispersion, the general picture of variation in connectivity holds for both the Ridge and Lasso models, as well as when using cortical parcellations of different granularity. Thus, we are confident that the variation in convergence reflects a stable, method-independent characteristic of the cortico-cerebellar system.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Future directions</title><p>Our approach was designed to identify the best task-general model of cortico-cerebellar connectivity. The connectivity model was able to take cortical activity patterns to make fairly accurate predictions of cerebellar activity, even when the data were obtained in a completely separate experiment from that used to build the model. This finding suggests that a substantial proportion of the cortico-cerebellar communication can be described by fixed information flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole et al., 2016</xref>); that is, each area of the cerebellum simply receives, independent of task, a copy of the neural activity occurring in the corresponding cortical areas.</p><p>However, the task-general model did not provide a perfect prediction of cerebellar activity. While these predictions may improve with more training data, we believe that there will likely be some systematic failures of the model. Such task-dependent deviations from the model prediction may offer important insights into cerebellar function, indicating that the cerebellum is more active than predicted by the cortical activity for some tasks and less for others. This pattern would suggest a ‘gating’ of cortical input to the cerebellum, perhaps within the pontine nuclei, which is the main relay station of cortical inputs to the cerebellum. Rather than just transmitting cortical input to the cerebellar cortex, these nuclei may serve as an adaptive gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwarz and Thier, 1999</xref>), amplifying or attenuating information as a function of the relative importance of cerebellar processing for the current task.</p><p>The models presented here allow us to detect such deviations by comparing the observed cerebellar activity for any task against the activity that is predicted by a task-invariant connectivity model.

The 26 unique tasks were designed to sample activity during a broad range of task domains including motor (e.g. sequence production), working memory (e.g. 2-back task), language (e.g. reading), social (e.g. theory of mind), cognitive control (no-go, Stroop), and emotion (e.g. facial expression; see Table S1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">King et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Twenty-four participants (16 females, 8 males, mean age = 23.8) were scanned during four sessions, with Task Set A employed in sessions 1 and 2 and Task Set B in sessions 3 and 4. Within a session, there were eight 10-min runs, with each run composed of 17 blocks of 35 s each. Each block involved a unique task and included an initial 5 s instruction period.

This procedure emphasized voxels with large signal-to-noise ratios over voxels with low signal-to-noise ratios. The normalized time series were then averaged within all Q cortical parcels, resulting in a TxQ matrix (X) of cortical features. For the cerebellum, we modeled each of the p=6937 cerebellar voxels separately (SUIT atlas space with 3 mm resolution), resulting in a TxP data matrix (Y). The cortical data were further z-standardized (as in a partial correlation analysis) before entering them into regression models (see <italic>Model Estimation</italic>).</p><p>When estimating connectivity models, correlated fMRI noise across the cortex and cerebellum (e.g. head movement, physiological artifacts) can lead to the erroneous detection of connectivity between structures. This is especially problematic for the superior cerebellum and the directly abutting regions of the occipital and inferior temporal lobes. To negate the influence of any noise process that was uncorrelated with the tasks, we used a ‘crossed’ approach to train the models. Because there were two sessions (same tasks, different order) in each task set (A and B), we were able to predict the cerebellar fitted time series for the first session by the cortical time series from the second session, and vice-versa (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>We did this separately for each task set, and given that the sequence of tasks was randomized across sessions, we could conclude from this approach that this prediction was based on task-related signal changes rather than fluctuations attributable to noise processes given that noise is not shared across scanning sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cortical parcels</title><p>We created a set of models that used different levels of granularity to subdivide the cortex.

For the first measure, we calculated the percentage of the cortical surface contributing to the prediction in each cerebellar voxel. We used the estimated weights from the Lasso regression model with the best unnormalized performance (80 cortical parcels). We opted to focus on the Lasso model since it sets weights that make a negligible contribution to the predictions to zero, thus identifying the sparsest cortical input that explains the cerebellar data. To determine the likely input area, we determined the number of non-zero coefficients for each cerebellar voxel, and expressed this as a percentage of the cortical surface. We also repeated these analyses using Ridge regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because Ridge does not result in zero coefficients, we applied a threshold, counting the number of connectivity weights with a value one standard above the mean of the weight matrix.</p><p>For the second measure, we calculated the dispersion (spherical variance) of the input weights. Using the spherical representation of the cerebral hemispheres from FreeSurfer, we defined unit vectors, v<sub>i</sub> , pointing from the center of the sphere to the center of each of the cortical parcels. Each vector was then weighted by the cortico-cerebellar connectivity weight for that region w<sub>i</sub>. All negative connectivity weights were set to zero. The spherical variance for hemisphere h across all <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>  parcels of this hemisphere was defined as:<disp-formula id="equ10"><label>(10)</label><mml:math id="m10"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:munder><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>To obtain a composite measure, we averaged the variances for the two hemispheres, with each weighted by the size of the summed (non-negative) connectivity weights. For summary and statistical testing, we then averaged the size of the input area, as well as the dispersion, across cerebellar voxels within each of the 10 functionally defined MDTB regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Model recovery simulations</title><p>Even though we are using data from a broad task battery, there is substantial collinearity between the cortical parcels. This raises the questions of whether our approach can reliably distinguish between models of sparse and broad connectivity, and whether we can detect differences in convergence across regions in an unbiased fashion.</p><p>To validate our model-selection approach we conducted a series of model recovery simulations. Using the observed cortical activity patterns from each individual participant (with 80–1848 parcels), we simulated artificial cerebellar data for 2000 voxels. The artificial connectivity weights were chosen under two scenarios. To simulate one-to-one connectivity, each cerebellar voxel was connected to only one randomly chosen cortical parcel. To simulate broad convergence, the connectivity weights were drawn from a normal distribution with mean = 0, and a variance of 0.2. We then generated artificial data following Equation 2, both for the training data (using the cortical data from Task Set A) and for the testing data (using the cortical data from Task Set B). The measurement noise (E) was drawn from a normal distribution with mean = 0. The variance (0.25) was adjusted to approximate the signal-to-noise level observed in the empirical data. Model estimation (including hyperparameter-tuning) and model testing were then conducted following the procedure used for the empirical data (see above).</p><p>We also tested whether differences in cortical input area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) could be due to differences in collinearity in the associated cortical parcels. To address this question, we conducted a simulation with 80 cortical parcels. For each MDTB region and participant, we simulated cerebellar data using one-to-one connectivity with the cortical parcel that had the highest average lasso-regression coefficient for that region and participant. Thus, we replaced the average activity profile in each cerebellar region by the profile of the most similar cortical parcel. We submitted these data to a Lasso regression with log-lambda set to –3 and calculated the percentage of the cortical surface with non-zero connectivity weights in the same manner as done with the real data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Generalization to new participants</title><p>Although the models were trained and tested on distinct datasets with more than half the tasks unique to each set, the data for training and testing were obtained from the same set of participants. As a stronger test of generalization, we evaluated the models with data from a new experiment involving naive participants (n=20, 11 females, 9 males, mean age = 21.3). These participants were trained to perform a 5-task battery (cognitive control, social prediction, action prediction, visual search, semantic prediction). For each task, there was an easy and hard condition (e.g., 2-back vs 0-back for cognitive control, high vs low predictability), along with the task’s associated instruction. Thus, there were a total of 16 conditions when including rest (fixation). Each participant completed five sessions, with fMRI data obtained in the first, third, and fifth sessions. Within a scanning session, there were six 11-min runs, and each run included three repetitions of each task (35 s) with a 10 s rest period prior to each 5 s instruction period.</p><p>The participants were scanned on a Siemens MAGNETOM TrioTim syngo MR B17 located in the Henry Wheeler Jr. Brain Imaging Center at the University of California, Berkeley. The protocol used the following parameters: 1 s repetition time; field-of-view measuring 20.8 cm; A-to-P phase encoding direction; 48 slices; 3 mm thickness; in-plane resolution 2.5×2.5 mm<sup>2</sup>. To localize and normalize the functional data, a high-resolution, whole-brain anatomical scan (T1-weighted MPRAGE, 1 mm isotropic resolution) was acquired during the first session. fMRIPrep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Esteban et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Esteban et al., 2020</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/">https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/</ext-link>) was used to preprocess the anatomical and functional data, following the same analysis procedures as conducted for the main experiment.</p><p>To generate estimates of activity (beta weights), a General Linear Model (GLM) was fitted for each voxel to the time series data. Each of the 16 conditions was modeled as a separate regressor, with this repeated separately for each imaging run. Nipype (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</ext-link>) and custom-written scripts in Python were used to estimate the beta weights from a first-level GLM.</p><p>To evaluate model generalization to this new dataset, we used the full set of cortico-cerebellar connectivity models estimated with the original data set, limiting the analysis to the regular cortical parcellations. Since the participants were different from the original data set, we averaged the model weights for the original 24 participants (i.e. 3 model types x 5 levels of granularity). Each model was then used to predict cerebellar activity from the cortical activity obtained in the new study, with these predictions compared to actual cerebellar activity at the individual level. Given that the experiment was a training study, we expected that both the true activation patterns, as well as the signal-to-noise ratio would change across sessions. We therefore determined the noise ceiling for each session separately by calculating the reliability across odd and even runs within each session. The normalized predictive accuracy was determined separately for each of the three imaging sessions, with the results across sessions averaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Source data files</title><p>Model training (‘model_training_ridge.csv’ and ‘model_training_lasso.csv’) and evaluation (‘model_evaluation.csv’) summary results are included as additional source data in the manuscript.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is a co-founder with equity in Magnetic Tides, Inc</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All participants gave informed consent under an experimental protocol approved by the institutional review board at Western University (Protocol number: 107293).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Chris Baker as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Claims of directionality are overstated and should be revised accordingly.</p><p>2) The authors should address the differences in model complexity, ideally through an additional analysis (e.g., involving AIC or BIC).</p><p>3) More details on the connectivity method used, especially how it handles the task-evoked variance inflation problem.</p><p>4) The authors should discuss the possibility that motor tasks are inherently simpler than non-motor tasks, which may have biased their results regarding motor vs. non-motor regions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should compare model performance while accounting for model complexity. One solution is for the Lasso/Ridge models to have the &quot;WTA&quot; weights to be fixed while randomly permuting all other weights. If the Ridge model is truly better, you would expect this random model to perform similarly to the WTA model but worse than the original Ridge/Lasso models. This would suggest that more inputs do not significantly explain more variances in the cerebellum just by chance.</p><p>The authors should expand the discussion on the closed-loop anatomical relationship between the cerebellum and the cortex and how its multi-synaptic relationship can allow converging inputs from the cortex to the cerebellum.</p><p>For figures 3 and 4, it would be nice to expand and show physically where and how widespread those cortical inputs are. That can help readers contextualize the physical level of &quot;convergence&quot; of the cortex onto cerebellar regions.</p><p>Instead of interpreting the results as cortico-cerebellar inputs, discuss how they can be bidirectional interactions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The authors note that a &quot;convergent architecture would suggest that subregions in the cerebellum integrate information across disparate cortical regions and may coordinate their interactions.&quot; It would be interesting to evaluate the degree to which the &quot;disparate&quot; regions that may provide convergent inputs to the cerebellum, as identified in this study, are functionally/anatomically related.</p><p>– The authors discuss findings from Pisano et al. 2021 as anatomical evidence for cerebellar outputs from specific regions reaching a variety of cortical targets. However, it is important to note that in most species, and especially in the mouse, it is quite unlikely that any one anatomical tracer injection into the cerebellar cortex can target a functionally distinct region of the cerebellum. See, for example, Fujita et al. 2010 J Comp Neurol where small injections into marmoset cerebellar cortex are difficult to localize to specific longitudinal bands in the cerebellar cortex.</p><p>– A map of the cerebellum showing the MDTB regions would be useful to include as a guideline in Figure 3</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A task-general connectivity model reveals variation in convergence of cortical inputs to functional regions of the cerebellum&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Chris Baker (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors did an excellent job improving their manuscript based on previous reviews, except for one major point described below.</p><p>R1 point 3 was responded to, but not meaningfully addressed. The authors seemed to misunderstand the issue that regressing out mean task-evoked activity is meant to deal with, resulting in the authors effectively ignoring the issue with regard to their own study. Indicative of misunderstanding the issue, the authors state: &quot;Returning to the papers cited by the reviewer, these are designed to look at connectivity not related to the task-evoked activity.&quot; This is a common misunderstanding in the field: Rather than looking at connectivity not related to task-evoked activity, regressing out mean task-evoked activity is meant to deal with a causal confound (common inputs from stimuli), while still allowing estimation of connectivity related to the task-evoked activity. This interest in the impact of the task-related activity on connectivity is clear from the simple logic of most studies utilizing mean task-evoked activity regression, wherein connectivity estimated in the context of condition-specific task-evoked activity is compared. (If all task-evoked activity were removed then there would be no point in comparing task conditions.) What is left over for estimating functional connectivity estimation is trial-by-trial (and moment-to-moment) variation in task-evoked activity (along with spontaneous activity). So, the authors have not dealt with the possibility that common stimulus inputs – such as centrally presented visual stimuli simultaneously activating left and right hemispheres, generating false inter-hemispheric functional connections – are driving some of their connectivity estimates. Ideally, this confound would be dealt with, but at the very least the authors should acknowledge this limitation of their methods.</p><p>Beyond this issue (and perhaps more importantly), it is difficult to reconcile the present study's approach with more standard task-related functional connectivity approaches. How can connectivity values estimated via the present study's approach be interpreted? How do these interpretations differ from those of more common task-related functional connectivity approaches? Is there enough advantage to using the present study's unconventional task-related functional connectivity method to make it worth the extra effort for readers to make sense of it and learn to relate it to more standard approaches? The presence of all of these unanswered questions makes it difficult to properly evaluate the manuscript and its results.</p><p>Further, in my attempt to answer the above questions myself, I have read and re-read the description of the connectivity approach, and yet I have not been able to make sense of it. I doubt this is my own lack of knowledge or intelligence, but even if that were the case it is likely that many (perhaps most) readers would have the same issue. Therefore, I recommend rewriting the &quot;Connectivity Models&quot; section (within &quot;Methods&quot;) to include more details. Some specific details that would be helpful to include:</p><p>– The meaning of &quot;fitted time series&quot; is ambiguous. Does this mean the original time series multiplied by the fit β estimate for each condition, resulting in the original time series modulated by the fit to the task regressor for each condition? Or does this mean the regressor time series multiplied by the fit β estimate for each condition? If it is the first option I can imagine interpreting the resulting functional connectivity estimates in a fairly similar way to standard task-related functional connectivity. However, if it is the second option, then I think the interpretation would be quite different from standard task-related functional connectivity. In such a case I think much more details on how to interpret the resulting connectivity values would be warranted. Of course, it could be a third option I haven't considered, in which case it would be helpful to have that option detailed.</p><p>– It is unclear what this detail means (pg. 24): &quot;This procedure reweighted the activity estimates in an optimal manner, accounting for the fact that estimates for the instructions were based on 5 s of fMRI data, while estimates for the conditions were based on 10-30 s of data.&quot; In what sense is this accounting for the duration of task conditions? This makes me wonder whether the connectivity estimates were based on using cortical β estimates (rather than time series) to predict cerebellar β estimates (rather than time series), which could account for condition duration quite well. But the description is ambiguous with respect to these kind of details, and this possibility doesn't seem to fit well with earlier descriptions of the method.</p><p>– It is unclear what this detail means (pg. 24): &quot;This method also mitigates problems that may arise in event-related designs due to correlations between regressors (Mumford et al., 2012).&quot; How exactly? Also, what exactly are the problems that may arise in event-related designs due to correlations between regressors? It sounds like this is related to collinearity, but it is unclear which aspects of the method help with collinearity.</p><p>– The details regarding the &quot;crossed&quot; approach need to be fleshed out. It is stated (pg. 25): &quot;we used a &quot;crossed&quot; approach to train the models: The cerebellar fitted time series for the first session was predicted by the cortical time series from the second session, and vice-versa&quot;. This procedure is also presented in an ambiguous manner in Figure 1. Right now it is stated in the manuscript that the session 2 cortical time series are used to predict the session 1 cerebellar time series, and yet it is unclear how that would be possible when there are different task conditions across the sessions. Is the connectivity model built using both cortical and cerebellar time series during session 2 (betas from cortex predicting cerebellum), then both cortical and cerebellar time series are used from session 1 to test the session 2 connectivity model (session 2 betas multiplied by session 1 cortical time series to predict session 1 cerebellar time series)? Put more simply: is it the case that the session 2 connectivity model is tested using session 1 data, and that the session 1 connectivity model is tested using session 2 data? If so, the description should change to better describe this. In any case, the description should be clarified with more details.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81511.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Claims of directionality are overstated and should be revised accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the correlation structure of BOLD signals in the neocortex and cerebellum is shaped by the closed-loop (bi-directional) interactions between the two structures. As such, some of the observed convergence could be caused by divergence of cerebellar output. We have added a new section to the discussion on the directionality of the model (Page 18).</p><p>That said, there are strong reasons to believe that our results are mainly determined by how the neocortex sends signals to the cerebellum, and not vice versa. An increasing body of physiological studies (and this includes newer papers, see response to reviewer #1, comment #1 for details) show that cerebellar blood flow is determined by signal transmission from mossy fibers to granule cells and parallel fibers, followed by Nitric oxide signaling from molecular layer interneurons. Importantly, it is clear that Purkinje cells, the only output cell of the cerebellar cortex, are not reflected in the BOLD signal from the cerebellar cortex. (We also note that <italic>increases</italic> in the firing rate of inhibitory Purkinje cells means <italic>less</italic> activation of the neocortex). Thus, while we acknowledge that cerebellar-cortical connectivity likely plays a role in the correlations we observed, we cannot use fMRI observations from the cerebellar cortex and neocortex to draw conclusions about cerebellar-cortical connectivity. To do so we would need to measure activity in the deep cerebellar nuclei (and likely thalamus).</p><p>The situation is different when considering the other direction (cortico-cerebellar connections). Here we have the advantage that the cerebellar BOLD signal is mostly determined by the mossy fiber input which, at least for the human cerebellum, comes overwhelmingly from cortical sources. On the neocortical side, the story is admittedly less clear: The cortical BOLD signal is likely determined by a mixture of incoming signals from the thalamus (which mixes inputs from the basal ganglia and cerebellum), subcortex, other cortical areas, and local cortical inputs (e.g., across layers). While the cortical BOLD signal (in contrast to the cerebellum) also reflects the firing rate of output cells, not all output cells will send collaterals to the pontine nuclei. These caveats are now clearly expressed in the Discussion section2.</p><p>On balance, there is an asymmetry: Cerebellar BOLD signal is dominated by neocortical input without contribution from the output (Purkinje) cells. Neocortical BOLD signal reflects a mixture of many inputs (with the cerebellar input making a small contribution) and cortical output firing. This asymmetry means that the observed correlation structure between cortical and cerebellar BOLD activity (the determinant of the estimated connectivity weights) will be determined more directly by cortico-cerebellar connections than by cerebellar-cortical connections. Given this, we have left the title and abstract largely the same, but have tempered the strength of the claim by discussing the influence of connectivity in the opposite direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should address the differences in model complexity, ideally through an additional analysis (e.g., involving AIC or BIC).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not having been clearer on the topic of model complexity in the original submission. Our approach (Figure 1) is designed to compare models of different complexity in an unbiased fashion. Parameters for all models were estimated on the training set (Task set A, Figure 1A). This includes the large number of connectivity weights (W_hat) and the single regularization coefficient for Ridge and Lasso regression. The models were then tested on the data from two independent imaging sessions (Task set B, Figure 1B). Using independent training and test data sets is the gold-standard in statistical model comparison (Stone, 1974), and fully corrects for model complexity i.e., any model that overfits the data will, on average, perform worse on an independent test dataset (i.e., Hastie et al. 2009, Chapter 7).</p><p>Training and testing was performed within-subjects to account for the considerable inter-individual variation in cortical and cerebellar functional organization. However, to test how well each model generalizes to new subjects, we also averaged the estimated weights across subjects and re-tested the model on a dataset with new subjects performing a new set of tasks (Figure 1C).</p><p>AIC is a well-established approximation to the expected cross-validation error in the setting of Gaussian linear regression (Stone 1977). While extensions to WTA (i.e. best-subset selection), Ridge regression and Lasso regression exist, the comparison of models across these approaches using AIC has, to our knowledge, not been well-validated. Thus, we think that using separate training and test sets is the safest and most transparent way to compare models with different structures.</p><p>Another important reason to compare models based on their ability to predict independent datasets, rather than using AIC, is that we can assess how well the models generalize to new task conditions. AIC (and related methods) approximates the expected cross-validation error in predicting Y (the cerebellar activity patterns) given a fixed X (the cortical activity patterns). However, in our case the number of tasks is smaller than the number of cortical parcels. Therefore, there will be strong linear dependencies between the different cortical parcels, such that a model may associate a cerebellar region with the wrong combination of cortical parcels (see pt 3). To protect against this, we really want to test on a new random X (e.g., on new tasks). New task sets will lead to somewhat different co-dependencies between cortical regions, and a model that learned the wrong combination of cortical parcels should perform poorly on these new (random) X’s, but not on the old (fixed) X’s. We therefore think that the out-of-sample test on a new taskset is a much stronger criterion for model comparison.</p><p>We now point this logic out more clearly in the Introduction and Results. We hope this is a more appropriate and convincing way of dealing with the problem of model comparison than AIC.</p><p>References:</p><p>Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., and Friedman, J.

It is important to stress that our approach only relied on task-evoked activity. Rather than removing the task-related activity from the time series (as for example, Cole et al., 2019) or using the entire time series, we used only the fitted (and hence task-evoked) activity. All other fluctuations were removed using the crossed approach of predicting cerebellar activity from one half of the data based on cortical activity from the other half of the data for each task set (see response to reviewer #1, comment #4). Models estimated based on the fitted (task-evoked) activity were able to predict the cerebellar activity patterns in Task Set B better than models based on the entire time series or models based on the residuals after removing task-evoked activity.</p><p>A task-based approach comes with two important concerns: First, for a small number of tasks, collinearity between different cortical areas may prevent us from determining the correct connectivity model. Second, the particular choice of tasks may bias the estimate of connectivity, and the models may not generalize well to other tasks.</p><p>In this paper, we addressed these problems by deliberately choosing a very broad task-set, one designed to activate different cortical areas as independently as possible. Additionally, we evaluated connectivity models in how well they predicted activity patterns from tasks that were not included in task set A (see also pt 2) – this ensures that we pick a model that generalizes well.</p><p>To determine how successful we were in picking tasks that allowed us to estimate a comprehensive connectivity model, we calculated the variance-inflation-factor (VIF) for each cortical parcel for the Ridge regression model (Marquardt, 1970). The VIF tells us how variable our estimate of the connectivity weight to a particular cortical parcel is due to collinearity with other cortical parcels.

This indicates that our task battery did not systematically activate and/or dissociate activity in these regions. Importantly, however, this limitation is not observed in the rest of the brain. The VIF in visual, motor, and associative regions was fairly uniform. Thus, the differences in convergence that we found between hand-motor regions and more cognitive regions of the cerebellum does not appear to be caused by different degrees of collinearity in these regions.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81511-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To further address this issue, we conducted an additional simulation analysis using the Lasso model and 80 cortical parcels (as in Figure 4b).

As we discuss in pt. 3, almost all regions of the cortex (including primary, premotor, and supplementary motor regions) were systematically activated and dissociated by our broadband set of tasks.</p><p>The above is an empirical argument. Theoretically we recognize there are many ways of defining complexity, a non-trivial exercise. We included two basic motor tasks in our battery, simple finger tapping and finger sequence tasks. Both activated primary and somatosensory motor cortices (as did most of our cognitive tasks since many required a left- or right-hand response). The main difference between the two motor tasks was that the sequence task elicited higher activation across these regions, as well as elicited activation in premotor and parietal areas. We do think it will be interesting in future research to include a broader set of motor tasks (e.g., include foot and tongue movements). Nonetheless, we do think we have a reasonable manipulation of complexity in the motor domain and yet, still find a difference in convergence between the motor and cognitive regions. Moreover, based on our statistical analysis of collinearity across the cortex (pt. 3), we show that differences in convergence between motor and non-motor regions cannot be attributed to different degrees of collinearity in these regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors should compare model performance while accounting for model complexity. One solution is for the Lasso/Ridge models to have the &quot;WTA&quot; weights to be fixed while randomly permuting all other weights.

The authors seemed to misunderstand the issue that regressing out mean task-evoked activity is meant to deal with, resulting in the authors effectively ignoring the issue with regard to their own study. Indicative of misunderstanding the issue, the authors state: &quot;Returning to the papers cited by the reviewer, these are designed to look at connectivity not related to the task-evoked activity.&quot; This is a common misunderstanding in the field: Rather than looking at connectivity not related to task-evoked activity, regressing out mean task-evoked activity is meant to deal with a causal confound (common inputs from stimuli), while still allowing estimation of connectivity related to the task-evoked activity. This interest in the impact of the task-related activity on connectivity is clear from the simple logic of most studies utilizing mean task-evoked activity regression, wherein connectivity estimated in the context of condition-specific task-evoked activity is compared. (If all task-evoked activity were removed then there would be no point in comparing task conditions.) What is left over for estimating functional connectivity estimation is trial-by-trial (and moment-to-moment) variation in task-evoked activity (along with spontaneous activity). So, the authors have not dealt with the possibility that common stimulus inputs – such as centrally presented visual stimuli simultaneously activating left and right hemispheres, generating false inter-hemispheric functional connections – are driving some of their connectivity estimates. Ideally, this confound would be dealt with, but at the very least the authors should acknowledge this limitation of their methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion caused by our response. When we said “task-evoked” activity in our last response, we meant the averaged (across repeated trials) task-evoked activity, not the trial-by-trial fluctuations in the task evoked activity that you are talking about here. The connectivity model training and evaluation in our paper is relying exclusively on this averaged task-evoked activity (see below).</p><p>As you state, this of course raises the immediate concern that a high connectivity weight between region A and B could be caused by a task that activates both regions, without the regions being connected. For example, the verbal N-back task is always associated with responses of the left hand, so if we were estimating connectivity based on this task alone, we could find high “connectivity” between the right hand-region and the working memory region. However, our task set was designed to be very broad, optimally dissociating the activity profiles across cortical regions (see Figure R1 in our last response). For example, the task set also included an object N-back task that was associated with right-hand responses. Thus, we addressed this concern by deliberately choosing a very broad task-set. Using data from this task set should strongly reduce the influence of spurious associations. Additionally, the evaluation on an independent set of tasks ensures that connectivity models that <italic>do</italic> reflect spurious between-region correlations that are induced by the specific choice of tasks, are penalized and will perform worse.</p><p>Thus, our approach follows a similar logic as the papers discussed in the last response.</p><p>The standard approach is to rely on the fact that the neural fluctuations captured in the residuals (or in the trial-by-trial variations of the regression weights) are rich and varied enough, such that two areas that are not connected would not always correlate. Here, we are relying on the fact that our task set is rich and varied enough to ensure that two areas that are not connected would not always be co-activated. To be clear, both approaches do not guarantee that the estimated connectivity between region A and region B is not caused by a consistent indirect influence from a third region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Beyond this issue (and perhaps more importantly), it is difficult to reconcile the present study's approach with more standard task-related functional connectivity approaches. How can connectivity values estimated via the present study's approach be interpreted? How do these interpretations differ from those of more common task-related functional connectivity approaches? Is there enough advantage to using the present study's unconventional task-related functional connectivity method to make it worth the extra effort for readers to make sense of it and learn to relate it to more standard approaches? The presence of all of these unanswered questions makes it difficult to properly evaluate the manuscript and its results.</p></disp-quote><p>Our approach indeed deviates in another aspect from other connectivity approaches. Rather than using correlation between time-series to derive a network structure, it runs a multiple regression analysis to explain the task-evoked activity in the cerebellum from the task-evoked activity from the neocortex. This approach is justified by the particular neuroanatomical and physiological properties of the system under study: (1) BOLD signal in the cerebellar cortex reflects almost exclusively the incoming input to the cerebellum, which in the human is dominated by the input from neocortex, and (2) there is very little recurrent activity and there are few association fibers between different regions of the cerebellum.</p><p>We therefore do not believe that our approach could not be used to model cortico-cortico connectivity. However, our chosen approach is perfectly suited to model the cortico-cerebellar system. We have now pointed out this difference, and the justification for our approach, more clearly in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, in my attempt to answer the above questions myself, I have read and re-read the description of the connectivity approach, and yet I have not been able to make sense of it. I doubt this is my own lack of knowledge or intelligence, but even if that were the case it is likely that many (perhaps most) readers would have the same issue. Therefore, I recommend rewriting the &quot;Connectivity Models&quot; section (within &quot;Methods&quot;) to include more details. Some specific details that would be helpful to include:</p><p>– The meaning of &quot;fitted time series&quot; is ambiguous. Does this mean the original time series multiplied by the fit β estimate for each condition, resulting in the original time series modulated by the fit to the task regressor for each condition? Or does this mean the regressor time series multiplied by the fit β estimate for each condition? If it is the first option I can imagine interpreting the resulting functional connectivity estimates in a fairly similar way to standard task-related functional connectivity. However, if it is the second option, then I think the interpretation would be quite different from standard task-related functional connectivity. In such a case I think much more details on how to interpret the resulting connectivity values would be warranted. Of course, it could be a third option I haven't considered, in which case it would be helpful to have that option detailed.</p><p>– It is unclear what this detail means (pg. 24): &quot;This procedure reweighted the activity estimates in an optimal manner, accounting for the fact that estimates for the instructions were based on 5 s of fMRI data, while estimates for the conditions were based on 10-30 s of data.&quot; In what sense is this accounting for the duration of task conditions? This makes me wonder whether the connectivity estimates were based on using cortical β estimates (rather than time series) to predict cerebellar β estimates (rather than time series), which could account for condition duration quite well. But the description is ambiguous with respect to these kind of details, and this possibility doesn't seem to fit well with earlier descriptions of the method.</p></disp-quote><p>Your second interpretation is correct.

For example, when we compute the inner product between the data for a cortical (x) and a cerebellar voxel, we have:</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:msup><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></p><p>If we had used only the average activity estimates (b), we would have:<inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></p><p>Comparing these two equations shows that the procedure simply reweights the activity estimates by Z<sup>T</sup>Z. The diagonal of this matrix contains the squared length of the support of the regressor (i.e. it accounts for the fact that estimates for the instructions were based on 5 s of fMRI data, while estimates for the conditions were based on 10-30 s of data).</p><p>The off-diagonal of Z<sup>T</sup>Z contains the covariance between the regressors. For example, due to the overlap of the instruction period and the following condition, these two regressors are positively correlated. Consequently, the activity estimates for the instruction and following condition are negatively correlated, a problem that arises especially in event-related designs (Mumford et al., 2012). This estimation uncertainty, however, is fully cancelled out when multiplying these estimates with the design matrix again.</p><p>Overall, this is a very minor and technical point, and we fear that it would confuse the reader rather than clarify our approach. We have therefore chosen to remove this point from the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The details regarding the &quot;crossed&quot; approach need to be fleshed out. It is stated (pg. 25): &quot;we used a &quot;crossed&quot; approach to train the models: The cerebellar fitted time series for the first session was predicted by the cortical time series from the second session, and vice-versa&quot;. This procedure is also presented in an ambiguous manner in Figure 1. Right now it is stated in the manuscript that the session 2 cortical time series are used to predict the session 1 cerebellar time series, and yet it is unclear how that would be possible when there are different task conditions across the sessions. Is the connectivity model built using both cortical and cerebellar time series during session 2 (betas from cortex predicting cerebellum), then both cortical and cerebellar time series are used from session 1 to test the session 2 connectivity model (session 2 betas multiplied by session 1 cortical time series to predict session 1 cerebellar time series)? Put more simply: is it the case that the session 2 connectivity model is tested using session 1 data, and that the session 1 connectivity model is tested using session 2 data? If so, the description should change to better describe this. In any case, the description should be clarified with more details.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added more detail explaining the “crossed approach” (see <italic>Connectivity Models</italic>). We have also made it clear throughout the document that there are two sessions (same tasks, separate days) for each task set: the same tasks are performed across sessions, with the order of the tasks randomized across sessions (this is true for both task sets). However, using the averaged activity estimates for each session, and the task-related regressors from the other session, we can predict the time series we should have observed if the task activated the brain in the same way across sessions. Therefore, it is possible to predict the cerebellar time series from one session using the cortical time series based on the activity estimates from another session.</p></body></sub-article></article>
