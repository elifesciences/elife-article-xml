phosphatidylserine on the cell surface, catalyzed by lipid scramblases, is an important signal for the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages. The protein XKR9 is a member of a conserved family that has been associated with apoptotic lipid scrambling. Here, we describe structures of full-length and caspase-treated XKR9 from <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> in complex with a synthetic nanobody determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The 43 kDa monomeric membrane protein can be divided into two structurally related repeats, each containing four membrane-spanning segments and a helix that is partly inserted into the lipid bilayer. In the full-length protein, the C-terminus interacts with a hydrophobic pocket located at the intracellular side acting as an inhibitor of protein function. Cleavage by caspase-3 at a specific site releases 16 residues of the C-terminus, thus making the pocket accessible to the cytoplasm. Collectively, the work has revealed the unknown architecture of the XKR family and has provided initial insight into its activation by caspases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-electron microscpy</kwd><kwd>lipid scramblase</kwd><kwd>synthetic nanobody</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FP7 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>339116, AnoBest</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dutzler</surname><given-names>Raimund</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006447</institution-id><institution>University of Zurich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FK-20-040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Straub</surname><given-names>Monique S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cryo-EM structures of XKR9 define the architecture and caspase-mediated activation of a protein family that is involved in the exposure of phosphatidylserine during apoptosis leading to the engulfment of apoptotic cells by macrophages.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lipid distribution in the two leaflets of the plasma membrane of a eukaryotic cell is asymmetric with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and the anionic lipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphoinositol (PI) located in the inner leaflet and phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM), in the outer leaflet of the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balasubramanian and Schroit, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bevers and Williamson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kobayashi and Menon, 2018</xref>). This asymmetry is established and maintained by ATP-dependent active transport processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leventis and Grinstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sebastian et al., 2012</xref>). Although preserved under resting conditions, the controlled breakdown of the lipid asymmetry changes the properties of the membrane and is exploited in different processes ranging from signal transduction to membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nagata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Whitlock and Hartzell, 2017</xref>). Asymmetry breakdown is catalyzed by lipid channels termed scramblases, which catalyze the bidirectional diffusion of lipids with poor specificity by lowering the barrier for lipid flip-flop between the two leaflets of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nagata et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pomorski and Menon, 2006</xref>). The resulting equilibration causes the exposure of negatively charged PS to the outside, which serves as a receptor for proteins that initiate specific signaling cascades. In case of apoptosis, PS exposure serves as an eat-me signal for macrophages, leading to the engulfment and clearance of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Segawa and Nagata, 2015</xref>). To prevent endogenous activity, which would be deleterious to cells, scramblases residing at the plasma membrane are tightly regulated. While incapable of catalyzing lipid transport under resting conditions, they become activated by specific stimuli, which lead to conformational rearrangements of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nagata et al., 2020</xref>). Active scramblases are believed to function by a âcredit card-like mechanismâ, by offering suitable pathways for lipid headgroups to cross the hydrophobic membrane core, whereas their apolar tails reside in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pomorski and Menon, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Lipid scrambling is catalyzed by different proteins with the currently best characterized examples belonging to the TMEM16 and XKR families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>). TMEM16 scramblases are activated in response to the increase of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Their mechanism of activation and lipid transport are best understood for the two fungal homologs nhTMEM16 and afTMEM16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falzone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalienkova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalienkova et al., 2021</xref>). These proteins contain polar membrane-spanning furrows of appropriate size, which are blocked in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> but become exposed to the membrane upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to offer suitable pathways for polar headgroups across the membrane, as predicted by the âcredit card mechanismâ. The fungal TMEM16 proteins were also found to disturb the organization of lipids in their vicinity, likely by destabilizing the bilayer and thus further decreasing the barrier for lipid flip-flop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falzone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalienkova et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although scramblases of the TMEM16 family have been associated with diverse processes such as blood coagulation and cell-fusion, they are not the long sought-after proteins that are responsible for the exposure of PS during apoptosis. The molecular identity of an apoptotic scramblase was first identified in 2013 when the human protein XKR8 and its <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> homolog Ced-8 were assigned as the scramblases that are responsible for PS exposure in apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>). Both are part of the evolutionarily conserved XKR family of proteins related to the founding member XK1, a molecule with unknown function, which was identified to be associated with the blood-group-specific factor Kell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calenda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stanfield and Horvitz, 2000</xref>). In humans, the family contains nine members, of whichÂ three, namely the proteins XKR4, 8, and 9, were found to activate scrambling under apoptotic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>). The primary activating step is the cleavage of a C-terminal peptide by the apoptotic peptidase caspase-3 at a specific site that is found in all three proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>). Besides the irreversible action of caspases, XKR8 was also shown to be activated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sakuragi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Another study has revealed the association of XKR8 with accessory proteins such as basigin or its paralog neuroplastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>). Both type I membraneproteins, containing extracellular IG-domains, facilitate the targeting of XKR8 to the plasma membrane. Based on the altered migration behavior on blue-native gel electrophoresis, the same study also claimed a dimerization of XKR8-basigin complexes upon caspase-3 activation as an essential step underlying activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>). A similar dimerization was recently postulated for XKR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maruoka et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Whereas the central role of certain XKR proteins in apoptotic scrambling and their activation by caspase-3 has been conclusively demonstrated, their molecular architecture and the question whether or how the proteins on their own would catalyze lipid transport has remained elusive. To address these questions, we have here studied the protein XKR9 from <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> and determined its structure in its full-length and caspase-cleaved form by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our results reveal the novel architecture of a eukaryotic membrane protein family involved in apoptotic scrambling and provide insight into their activation by caspases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Biochemical characterization of XKR9</title><p>In our study, we have selected the XKR9 ortholog from <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> (rXKR9) due to its promising biochemical properties. The protein is 373 amino acids long and shares 76% of identical residues with its human ortholog. Following its expression in suspension culture of HEK293S GnTI<sup>â</sup> cells, purification in the detergent lauryl-maltose-neopentyl-glycol (LMNG), and removal of the N-terminal tag used for affinity purification, we found rXKR9 to elute as monodisperse peak on gel-filtration with an elution volume corresponding to a monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which was subsequently quantified by multi-angle light scattering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The protein contains a predicted caspase cleavage site, which would remove 16 amino acids from the C-terminus resulting in the activation of scrambling in cells. We have investigated protein digestion after incubation with caspase-3 in detergent solution and found complete cleavage of the C-terminus resulting in the predicted reduction of the molecular weight as confirmed by mass spectrometry. As full-length rXKR9, the truncated protein elutes as a monomer and we did not find strong evidence of dimerization in detergent solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which was independently suggested for an XKR8-basigin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>) and for XKR4 upon caspase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maruoka et al., 2021</xref>). To probe whether purified rXKR9 on its own would facilitate lipid scrambling, we have reconstituted the protein into liposomes. Incorporation of the protein was assayed by its re-extraction from harvested proteoliposomes using mild detergents and analysis by size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We subsequently investigated the flipping of lipids between the two leaflets of the bilayer by using an assay that was previously established for the characterization of opsin and scramblases of the TMEM16 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunner and Schenck, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Falzone and Accardi, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ploier and Menon, 2016</xref>). The applied assay investigates the quenching of a fluorescent NBD group attached to one of the tails of a lipid that was added to the liposomes as minor component. The reduction of fluorescence proceeded by addition of the membrane-impermeable reagent dithionite to the outside, which bleaches NBD-containing lipids located on the outer leaflet of the bilayer. In our assays, we investigated the scrambling activity in proteoliposomes containing either full-length rXKR9, a caspase-3-treated form of the protein where the C-terminus was cleaved-off before reconstitution, or proteoliposomes of full-length rXKR9 where the accessible C-terminus of proteins in inside-out orientation was removed upon addition of caspase-3 to the medium. In latter case, reducing conditions were required for the protease to be active, which was achieved by supplementation of the buffer with 1 mM of TCEP, which did neither reduce the labeled lipids nor interfere with liposome integrity. Whereas in both cases, cleavage was detected on SDSâPAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the assay used to investigate the integrity of the reconstituted protein indicated that removal of the C-terminus might have compromised the stability of rXKR9, which is particularly pronounced for protein that was incubated with caspase-3 prior to reconstitution. After re-extraction of the digested protein from proteoliposomes, we found for cleaved protein a decreasing peak height at elution volumes corresponding to monomers and pronounced peaks eluting at the void volume of the column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). In our liposome-based assays, we did not find strong evidence of scrambling activity irrespective of the cleavage of the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), thus suggesting that the protein does not promote lipid scrambling under the applied conditions, which might be the consequence of the lack of an essential factor required for the protein to be active.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Biochemical and functional properties of rXKR9.</title><p>Size-exclusion chromatogram of full-length (<bold>A</bold>) and caspase-treated (<bold>B</bold>) rXKR9.

We thus engaged in biochemical studies investigating the co-expression of either protein with their corresponding species-specific basigin orthologs. Whereas in case of hXKR8, we find robust complex formation with basigin, which is also manifested in a low-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>) and in a recently determined structure of the complex at high resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakuragi et al., 2021</xref>), we do not find evidence for the formation of a similar complex with rXKR9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), thus refuting the assumption that basigin might be an essential interaction partner of the protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Structure determination of XKR9-sybody complexes</title><p>Although rXKR9 did not show any scrambling activity in vitro, its high similarity to hXKR8 (with both proteins sharing 29% of identical and 53% of homologous residues) and its susceptibility to caspase-3 makes it an attractive target to elucidate the unknown architecture of the XKR family and the molecular consequences of its proteolytic activation. As a monomeric protein containing 373 residues only, rXKR9 is on the small side for structural studies by cryo-EM and we thus attempted to increase its size by forming complexes with suitable binding proteins. To this end, we engaged in the selection of nanobodies from synthetic libraries (termed sybodies) targeting purified rXKR9 by a combination of ribosome- and phage-display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zimmermann et al., 2020</xref>). Our attempts allowed us to identify several sybodies. From the selected set of binders, we chose the sybody Sb1<sup>XKR9</sup> to generate complexes with full-length and cleaved rXKR9 due to its ability to form stable and monodisperse heterodimeric 1:1 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Following sample preparation, we collected large cryo-EM datasets of both complexes. The resulting maps, which extend to 3.66 Ã for full-length and 4.3 Ã for the cleaved protein, were of high quality and allowed in each case the interpretation with an atomic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The structure was initially built into the map of the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Although, due toÂ the novelty of the protein fold, model building was challenging, the high quality of the map and the distribution of sidechain density of different volume have ultimately allowed the unambiguous interpretation of residues 1â66, 81â105, 119â344, and 365â373 of rXKR9 encompassing all structured parts of the protein. In case of Sb1<sup>XKR9</sup>, the density of the CDR regions in contact with the protein is well-resolved and reveals the interaction with its epitope, whereas the more peripheral residues are of lower resolution and were thus interpreted with a model that is based on a high-resolution structure of the constant region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4B, D</xref>). The structure of the cleaved rXKR9-Sb1<sup>XKR9</sup> complex was subsequently built using the full-length complex as template, which was comparably straightforward, since the bulk of the protein retained a similar conformation, and the density that was ascribed to the C-terminus in the data of the full-length protein was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM maps of rXKR9-Sb1<sup>XKR9</sup> complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cryo-EM density of complexes of the full-length construct at 3.66 Ã (contoured at 9.5 Ï) and (<bold>B</bold>), the caspase-treated protein at 4.3 Ã (contoured at 8.8 Ï).

Although the transmembrane helices of rXKR9 contain several polar and charged residues, which have precluded the assignment of TM3 as membrane-spanning region during hydropathy analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), the observed protein conformation buries these residues between the tightly packed transmembrane segments. Due to the long-range nature of coulombic interactions and the low dielectrics of the bilayer, these residues might still influence the electrostatics on the surface of the close-by cavities C1 and C2 and thus their ability to interact with polar compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). A region with high density of acidic residues is positioned between interacting helices of the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). These residues, which are predominantly located on TM1 and 3, are strongly conserved throughout the family and thus appear to be a characteristic feature of XKR proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). Occluded within the core of the N-terminal domain, the vicinity of several acidic residues distantly resembles a divalent cation binding site, although the structure does not provide evidence of bound cations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Conversely, a cluster of polar and basic residues is located at the C-terminal domain and render the electrostatics positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5HâJ</xref>). In contrast to the N-terminal domain, these residues are less conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>) and one buried arginine (Arg 294) appears to interact with the C-terminus of the partly inserted helix IH2, suggesting that it would serve a role in the stabilization of the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>).</p><p>In summary, while the presence of charged residues located within the membrane domain, some of which are strongly conserved, emphasize their importance for protein stability, their role for lipid movement, and the question whether some of them would change their exposure during activation is still unclear.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Caspase cleavage of the C-terminus</title><p>Activation of apoptotic scramblases proceeds after cleavage of a C-terminal peptide by caspase-3 at a specific recognition site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In case of rXKR9, part of the cleavable peptide, which is only 16 residues long, binds to an intracellular site that is located in a pocket at the interface between the two domains formed by residues of TM3-5, 8, IH2 and the connecting loop regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). In the structure of full-length rXKR9, part of the inhibitory peptide is well-defined, whereas the connecting loop harboring the cleavage site appears unstructured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Features in the density suggest the binding of eight residues at the very C-terminus of the protein. These fold into a single turn of an Î±-helix followed by an extended region that form complementary interactions with the protein burying 1698 Ã<sup>2</sup> of the combined molecular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). In our model, the C-terminus fills the binding pocket to either stabilize the protein in its inactive form or, alternatively, shield the residues lining the pocket from other interactions. The binding is predominantly hydrophobic at its core but involves coulombic interactions at the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). An isoleucine (Ile 367), a phenylalanine (Phe 370), and a leucine (Leu 371) of the C-terminus are buried in a hydrophobic pocket of the protein that is lined by aliphatic and aromatic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In the data of the cleaved rXKR9, the density of the C-terminus is absent, exposing the hydrophobic cleft to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Apart from smaller changes in the intracellular loop regions, the truncated protein has not changed its conformation, which is illustrated in the low RMSD of 0.72 Ã between the two structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, at this stage we do not want to exclude the possibility of larger conformational changes during activation as the observed conformation might be either be stabilized by the bound sybody or the absence of an endogenous factor that has also prohibited lipid scrambling in reconstituted samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Binding site of the C-terminus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Binding of the C-terminus of rXKR9 to a cleft of the protein. rXKR9 excluding its C-terminus is shown asÂ surface representation andÂ coloredÂ as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>.

With a size of only 43 kDa and not containing pronounced structural features outside of the membrane, rXKR9 on its own is too small for cryo-EM analysis. However, the addition of a sybody increasing the complex size to 60 kDa was sufficient to obtain high-quality data and thus could provide a suitable general strategy for the structure determination of small and asymmetric membrane proteins. The rXKR9 structures show a novel protein fold, consisting of two structurally related repeats of four transmembrane helices each, that is presumably shared by the entire family irrespective of the function of its members, which is in many cases still elusive.</p><p>Three members of the XKR family, namely the proteins XKR8, 9, and 4, were previously identified as essential constituents of apoptotic lipid scramblases, which are activated by proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>). Caspases directly act on the protein by targeting a single cleavage site located after the last transmembrane helix TM8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Our structures illustrate the consequence of this cleavage where the C-terminus, which binds to a hydrophobic pocket facing the cytoplasm in the full-length protein, is released to free the access to this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The 16-residue-long peptide thus acts as inhibitor of protein function, whose dissociation from its binding site is a requirement for activation. This could proceedÂ either by lowering its local concentration following proteolysis or by covalent modifications of the peptide as recently suggested for XKR8, which is also activated by phosphorylation of specific positions of the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sakuragi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although in our structure of the cleaved rXKR9, we do not observe any larger rearrangements of the protein as a consequence of proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), such conformational changes could be prevented by the bound sybody or the lack of accessory factors, which might lock the protein in its observed conformation. Although previous experimental data suggested that XKR proteins themselves form the catalytic unit promoting scrambling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>), our attempts to observe such activity for rXKR9 in vitro after purification and reconstitution into liposomes did not provide evidence for lipid flip-flop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This does not exclude that rXKR9 would itself act as a scramblase, but it suggests that there might be additional components required for its activity. In case of its paralog XKR8, this could be the interaction with the Î²-subunit basigin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>) and the proposed dimerization of the complex upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>). Pairing in response to caspase cleavage was recently also reported for the protein XKR4, which additionally requires the binding of an endogenous peptide for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maruoka et al., 2021</xref>). For rXKR9, we did neither observe an interaction with basigin, nor did we find any indication for the change of the oligomeric state following caspase cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>), leaving the possibility that the protein might require an unknown subunit for activation and lipid transport.</p><p>Previous studies on fungal homologs of the TMEM16 family have defined features that underlie their function as lipid scramblases. These include a protein architecture that distorts the membrane and the presence of a hydrophilic membrane-spanning furrow that is hidden in the closed conformation and that becomes exposed in the activated conformation of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falzone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalienkova et al., 2019</xref>). Both factors appear sufficient to lower the energetic barrier for lipid flip-flop, which might proceed in the immediate vicinity of the polar furrow and even at some distance from the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malvezzi et al., 2018</xref>). No such obvious features for scramblase function were found in the rXKR9 structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A,C</xref>). The micelle surrounding the protein does not show clear evidence for distortion, which in fungal TMEM16 scramblases was already manifested in structures determined in detergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalienkova et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, appropriate cavities located at the surface of the protein, which contain residual densities of bound lipids, are generally hydrophobic and thus do no offer obvious interactions with the lipid headgroups on their way across the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5AâD</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). Polar amino acids on the surface of rXKR9 are generally found in the headgroup region, including a cluster of positively charged residues located at the intracellular side of one cavity, which might facilitate the interaction with negatively charged lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplements 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2C</xref>). A remarkable feature of rXKR9 concerns a cluster of acidic residues buried in the protein, which is strongly conserved within family members that were assigned as lipid scramblases, with TM3 being unusually hydrophilic for a transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5EâG</xref>). The role of these residues for protein function is currently unknown, and it is conceivable that they might contribute to lipid scrambling in an active state of the protein, which is likely not displayed in any of our structures. Due to the low dielectric environment of the membrane, charged residues might influence the interaction with polar lipid headgroups even in case they would remain buried after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In light of the lack of structural evidence for its scramblase function, it is noteworthy that opsins were demonstrated to function as lipid scramblases without containing obvious structural features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Menon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morra et al., 2018</xref>) and that the hallmarks described for the fungal scramblases nhTMEM16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>), afTMEM16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falzone et al., 2019</xref>), or TMEM16K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bushell et al., 2019</xref>) are not displayed in any of the current structures of TMEM16F, whose function as lipid scramblase has been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvadia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our study has defined the architecture of a protein that forms a critical part of the machinery leading to the exposure of PS during programmed cell death, which is an essential step leading to the clearance of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Segawa and Nagata, 2015</xref>). By defining the interaction of the C-terminus, which is removed upon proteolysis, it has also provided initial insight into the activation of family members by caspases. However, as we did not observe activity of rXKR9 upon reconstitution and its structures do not provide immediate evidence for a potential scrambling mechanism, we envisage different scenarios for activation and lipid transport. These could either include a conformational change that would expose polar patches that are buried in the inactive protein to facilitate lipid flip-flop, dimerization of the protein as suggested for XKR8 and XKR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maruoka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>), or binding of an extrinsic interaction partner that might contribute part or all of the site responsible for lipid flip-flop. These mechanisms could also work in concert to promote the activation of an apoptotic scramblase. Collectively, our work provides a foundation for future experiments that will have to clarify whether and how the members of this important protein family catalyze lipid translocation between membrane leaflets and identify interaction partners that may play a critical role in their function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Caspase-3-cleaved protein (MW 41.6 kDa) was analyzed by ESI-MS by the Functional Genomics Center ZurichÂ (FGCZ) of the UZH to confirm successful cleavage. Briefly, protein was precipitated in a 30% aqueous solution of TCA.

This solution was further diluted with MeOH:2PrOH:0.2%FA (30:20:50), infused through a fused silica capillary, and sprayed through a PicoTip. The spray voltage was set to 3 kV, the cone voltage was set to 50 V, and the source temperature wasÂ setÂ to 80Â°C. Nano-ESI-MS analysis was performed on a Synapt G2_Si mass spectrometer, and the data was recorded with MassLynx 4.2. Mass spectra were acquired in the positive-ion mode by scanning the m/z range from 400 to 5000 Da with a scan duration of 1 s and an interscan delay of 0.1 s.

The lipids were prepared as described above.</p><p>On the day of purification, solubilized lipids were thawed at room temperature and diluted to 4 mg/ml in liposome buffer. Purified full-length or caspase-3-cleaved rXKR9 was added to lipids at a lipid to protein ratio of 100:1 (wt/wt, resulting in a molar ratio of 6000 lipid molecules per protein) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min under gentle agitation. For empty liposome controls, an equal amount of SEC buffer was added to the lipids instead of protein. For detergent removal and formation of proteoliposomes, SM-II bio-beads (20 mg per 1 mg lipids) were added to the lipidâprotein mix. After 30 min of incubation under constant agitation at room temperature, another batch of bio-beads was added and the mix was transferred to 4Â°C. After 1 hr, the third fraction of bio-beads was added and the reconstitution mix was incubated at 4Â°C overnight while constantly agitating. The next morning, a final batch of bio-beads was added and incubated for 4 hr at 4Â°C. Proteoliposomes were transferred to room temperature and filtered through gravity-flow columns to remove the bio-beads. To harvest the proteoliposomes, samples were centrifuged at 170,000 g for 30 min at 22Â°C. Pelleted proteoliposomes were re-suspended in liposome buffer to 10 mg/ml and either flash-frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored at â80Â°C or incubated with caspase-3 and 1 mM TCEP at room temperature overnight. After caspase-3 treatment, the proteoliposomes were flash-frozen and stored at â80Â°C. All steps were carried out in the dark to prevent bleaching of NBD fluorophores.</p><p>The scrambling measurements were essentially performed as described for TMEM16 scramblases without the addition of calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvadia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalienkova et al., 2019</xref>). On the day of measurement, the proteoliposomes were thawed at room temperature, subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles and extruded 21 times through a 200 nm polycarbonate membrane, using an Avanti MiniExtruder. Extruded proteoliposomes were diluted in 80 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 2 mM EGTA to 0.2 mg/ml, and initial fluorescence was recorded using a Spectrofluorometer (Ex.: 470 nm, Em.: 530 nm). After 60 s, 30 mM sodium dithionite was added and the measurement was continued for 360 s. The fluorescent decay was plotted as F/F<sub>max</sub>. Reconstitution efficiency was examined by re-extraction of the protein with 1% DDM for 1 hr on ice. Extracted protein was injected onto a Superdex 200 Increase 5/150 GL column, equilibrated in SEC buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Characterization of mTMEM16F</title><p>mTMEM16F wasÂ expressed, purified, and reconstituted into liposomes as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvadia et al., 2019</xref>. Briefly, mTMEM16F containing a C-terminal 3C cleavage site, myc and SBP tags, was expressed in stably transfected mTMEM16F HEK293T cells by tetracycline induction (2 Î¼g/ml) for 48 hr. Harvested cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pHÂ 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 2% digitonin, and protease inhibitors), extracted for 2 hr, and centrifuged at 85,000 g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated for 2 hr at 4Â°C with streptavidin UltraLink resin (1 ml beads per 20 ml cell pellet). The resin was washed with 60 CV SEC buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 0.1% digitonin). Protein was eluted with 3 CV of SEC buffer, supplemented with 4 mM biotin, concentrated using 100 kDa cut-off concentrator, filtered through a 0.22 Î¼m filter, and injected onto a Superose 6 10/300 GL column, pre-equilibrated in SEC buffer. Peak fractions were collected, concentrated, and used for liposome reconstitution. mTMEM16F was reconstituted into liposomes composed of 79.5% soybean polar lipid extracts, 20% (mol/mol) cholesterol, and 0.5% (wt/wt) 18:1-06:0 NBD-PE, at a 1:100 protein-to-lipid ratio (wt/wt). Harvested liposomes were re-suspended in liposome buffer, supplemented with the correct amount of Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> to obtain the desired concentrations of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> as calculated with the online WEBMAXC calculator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bers et al., 2010</xref>). After thawing and extrusion through a 400 nm membrane, the proteoliposomes were diluted in 80 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 2 mM EGTA, plus Ca<sup>2+</sup>, aiming for symmetric buffer conditions. NBD fluorescence was recorded as described for rXKR9.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>XKR8/9-basigin co-purification</title><p>To investigate the protein-protein interaction of rXKR9 and rat basigin, rXKR9 in pcDxNSM3 and rat basigin in pcDxC3GM were co-expressed and -purified. hXKR8 and human basigin in the same vectors were used as a positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>). For transfection of adherent HEK293T cells, the respective XKR and basigin DNA was mixed at a 1:2 ratio and then incubated with PEI MAX 40 kDa in a 1:2.5 ratio. The DNA sample diluted in non-supplemented DMEM was incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then added to HEK293T cells. Immediately after addition of the transfection mix, 3.5 mM valproic acid was added. Cells were incubated at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were harvested, washed in PBS, flash-frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>, and pellets stored at â80Â°C.</p><p>XKR-basigin complexes were essentially purified as described in the protein purification section. HRV 3C cleavage was not performed to keep the fluorescent tag. In-gel fluorescence was monitored with a Viber Fusion FX7 imaging system (Ex.: 515 nm, Em.: 530 nm). Silver staining was performed according to manufacturerâs instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Protein biotinylation</title><p>For sybody selection and ELISA, purified rXKR9 was chemically biotinylated using EZ-link NHS-PEG4-biotin. rXKR9 was concentrated to 2 mg/ml and incubated with a 10 times molar excess of EZ-link NHS-PEG4-biotin for 1 hr on ice. The amine-reactive reaction was quenched upon addition of 5 mM TrisâHCl pH 7.5. Excess biotin was separated from biotinylated protein on a PD-10 desalting column. Eluted protein was concentrated to 1.3 mg/ml, mixed with glycerol to a final concentration of 10%, aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>, and stored at â80Â°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Sybody selection and ELISA</title><p>The sybody selection was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zimmermann et al., 2020</xref>). The synthetic mRNA libraries, termed concave (CC), loop (LP), and convex (CX), and vectors required for selections were generously provided by Prof. Markus Seeger, Institute of Medical Microbiology, UZH. Selection and ELISA were performed in described buffers with the addition of LMNG where indicated. Briefly, one round of ribosome display was performed using the three different mRNA libraries, each encoding for 10<sup>12</sup> different binders. The output library of ribosome display was cloned into a phagemid vector, which was used for two successive rounds of phage display. During the second round of phage display, an off-rate selection was performed to remove binders with a high off-rate. Eluted phages were quantified by qPCR, which allowed estimation of the enrichment. Enrichment was calculated based on the ratio of eluted phages from rXKR9 divided by the elution from the negative control (biotinylated TM287/288), which was purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hutter et al., 2019</xref>). Enrichment factors after the second round of phage display were 1.7, 8.3, and 1.1 for CC, LP, and CX libraries. Despite the low enrichment factors, the libraries were subcloned by FX-cloning into pSb_init and expressed in 96-well plates. The periplasmic extract was subjected to ELISA in a 384-well format, using 50 Î¼l of biotinylated rXKR9 or TM287/288 (50 nM/well). ELISA hits were analyzed by Sanger sequencing (Microsynth). Of 64 hits, 21 clones were further characterized for expression and biochemical behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection</title><p>For the uncleaved cryo-EM sample, rXKR9 was purified as described above, except that purified sybody Sb1<sup>XKR9</sup> was added to rXKR9 prior to injecting onto the Superdex 200 10/300 GL column at 1.5 times molar excess. The SEC-purified complex was concentrated using a 50 kDa cut-off concentrator to 1.5 mg/ml and applied to glow-discharged (0.39 mbar, 15 mA, 30 s) holey carbon grids (QuantiFoil R1.2/1.3 Au 200 mesh). Excess sample was removed by blotting for 2â4 s with zero blotting force in a controlled environment (4Â°C, 100% relative humidity) using a Vitrobot Mark IV. The sample was plunge-frozen in a liquid ethane-propane mix and stored in liquid N<sub>2</sub> for data collection.</p><p>For the cleaved cryo-EM sample, rXKR9 was purified as described above. After SEC, the protein was concentrated to 0.87 mg/ml and incubated with 24 units of caspase-3 and 10 mM DTT overnight on ice. The next-day, purified sybody Sb1<sup>XKR9</sup> was added at a 1.5 times molar excess, and complexes were subjected to SEC on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column pre-equilibrated in SEC buffer. The cleaved complex was concentrated to 1.5 mg/ml and plunge-frozen the same way as the uncleaved sample.</p><p>The hXKR8-hBSG complex was purified as described above. The complex was concentrated to 2 mg/ml and plunge-frozen the same way as the rXKR9 samples. All rXKR9 samples were imaged on a Titan Krios G3i, operated at 300 kV, with a 100 Î¼m objective aperture. All data were recorded using a post-column BioQuantum energy filter with a 20 eV slit and a K3 direct electron detector in super-resolution mode. Dose-fractionated micrographs were recorded with a defocus range of â1 Î¼m to â2.4 Î¼m in an automated mode using EPU 2.9. The datasets were acquired at a nominal magnification of 130,000Ã, corresponding to a pixel size of 0.651 Ã per pixel (0.3255 Ã per pixel in super-resolution mode), with 1.01 s exposure (36 frames) and a dose of 1.94 and 1.93 e<sup>â</sup>/Ã<sup>2</sup>/frame for the datasets of uncleaved and cleaved protein, respectively.

For the dataset of uncleaved protein, 12,396 micrographs were collected and subjected to patch motion correction and patch CTF estimation. Micrographs were Fourier-cropped once during motion correction, resulting in a pixel size of 0.651 Ã per pixel. Low-quality micrographs were discarded based on the estimated resolution of CTF fits, relative ice thickness, and total full-frame motion, resulting in 9,823 good micrographs used for further analysis. A small subset of micrographs was used for particle picking, using a blob with 50 Ãâ120 Ã diameter. Particles were extracted with a box size of 360 pixels and Fourier-cropped to 180 pixels (1.302 Ã per pixel). From two rounds of 2D classification with marginalization over poses and shifts and a circular 150 Ã mask, 2D class averages showing protein features were used as templates for automated template-based picking from all high-quality micrographs. Particles were extracted as described above. After two rounds of 2D classification, 2,171,713 particles were subjected to an ab initio reconstruction with five classes, no similarity, C1 symmetry, and initial alignment resolution of 12 Ã. 1,852,344 particles, from classes with protein features, were directed into a second ab initio reconstruction with three classes, no similarity, C1 symmetry, and 7 Ã initial resolution. The best-resolved class, together with the worst-resolved class from the first ab initio reconstruction, were used as references for three rounds of heterogeneous refinement, together with the particle set selected from the first round of ab initio reconstruction. After heterogeneous refinement, where the initial resolution of the input volumes was set to 7 Ã, 866,439 particles of high quality were initially used in a non-uniform (NU) refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Punjani et al., 2020</xref>) and afterwards locally CTF refined.

This procedure resulted in 12,135 of high-quality micrographs, that were used for template-based picking using templates created from the 3.66 Ã map from the dataset of uncleaved protein. Particles were extracted as described previously. After two rounds of 2D classification, 834,105 and 496,296 particles were used for a first and second ab initio reconstruction with the same parameters as for the dataset of uncleaved protein. All particles used for the second round of ab initio reconstruction were subjected to five rounds of heterogeneous refinement, using the same parameters as described above. The best-resolved class from the second ab initio reconstruction and a decoy class, generated from deselected particles from 2D classifications, were used as input volumes.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper reports the atomic structure of XKR9, a membrane protein that is implicated in initiating the process to get rid of cells that are undergoing programmed cell death (apoptosis). The protein of interest was originally proposed to be a lipid channel, but the work presented here suggests that it is unlikely to function in this capacity alone. Still, the structural work presented is significant, and altogether this study represents an important step forward in this nascent field.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cryo-EM structures of the Caspase activated protein XKR9 involved in apoptotic lipid scrambling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Anant K Menon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>There was general enthusiasm for this paper, with the work regarded as being of high quality, and a significant structural advance in a nascent field. We have the following requests for revisions.</p><p>1) Please remove the summary Figure 7 and limit the speculative narrative about molecular mechanism of XKR9 in the Results and Discussion sections. Subsection titles should be modified to provide an objective interpretation of the results. For example, &quot;Features of potential functional relevance&quot; could be changed to something like &quot;Analysis of putative lipid pathways&quot;. Similarly &quot;Activation&quot; can be changed to something like &quot;Caspase cleavage of the C-terminus&quot;, which provides a more direct presentation of the experiment conducted. With this, the paper can focus on the novelty of the structures obtained, discussing the new architecture and evidence of lipids in the protein in XKR9.</p><p>2) All three reviewers made the following comment: In Figure 1, no activity can be detected from full-length or cleaved XKR9 reconstituted into proteoliposomes. As controls, scramblase experiments were performed with proteoliposomes containing TMEM16F in the presence or absence of ca<sup>2+</sup>. While this is a reasonable control, a low-resolution structure of XKR8 in complex with its accessory protein basigin is presented in the same figure demonstrating that it is biochemically stable. Thus, it would be helpful to perform the scramblase assay with XKR8/basigin, which is hypothesized to be a fully functioning member of the same family. This would provide evidence that the assay, which is well-established for TMEM16 family members, is also suitable for detecting activity by XKR scramblases in vitro. While the observation of function in XKR8/basigin would represent a significant advance, it is not required for publication. Still, carrying out this experiment, and discussion of these efforts would help to smooth the somewhat awkward transition between the presentation of these two proteins in the current manuscript.</p><p>3) Please respond to the comments in the recommendations to authors sections below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The lack of functional activity is a key question here, and it is understandable that the reconstituted system may not contain the required components. However, since PS is the main lipid that gets scrambled in cells, have you examined higher PS lipid compositions other than the small amount of labelled PS that you have currently? Alternatively, have you tested the function of membrane vesicles to confirm that the protein is functional when expressed?</p><p>2. Page 7, line 138: It is concluded that basigin is not the required component for scrambling because it does not form a complex with XKR9 in your experiments, and thus does not confer scrambling. However, it seems possible that it could form a complex under different conditions. It is also possible that XKR9 is the component that is not in a proper state to form a complex with basigin, especially considering that XKR9 is not functions. Many different options still seem possible and so this conclusion is not well supported.</p><p>3. In the SDS-PAGE images, the shift in the caspase-3 treated bands is not clear. Assuming that you are trying to show that caspase-3 successfully cleaved this fragment, these results should be optimized on a different acrylamide gel to show that the shift is clearly discernable.</p><p>4. Figure 1D â &quot;Data show mean and standard deviations of three technical replicates.&quot; This panel appears to contain the raw traces of the fluorescent quenching, not the mean {plus minus} st.dev. of the traces. Is this correct?</p><p>5. Please report the molecular weights of the different protein species in the methods.</p><p>6. Please report the lipid reconstitution conditions in mole fraction units (i.e. 1 monomer per 10000 lipids) in addition to the 1:100 wt/wt ratio.</p><p>7. Page 6, line 117: Please clarify about the inside-out liposomes, was this just by random orientation or were inside-out liposomes purified directly?</p><p>8. There were several typos found in the document. Please read through and correct others:</p><p>Typo on page 6, line 95: &quot;multi angle&quot; should be &quot;multi-angle&quot;</p><p>Typo on page 17, line 346: &quot;â¦ its structure structures do not provideâ¦&quot;</p><p>Typo on page 24, line 473: &quot;TMEM16scramblases&quot;</p><p>9. As a reminder, the PDBs will need to be deposited and listed in the Accession code section of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Density attributed to a phospholipid is present in both structures. Despite its potential importance to the protein's functional role, there is little mention of the interactions between the lipid and XKR9 in the text and no detailed figure showing the interactions. I would suggest that additional efforts be made in describing the lipid-binding site and its potential role in scramblase activity.</p><p>2. Continuing from point 2, were non-protein densities resolved in the C2 or C3 cavities of either structure?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69800.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>There was general enthusiasm for this paper, with the work regarded as being of high quality, and a significant structural advance in a nascent field.

We and others have previously used the same assay to characterize different lipid scramblases and we thus think that it is generally suitable to detect protein-catalyzed lipid movement between both leaflets of the bilayer. In our experiments, we have included data of TMEM16F as a proper control to illustrate the range of the expected change of the signal between an inactive and an active scramblase. This is particularly important since the basal fluorescence level does to some degree vary upon protein reconstitution, even in case a protein does not itself mediate lipid flip-flop.</p><p>As described in our manuscript, our data has not provided strong evidence for the reconstituted XKR9 to act as a caspase-activated lipid scramblase. Besides XKR9, we have also carried out equivalent experiments for an XKR8-basigin complex and found very similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Although the data from cellular assays, which suggest that XKR proteins themselves form the scrambling units, are strong, this activity could so far not be detected for purified and reconstituted protein in vitro. This leaves the question whether isolated XKR proteins would be sufficient to catalyze lipid movements unanswered. At this stage, we cannot exclude the possibility that the assay in its current form is not suitable to characterize scrambling activity of purified and reconstituted XKR proteins. Since, in contrast to XKR9, the experiments on the XKR8-basigin complex were only performed once and XKR8 is not the main subject of our investigation, we refrain from including the data in the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Lipid scrambling assay of the XKR8-basigin complex.</title><p>(A) Size exclusion chromatogram of proteins extracted from proteoliposomes containing a full-length reconstituted XKR8-basigin complex (uncleaved), the same proteoliposomes treated with caspase-3 added to the surrounding media (assuming that a fraction of the cleavage sites would be accessible from the outside, liposome cleaved) or protein that was incubated with caspase 3 in solution overnight prior to reconstitution (buffer cleaved).

The aim of the experiments related to the co-expression of XKR8 and XKR9 with basigin was to show whether we would be able to detect a basigin interaction with XKR9, which was not the case. In these experiments, XKR8 was used as control to show the validity of the approach. Although the interaction of XKR8 with basigin is now established (see also the recent structure of a XKR8-basign complex by the Nagata and Toyoshima groups deposited in bioRxiv (Sakuragi et al., 2021)), the impact of basigin on XKR8 function remains unclear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please respond to the comments in the recommendations to authors sections below.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The lack of functional activity is a key question here, and it is understandable that the reconstituted system may not contain the required components. However, since PS is the main lipid that gets scrambled in cells, have you examined higher PS lipid compositions other than the small amount of labelled PS that you have currently? Alternatively, have you tested the function of membrane vesicles to confirm that the protein is functional when expressed?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not tested the function of the protein in membrane vesicles. In light of the basal expression of apoptotic scramblases such assays do either require the use of genetic knock-outs or a near quantitative downregulation by siRNA. With respect to the preparation of liposomes, we have experimented with different lipid compositions and found the used soybean-cholesterol mixture to be compatible with proper reconstitution. It should be emphasized that this source would provide a lipid composition that is close to the content of eukaryotic cells. The same lipid composition was used for the reconstitution and characterization of the scramblase TMEM16F, which is fully activatable and shown as control (Figure 1D, Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C). Although not explicitly listed in the manufacturerâs specification, PS is a lipid that is found in soybeans and we thus expect it to be present in our samples beyond the 0.5% of labeled lipids added to our reconstitution. We also want to emphasize that, although the biological response is evoked by the exposure of PS to the outside, scramblases are generally not considered as specific and their transport is usually bidirectional. Although this poor selectivity has not yet been explicitly demonstrated for apoptotic scramblases, it is well established for scramblases of the TMEM16 family.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In our experiments, XKR8 served as a positive control for which we were able to detect complex formation in a straightforward fashion. In contrast, no sign of interaction was found under equivalent conditions for XKR9. We did not want to imply that basigin would itself play a direct role in lipid scrambling in XKR8, which we do not know at this stage. We have clarified this in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the SDS-PAGE images, the shift in the caspase-3 treated bands is not clear.

The displayed gels generally correspond to the samples used for the experiments. The comparison between full-length and cleaved protein in Figure 1B was not essential and we have removed the full-length band to only show the gel fraction used for the SEC-experiment. The gel shown Figure 1C corresponds to protein that was extracted from proteoliposomes used for the scrambling experiments shown in Figure 1D. In this case, the shift between uncleaved and cleaved protein is obvious as also illustrated in the plotted density profile shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>SDS PAGE gel showing mass differences between full-length and caspase-cleaved samples.</title><p>Left, SDS PAGE gel of full-length and caspase-3 treated samples with the integrated lanes numbered and indicated by yellow boxes.
